      <title>Shannon's inequality on non-collapsing RCD spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the Shannon's inequality on non-collapsing $\mathsf{RCD}(0,N)$ spaces. In the proof, we use the characterization of the $\mathsf{EVI}_{0,N}$-gradient flow of the relative entropy and the infinitesimal behavior of the heat kernel. Also we have a cone rigidity result. As an application, we have the so-called uncertainty principle inequality on such spaces.</description>

      <title>Polygonal equalities and $p$-negative type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nontrivial $p$-polygonal equalities impose certain conditions on the geometry of a metric space $(X,d)$ and so it is of interest to be able to identify the values of $p \in [0,\infty)$ for which such equalities exist. Following work of Li and Weston, Kelleher, Miller, Osborn and Weston established that if a metric space $(X,d)$ is of $p$-negative type, then $(X,d)$ admits no nontrivial $p$-polygonal equalities if and only if it is of strict $p$-negative type. In this note we remove the underlying premise of $p$-negative type from this theorem. As an application we show that the set of all $p$ for which a finite metric space $(X,d)$ admits a nontrivial $p$-polygonal equality is always a closed interval of the form $[\wp, \infty)$, where $\wp &gt; 0$, or the empty set. It follows that for each $q \not= 2$, the Schatten $q$-class $\mathcal{C}_{q}$ admits a nontrivial $p$-polygonal equality for each $p &gt; 0$. Other spaces with this same property include $C[0, 1]$ and $\ell_{q}^{(3)}$ for all $q &gt; 2$.</description>

      <title>Beyond trees: the metric geometry of subsets of weighted Hamming cubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Associated to any finite metric space are a large number of objects and quantities which provide some degree of structural or geometric information about the space. In this paper we show that in the setting of subsets of weighted Hamming cubes there are unexpected relationships between many of these quantities. We obtain in particular formulas for the determinant of the distance matrix, the $M$-constant and the cofactor sum for such spaces. This work extends previous results for unweighted metric trees, and more generally, for subsets of standard Hamming cubes, as well as results for weighted metric trees. Finally we consider polygonal equalities in these spaces, giving a complete description of nontrivial $1$-polygonal equalities that can arise in weighted Hamming cubes.</description>

      <title>Log-Lipschitz and H\"older regularity imply smoothness for complex analytic sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove metric analogues, in any dimension and in any co-dimension, of the famous Theorem of Mumford on smoothness of normal surfaces and the beautiful Theorem of Ramanujam that gives a topological characterization of $\mathbb{C}^2$ as an algebraic surface. For instance, we prove that a complex analytic set that is log-Lipschitz regular at 0 (i.e., a complex analytic set that has a neighbourhood of the origin which bi-log-Lipschitz homeomorphic to an Euclidean ball) must be smooth at 0. We prove even more, we prove that if a complex analytic set $X$ such that, for each $0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$, $(X,0)$ and $(\mathbb{R}^k,0)$ are bi-$\alpha$-H\"older homeomorphic, then $X$ must be smooth at 0. These results generalize the Lipschitz Regularity Theorem, which says that a Lipschitz regular complex analytic set must be smooth. Global versions of these results are also presented here and, in particular, we obtain a characterization of an affine linear subspace as a pure-dimensional entire complex analytic set.</description>

      <title>On the Fibonacci tiling and its modern ramifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the last 30 years, the mathematical theory of aperiodic order has developed enormously. Many new tilings and properties have been discovered, few of which are covered or anticipated by the early papers and books. Here, we start from the well-known Fibonacci chain to explain some of them, with pointers to various generalisations as well as to higher-dimensional phenomena and results. This should give some entry points to the modern literature on the subject.</description>

      <title>Forbidden induced subgraphs for graphs and signed graphs with eigenvalues bounded from below</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.10366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.10366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The smallest eigenvalue of a graph is the smallest eigenvalue of its adjacency matrix. We show that the family of graphs with smallest eigenvalue at least $-\lambda$ can be defined by a finite set of forbidden induced subgraphs if and only if $\lambda &lt; \lambda^*$, where $\lambda^* = \rho^{1/2} + \rho^{-1/2} \approx 2.01980$, and $\rho$ is the unique real root of $x^3 = x + 1$. This resolves a question raised by Bussemaker and Neumaier. As a byproduct, we find all the limit points of smallest eigenvalues of graphs, supplementing Hoffman's work on those limit points in $[-2, \infty)$.
  We also prove that the same conclusion about forbidden subgraph characterization holds for signed graphs. Our impetus for the study of signed graphs is to determine the maximum cardinality of a spherical two-distance set with two fixed angles (one acute and one obtuse) in high dimensions. Denote by $N_{\alpha, \beta}(n)$ the maximum number of unit vectors in $\mathbb{R}^d$ where all pairwise inner products lie in $\{\alpha, \beta\}$ with $-1 \le \beta &lt; 0 \le \alpha &lt; 1$. Very recently Jiang, Tidor, Yao, Zhang and Zhao determined the limit of $N_{\alpha, \beta}(d)/d$ as $d\to\infty$ when $\alpha + 2\beta &lt; 0$ or $(1-\alpha)/(\alpha-\beta) \in \{1,\sqrt2,\sqrt3\}$, and they proposed a conjecture on the limit in terms of eigenvalue multiplicities of signed graphs. We establish their conjecture whenever $(1-\alpha)/(\alpha - \beta) &lt; \lambda^*$.</description>

      <title>Green function in metric measure spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.11974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study existence and uniqueness of Green functions for the Cheeger $Q$-Laplacian in metric measure spaces that are Ahlfors $Q$-regular and support a $Q$-Poincar\'e inequality with $Q&gt;1$. We prove uniqueness of Green functions both in the case of relatively compact domains, and in the global (unbounded) case. We also prove existence of global Green functions in unbounded spaces, complementing the existing results in relatively compact domains proved recently in [BBL20].</description>
