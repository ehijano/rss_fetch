      <title>Optical Interference Effect in Strong-field Electronic Coherence Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated strong-field-induced electronic coherences in argon and molecular nitrogen ions created by high-intensity, few-cycle infrared laser pulses. This is a step toward the long-sought goal of strong-field coherent control in molecular chemistry. We employed high-intensity, few-cycle infrared laser pulses in a pump-probe setup to investigate a recent prediction that electronic coherences in nitrogen molecules change the ion yields vs. pump-probe delay. [Yuen and Lin, Phys. Rev. A 109, L011101 (2024)]. The predicted coherence signals in molecular nitrogen could not be resolved above the optical interference of the pump and probe pulses; a simultaneous measurement clearly resolved the induced cation fine-structure coherence in strong-field-ionized argon. The results of our comparison with simulations suggest that optical interference effects manifest differently in each ionic species and must be carefully accounted for when interpreting experimental data. We found that nonsequential double ionization in the low-intensity region of the focal volume can reduce the visibility of coherence generated by two-pulse sequential ionization, and we quantify the importance of pulse shape and spectral characteristics for isolating the desired coherence signals.</description>

      <title>Theory of itinerant collisional spin dynamics in nondegenerate molecular gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the fully itinerant dynamics of ultracold but nondegenerate polar molecules with a spin-$1/2$ degree of freedom encoded into two of their electric field dressed rotational states. Center of mass molecular motion is constrained to two-dimensions via tight confinement with a one-dimensional optical lattice, but remains mostly unconstrained within the plane. The pseudospins can become entangled through ultracold dipolar collisions, for which the locality of interactions is greatly relaxed by free molecular motion. At the level of single-molecule observables, collision-induced entanglement manifests as spin decoherence, for which our theoretical calculations serve well to describe recent Ramsey contrast measurements of quasi-2D confined KRb molecules at JILA [A. Carroll et al., Science 388 6745 (2025)]. In presenting a more detailed theoretical analysis of the KRb experiment, we highlight a key finding that molecular loss enhanced by particle exchange symmetry can lead to a suppression of collective spin decoherence, a mechanism with refer to as ``loss-induced quantum autoselection". We then show that by utilizing bialkali species with sufficiently large dipole moments, loss can be near completely suppressed in all collision channels via electric field tunable confinement-induced collisional shielding. The afforded collisional stability permits fully coherent spin mixing dynamics, natively realizing unitary circuit dynamics with random all-to-all connectivity and U(1) charge conservation. This work establishes a bridge between the domains of ultracold molecular collisions and many-body spin physics, ultimately proposing the use of nondegenerate bulk molecular gases as a controllable platform for nonequilibrium explorations of itinerant quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Raman scattering from metastable states of Ba$^+$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum logic gates performed via two-photon stimulated-Raman transitions in ions and atoms are fundamentally limited by spontaneous scattering errors. Recent theoretical treatment of these scattering processes has predicted no lower bound on the error rate of such gates when implemented with far-detuned lasers, while also providing an extension to metastable qubits. To validate this theoretical model, we provide experimental measurements of Raman scattering rates due to near-, and far-detuned lasers for initial states in the metastable D$_{5/2}$ level of $^{137}$Ba$^+$. The measured spontaneous Raman scattering rate is consistent with the theoretical prediction and suggests that metastable-level two-qubit gates with an error rate $\approx10^{-4}$ are possible with laser excitation detuned by tens of terahertz or more.</description>

      <title>A multimode cavity QED Ising spin glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We realize a driven-dissipative Ising spin glass using cavity QED in a novel ``4/7" multimode geometry. Gases of ultracold atoms trapped within the cavity by optical tweezers serve as effective spins. They are coupled via randomly signed, all-to-all Ising cavity-mediated interactions. Networks of up to n = 25 spins are holographically imaged via cavity emission. The system is driven through a frustrated transverse-field Ising transition, and we show that the entropy of the spin glass states depends on the rate at which the transition is crossed. Despite being intrinsically nonequilibrium, the system exhibits phenomena associated with Parisi's theory of equilibrium spin glasses, namely replica symmetry breaking (RSB) and ultrametric structure. For system sizes up to n = 16, we measure the Parisi function q(x), Edwards-Anderson overlap q_EA, and ultrametricity K-correlator; all indicate a deeply ordered spin glass under RSB. The system can serve as an associative memory and enable aging and rejuvenation studies in driven-dissipative spin glasses at the microscopic level.</description>

      <title>Absolute frequency measurement of a Lu$^+$ $(^{3}\rm D_1)$ optical frequency standard via link to international atomic time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10004v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on an absolute frequency measurement of the ${\rm Lu}^{+}\,(^{3}\rm D_1)$ standard frequency which is defined as the hyperfine-average of $^{1}\rm S_0$ to $^{3}\rm D_1$ optical clock transitions in $^{176}{\rm Lu}^{+}$. The measurement result of $353\,638\,794\,073\,800.35(33)$Hz with a fractional uncertainty of $9.2 \times 10^{-16}$ was obtained by operating a single-ion $^{176}{\rm Lu}^{+}$ frequency standard intermittently over 3 months with a total uptime of 162 hours. Traceability to the International System of Units (SI) is realized by remote link to International Atomic Time. This is the first reported absolute frequency value for a ${\rm Lu}^{+}\,(^{3}\rm D_1)$ optical frequency standard.</description>

      <title>Stability conditions for bound states in antiprotonic atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the stability of bound antiprotons in close proximity to the atomic nucleus. Using experimental data from X-ray spectroscopy measurements of antiprotonic atom transitions, we tune a minimal theoretical framework and estimate parameter ranges where the strong or electromagnetic decay channels govern the stability of the deepest bound states. In this way, we present an overview of the dominant decay mechanism of antiprotonic orbits for a given principle quantum number, to assist future spectroscopic experiments on antiprotonic atoms.</description>

      <title>An effective model for describing coherent population trapping resonances, which correctly takes into account the off-resonant frequency components in periodically modulated laser field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have developed an effective mathematical model to calculate the coherent population trapping (CPT) resonance in periodically modulated light, when the modulation frequency $f$ varies near the fractional part of hyperfine splitting in the ground state $\Delta_{\rm hfs}/N$ (where $N=1,2,...$). In such polychromatic field, only two frequency components that are most resonant with atomic optical transitions are taken into account accurately, while all other off-resonant components are taken into account using the second-order perturbation theory in the field. Within the presented concept, equation for atomic density matrix is obtained, in which the contribution of all off-resonant components is reduced to the appearance of two new operators (non-diagonal, in general case): the shift operator and relaxation operators. In the case of three-level $\Lambda$-system, the adequacy of presented effective model was verified by numerical calculations of various dependencies, in which we did not find visual differences from the exact calculations. In addition to a significant mathematical simplification, our model provides a clear physical picture of various features of CPT spectroscopy in a periodically modulated laser field, including effects that have not been discussed in the scientific literature before. In particular, we show that the widespread viewpoint that the CPT resonance shift is determined by usual ac Stark shifts of the lower levels is, in general, fundamentally incorrect, since the contribution to the light shift due to beats at the frequency $\Delta_{\rm hfs}$ between different off-resonant frequency components can be comparable (or even dominate) with the standard ac Stark shift. Therefore, even if we have detailed information on the modulated field spectrum (e.g. using a spectrum analyzer), this is, in general, absolutely insufficient to determine the light shift of CPT resonance.</description>

      <title>Suppressing the Decoherence of Alkali-Metal Spins at Low Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.12236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interactions of electron spins with rotational degrees of freedom during collisions or with external fields are fundamental processes that limit the coherence time of spin gases. We experimentally study the decoherence of hot cesium spins dominated by spin rotation-interaction during binary collisions with N$_2$ molecules or by absorption of near-resonant light. We report an order of magnitude suppression of the spin decoherence rate by either of those processes at low magnetic fields. This work extends the use of magnetic fields as a control knob, not only to suppress decoherence from random spin-conserving processes in the Spin-Exchange Relaxation Free (SERF) regime but also to suppress processes that relax electron spins rather than conserve them.</description>

      <title>Magnetic-field-independent spin-exchange relaxation-free magnetometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.13086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: SERF magnetometers based on dense ensembles of alkali-metal spins are precision quantum sensors that hold the record of measured and projected sensitivity to magnetic fields, in the $\mu\textrm{G}-\textrm{mG}$ range. At geomagnetic fields however, these sensors quickly lose their magnetic sensitivity due to spin decoherence by random spin-exchange collisions. Here we discover that atoms with nuclear spin $I=1/2$ can operate in the Spin-Exchange Relaxation Free (SERF) regime even at high magnetic field. We counter-intuitively show that frequent collisions between a dense and optically-inaccessible $(I=1/2)$ gas with another optically-accessible spin gas ($I&gt;1/2$) improve the fundamental magnetic sensitivity of the latter. We analyze the performance of a dual-specie potassium and atomic hydrogen magnetometer, and project a fundamental sensitivity of about $10\,\mathrm{aT}\sqrt{\mathrm{cm}^3/\mathrm{Hz}}$ at geomagnetic fields for feasible experimental conditions.</description>
