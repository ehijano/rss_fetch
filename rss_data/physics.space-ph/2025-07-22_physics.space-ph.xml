      <title>A "Faux-Shock" Method for Hybrid Simulations of Astrophysical Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a novel setup for hybrid particle-in-cell simulations designed to isolate the physics of the shock precursor over long time periods for significantly lower computational cost than previous methods. This is achieved using a "faux-shock" or shock-like boundary condition on one edge of our simulation domain such that particles that interact with the boundary either pass through it or are reflected off of it with a change in momentum that mimics scattering in the downstream. We show that our faux-shock setup reproduces the same fluid quantities and phase spaces as traditional shock simulations, including those which could otherwise only be done in 3D, with higher particle resolution and for reduced computational cost. While the method involves an assumed boundary condition, it nonetheless captures the essential physics of interest, establishing it as a reliable and efficient tool for future self-consistent studies of instabilities driven by cosmic rays in a shock upstream medium.</description>

      <title>Low Speed Oblique Impact Behavior On Granular Media Across Gravitational Conditions; The role of cohesion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analyses of impact provide rich insights from the evolution of granular bodies to their structural properties of the surface and subsurface layers of celestial bodies. Although chemical cohesive bonding has been observed in asteroid samples, and low-speed impact has been a subject of many studies, our understanding of the role of cohesion in these dynamics is limited, especially at small gravities such as those observed on asteroid surfaces. In this work, we use numerical discrete element method (DEM) and analytical dynamic resistive force theory (DRFT) modeling to examine the effect of cohesion on the outcome of the impact into loose granular media and explore scaling laws that predict impact behavior in the presence of cohesion under various gravitational conditions and cohesive strengths. We find that the effect of cohesion on the impact behavior becomes more significant in smaller gravitational acceleration, raising the need to scale the cohesion coefficient with gravity. We find that due to an insufficient understanding of confounding between cohesion and friction-induced quasi-static and inertial resistance, the outcomes of the DEM simulation models are incongruent with a suggested analytic model using Froude and Bond number scaling based on an additive contribution of frictional and inertial forces. Our study suggests that new dimensionless parameters and scaling are required to accurately capture the role of cohesion, given its ties to frictional behavior between the grain particles at different gravities.</description>

      <title>Investigation of lunar ejecta dynamics: Particles reaching the near-Earth space and their effect on Earth-based observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aims. Particles ejected from the lunar surface via hypervelocity impacts form a torus between the Earth and the Moon. According to our previous study (Yang et al., A\&amp;A, 659, A120), among them about $2.3\times10^{-4}\,\mathrm{kg/s}$ particles impact the Earth after long-term orbital evolution. We mainly focus on these Earth impactors, analyze their orbital element distribution, and estimate their influence on Earth-based observations.
  Methods. In previous work we simulated the long-term orbital evolution of particles ejected from the lunar surface, and obtained their steady-state spatial distribution in the Earth-Moon system. In this work, we analyze the simulation results about the Earth impactors, including the fraction of impactors with different initial parameters among all impactors, the orbital element distribution, and the projection of particles onto several Earth-based observatories.
  Results. Particles ejected from the lunar surface are more likely to impact the Earth within a certain range of initial parameters. Most of these lunar-ejected impactors ($\sim70\%$) reach the Earth within one year, while most of the small ones ($87.2\%$ of $0.2\,\mathrm{\mu m}$ particles and $64.6\%$ of $0.5\,\mathrm{\mu m}$ particles) reach the Earth within one week. A large proportion of lunar-ejected Earth impactors can be distinguished from interplanetary dust particles according to the differences in their orbital distributions. Besides, lunar-ejected particles may exhibit distinct configurations and orientations from the perspectives of different Earth-based observatories.</description>
