      <title>Generative Geostatistical Modeling from Incomplete Well and Imaged Seismic Observations with Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel approach to synthesizing subsurface velocity models using diffusion generative models. Conventional methods rely on extensive, high-quality datasets, which are often inaccessible in subsurface applications. Our method leverages incomplete well and seismic observations to produce high-fidelity velocity samples without requiring fully sampled training datasets. The results demonstrate that our generative model accurately captures long-range structures, aligns with ground-truth velocity models, achieves high Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) scores, and provides meaningful uncertainty estimations. This approach facilitates realistic subsurface velocity synthesis, offering valuable inputs for full-waveform inversion and enhancing seismic-based subsurface modeling.</description>

      <title>A Novel Coupled bES-FEM Formulation with SUPG stabilization for Thermo-Hydro-Mechanical Analysis in Saturated Porous Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two primary types of numerical instabilities often occur in low-order finite element method (FEM) analyses of thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) phenomena: (1) pressure oscillations arising improper interpolation of pressure and displacement fields; and (2) spatial oscillations induced by nonlinear convection terms in convection-dominated scenarios. In response to these issues, this paper proposes a novel stabilized edge-based smoothed FEM with a bubble function (bES-FEM) for THM analysis within saturated porous media. In the proposed framework, a cubic bubble function is first incorporated into ES-FEM to efficiently mitigate pressure oscillations that breach the Inf-Sup condition, and then the Streamline Upwind Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) scheme is adopted in bES-FEM to effectively reduce the spurious oscillations in convection-dominated heat transfer scenarios. The accuracy of the bES-FEM with SUPG formulation for THM coupled problems is validated through a series of five benchmark tests. Moreover, the simulations of open-loop ground source energy systems demonstrate the proposed method's exceptional capability in tackling complex THM challenges in real-world applications. All the obtained results showcase the superiority of proposed bES-FEM with SUPG in eliminating the spatial and pressure oscillations, marking it as a promising tool for the exploration of coupled THM issues.</description>

      <title>Towards Long Range Detection of Elephants Using Seismic Signals; A Geophone-Sensor Interface for Embedded Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The long-distance detection of the presence of elephants is pivotal to addressing the human-elephant conflict. IoT-based solutions utilizing seismic signals originating from the movement of elephants are a novel approach to solving this problem. This study introduces an instrumentation system comprising a specially designed geophone-sensor interface for non-invasive, long-range elephant detection using seismic waves while minimizing the vulnerability of seismic signals to noise. The geophone-sensor interface involves a cascade array of an instrumentation amplifier, a second-order Butterworth filter for signal filtering, and a signal amplifier. The introduced geophone-sensor interface was tested under laboratory conditions, and then real-world experiments were carried out for tamed, partly tamed, and untamed elephants. The experimental results reveal that the system remains stable within the tested frequency range from 1 Hz to 1 kHz and the temperature range of 10C to 40C. The system successfully captured the seismic signals generated by the footfalls of elephants within a maximum detection range of 155.6 m, with an overall detection accuracy of 99.5%.</description>

      <title>Effective Data Selection for Seismic Interpretation through Disagreement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a discussion on data selection for deep learning in the field of seismic interpretation. In order to achieve a robust generalization to the target volume, it is crucial to identify the specific samples are the most informative to the training process. The selection of the training set from a target volume is a critical factor in determining the effectiveness of the deep learning algorithm for interpreting seismic volumes. This paper proposes the inclusion of interpretation disagreement as a valuable and intuitive factor in the process of selecting training sets. The development of a novel data selection framework is inspired by established practices in seismic interpretation. The framework we have developed utilizes representation shifts to effectively model interpretation disagreement within neural networks. Additionally, it incorporates the disagreement measure to enhance attention towards geologically interesting regions throughout the data selection workflow. By combining this approach with active learning, a well-known machine learning paradigm for data selection, we arrive at a comprehensive and innovative framework for training set selection in seismic interpretation. In addition, we offer a specific implementation of our proposed framework, which we have named ATLAS. This implementation serves as a means for data selection. In this study, we present the results of our comprehensive experiments, which clearly indicate that ATLAS consistently surpasses traditional active learning frameworks in the field of seismic interpretation. Our findings reveal that ATLAS achieves improvements of up to 12% in mean intersection-over-union.</description>

      <title>Elastic Full-Waveform Inversion : How the physics of problem improves data-driven techniques?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Full-Waveform Inversion (FWI) is a nonlinear iterative seismic imaging technique that, by reducing the misfit between recorded and predicted seismic waveforms, can produce detailed estimates of subsurface geophysical properties. Nevertheless, the strong nonlinearity of FWI can trap the optimization in local minima. This issue arises due to factors such as improper initial values, the absence of low frequencies in the measurements, noise, and other related considerations. To address this challenge and with the advent of advanced machine-learning techniques, data-driven methods, such as deep learning, have attracted significantly increasing attention in the geophysical community. Furthermore, the elastic wave equation should be included in FWI to represent elastic effects accurately. The intersection of data-driven techniques and elastic scattering theories presents opportunities and challenges. In this paper, by using the knowledge of elastic scattering (Physics of problem) and integrating it with deep learning techniques, we propose methods for the solution of time-harmonic FWI to enhance accuracy compared to pure data-driven approaches. Moreover, by modifying the structure of the Variational Autoencoder, we introduce a probabilistic deep learning method based on the physics of the problem that enables us to explore the uncertainties of the solution. According to the limited availability of datasets in this field and to assess the performance and accuracy of the proposed methods, we create a comprehensive dataset close to reality and conduct a comparative analysis of the presented approaches to it.</description>

      <title>Superstep wavefield propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes how to propagate wavefields for arbitrary numbers of traditional time steps in a single step, called a superstep. We show how to construct operators that accomplish this task for finite-difference time domain schemes, including temporal first-order schemes in isotropic, anisotropic and elastic media, as well as temporal second-order schemes for acoustic media. This task is achieved by implementing a computational tradeoff differing from traditional single step wavefield propagators by precomputing propagator matrices for each model location for k timesteps (a superstep) and using these propagator matrices to advance the wavefield k time steps at once. This tradeoff separates the physics of the propagator matrix computation from the computer science of wavefield propagation and allows each discipline to provide their optimal modular solutions.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Crustal Velocity Structure in Sedimentary Basin by joint inversion of Teleseismic P-Wave Reverberations and Surface Wave Dispersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately determining the crustal velocity structure within sedimentary basins is crucial for enhancing energy resource evaluation and seismic hazard assessment. Traditional crustal imaging is challenging due to the interference of teleseismic P-wave reverberations (TPR). To address this issue, we propose an inversion strategy that combines multi-frequency TPR and surface wave dispersion (SWD) to constrain the crustal structure. Both theoretical simulations and real data tests from two stations in the Songliao Basin validate our approach. This method shows great promise for improving crustal structure investigations in complex environments, such as sedimentary basins and oceanic regions.</description>

      <title>Turbulent spectra of 2D inertial gravity waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We find the turbulent energy spectrum of weakly interacting 2D internal gravity waves without relying on the hydrostatic approximation. This spectrum is an exact solution of the kinetic equation after the shear modes are removed, and it agrees with the oceanic Garrett-Munk spectrum for frequencies large compared to the Coriolis frequency and vertical scales small compared to the depth of the ocean. Among a continuous family of solutions to the kinetic equation, we show that the turbulent solution is the special solution with non zero angular dependent radial flux. Our solution provides an interesting insight of how turbulent energy cascade proceeds in anisotropic systems - similarly to isotropic turbulence it is self-similar in scale, but its angular part is peaked along the curve of vanishing frequency.</description>
