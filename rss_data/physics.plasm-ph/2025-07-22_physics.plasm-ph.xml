      <title>Electromagnetic Flow Control in Hypersonic Rarefied Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Unified Gas-Kinetic Wave-Particle (UGKWP) method, developed for multiscale simulation of partially ionized plasmas, has been extended to unstructured meshes, enabling the modeling of electromagnetic flows around a hemisphere across near-continuum to rarefied regimes. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first application of a multiscale plasma solver to this problem. In our approach, neutrals, ions, and electrons are treated as distinct species, with electrons modeled beyond the conventional fluid approximation. The numerical implementation is validated through comparison with reference solutions for neutral hypersonic flow around a sphere, as well as benchmarking against experimental data for a Mach 4.75 pre-ionized argon flow. In both cases, the UGKWP results show good agreement with the reference and experimental data. The findings reveal that rarefied effects play a significant role in the prediction of electromagnetic flow control, underscoring the necessity of multiscale modeling in plasma flow applications.</description>

      <title>Effects of turbulence spreading and symmetry breaking on edge shear flow during sawtooth cycles in J-TEXT tokamak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sawtooth oscillations can trigger off heat and turbulence pulses that propagate into the edge plasma, and thus enhancing the edge shear flow and inducing a transition from low confinement mode to high confinement mode. The influences of turbulence spreading and symmetry breaking on edge shear flow with sawtooth crashes are observed in the J-TEXT tokamak. The edge plasma turbulence and shear flow are measured using a fast reciprocating electrostatic probe array. After sawtooth crashes, the heat and turbulence pulses in the core propagate to the edge, with the turbulence pulse being faster than the heat pulse. After sawtooth crashes, the edge electron temperature increases and the edge turbulence is enhanced, with turbulence preceding temperature. The enhanced edge turbulence is mainly composed of two parts: the turbulence driven by local gradient and the turbulence spreading from core to edge. The development of the estimated turbulence spreading rate is prior to that of the turbulence driving rate. The increase in the turbulence intensity can cause the turbulent Reynold stress and its gradient to increase, thereby enhancing shear flows and radial electric fields. Turbulence spreading leads the edge Reynolds stresses to develop and the shear flow to be faster than edge electron temperature. The Reynolds stress arises from the symmetry breaking of the turbulence wave number spectrum. After sawtooth collapses, the joint probability density function of radial wave number and poloidal wave number of turbulence intensity exhibits strong asymmetry. These results show that the turbulence spreading and symmetry breaking can enhance turbulent Reynolds stress, thereby driving shear flows, after sawtooth has crashed.</description>

      <title>Investigations of the kinetic ion-acoustic soliton by the Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal integral method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solitary waves are investigated through the Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal integral method with the ion response. We consider two specific cases of ions, i.e., the single stream with the waterbag distribution and the two counter-propagating streams with the Maxwellian distribution. The trapped electron distributions are derived for both two cases. The results show that the trapped electron distribution can be either a hole or a hump in the phase space, depending on the competition between the contributions from the passing electron distribution, the potential profile, and the ion response. We obtain the boundary between the ion-acoustic soliton and the electron hole in the parameter space. The effects of the potential amplitude, width, and the ion-to-electron mass ratio on the separatrices are discussed. The Vlasov simulations are conducted to verify the stability of the ion-acoustic soliton constructed by the integral method.</description>

      <title>Effect of radial pressure corrugations and profile shearing on turbulence in Fusion plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microturbulence can produce stationary fine-scale radial corrugations on the plasma density and temperature gradients in magnetic confinement fusion devices. We show that these structures play a significant role in regulating turbulent transport. We focus on the pedestal, studying electron-temperature-gradient (ETG) mode destabilisation and saturation in the presence of radial corrugations on the electron temperature gradient that could result from microtearing turbulence. A linear dispersion relation is derived for a shearless slab case, which indicates that in the presence of a sinusoidal background corrugation, each ETG mode splits into three distinct eigenvalues, with one being the original, one being more unstable and one being less unstable. However, despite the presence of more unstable linear modes, nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations of ETG with corrugated background electron temperature show a reduction of fluxes. Our investigation reveals a radial variation of the phase velocity of the modes that is proportional to the diamagnetic drift velocity and the local pressure gradient. The associated profile shearing breaks the turbulent eddies apart, reducing the transport level. This profile shearing resulting from fine-scale pressure corrugations could be a ubiquitous turbulence saturation mechanism not just in Fusion plasmas, but in Astrophysics and other areas.</description>

      <title>Spectral Surgery in a Heat Bath: a finite-temperature guide to particle production for phenomenologists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantifying the effects of finite temperature and density (FTD) on particle properties is essential for understanding phenomena within and beyond the Standard Model. In this work, we present a simplified framework for calculating particle production rates at FTD without resorting to a full thermal field theory calculation. We do so by relating the imaginary part of a particle's $n$-loop finite temperature self energy, which defines its in-medium damping rate, to a sum of thermally weighted tree-level vacuum rates. Such a mapping results in novel "interference" contributions to particle production which have no vacuum analog and which have been relatively overlooked in the phenomenology literature. These interference terms are known to regulate collinear and infrared divergences that arise when calculating interaction rates in a medium. We demonstrate the impact of these corrections with two toy models and find that properly accounting for these interference terms can alter particle production by an $O(1)$ amount. We additionally compare the size of these corrections to the thermal mass corrections often studied in the literature, finding the sizes of these contributions to be of similar order.</description>

      <title>A "Faux-Shock" Method for Hybrid Simulations of Astrophysical Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a novel setup for hybrid particle-in-cell simulations designed to isolate the physics of the shock precursor over long time periods for significantly lower computational cost than previous methods. This is achieved using a "faux-shock" or shock-like boundary condition on one edge of our simulation domain such that particles that interact with the boundary either pass through it or are reflected off of it with a change in momentum that mimics scattering in the downstream. We show that our faux-shock setup reproduces the same fluid quantities and phase spaces as traditional shock simulations, including those which could otherwise only be done in 3D, with higher particle resolution and for reduced computational cost. While the method involves an assumed boundary condition, it nonetheless captures the essential physics of interest, establishing it as a reliable and efficient tool for future self-consistent studies of instabilities driven by cosmic rays in a shock upstream medium.</description>

      <title>Coherently enhanced radiation friction in laser-plasma collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20290v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reconsider the footprints of radiation friction in a head on collision of a bunch of relativistic charged particles with a laser pulse by demonstrating that in a dense enough bunch forward and backward radiation and radiation friction are coherently enhanced. This should make it possible to observe radiation friction effects in laser-matter interactions at much lower energies and laser intensities than accepted ever previously. A simple estimate for the energy losses of the particles in the bunch over the collision due to radiation friction in terms of laser and bunch parameters is derived and validated by comparing with the results of three dimensional particle-in-cell simulations.</description>

      <title>Absolute constraints on the magnetic field evolution in tokamak power plants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Issues of tokamak power plants, such as maximum possible length of a pulse of fusion power, the required time between fusion pulses, and the evolution of the current profile towards disruptive states, are tightly constrained by a simple evolution equation for the magnetic field. This equation follows from Faraday's Law and the mathematical relation between the magnetic and the electric fields. The validity of detailed simulations is tested by consistency with Faraday's Law, not the other way around. The evolution equation suggests methods of avoiding the limitations of these constraints. Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) is proceeding on a fast timescale to operate a fusion power plant -- even writing contracts on the power to be produced by their ARC tokamak. This makes it important to determine the issues that should be studied by SPARC, which is the tokamak that CFS is building to address issues before ARC is built. The STEP prototype of a spherical tokamak power plant of Tokamak Energy is on a similar fast timescale. Feasible simulations from startup to shutdown for prototype plasmas could greatly clarify these constraints and the feasibility of their avoidance. This paper has two purposes: (1) Illustrate issues on which research must be focused for the credibility tokamak power plants. (2) Encourage thought on the allocation of resources among the various fusion concepts to minimize the time and the cost to the achievement of practical fusion power.</description>
