      <title>A note on the perturbations of subshifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider different classes of subshifts and study their perturbations obtained by forbidding sequences that contain a given word as a subword. We show that the perturbations of sofic shifts are sofic. Though not true for general coded systems, we provide sufficient conditions under which perturbations of synchronized systems remain synchronized. We investigate which systems remain conjugate under perturbation by a word from a coded system. We also explicitly calculate the drop in entropy under perturbation when the subshift is an $\mathcal{S}$-gap shift, and obtain its exponential decay as the length of the word increases. In the case of subshifts of finite type, we explore the drop in entropy under multi-word perturbations.</description>

      <title>Automorphism groups of measures on the Cantor space. Part II: Abstract homogeneous measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main aim of the paper is to introduce a new class of (semigroup-valued) measures that are ultrahomogeneous on the Boolean algebra of all clopen subsets of the Cantor space and to study their automorphism groups. A characterisation, in terms of the so-called trinary spectrum of a measure, of ultrahomogeneous measures such that the action of their automorphism groups is (topologically) transitive or minimal is given. Also sufficient and necessary conditions for the existence of a dense (or co-meager) conjugacy class in these groups are offered. In particular, it is shown that there are uncountably many full non-atomic probability Borel measures m on the Cantor space such that m and all its restrictions to arbitrary non-empty clopen sets have all the following properties: this measure is ultrahomogeneous and not good, the action of its automorphism group G is minimal (on a respective clopen set), and G has a dense conjugacy class. It is also shown that any minimal homeomorphism h on the Cantor space induces a homogeneous h-invariant probability measure that is universal among all h-invariant probability measures (which means that it `generates' all such measures) and this property determines this measure (in a certain sense) up to a Q-linear isomorphism.</description>

      <title>Structural System Identification via Validation and Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating the governing equation parameter values is essential for integrating experimental data with scientific theory to understand, validate, and predict the dynamics of complex systems. In this work, we propose a new method for structural system identification (SI), uncertainty quantification, and validation directly from data. Inspired by generative modeling frameworks, a neural network maps random noise to physically meaningful parameters. These parameters are then used in the known equation of motion to obtain fake accelerations, which are compared to real training data via a mean square error loss. To simultaneously validate the learned parameters, we use independent validation datasets. The generated accelerations from these datasets are evaluated by a discriminator network, which determines whether the output is real or fake, and guides the parameter-generator network. Analytical and real experiments show the parameter estimation accuracy and model validation for different nonlinear structural systems.</description>

      <title>Structural stability and generic transitions of "incompressible" line fields on surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various line fields naturally arise on surfaces in both physical and biological contexts, and generic singularities frequently appear in the form of 1-prong (thorn-like) and 3-prong (tripod-like) configurations, which can be modeled by partial differential equations with specific parameter values. However, it remains open under which topologies such line fields are structurally stable and form an open dense subset. In this paper, we propose a new topological framework for describing line fields and their evaluations on surfaces that is suitable from both theoretical and applied perspectives. Specifically, we demonstrate that, under a topology defined by a ``cone'' structure, line fields with 1-prong and 3-prong singularities are generic when an ``incompressibility condition'' holds. We also introduce representations of complete invariants for generic line fields and their generic transitions. These representations enable the evolution of ``incompressible'' line fields -- such as those observed in active nematics -- to be encoded as walks on transition graphs, providing a combinatorial framework for their analysis.</description>

      <title>Convergence of the Birkhoff spectrum for nonintegrable observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider interval maps with countably many full branches and observables with polynomial tails. We show that the Birkhoff spectrum is real analytic and that its convergence to the Hausdorff dimension of the repeller is governed by the polynomial tail exponent. This result extends previous work by Arima on more regular observables and demonstrates how the tail behaviour influences the structure of the Birkhoff spectrum. Our proof relies on techniques from thermodynamic formalism and tail estimates for the observable and our applications are to natural observations on Gauss maps, L\"uroth transformations as well as to a the first return time for a class of induced Manneville-Pomeau maps.</description>

      <title>An ergodic Lebesgue differentiation theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that if $(X, \mu, T)$ is a probability measure-preserving dynamical system, and $\mathscr{P}$ is a countable partition of $(X, \mu)$, then the limit $$ \lim_{n, k \to \infty} \mathbb{E} \left[ \frac{1}{k} \sum_{j = 0}^{k - 1} f \circ T^j \mid \bigvee_{i = 0}^{n - 1} T^{-i} \mathscr{P} \right] $$ exists almost surely for all $f \in L^p(\mu), p &gt; 1$. We prove this as a corollary of a geometric result: that if $(X, \mu)$ is a metric measure space on which the Hardy-Littlewood maximal inequality holds, then the limit $$\lim_{r \searrow 0, k \to \infty} \mu(B(x, r))^{-1} \int_{B(x, r)} \frac{1}{k} \sum_{j = 0}^{k - 1} f \circ T^j \mathrm{d} \mu$$ exists almost surely.</description>

      <title>On the Invariance of Expansive Measures for Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study expansive measures for continuous flows without fixed points on compact metric spaces, as introduced in [6]. We provide a new characterization of expansive measures through dynamical balls that, in contrast to the dynamical balls considered in [6], are actually Borel sets. This makes the theory more amenable to measure-theoretic analysis. We then establish a version of the Brin-Katok local entropy formula for flows using these generalized dynamical balls. As an application, we prove that every ergodic invariant measure with positive entropy is positively expansive, thus extending the results of [1] to the setting of regular flows. This implies that flows with positive topological entropy admit expansive invariant measures. Furthermore, we show that the stable classes of such measures have zero measure. Lastly, we prove that the set of expansive measures forms a $G_{\delta\sigma}$ subset in the weak*-topology and that every expansive measure (invariant or not) can be approximated by expansive measures supported on invariant sets.</description>

      <title>Distributed Lyapunov Functions for Nonlinear Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear networks are often multistable, exhibiting coexisting stable states with competing regions of attraction (ROAs). As a result, ROAs can have complex "tentacle-like" morphologies that are challenging to characterize analytically or computationally. In addition, the high dimensionality of the state space prohibits the automated construction of Lyapunov functions using state-of-the-art optimization methods, such as sum-of-squares (SOS) programming. In this letter, we propose a distributed approach for the construction of Lyapunov functions based solely on local information. To this end, we establish an augmented comparison lemma that characterizes the existence conditions of partial Lyapunov functions, while also accounting for residual effects caused by the associated dimensionality reduction. These theoretical results allow us to formulate an SOS optimization that iteratively constructs such partial functions, whose aggregation forms a composite Lyapunov function. The resulting composite function provides accurate convex approximations of both the volumes and shapes of the ROAs. We validate our method on networks of van der Pol and Ising oscillators, demonstrating its effectiveness in characterizing high-dimensional systems with non-convex ROAs.</description>

      <title>Stochastic and Non-local Closure Modeling for Nonlinear Dynamical Systems via Latent Score-based Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a latent score-based generative AI framework for learning stochastic, non-local closure models and constitutive laws in nonlinear dynamical systems of computational mechanics. This work addresses a key challenge of modeling complex multiscale dynamical systems without a clear scale separation, for which numerically resolving all scales is prohibitively expensive, e.g., for engineering turbulent flows. While classical closure modeling methods leverage domain knowledge to approximate subgrid-scale phenomena, their deterministic and local assumptions can be too restrictive in regimes lacking a clear scale separation. Recent developments of diffusion-based stochastic models have shown promise in the context of closure modeling, but their prohibitive computational inference cost limits practical applications for many real-world applications. This work addresses this limitation by jointly training convolutional autoencoders with conditional diffusion models in the latent spaces, significantly reducing the dimensionality of the sampling process while preserving essential physical characteristics. Numerical results demonstrate that the joint training approach helps discover a proper latent space that not only guarantees small reconstruction errors but also ensures good performance of the diffusion model in the latent space. When integrated into numerical simulations, the proposed stochastic modeling framework via latent conditional diffusion models achieves significant computational acceleration while maintaining comparable predictive accuracy to standard diffusion models in physical spaces.</description>

      <title>On the geometry of a 4-dimensional extension of a $q$-Painlev\'e I equation with symmetry type $A_1^{(1)}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a geometric study of a four-dimensional integrable discrete dynamical system which extends the autonomous form of a $q$-Painlev\'e I equation with symmetry of type $A_1^{(1)}$. By resolution of singularities it is lifted to a pseudo-automorphism of a rational variety obtained from $({\mathbb P}^1)^{\times 4}$ by blowing up along 28 subvarieties and we use this to establish its integrability in terms of conserved quantities and degree growth. We embed this rational variety into a family which admits an action of the extended affine Weyl group $\widetilde{W}(A_1^{(1)})\times \widetilde{W}(A_1^{(1)})$ by pseudo-isomorphisms. We use this to construct two 4-dimensional analogues of $q$-Painlev\'e equations, one of which is a deautonomisation of the original autonomous integrable map.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work extends weak KAM theory to the case of a nonsmooth Lagrangian satisfying a superlinear growth condition. Using the solution of a weak KAM equation that is a stationary Hamilton-Jacobi equation and the proximal aiming method, we construct a family of discontinuous feedback strategies that are nearly optimal for every time interval. This result leads to an analogue of the weak KAM theorem. Additionally, as in classical weak KAM theory, we demonstrate that the effective Hamiltonian (Ma\~{n}\'{e} critical value) can be determined by solving a linear programming problem in the class of probability measures.</description>

      <title>Evolution of boundedly rational learning in games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: People make strategic decisions multiple times a day. We act strategically in negotiations, when we coordinate our actions with others, or when we choose with whom to cooperate. The resulting dynamics can be studied with evolutionary game theory. This framework explores how people adapt their decisions over time, in light of how effective their strategies have proven to be. A crucial quantity in respective models is the strength of selection. This quantity regulates how likely individuals switch to a better strategy when given the choice. The larger the selection strength, the more biased is the learning process in favor of strategies with large payoffs. Therefore, this quantity is often interpreted as a measure of rationality. Traditionally, most models take selection strength to be a fixed parameter. Instead, here we allow the individuals' strategies and their selection strength to co-evolve. The endpoints of this co-evolutionary process depend on the strategic interaction in place. In many prisoner's dilemmas, selection strength increases indefinitely, as one may expect. However, in snowdrift or stag-hunt games, it can either converge to a finite value, or we observe evolutionary branching altogether - such that different individuals arrive at different selection strengths. Overall, this work sheds light on how evolution might shape learning mechanisms for social behavior. It suggests that boundedly rational learning is not only a by-product of cognitive constraints. Instead it might also evolve as a means to gain strategic advantages.</description>

      <title>On the weakness of the vague specification property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the vague specification property is strictly weaker than most of the specification-like properties, by establishing its equivalence with the asymptotic average shadowing property. In particular, we see that the weak specification property implies the vague specification property, but the converse does not hold, answering the question posed by Downarowicz and Weiss in [Ergod. Th. \&amp; Dynam. Sys. 44(9) (2024), 2565--2580]. Additionally, we prove that, for surjective systems, the asymptotic average shadowing property is equivalent to the average shadowing property if the phase space is complete with respect to the dynamical Besicovitch pseudometric. We use the combination of both results to prove that the proximal and minimal shift spaces from [Ergod. Th. \&amp; Dynam. Sys., 45(2) (2025), 396--426] possess the vague specification property (asymptotic average shadowing property). Our findings also allow us to address a couple of questions from [Fund. Math., 224(3) (2014), 241--278] about the asymptotic average shadowing property.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a complete non-archimedean field of characteristic $0$ equipped with a discrete valuation. We establish the rationality of the Artin-Mazur zeta function on the Julia set for any subhyperbolic rational map defined over $K$ with a compact Julia set. Furthermore, we conclude that the topological entropy on the Julia set of such a map is given by the logarithm of a weak Perron number. Conversely, we construct a (sub)hyperbolic rational map defined over $K$ with compact Julia set whose topological entropy on the Julia set equals the logarithm of a given weak Perron number. This extends Thurston's work on the entropy for postcritically finite interval self-maps %of the unit interval to the non-archimedean setting.</description>

      <title>Maslov $S^{1}$ Bundles and Maslov Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.11085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define Maslov $S^1$ bundles over a symplectic manifold $(M,\omega)$. These are the determinant bundle $\Gamma_J$ of the unitary frame bundle defined by an almost complex structure compatible with $\omega$, and the bundle $\Gamma_J^2 = \Gamma_J \big/ \{\pm1\}$. We analyze the properties of the Maslov $S^1$ bundles $\Gamma_J$ and $\Gamma_J^2$, focusing on the interplay between their geometry and the dynamics of a symplectic action of a compact Lie group $G$ on $M$ which induces lifted $G$ actions on $\Gamma_J$ and on $\Gamma_J^2$. We show that when $M$ is a homogeneous $G$-space and the first real Chern class $c_\Gamma$ is nonvanishing, $\Gamma_J$ and $\Gamma_J^2$ are also homogeneous $G$-spaces. Moreover, we give an alternative proof of the fact that when $[\omega]=r\,c_{\Gamma}$ for some real number $r$, then the symplectic $G$ action on $(M,\omega)$ is Hamiltonian. When the Maslov $S^1$ bundle $\Gamma_J^2$ is trivial, then an index generalizing the Maslov index can be defined. This is no longer true if $\Gamma_J^2$ is not trivial. However, if $G=S^1$ acts symplectically on $(M,\omega)$ we define a quantity that we call Maslov data which serves as a non-integrable version of the notion of Maslov index in the case where $\Gamma_J^2$ is not trivial, and we associate the Maslov data at fixed points of the $G=S^1$ action to their resonance type. Finally, we consider three applications motivated by the study of integrable Hamiltonian systems. First, we discuss conditions under which an $S^1$ symmetry of a two degrees of freedom integrable Hamiltonian system can be extended to a $\mathbb T^2$ symmetry. Second, we show that the Maslov $S^1$ bundles over Lagrangian pinched tori are trivial. Third, we consider $S^2 \times S^2$ as a symplectic manifold with an $S^1$ action corresponding to simultaneous rotations of the two spheres, and we compute the corresponding Maslov data.</description>

      <title>Subspace-Distance-Enabled Active Learning for Efficient Data-Driven Model Reduction of Parametric Dynamical Systems</title>

Abstract: In situations where the solution of a high-fidelity dynamical system needs to be evaluated repeatedly, over a vast pool of parametric configurations and in absence of access to the underlying governing equations, data-driven model reduction techniques are preferable. We propose a novel active learning approach to build a parametric data-driven reduced-order model (ROM) by greedily picking the most important parameter samples from the parameter domain. As a result, during the ROM construction phase, the number of high-fidelity solutions dynamically grow in a principled fashion. The high-fidelity solution snapshots are expressed in several parameter-specific linear subspaces, with the help of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), and the relative distance between these subspaces is used as a guiding mechanism to perform active learning. For successfully achieving this, we provide a distance measure to evaluate the similarity between pairs of linear subspaces with different dimensions, and also show that this distance measure is a metric. The usability of the proposed subspace-distance-enabled active learning (SDE-AL) framework is demonstrated by augmenting two existing non-intrusive reduced-order modeling approaches, and providing their active-learning-driven (ActLearn) extensions, namely, SDE-ActLearn-POD-KSNN, and SDE-ActLearn-POD-NN. Furthermore, we report positive results for two parametric physical models, highlighting the efficiency of the proposed SDE-AL approach.</description>

      <title>The Graded Classification Conjecture holds for graphs with disjoint cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Graded Classification Conjecture (GCC) states that the pointed $K_0^{\operatorname{gr}}$-group is a complete invariant of the Leavitt path algebras of finite graphs when these algebras are considered with their natural grading by $\mathbb Z.$ The conjecture has previously been shown to hold in some special cases. The main result of the paper shows that the GCC holds for a significantly more general class of graphs included in the class of graphs with disjoint cycles. In particular, our result holds for finite graphs with disjoint cycles. We show the main result also for graph $C^*$-algebras. As a consequence, the graded version of the Isomorphism Conjecture holds for the class of graphs we consider.
  Besides showing the conjecture for the class of graphs we consider, we realize the Grothendieck $\mathbb Z$-group isomorphism by a specific graded $*$-isomorphism. In particular, we introduce a series of graph operations which preserve the graded $*$-isomorphism class of their algebras. After performing these operations on a graph, we obtain well-behaved ``representative'' graphs, which we call canonical forms. We define an equivalence $\approx$ on graphs such that $E\approx F$ holds when there are isomorphic canonical forms of $E$ and $F$ and we show that the condition $E\approx F$ is equivalent to the existence of an isomorphism $f$ of the Grothendieck $\mathbb Z$-groups of the algebras of $E$ and $F$ in the appropriate category. As $E\approx F$ can be realized by a finite series of specific graph operations, any such isomorphism $f$ can be realized by an explicit graded $*$-algebra isomorphism. Thus, we describe the graded ($*$-)isomorphism classes of the algebras of graphs we consider. Besides the ties to symbolic dynamics and Williams' Problem, such a description is relevant for the active program of classification of graph $C^*$-algebras.</description>

      <title>A fast and memoryless numerical method for solving fractional differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The numerical solution of implicit and stiff differential equations by implicit numerical integrators has been largely investigated and there exist many excellent efficient codes available in the scientific community, as Radau5 (based on a Runge-Kutta collocation method at Radau points) and Dassl, based on backward differentiation formulas, among the others. When solving fractional ordinary differential equations (ODEs), the derivative operator is replaced by a non-local one and the fractional ODE is reformulated as a Volterra integral equation, to which these codes cannot be directly applied.
  This article is a follow-up of the article by the authors (Guglielmi and Hairer, SISC, 2025) for differential equations with distributed delays. The main idea is to approximate the fractional kernel $t^{\alpha -1}/ \Gamma (\alpha )$ ($\alpha &gt;0$) by a sum of exponential functions or by a sum of exponential functions multiplied by a monomial, and then to transform the fractional integral (of convolution type) into a set of ordinary differential equations. The augmented system is typically stiff and thus requires the use of an implicit method. It can have a very large dimension and requires a special treatment of the arising linear systems.
  The present work presents an algorithm for the construction of an approximation of the fractional kernel by a sum of exponential functions, and it shows how the arising linear systems in a stiff time integrator can be solved efficiently. It is explained how the code Radau5 can be used for solving fractional differential equations. Numerical experiments illustrate the accuracy and the efficiency of the proposed method. Driver examples are publicly available from the homepages of the authors.</description>
