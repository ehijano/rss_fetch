      <title>Scalable Distributed Nonlinear Control Under Flatness-Preserving Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study distributed control for a network of nonlinear, differentially flat subsystems subject to dynamic coupling. Although differential flatness simplifies planning and control for isolated subsystems, the presence of coupling can destroy this property for the overall joint system. Focusing on subsystems in pure-feedback form, we identify a class of compatible lower-triangular dynamic couplings that preserve flatness and guarantee that the flat outputs of the subsystems remain the flat outputs of the coupled system. Further, we show that the joint flatness diffeomorphism can be constructed from those of the individual subsystems and, crucially, its sparsity structure reflects that of the coupling. Exploiting this structure, we synthesize a distributed tracking controller that computes control actions from local information only, thereby ensuring scalability. We validate our proposed framework on a simulated example of planar quadrotors dynamically coupled via aerodynamic downwash, and show that the distributed controller achieves accurate trajectory tracking.</description>

      <title>Verifying Closed-Loop Contractivity of Learning-Based Controllers via Partitioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of verifying closed-loop contraction in nonlinear control systems whose controller and contraction metric are both parameterized by neural networks. By leveraging interval analysis and interval bound propagation, we derive a tractable and scalable sufficient condition for closed-loop contractivity that reduces to checking that the dominant eigenvalue of a symmetric Metzler matrix is nonpositive. We combine this sufficient condition with a domain partitioning strategy to integrate this sufficient condition into training. The proposed approach is validated on an inverted pendulum system, demonstrating the ability to learn neural network controllers and contraction metrics that provably satisfy the contraction condition.</description>

      <title>Edge-Native, Behavior-Adaptive Drone System for Wildlife Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wildlife monitoring with drones must balance competing demands: approaching close enough to capture behaviorally-relevant video while avoiding stress responses that compromise animal welfare and data validity. Human operators face a fundamental attentional bottleneck: they cannot simultaneously control drone operations and monitor vigilance states across entire animal groups. By the time elevated vigilance becomes obvious, an adverse flee response by the animals may be unavoidable. To solve this challenge, we present an edge-native, behavior-adaptive drone system for wildlife monitoring. This configurable decision-support system augments operator expertise with automated group-level vigilance monitoring. Our system continuously tracks individual behaviors using YOLOv11m detection and YOLO-Behavior classification, aggregates vigilance states into a real-time group stress metric, and provides graduated alerts (alert vigilance to flee response) with operator-tunable thresholds for context-specific calibration. We derive service-level objectives (SLOs) from video frame rates and behavioral dynamics: to monitor 30fps video streams in real-time, our system must complete detection and classification within 33ms per frame. Our edge-native pipeline achieves 23.8ms total inference on GPU-accelerated hardware, meeting this constraint with a substantial margin. Retrospective analysis of seven wildlife monitoring missions demonstrates detection capability and quantifies the cost of reactive control: manual piloting results in 14 seconds average adverse behavior duration with 71.9% usable frames. Our analysis reveals operators could have received actionable alerts 51s before animals fled in 57% of missions. Simulating 5-second operator intervention yields a projected performance of 82.8% usable frames with 1-second adverse behavior duration,a 93% reduction compared to manual piloting.</description>

      <title>On Frequency-Weighted Extended Balanced Truncation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of frequency-weighted extended balanced truncation for discrete and continuous-time linear time-invariant plants. We show that the frequency-weighted discrete-time plant admits block-diagonal solutions to both the Lyapunov inequality and its extended form. A recursive algorithm for extended balanced truncation is proposed, together with corresponding a-priori error bounds. Theoretical results are extended to continuous-time systems and validated through numerical examples.</description>

      <title>On the Convergence of Density-Based Predictive Control for Multi-Agent Non-Uniform Area Coverage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents Density-based Predictive Control (DPC), a novel multi-agent control strategy for efficient non-uniform area coverage, grounded in optimal transport theory. In large-scale scenarios such as search and rescue or environmental monitoring, traditional uniform coverage fails to account for varying regional priorities. DPC leverages a pre-constructed reference distribution to allocate agents' coverage efforts, spending more time in high-priority or densely sampled regions. We analyze convergence conditions using the Wasserstein distance, derive an analytic optimal control law for unconstrained cases, and propose a numerical method for constrained scenarios. Simulations on first-order dynamics and linearized quadrotor models demonstrate that DPC achieves trajectories closely matching the non-uniform reference distribution, outperforming existing coverage methods.</description>

      <title>Fleet Size and Mix Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows for Mobile Fast Chargers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electrification of off-road heavy equipment presents operational challenges for agencies serving remote sites with limited fixed charging infrastructure. Existing mobile fast charging vehicle (MFCV) planning approaches typically treat fleet design and routing as separate problems, fixing vehicle characteristics before dispatch. This paper formulates a fleet size and mix capacitated vehicle routing problem with time windows (FSMCVRPTW) for MFCV deployment, jointly optimizing fleet composition, charger specifications, routing, and scheduling within a unified mixed-integer linear program. The model incorporates heterogeneous MFCV types with varying power ratings, battery capacities, fuel range, and cost structures, minimizing total daily cost from labor, fuel, amortized capital expenditure, and energy purchase under temporal service windows, resource budgets, and energy-delivery constraints. The formulation is implemented in Python/Gurobi and applied to two case studies using California Department of Transportation wheel-loader data in Los Angeles (dense urban) and Truckee (sparse mountainous). Results show that simultaneous optimization yields compact, well-utilized fleets that meet all service windows while revealing strong sensitivity of unit cost to demand density and geography. The proposed FSMCVRPTW framework provides a generalizable decision-support methodology that co-designs fleet size, charger power, routing, and service schedules in a single optimization layer for context-aware, cost-efficient mobile fast charging.</description>

      <title>Necessary and Sufficient Conditions for PID Design of MIMO Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As is well known, classical PID control is ubiquitous in industrial processes, yet a rigorous and explicit design theory for nonlinear uncertain MIMO second-order systems remains underdeveloped. In this paper we consider a class of such systems with both uncertain dynamics and an unknown but strictly positive input gain, where the nonlinear uncertainty is characterized by bounds on the Jacobian with respect to the state variables. We explicitly construct a three-dimensional region for the PID gains that is sufficient to guarantee global stability and asymptotic tracking of constant references for all nonlinearities satisfying these Jacobian bounds. We then derive a corresponding necessary region, thereby revealing the inherent conservatism required to cope with worst-case uncertainties. Moreover, under additional structural assumptions on the nonlinearities, these sufficient and necessary regions coincide, yielding a precise necessary-and-sufficient characterization of all globally stabilizing PID gains. All these regions are given in closed form and depend only on the prescribed Jacobian bounds and the known lower bound of the input gain, in contrast to many qualitative tuning methods in the literature.</description>

      <title>Intervention Strategies for Fairness and Efficiency at Autonomous Single-Intersection Traffic Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intersections present significant challenges in traffic management, where ensuring safety and efficiency is essential for effective flow. However, these goals are often achieved at the expense of fairness, which is critical for trustworthiness and long-term sustainability. This paper investigates how the timing of centralized intervention affects the management of autonomous agents at a signal-less, orthogonal intersection, while satisfying safety constraints, evaluating efficiency, and ensuring fairness. A mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) approach is used to optimize agent coordination within a circular control zone centered at the intersection. We introduce the concept of fairness, measured via pairwise reversal counts, and incorporate fairness constraints into the MILP framework. We then study the relationship between fairness and system efficiency and its impact on platoon formation. Finally, simulation studies analyze the effectiveness of early versus late intervention strategies and fairness-aware control, focusing on safe, efficient, and robust management of agents within the control zone.</description>

      <title>Reduced-order Smith predictor for state feedback control with guaranteed stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article deals with the implementation of the Smith Predictor for state feedback control in state space representation. The desired control law, obtained using partial differential equations and backstepping control, contains an integral term that has to be approximated for implementation. In this article, we propose a new way to implement this control law using a dynamic controller. The control law is composed of a state feedback term and a dynamic term that approaches the integral term that has to be estimated for implementation. Using a Lyapunov functional, we provide sufficient conditions, in terms of a linear matrix inequality, to guarantee that the closed-loop system is stable when the proposed control law is applied. We use three examples, taken from the literature, to show the benefits of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Modal Analysis of Core Inertial Dynamics: Re-evaluating Grid-Forming Control Design Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper employs modal analysis to study the core inertial dynamics of governor-controlled synchronous generators (GC-SG), droop-based grid-forming (GFM) converters, and their most fundamental interactions. The results indicate that even in the simplest cases, the prevailing industry paradigm of emulating legacy GC-SG behaviour in GFM converters (high inertia to slow down the system and large droop to increase damping) could be a suboptimal policy. It is shown that GC-SGs exhibit a fundamental trade-off: adequate damping of the turbine-governor mode requires large droop constants, inevitably increasing steady-state frequency deviation and dependence on secondary regulation. In contrast, droop-based GFM converters invert this relationship: decreasing the droop constant simultaneously reduces steady-state frequency deviations and increases damping, while allowing virtual inertia to be freely chosen. When two GC-SGs are coupled, the poorly damped electromechanical swing mode emerges. Results show that replacing one GC-SG with a GFM converter of equivalent droop and inertia already significantly improves damping of both swing and turbine-governor modes. Counter-intuitively, further and remarkable damping gains are achieved by substantially lowering the GFM virtual inertia constant. These findings suggest that current industry trends may be constraining the potential benefits of Inverter Based Resources (IBRs). Optimal stability and performance are instead obtained with low droop and low virtual inertia, yielding tightly bounded frequency variations and strongly-damped electromechanical modes. The results indicate a need to re-evaluate GFM control design principles and emerging grid-code requirements.</description>

      <title>Gain-Scheduling Data-Enabled Predictive Control for Nonlinear Systems with Linearized Operating Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a Gain-Scheduled Data-Enabled Predictive Control (GS-DeePC) framework for nonlinear systems based on multiple locally linear data representations. Instead of relying on a single global Hankel matrix, the operating range of a measurable scheduling variable is partitioned into regions, and regional Hankel matrices are constructed from persistently exciting data. To ensure smooth transitions between linearization regions and suppress region-induced chattering, composite regions are introduced, merging neighboring data sets and enabling a robust switching mechanism. The proposed method maintains the original DeePC problem structure and can achieve reduced computational complexity by requiring only short, locally informative data sequences. Extensive experiments on a nonlinear DC-motor with an unbalanced disc demonstrate the significantly improved control performance compared to standard DeePC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the modeling of autonomous vehicles with high maneuverability used in an experimental framework for educational purposes. Since standard bicycle models typically neglect wide steering angles, we develop modified planar bicycle models and combine them with both parametric and non-parametric identification techniques that progressively incorporate physical knowledge. The resulting models are systematically compared to evaluate the tradeoff between model accuracy and computational requirements, showing that physics-informed neural network models surpass the purely physical baseline in accuracy at lower computational cost.</description>

      <title>Tempering the Bayes Filter towards Improved Model-Based Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model-based filtering is often carried out while subject to an imperfect model, as learning partially-observable stochastic systems remains a challenge. Recent work on Bayesian inference found that tempering the likelihood or full posterior of an imperfect model can improve predictive accuracy, as measured by expected negative log likelihood. In this paper, we develop the tempered Bayes filter, improving estimation performance through both of the aforementioned, and one newly introduced, modalities. The result admits a recursive implementation with a computational complexity no higher than that of the original Bayes filter. Our analysis reveals that -- besides the well-known fact in the field of Bayesian inference that likelihood tempering affects the balance between prior and likelihood -- full-posterior tempering tunes the level of entropy in the final belief distribution. We further find that a region of the tempering space can be understood as interpolating between the Bayes- and MAP filters, recovering these as special cases. Analytical results further establish conditions under which a tempered Bayes filter achieves improved predictive performance. Specializing the results to the linear Gaussian case, we obtain the tempered Kalman filter. In this context, we interpret how the parameters affect the Kalman state estimate and covariance propagation. Empirical results confirm that our method consistently improves predictive accuracy over the Bayes filter baseline.</description>

      <title>PAC-Bayesian Optimal Control with Stability and Generalization Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic Nonlinear Optimal Control (SNOC) seeks to minimize a cost function that accounts for random disturbances acting on a nonlinear dynamical system. Since the expectation over all disturbances is generally intractable, a common surrogate is the empirical cost, obtained by averaging over a finite dataset of sampled noise realizations. This substitution, however, introduces the challenge of guaranteeing performance under unseen disturbances. The issue is particularly severe when the dataset is limited, as the trained controllers may overfit, leading to substantial gaps between their empirical cost and the deployment cost. In this work, we develop a PAC-Bayesian framework that establishes rigorous generalization bounds for SNOC. Building on these bounds, we propose a principled controller design method that balances empirical performance and prior knowledge. To ensure tractability, we derive computationally efficient relaxations of the bounds and employ approximate inference methods. Our framework further leverages expressive neural controller parameterizations, guaranteeing closed-loop stability. Through simulated examples, we highlight how prior knowledge can be incorporated into control design and how more reliable controllers can be synthesized for cooperative robotics.</description>

Abstract: This letter proposes an AC/DC frequency-dependent power flow Jacobian analysis to identify the system support capabilities. In addition, the analyses reveal that system support capabilities do not necessarily enhance the system stability margin, suggesting that technical requirements of narrow-frequency-band and AC-side focused specifications may not lead to the expected performance of GFM.</description>

      <title>Statistical-Symbolic Verification of Perception-Based Autonomous Systems using State-Dependent Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reachability analysis has been a prominent way to provide safety guarantees for neurally controlled autonomous systems, but its direct application to neural perception components is infeasible due to imperfect or intractable perception models. Typically, this issue has been bypassed by complementing reachability with statistical analysis of perception error, say with conformal prediction (CP). However, existing CP methods for time-series data often provide conservative bounds. The corresponding error accumulation over time has made it challenging to combine statistical bounds with symbolic reachability in a way that is provable, scalable, and minimally conservative. To reduce conservatism and improve scalability, our key insight is that perception error varies significantly with the system's dynamical state. This article proposes state-dependent conformal prediction, which exploits that dependency in constructing tight high-confidence bounds on perception error. Based on this idea, we provide an approach to partition the state space, using a genetic algorithm, so as to optimize the tightness of conformal bounds. Finally, since using these bounds in reachability analysis leads to additional uncertainty and branching in the resulting hybrid system, we propose a branch-merging reachability algorithm that trades off uncertainty for scalability so as to enable scalable and tight verification. The evaluation of our verification methodology on two complementary case studies demonstrates reduced conservatism compared to the state of the art.</description>

      <title>GNSS Array-Based Multipath Detection Employing UKF on Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) applications are often hindered by various sources of error, with multipath interference being one of the most challenging, particularly in urban environments. In this work, we build on previous research by implementing a GNSS array-based multipath detection algorithm, incorporating real-time attitude estimation for dynamic scenarios. The method fuses GNSS and IMU data using an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) on a manifold, enabling continuous attitude tracking. The proposed approach utilizes attitude information from satellite combinations to identify and exclude multipath-affected satellites, improving the accuracy of both positioning and attitude determination. To address computational challenges associated with evaluating large numbers of satellite combinations, we propose the use of the Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm, which reduces the number of combinations assessed while maintaining high detection performance. Performance evaluations are conducted using trajectories and IMU readings from the KITTI dataset. GNSS observations are simulated based on ground truth positions and satellite ephemeris. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in detecting satellites affected by multipath interference. Significant improvements in positioning accuracy are observed, particularly in scenarios where a large portion of the visible satellites are contaminated by severe multipath.</description>

      <title>Learning Physically Consistent Lagrangian Control Models Without Acceleration Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article investigates the modeling and control of Lagrangian systems involving non-conservative forces using a hybrid method that does not require acceleration calculations. It focuses in particular on the derivation and identification of physically consistent models, which are essential for model-based control synthesis. Lagrangian or Hamiltonian neural networks provide useful structural guarantees but the learning of such models often leads to inconsistent models, especially on real physical systems where training data are limited, partial and noisy. Motivated by this observation and the objective to exploit these models for model-based nonlinear control, a learning algorithm relying on an original loss function is proposed to improve the physical consistency of Lagrangian systems. A comparative analysis of different learning-based modeling approaches with the proposed solution shows significant improvements in terms of physical consistency of the learned models, on both simulated and experimental systems. The model's consistency is then exploited to demonstrate, on an experimental benchmark, the practical relevance of the proposed methodology for feedback linearization and energy-based control techniques.</description>

      <title>Robust Geospatial Coordination of Multi-Agent Communications Networks Under Attrition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast, efficient, robust communication during wildfire and other emergency responses is critical. One way to achieve this is by coordinating swarms of autonomous aerial vehicles carrying communications equipment to form an ad-hoc network connecting emergency response personnel to both each other and central command. However, operating in such extreme environments may lead to individual networking agents being damaged or rendered inoperable, which could bring down the network and interrupt communications.
  To overcome this challenge and enable multi-agent UAV networking in difficult environments, this paper introduces and formalizes the problem of Robust Task Networking Under Attrition (RTNUA), which extends connectivity maintenance in multi-robot systems to explicitly address proactive redundancy and attrition recovery. We introduce Physics-Informed Robust Employment of Multi-Agent Networks ($\Phi$IREMAN), a topological algorithm leveraging physics-inspired potential fields to solve this problem. Through simulation across 25 problem configurations, $\Phi$IREMAN consistently outperforms the DCCRS baseline, and on large-scale problems with up to 100 tasks and 500 drones, maintains $&gt;99.9\%$ task uptime despite substantial attrition, demonstrating both effectiveness and scalability.</description>

      <title>The xApp Store: A Framework for xApp Onboarding and Deployment in O-RAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 5G and beyond mobile telecommunication networks are increasingly embracing software technologies in their operation and control, similar to what has powered the growth of the cloud. This is most recently seen in the radio access network (RAN). In this new approach, the RAN is increasingly controlled by software applications known as xApps, and opens the door to third party development of xApps bringing diversity to the ecosystem, similar to mobile phone apps. This model aligns closely with the controllers in the ITU-T architecture for autonomous networks, and provides a pathway towards autonomous operation in the RAN. Unfortunately, no marketplace to host or supply xApps currently exists.
  This work describes our experiences in leveraging open-source O-RAN implementations to design and develop an xApp store.</description>

      <title>Double-Helix based Real-Time Single Particle Tracking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Real-Time, Feedback-Driven Single Particle Tracking methods, measurements of the emission intensity from a labeled, nanometer-scale particle are used in a feedback loop to track the motion of the particle as it moves inside its native environment, including within living cells. In this work, we take advantage of Point Spread Function (PSF) engineering techniques that encode the axial position of the particle into the shape of the PSF in the focal plane to eliminate the need for out-of-focal-plane measurements, reducing the complexity of implementation and decreasing the overall measurement time of the control loop. Specifically, we used the Double Helix PSF (DH-PSF) in which a single fluorescent source gives rise to two lobes in the image plane with the lobes rotating in the plane as the particle moves along the optical axis. We designed simple estimators of the relative error between the particle and the tracker, and a simple proportional feedback controller to regulate that error to zero. We explored the efficacy of the approach through simulation studies, demonstrating the tracking of fast-moving particles (with diffusion coefficients up to 10 {\mu\text{m}^2/\text{s}}) over long time periods (multiple seconds).</description>

      <title>Quick Updates for the Perturbed Static Output Feedback Control Problem in Linear Systems with Applications to Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16178v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a method for efficiently updating a nominal stabilizing static output feedback (SOF) controller in perturbed linear systems. As operating points and state-space matrices change in dynamic systems, accommodating updates to the SOF controller are necessary. Traditional methods address such changes by re-solving for the updated SOF gain, which is often (i) computationally expensive due to the NP-hard nature of the problem or (ii) infeasible due to the limitations of its semidefinite programming relaxations. To overcome this, we leverage the concept of minimum destabilizing real perturbation (MDRP) to formulate a norm minimization problem that yields fast, reliable controller updates. This approach accommodates a variety of known perturbations, including abrupt changes, model inaccuracies, and equilibrium-dependent linearizations. We remark that the application of our proposed approach is limited to the class of SOF controllers in perturbed linear systems. We also introduce geometric metrics to quantify the proximity to instability and rigorously define stability-guaranteed regions. Extensive numerical simulations validate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed method. Moreover, such extensive numerical simulations corroborate that although we utilize a heuristic optimization method to compute the MDRP, it performs quite well in practice compared to an existing approximation method in the literature, namely the hybrid expansion-contraction (HEC) method. We demonstrate the results on the SOF control of multi-machine power networks with changing operating points, and demonstrate that the computed quick updates produce comparable solutions to the traditional SOF ones, while requiring orders of magnitude less computational time.</description>

      <title>Convex Computations for Controlled Safety Invariant Sets of Black-box Discrete-time Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01638v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying controlled safety invariant sets (CSISs) is essential for safety-critical systems. This paper addresses the problem of computing CSISs for black-box discrete-time systems, where the dynamics are unknown and only limited simulation data are available. Traditionally, a CSIS requires that for every state in the set, there exists a control input that keeps the system within the set at the next step. However, enforcing such universal invariance, i.e., requiring the set to remain controlled invariant for all states, is often overly restrictive or impractical for black-box systems. To address this, we introduce the notion of a Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) CSIS, in which, with prescribed confidence, there exists a suitable control input to keep the system within the set at the next step for at least a specified fraction of the states. Our approach leverages barrier functions and scenario optimization, yielding a tractable linear programming method for estimating PAC CSISs. Several illustrative examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>A Switched Systems Approach to Image-Based Feature Tracking for Autonomous Satellite Inspection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an information-based guidance and control architecture for an autonomous deputy spacecraft tasked with inspecting a chief satellite in orbit. The primary objective is for the deputy spacecraft to maximize information gain while tracking features on the chief satellite. The deputy spacecraft needs to respect various constraints such as illumination, field-of-view (FOV), fuel limitations, and avoidance regions. Additionally, the absence of GPS information poses a significant challenge for relative localization within the space environment. To learn the structure of the chief satellite while achieving relative self-localization and maximizing the information gain, this paper integrates a memory regression extension (MRE)-based distance observer with an information-maximizing adaptive controller. The distance observer utilizes feedback from a camera. A switched systems approach is used to determine the minimum dwell time required for a feature to remain within the FOV of the camera to ensure accurate estimation. A k-means clustering algorithm acts as a high-level planner to intermittently generate goal locations that guide the deputy spacecraft toward the nearest cluster of uninspected points on the chief satellite, subject to illumination and FOV constraints. A Lyapunov-based stability analysis is conducted to analyze the developed architecture, and simulation results validate the theoretical results of the paper.</description>

      <title>Dissipativity-Based Synthesis of Distributed Control and Communication Topology Co-Design for AC Microgrids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06576v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a dissipativity-based framework for the joint design of distributed controllers and communication topologies in AC microgrids (MGs), providing robust performance guarantees for voltage regulation, frequency synchronization, and proportional power sharing across distributed generators (DGs). The closed-loop AC MG is represented as a networked system in which DGs, distribution lines, and loads function as interconnected subsystems linked through cyber-physical networks. Each DG utilizes a three-layer hierarchical control structure: a steady-state controller for operating point configuration, a local feedback controller for voltage tracking, and a distributed droop-free controller implementing normalized power consensus for frequency coordination and proportional power distribution. The operating point design is formulated as an optimization problem. Leveraging dissipativity theory, we derive necessary and sufficient subsystem dissipativity conditions. The global co-design is then cast as a convex linear matrix inequality (LMI) optimization that jointly determines distributed controller parameters and sparse communication architecture while managing the highly nonlinear, coupled dq-frame dynamics characteristic of AC systems.</description>

      <title>Observer Design for Networked Linear Systems with Fast and Slow Dynamics under Measurement Noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16469v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the emulation-based observer design for networked control systems (NCS) with linear plants that operate at two time scales in the presence of measurement noise. The system is formulated as a hybrid singularly perturbed dynamical system, enabling the systematic use of singular perturbation techniques to derive explicit bounds on the maximum allowable transmission intervals (MATI) for both fast and slow communication channels. Under the resulting conditions, the proposed observer guarantees that the estimation error satisfies a global exponential derivative-input-to-state stability (DISS)-like property, where the ultimate bound scales proportionally with the magnitudes of the measurement noise and the time derivative of the control input. The effectiveness of the approach is illustrated through a numerical example.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the problem of quantized distributed estimation with event-triggered communication and packet loss, aiming to reduce the number of transmitted bits. The main challenge lies in the inability to differentiate between an untriggered event and a packet loss occurrence. This paper proposes an event-triggered distributed estimation algorithm with quantized communication and quantized measurement, in which it introduces a one-bit information reconstruction method to deal with packet loss. The almost sure convergence and convergence rate of the proposed algorithm are established. Besides, it is demonstrated that the global average communication bit-rate decreases to zero over time. Moreover, the trade-off between communication rate and convergence rate is revealed, providing guidance for designing the communication rate required to achieve the algorithm's convergence rate. A numerical example is supplied to validate the findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Microelectronic devices in modern systems are working continuously for prolonged periods of many years. Thus, there is a crucial need for reliability model that will enable us to predict precisely the life cycle of the device and point out on the governing failure mechanisms that are responsible for degradation and failure. This is even more important when high power and frequency devices, especially Normally Off Switch Power transistors are concerned, since the reliability research on those devices lay far behind that of low power digital devices. Our main goal in our lab is to investigate the failure mechanisms of GaN transistors, aimed at determining the reliability factors of the innovative MTOL model. The main goal is to understand the reason for the transformation of the failure mechanism. Employing the recorded data may enable us to predict the performance and life time of the device at different operation parameters such as current, voltage, frequency and temperatures. In this study we employ a new different use for the well-known boost convertor circuit, based on GaN Devices in order to stress the transistor to the maximum values of voltage and current which allows us to examine the reliability of the transistor and accelerating Hot Carrier And Trap Generation failures mechanisms. The acceleration of the failure mechanism should be done in a way that will not affect the electronic device detrimentally and on the other hand we would not need to wait a long time in order to observe the degradation. In this work we will present our new boost converter circuit based on high power GaN HEMT.</description>

      <title>Ergodic-risk Criterion for Stochastically Stabilizing Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10767v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces ergodic-risk criteria, which capture long-term cumulative risks associated with controlled Markov chains through probabilistic limit theorems--in contrast to existing methods that require assumptions of either finite hitting time, finite state/action space, or exponentiation necessitating light-tailed distributions. Using tailored Functional Central Limit Theorems (FCLT), we demonstrate that the time-correlated terms in the ergodic-risk criteria converge under uniform ergodicity and establish conditions for the convergence of these criteria in non-stationary general-state Markov chains involving heavy-tailed distributions. For quadratic risk functionals on stochastic linear systems, in addition to internal stability, this requires the (possibly heavy-tailed) process noise to have only a finite fourth moment. After quantifying cumulative uncertainties in risk functionals that account for extreme deviations, these ergodic-risk criteria are then incorporated into policy optimizations, thereby extending the standard average optimal synthesis to a risk-sensitive framework. Finally, by establishing the strong duality of the constrained policy optimization, we propose a primal-dual algorithm that optimizes average performance while ensuring that certain risks associated with these ergodic-risk criteria are constrained. Our risk-sensitive framework offers a theoretically guaranteed policy iteration for the long-term risk-sensitive control of processes involving heavy-tailed noise, which is shown to be effective through several simulations.</description>

Abstract: Constrained decision-making is essential for designing safe policies in real-world control systems, yet simulated environments often fail to capture real-world adversities. We consider the problem of learning a policy that will maximize the cumulative reward while satisfying a constraint, even when there is a mismatch between the real model and an accessible simulator/nominal model. In particular, we consider the robust constrained Markov decision problem (RCMDP) where an agent needs to maximize the reward and satisfy the constraint against the worst possible stochastic model under the uncertainty set centered around an unknown nominal model. Primal-dual methods, effective for standard constrained MDP (CMDP), are not applicable here because of the lack of the strong duality property. Further, one cannot apply the standard robust value-iteration based approach on the composite value function either as the worst case models may be different for the reward value function and the constraint value function. We propose a novel technique that effectively minimizes the constraint value function--to satisfy the constraints; on the other hand, when all the constraints are satisfied, it can simply maximize the robust reward value function. We prove that such an algorithm finds a policy with at most $\epsilon$ sub-optimality and feasible policy after $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ iterations. In contrast to the state-of-the-art method, we do not need to employ a binary search, thus, we reduce the computation time by at least 4x for smaller value of discount factor ($\gamma$) and by at least 6x for larger value of $\gamma$.</description>

      <title>Autocratic strategies in Cournot oligopoly game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16038</link>

Abstract: An oligopoly is a market in which the price of goods is controlled by a few firms. Cournot introduced the simplest game-theoretic model of oligopoly, where profit-maximizing behavior of each firm results in market failure. Furthermore, when the Cournot oligopoly game is infinitely repeated, firms can tacitly collude to monopolize the market. Such tacit collusion is realized by the same mechanism as direct reciprocity in the repeated prisoner's dilemma game, where mutual cooperation can be realized whereas defection is favorable for both prisoners in a one-shot game. Recently, in the repeated prisoner's dilemma game, a class of strategies called zero-determinant strategies attracts much attention in the context of direct reciprocity. Zero-determinant strategies are autocratic strategies which unilaterally control payoffs of players by enforcing linear relationships between payoffs. There were many attempts to find zero-determinant strategies in other games and to extend them so as to apply them to broader situations. In this paper, first, we show that zero-determinant strategies exist even in the repeated Cournot oligopoly game, and that they are quite different from those in the repeated prisoner's dilemma game. Especially, we prove that a fair zero-determinant strategy exists, which is guaranteed to obtain the average payoff of the opponents. Second, we numerically show that the fair zero-determinant strategy can be used to promote collusion when it is used against an adaptively learning player, whereas it cannot promote collusion when it is used against two adaptively learning players. Our findings elucidate some negative impact of zero-determinant strategies in the oligopoly market.</description>

      <title>Fast 3D Surrogate Modeling for Data Center Thermal Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reducing energy consumption and carbon emissions in data centers by enabling real-time temperature prediction is critical for sustainability and operational efficiency. Achieving this requires accurate modeling of the 3D temperature field to capture airflow dynamics and thermal interactions under varying operating conditions. Traditional thermal CFD solvers, while accurate, are computationally expensive and require expert-crafted meshes and boundary conditions, making them impractical for real-time use. To address these limitations, we develop a vision-based surrogate modeling framework that operates directly on a 3D voxelized representation of the data center, incorporating server workloads, fan speeds, and HVAC temperature set points. We evaluate multiple architectures, including 3D CNN U-Net variants, a 3D Fourier Neural Operator, and 3D vision transformers, to map these thermal inputs to high-fidelity heat maps. Our results show that the surrogate models generalize across data center configurations and significantly speed up computations (20,000x), from hundreds of milliseconds to hours. This fast and accurate estimation of hot spots and temperature distribution enables real-time cooling control and workload redistribution, leading to substantial energy savings (7\%) and reduced carbon footprint.</description>

      <title>Sequential Convex Programming for Multimode Spacecraft Trajectory Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19505v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spacecraft equipped with multiple propulsion modes or systems can offer enhanced performance and mission flexibility compared with traditional configurations. Despite these benefits, the trajectory optimization of spacecraft utilizing such configurations remains a complex challenge. This paper presents a sequential convex programming (SCP) approach for the optimal design of multi-mode and multi-propulsion spacecraft trajectories. The method extends the dynamical linearization within SCP using sparse automatic differentiation, enabling efficient inclusion of multiple propulsion modes or systems without complex manual reformulation while maintaining comparable computational efficiency. New constraint formulations are introduced to ensure selection of a single propulsion mode at each time step and limit the total number of modes used. The approach is demonstrated for (i) a low-thrust Earth-67P rendezvous using the SPT-140 thruster with 20 discrete modes, and (ii) an Earth-Mars transfer employing both a low-thrust engine and a solar sail. Results confirm that the proposed method can efficiently compute optimal trajectories for these scenarios.</description>

      <title>Data-Efficient Motor Condition Monitoring with Time Series Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motor condition monitoring is essential for ensuring system reliability and preventing catastrophic failures. However, data-driven diagnostic methods often suffer from sparse fault labels and severe class imbalance, which limit their effectiveness in real-world applications. This paper proposes a motor condition monitoring framework that leverages the general features learned during pre-training of two time series foundation models, MOMENT and Mantis, to address these challenges. By transferring broad temporal representations from large-scale pre-training, the proposed approach significantly reduces dependence on labeled data while maintaining high diagnostic accuracy. Experimental results show that MOMENT achieves nearly twice the performance of conventional deep learning models using only 1% of the training data, whereas Mantis surpasses state-of-the-art baselines by 22%, reaching 90% accuracy with the same data ratio. These results demonstrate the strong generalization and data efficiency of time series foundation models in fault diagnosis, providing new insights into scalable and adaptive frameworks for intelligent motor condition monitoring.</description>
