      <title>On the First-Passage Time Fluctuation Theorem in Complex Biomolecular Networks</title>

Abstract: A fluctuation theorem is examined for the first-passage time of a biomolecular machine in a nonequilibrium steady-state. For such machines in which the driven, observable process is coupled to a hidden process in a kinetically cooperative fashion, the entropy produced along first-passage trajectories is no longer uniform, resulting in a breakdown of this relation. Here, we consider the canonical model for this type of system, a kinetic scheme for conformation-modulated single-enzyme catalysis, as we (i) determine the circumstances under which this fluctuation theorem can be restored; (ii) assess what its violation reveals about the hidden dynamics; and (iii) characterize the general form of the deviation from this relation. Kinetic evaluations are performed using a novel, efficient pathway analysis technique, allowing us to attain some surprising and fairly straightforward results from relatively complex calculations. We find that in the absence of hidden current, a fluctuation theorem can be written for the first-passage time of the observable process, and we demonstrate that this is a general feature applicable to a wide variety of complex networks. The validity of this relation can be experimentally tested, with its violation serving as a signature of hidden detailed balance breaking. In addition, we obtain a remarkably compact exact expression for the integrated correction to this first-passage time fluctuation theorem, which indicates that the kinetic branching ratio, defined as the ratio of the forward observable process probability to the backward one, is bounded by the entropy production associated with the first-passage work (i.e., the work applied along a first-passage trajectory). These results provide detailed insight into the rich connections between dynamic measurements and the underlying nonequilibrium thermodynamics in complex biomolecular networks.</description>

      <title>A unified model for the origins of spongiform degeneration and other neuropathological features in prion diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16678</link>

Abstract: Decades after their initial observation in prion-infected brain tissues, the identities of virus-like dense particles, varicose tubules, and oval bodies containing parallel bands and fibrils have remained elusive. Our recent work revealed that a phenotype of dilation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), most notable for the perinuclear space (PNS), contributes to spongiform degeneration. To assess the significance of this phenotype for the etiology of prion diseases, we explored whether it can be functionally linked to other neuropathological hallmarks observed in these diseases, as this would indicate it to be a central event. Having surveyed the neuropathological record and other distant literature niches, we propose a model in which pathogenic forms of the prion protein poison raft domains, including essential Na+, K+-ATPases (NKAs) embedded within them, thereby triggering an ER-centered cellular rescue program coordinated by the unfolded protein response (UPR). The execution of this program stalls general protein synthesis, causing the deterioration of synaptic spines. As the disease progresses, cells selectively increase sterol biosynthesis, along with ribosome and ER biogenesis. These adaptive rescue attempts cause morphological changes to the ER which manifest as ER dilation or ER hypertrophy in a manner that is influenced by Ca2+ influx into the cell. The nuclear-to-cytoplasmic transport of mRNAs and tRNAs interrupts in late stage disease, thereby depriving ribosomes of supplies and inducing them to aggregate into a paracrystalline form. In support of this model, we share previously reported data, whose features are consistent with the interpretation that 1) the phenotype of ER dilation is observed in major prion diseases, 2) varicose tubules and oval bodies represent ER hypertrophy, and 3) virus-like dense particles are paracrystalline aggregates of inactive ribosomes.</description>
