      <title>Dynamic Skewness in Stochastic Volatility Models: A Penalized Prior Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Financial time series often exhibit skewness and heavy tails, making it essential to use models that incorporate these characteristics to ensure greater reliability in the results. Furthermore, allowing temporal variation in the skewness parameter can bring significant gains in the analysis of this type of series. However, for more robustness, it is crucial to develop models that balance flexibility and parsimony. In this paper, we propose dynamic skewness stochastic volatility models in the SMSN family (DynSSV-SMSN), using priors that penalize model complexity. Parameter estimation was carried out using the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) method via the \texttt{RStan} package. Simulation results demonstrated that penalizing priors present superior performance in several scenarios compared to the classical choices. In the empirical application to returns of cryptocurrencies, models with heavy tails and dynamic skewness provided a better fit to the data according to the DIC, WAIC, and LOO-CV information criteria.</description>

      <title>A 4% withdrawal rate for retirement spending, derived from a discrete-time model of stochastic returns on assets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: What grounds the rule of thumb that a(n American) retiree can safely withdraw 4% of their initial retirement wealth in their first year of retirement, then increase that rate of consumption with inflation? I investigate that question with a discrete-time model of returns to a retirement portfolio consumed at a rate that grows by $s$ per period. The model hinges on the parameter $\gamma$, an $s$-adjusted rate of return to wealth, derived from the first 2-4 moments of the portfolio's probability distribution of returns; for a retirement lasting $t$ periods the model recommends a rate of consumption of $\gamma / (1 - (1 - \gamma)^t)$. Estimation of $\gamma$ (and hence of the implied rate of spending down in retirement) reveals that the 4% rule emerges from adjusting high expected rates of return down for: consumption growth, the variance in (and kurtosis of) returns to wealth, the longevity risk of a retiree potentially underestimating $t$, and the inclusion of bonds in retirement portfolios without leverage. The model supports leverage of retirement portfolios dominated by the S&amp;P 500, with leverage ratios $&gt; 1.6$ having been historically optimal under the model's approximations. Historical simulations of 30-year retirements suggest that the model proposes withdrawal rates having roughly even odds of success, that leverage greatly improves those odds for stocks-heavy portfolios, and that investing on margin could have allowed safe withdrawal rates $&gt; 6$% per year.</description>
