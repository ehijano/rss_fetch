      <title>Model reduction of convection-dominated viscous conservation laws using implicit feature tracking and landmark image registration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reduced-order models (ROMs) remain generally unreliable for convection-dominated problems, such as those encountered in hypersonic flows, due to the slowly decaying Kolmogorov $n$-width of linear subspace approximations, known as the Kolmogorov barrier. This limitation hinders the accuracy of traditional ROMs and necessitates impractical amounts of training data during the offline phase. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel landmark-based registration procedure tailored for ROMs of convection-dominated problems. Our approach leverages limited training data and incorporates a nonlinear transformation of the data using a landmark-based registration technique combined with radial basis function (RBF) interpolation. During the offline phase, we align dominant convective features in a reference domain, resulting in a rapid decay of error relative to the reduced space dimension. Landmarks are generated through a three-step process: (1) detecting shocks via edge detection techniques, (2) sampling using Monte Carlo methods, and (3) domain partitioning with $k$-means clustering, where cluster centroids serve as landmarks. Accurate landmark correspondence is achieved by minimizing pairing distances for similar features. The online phase integrates standard minimum-residual ROM methodologies, extending the optimization space to include admissible domain mappings. We validate our approach on two test cases: a space-time Burgers' equation parameterized by the initial condition, and a hypersonic viscous flow over a cylinder parameterized by the Mach number. Results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in overcoming the Kolmogorov barrier and enhancing the reliability of ROMs for convection-dominated problems.</description>

      <title>Samplets: Wavelet concepts for scattered data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter is dedicated to recent developments in the field of wavelet analysis for scattered data. We introduce the concept of samplets, which are signed measures of wavelet type and may be defined on sets of arbitrarily distributed data sites in possibly high dimension. By employing samplets, we transfer well-known concepts known from wavelet analysis, namely the fast basis transform, data compression, operator compression and operator arithmetics to scattered data problems. Especially, samplet matrix compression facilitates the rapid solution of scattered data interpolation problems, even for kernel functions with nonlocal support. Finally, we demonstrate that sparsity constraints for scattered data approximation problems become meaningful and can efficiently be solved in samplet coordinates.</description>

      <title>The Akhiezer iteration and an inverse-free solver for Sylvester matrix equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An inverse-free iterative method is developed for solving Sylvester matrix equations when the spectra of the coefficient matrices are on, or near, known disjoint subintervals of the real axis. The method uses the recently-introduced Akhiezer iteration to address an equivalent problem of approximating the matrix sign function applied to a block matrix, resulting in a provable and computable geometric rate of convergence. When the right-hand side matrix is low rank, the method requires only low-rank matrix-matrix products. Relative to existing state-of-the-art approaches, the method presented here can be more efficient when the coefficient matrices are dense or otherwise costly to invert. Applications include solving partial differential equations and computing Fr\'echet derivatives.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Lagrangian Shock Hydrodynamics with Application to Stable Shock Acceleration of Density Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a gradient based optimization approach for the equations of compressible, Lagrangian hydrodynamics and demonstrate how it can be employed to automatically uncover strategies to control hydrodynamic instabilities arising from shock acceleration of density interfaces. Strategies for controlling the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability (RMI) are of great benefit for inertial confinement fusion (ICF) where shock interactions with many small imperfections in the density interface lead to instabilities which rapidly grow over time. These instabilities lead to mixing which, in the case of laser driven ICF, quenches the runaway fusion process ruining the potential for positive energy return. We demonstrate that control of these instabilities can be achieved by optimization of initial conditions with (&gt; 100) parameters. Optimizing over a large parameter space like this is not possible with gradient-free optimization strategies. This requires computation of the gradient of the outputs of a numerical solution to the equations of Lagrangian hydrodynamics with respect to the inputs. We show that the efficient computation of these gradients is made possible via a judicious application of (i) adjoint methods, the exact formal representation of sensitivities involving partial differential equations, and (ii) automatic differentiation (AD), the algorithmic calculation of derivatives of functions. Careful regularization of multiple operators including artificial viscosity and timestep control is required. We perform design optimization of &gt; 100 parameter energy field driving the Richtmyer Meshkov instability showing significant suppression while simultaneously enhancing the acceleration of the interface relative to a nominal baseline case.</description>

      <title>Network-Driven Global Stability Analysis: SVIRS Epidemic Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An epidemic Susceptible-Vaccinated-Infected-Removed-Susceptible (SVIRS) model is presented on a weighted-undirected network with graph Laplacian diffusion. Disease-free equilibrium always exists while the existence and uniqueness of endemic equilibrium have been shown. When the basic reproduction number is below unity, the disease-free equilibrium is asymptotically globally stable. The endemic equilibrium is asymptotically globally stable if the basic reproduction number is above unity. Numerical analysis is illustrated with a road graph of the state of Minnesota. The effect of all important model parameters has been discussed.</description>

      <title>Hardware Acceleration for HPS Algorithms in Two and Three Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a flexible, open-source framework for hardware acceleration, namely massively-parallel execution on general-purpose graphics processing units (GPUs), applied to the hierarchical Poincar\'e--Steklov (HPS) family of algorithms for building fast direct solvers for linear elliptic partial differential equations. To take full advantage of the power of hardware acceleration, we propose two variants of HPS algorithms to improve performance on two- and three-dimensional problems. In the two-dimensional setting, we introduce a novel recomputation strategy that minimizes costly data transfers to and from the GPU; in three dimensions, we modify and extend the adaptive discretization technique of Geldermans and Gillman [2019] to greatly reduce peak memory usage. We provide an open-source implementation of these methods written in JAX, a high-level accelerated linear algebra package, which allows for the first integration of a high-order fast direct solver with automatic differentiation tools. We conclude with extensive numerical examples showing our methods are fast and accurate on two- and three-dimensional problems.</description>

      <title>A Spherical Crank-Nicolson Integrator Based on the Exponential Map and the Spherical Linear Interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose implicit integrators for solving stiff differential equations on unit spheres. Our approach extends the standard backward Euler and Crank-Nicolson methods in Cartesian space by incorporating the geometric constraint inherent to the unit sphere without additional projection steps to enforce the unit length constraint on the solution. We construct these algorithms using the exponential map and spherical linear interpolation (SLERP) formula on the unit sphere. Specifically, we introduce a spherical backward Euler method, a projected backward Euler method, and a second-order symplectic spherical Crank-Nicolson method. While all methods require solving a system of nonlinear equations to advance the solution to the next time step, these nonlinear systems can be efficiently solved using Newton's iterations. We will present several numerical examples to demonstrate the effectiveness and convergence of these numerical schemes. These examples will illustrate the advantages of our proposed methods in accurately capturing the dynamics of stiff systems on unit spheres.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the class of Runge-Kutta type methods named Fractional HBVMs (FHBVMs) has been introduced for the numerical solution of initial value problems of fractional differential equations, and a corresponding Matlab software has been released. Though an error analysis has already been given, a corresponding linear stability analysis is still lacking. We here provide such an analysis, together with some improvements concerning the mesh selection. This latter has been implemented into a new version of the code, which is available on the web.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel method to approximate the mean field stochastic differential equation by means of approximating the density function via Fokker-Planck equation. We construct a well-posed truncated Fokker-Planck equation whose solution is an approximation to the density function of solution to the mean field stochastic differential equation. We also apply finite difference method to approximate the truncated Fokker-Planck equation and derive error estimates. We use the numerical density function to replace the true measure in mean field stochastic differential equation and set up a stochastic differential equation to approximate the mean field one. Meanwhile, we derive the corresponding error estimates. Finally, we present several numerical experiments to illustrate the theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>Weak Convergence Analysis for the Finite Element Approximation to Stochastic Allen-Cahn Equation Driven by Multiplicative White Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to study the optimal weak convergence order for the finite element approximation to a stochastic Allen-Cahn equation driven by multiplicative white noise. We first construct an auxiliary equation based on the splitting-up technique and derive prior estimates for the corresponding Kolmogorov equation and obtain the strong convergence order of 1 in time between the auxiliary and exact solutions. Then, we prove the optimal weak convergence order of the finite element approximation to the stochastic Allen-Cahn equation by deriving the weak convergence order between the finite element approximation and the auxiliary solution via the theory of Kolmogorov equation and Malliavin calculus. Finally, we present a numerical experiment to illustrate the theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>Accurate Error Estimates and Optimal Parameter Selection in Ewald Summation for Dielectrically Confined Coulomb Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dielectrically confined Coulomb systems are widely employed in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Despite extensive efforts in developing efficient and accurate algorithms for these systems, rigorous and accurate error estimates, which are crucial for optimal parameter selection for simulations, is still lacking. In this work, we present a rigorous error analysis in Ewald summation for electrostatic interactions in systems with two dielectric planar interfaces, where the polarization contribution is modeled by an infinitely reflected image charge series. Accurate error estimate is provided for the truncation error of image charge series, as well as decay rates of energy and force correction terms, as functions of system parameters such as vacuum layer thickness, dielectric contrasts, and image truncation levels. Extensive numerical tests conducted across several prototypical parameter settings validate our theoretical predictions. Additionally, our analysis elucidates the non-monotonic error convergence behavior observed in previous numerical studies. Finally, we provide an optimal parameter selection strategy derived from our theoretical insights, offering practical guidance for efficient and accurate MD simulations of dielectric-confined systems.</description>

      <title>A Simple Weak Galerkin Finite Element Method for a Class of Fourth-Order Problems in Fluorescence Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a simple numerical algorithm based on the weak Galerkin (WG) finite element method for a class of fourth-order problems in fluorescence tomography (FT), eliminating the need for stabilizer terms required in traditional WG methods. FT is an emerging, non-invasive 3D imaging technique that reconstructs images of fluorophore-tagged molecule distributions in vivo. By leveraging bubble functions as a key analytical tool, our method extends to both convex and non-convex elements in finite element partitions, representing a significant advancement over existing stabilizer-free WG methods. It overcomes the restrictive conditions of previous approaches, offering substantial advantages. The proposed method preserves a simple, symmetric, and positive definite structure. These advantages are confirmed by optimal-order error estimates in a discrete $H^2$ norm, demonstrating the effectiveness and accuracy of our approach. Numerical experiments further validate the efficiency and precision of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Randomized strong rank-revealing QR for column subset selection and low-rank matrix approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss a randomized strong rank-revealing QR factorization that effectively reveals the spectrum of a matrix $\textbf{M}$. This factorization can be used to address problems such as selecting a subset of the columns of $\textbf{M}$, computing its low-rank approximation, estimating its rank, or approximating its null space. Given a random sketching matrix $\pmb{\Omega}$ that satisfies the $\epsilon$-embedding property for a subspace within the range of $\textbf{M}$, the factorization relies on selecting columns that allow to reveal the spectrum via a deterministic strong rank-revealing QR factorization of $\textbf{M}^{sk} = \pmb{\Omega}\textbf{M}$, the sketch of $\textbf{M}$. We show that this selection leads to a factorization with strong rank-revealing properties, making it suitable for approximating the singular values of $\textbf{M}$.</description>

      <title>Error analysis for temporal second-order finite element approximations of axisymmetric mean curvature flow of genus-1 surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing studies on the convergence of numerical methods for curvature flows primarily focus on first-order temporal schemes. In this paper, we establish a novel error analysis for parametric finite element approximations of genus-1 axisymmetric mean curvature flow, formulated using two classical second-order time-stepping methods: the Crank-Nicolson method and the BDF2 method. Our results establish optimal error bounds in both the L^2-norm and H^1-norm, along with a superconvergence result in the H^1-norm for each fully discrete approximation. Finally, we perform convergence experiments to validate the theoretical findings and present numerical simulations for various genus-1 surfaces. Through a series of comparative experiments, we also demonstrate that the methods proposed in this paper exhibit significant mesh advantages.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the application of a high order symplectic method in Shardlow's method for dissipative particle dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the efficiency and reliability of the modified Shardlow's (M-Shardlow) method for dissipative particle dynamics (DPD). We show that the M-Shardlow method in which for its construction, the second order velocity Verlet method in the Shardlows method to integrate the Hamiltonian part has been replaced by a symplectic fourth order method, improperly uses some parameters. %In other words, in this paper, it is shown that the initial M-Shardlow method employed some parameters improperly in the fourth order symplectic method that was used for the M-Shardlow method. By numerical experiments and computing, some important configurational quantities such as configurational temperature and radial distribution function (RDF), the M-Shardlow's method is compared with the Shardlow and ABOBA methods. These results indicate that the new method obtained in this way, even with the proper parameters is too costly in the sense of the CPU-time that is required per each step which makes it an inefficient DPD integrator. Besides, by a comparison of the radial distribution function of this method with Shardlow and ABOBA for large time increments, we can observe no considerable improvement in preserving the structure of the system by this new DPD solver.</description>

      <title>A filtered two-step variational integrator for charged-particle dynamics in a normal or strong magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is concerned with a new filtered two-step variational integrator for solving the charged-particle dynamics in a mildly non-homogeneous normal or strong magnetic field with a dimensionless parameter $\epsilon$ inversely proportional to the strength of the magnetic field. In the case of a normal magnetic field ($\epsilon \approx 1$), second-order error bounds and long time energy and momentum conservations are obtained. Moreover, the proof of the long-term analysis is accomplished by the backward error analysis. For the strong magnetic field ($0&lt;\epsilon \ll1$), this paper clarifies the behaviour of the filtered variational integrator for both a large stepsize $h^2 \geq \epsilon$ and a smaller stepsize $ h \sim \epsilon$. The approach to analysing the error bounds for these two stepsizes is based on comparing the modulated Fourier expansions of the exact and the numerical solutions. It is shown that the proposed integrator achieves a second-order accuracy $\mathcal{O}(h^2)$ in the position and in the parallel velocity for a large step size and an $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon)$ accuracy for a smaller stepsize. This paper also yields the long time energy and magnetic moment conservations for the strong magnetic field by developing the modulated Fourier expansion of the proposed scheme. All the theoretical results of the error behaviour and long-term conservations are numerically demonstrated by two numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>On the best accuracy using the $h$-adaptive finite element refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In \cite{liu2022practical}, a general algorithm is developed to efficiently obtain the best accuracy using the regular refinement. The adaptive refinement allows for obtaining an accuracy with a smaller number of DoFs compared with the regular refinement. In this paper, we investigate the best accuracy when using the adaptive refinement. To this end, we study the evolution of the truncation error and the round-off error using the adaptive refinement. For the former, a new threshold for the selection of the number of elements to be refined is proposed. For the latter, the round-off error is quantified using the method proposed in \cite{liu2022practical}. Moreover, for achieving a tolerance, we propose to use the line of the round-off error as a stopping criterion.</description>

      <title>Maximum Bound Principle and Bound Preserving ETD schemes for a Phase-Field Model of Tumor Growth with Extracellular Matrix Degradation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In cancer research, the role of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and its associated matrix-degrading enzyme (MDE) has been a significant area of focus. This study presents a numerical algorithm designed to simulate a previously established tumor model that incorporates various biological factors, including tumor cells, viable cells, necrotic cells, and the dynamics of MDE and ECM. The model consists of a system that includes a phase field equation, two reaction-diffusion equations, and two ordinary differential equations. We employ the fast exponential time differencing Runge-Kutta (ETDRK) method with stabilizing terms to solve this system, resulting in a decoupled, explicit, linear numerical algorithm. The objective of this algorithm is to preserve the physical properties of the model variables, including the maximum bound principle (MBP) for nutrient concentration and MDE volume fraction, as well as bound preserving for ECM density and tumor volume fraction. We perform simulations of 2D and 3D tumor models {and discuss how different biological components impact growth dynamics. These simulations may help predict tumor evolution trends, offer insights for related biological and medical research,} potentially reduce the number and cost of experiments, and improve research efficiency.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-optimal computational complexity of an adaptive stochastic Galerkin method with independently refined spatial meshes for elliptic partial differential equations is shown. The method takes advantage of multilevel structure in expansions of random diffusion coefficients and combines operator compression in the stochastic variables with error estimation using finite element frames in space. A new operator compression strategy is introduced for nonlinear coefficient expansions, such as diffusion coefficients with log-affine structure.</description>

      <title>Least-Squares Finite Element Methods for nonlinear problems: A unified framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a unified Least-Squares framework for solving nonlinear partial differential equations by recasting the governing system as a residual minimization problem. A Least-Squares functional is formulated and the corresponding Gauss-Newton iterative method derived, which approximates simultaneously primal and stress-like variables. We derive conditions under which the Least-Squares functional is coercive and continuous in an appropriate solution space, and establish convergence results while demonstrating that the functional serves as a reliable a posteriori error estimator. This inherent error estimation property is then exploited to drive adaptive mesh refinement across a variety of problems, including the stationary heat equation with either temperature-dependent or discontinuous conductivity or a ReLU-type nonlinearity, nonlinear elasticity based on the Saint Venant-Kirchhoff model and sea-ice dynamics.</description>

      <title>Efficient QR-Based CP Decomposition Acceleration via Dimension Tree and Extrapolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The canonical polyadic (CP) decomposition is one of the most widely used tensor decomposition techniques. The conventional CP decomposition algorithm combines alternating least squares (ALS) with the normal equation. However, the normal equation is susceptible to numerical ill-conditioning, which can adversely affect the decomposition results. To mitigate this issue, ALS combined with QR decomposition has been proposed as a more numerically stable alternative. Although this method enhances stability, its iterative process involves tensor-times-matrix (TTM) operations, which typically result in higher computational costs. To reduce this cost, we propose branch reutilization of dimension tree, which increases the reuse of intermediate tensors and reduces the number of TTM operations. This strategy achieves a $33\%$ reduction in computational complexity for third and fourth order tensors. Additionally, we introduce a specialized extrapolation method in CP-ALS-QR algorithm, leveraging the unique structure of the matrix $\mathbf{Q}_0$ to further enhance convergence. By integrating both techniques, we develop a novel CP decomposition algorithm that significantly improves efficiency. Numerical experiments on five real-world datasets show that our proposed algorithm reduces iteration costs and enhances fitting accuracy compared to the CP-ALS-QR algorithm.</description>

Abstract: This work presents a framework for modeling three-dimensional scaffold-mediated bone regeneration and the associated optimization problem. By incorporating microstructure into the model through periodic homogenization, we capture the effects of microscale fluctuations on the bone growth process.

      <title>On two families of iterative methods without memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study two natural families of methods of order $n\ge 2$ that are useful for solving numerically one variable equations $f(x)=0.$ The first family consists on the methods that depend on $x,f(x)$ and its successive derivatives up to $f^{(n-1)}(x)$ and the second family comprises methods that depend on $x,g(x)$ until $g^{\circ n}(x),$ where $g^{\circ m}(x)=g(g^{\circ (m-1)}(x))$ and $g(x)=f(x)+x$. The first family includes the well-known Newton, Chebyshev, and Halley methods, while the second one contains the Steffensen method. Although the results for the first type of methods are well known and classical, we provide new, simple, detailed, and self-contained proofs.</description>

      <title>High-Order and Energy-Stable Implicit-Explicit Relaxation Runge-Kutta Schemes for Gradient Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18844v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a class of high-order and energy-stable implicit-explicit relaxation Runge-Kutta (IMEX RRK) schemes for solving the phase-field gradient flow models. By incorporating the scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) method, the original equations are reformulated into equivalent forms, and the modified energy is introduced. Then, based on the reformulated equations, we propose a kind of IMEX RRK methods, which are rigorously proved to preserve the energy dissipation law and achieve high-order accuracy for both Allen-Cahn and Cahn-Hilliard equations. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the theoretical results, including the accuracy of the approximate solution and the efficiency of the proposed scheme. Furthermore, the schemes are extended to multi-component gradient flows, with the vector-valued Allen-Cahn equations serving as a representative example.</description>

      <title>Fast and Accurate Interpolative Decompositions for General, Sparse, and Structured Tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we develop deterministic and random sketching-based algorithms for two types of tensor interpolative decompositions (ID): the core interpolative decomposition (CoreID, also known as the structure-preserving HOSVD) and the satellite interpolative decomposition (SatID, also known as the HOID or CURT). We adopt a new adaptive approach that leads to ID error bounds independent of the size of the tensor. In addition to the adaptive approach, we use tools from random sketching to enable an efficient and provably accurate calculation of these decompositions. We also design algorithms specialized to tensors that are sparse or given as a sum of rank-one tensors, i.e., in the CP format. Besides theoretical analyses, numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the power of the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Serinv: A Scalable Library for the Selected Inversion of Block-Tridiagonal with Arrowhead Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inversion of structured sparse matrices is a key but computationally and memory-intensive operation in many scientific applications. There are cases, however, where only particular entries of the full inverse are required. This has motivated the development of so-called selected-inversion algorithms, capable of computing only specific elements of the full inverse. Currently, most of them are either shared-memory codes or limited to CPU implementations. Here, we introduce Serinv, a scalable library providing distributed, GPU-based algorithms for the selected inversion and Cholesky decomposition of positive-definite, block-tridiagonal arrowhead matrices. This matrix class is highly relevant in statistical climate modeling and materials science applications. The performance of Serinv is demonstrated on synthetic and real datasets from statistical air temperature prediction models. In our numerical tests, Serinv achieves 32.3% strong and 47.2% weak scaling efficiency and up to two orders of magnitude speedup over the sparse direct solvers PARDISO and MUMPS on 16 GPUs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to present a new design for a pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) that is cryptographically secure, passes all of the usual statistical tests referenced in the literature and hence generates high quality random sequences, that is compact and easy to implement in practice, of portable design and offering reasonable execution times. Our procedure achieves those objectives through the use of a sequence of modular exponentiations followed by the application of Feistel-like boxes that mix up bits using a nonlinear function. The results of extensive statistical tests on sequences of about 2^40 bits in size generated by our algorithm are also presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a new probability sampling methods based on Langevin diffusion dynamics to resolve the problem of existing Monte Carlo algorithms when draw samples from high dimensional target densities. We extent Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin Diffusion algorithm by modelling the stochasticity of precondition matrix as a random matrix. An advantage compared to other proposal method is that it only requires the gradient of log-posterior. The proposed method provides fully adaptation mechanisms to tune proposal densities to exploits and adapts the geometry of local structures of statistical models. We clarify the benefits of the new proposal by modelling a Quantum Probability Density Functions of a free particle in a plane (energy Eigen-functions). The proposed model represents a remarkable improvement in terms of performance accuracy and computational time over standard MCMC method.</description>

      <title>Performance prediction of fully three-dimensional solid-state propulsion systems by eigenvalue problem decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A three-component plasma fluid model that considers the presence of electrons, positive ions, and negative ions consists of a nonlinear system of partial differential equations, incorporating numerous disparate time scales both spatially and temporally, and therefore, it is known to be challenging to solve. In this study, on the basis of the model, we develop an Anemone solver capable of numerically estimating the corona inception voltage and energy conversion efficiency in a three-dimensional solid-state electroaerodynamic propulsion system. In previous research, the discharge inception voltage and initial discharge region in the governing equations were obtained by solving a large-scale eigenvalue problem based on global stability analysis. However, in this study, we employ the method of characteristics to obtain the subproblem, transforming it into a large number of smaller-scale eigenvalue problems. Furthermore, we successfully converted these eigenvalue problems into integral equations, making them easier to handle. Finally, we validated the prediction results based on the theoretical results in a previous study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces HyperNOs, a PyTorch library designed to streamline and automate the process of exploring neural operators, with a special focus on hyperparameter optimization for comprehensive and exhaustive exploration. Indeed, HyperNOs takes advantage of state-of-the-art optimization algorithms and parallel computing implemented in the Ray-tune library to efficiently explore the hyperparameter space of neural operators. We also implement many useful functionalities for studying neural operators with a user-friendly interface, such as the possibility to train the model with a fixed number of parameters or to train the model with multiple datasets and different resolutions. We integrate Fourier neural operators and convolutional neural operators in our library, achieving state of the art results on many representative benchmarks, demonstrating the capabilities of HyperNOs to handle real datasets and modern architectures. The library is designed to be easy to use with the provided model and datasets, but also to be easily extended to use new datasets and custom neural operator architectures.</description>

      <title>Quantile-Based Randomized Kaczmarz for Corrupted Tensor Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reconstruction of tensor-valued signals from corrupted measurements, known as tensor regression, has become essential in many multi-modal applications such as hyperspectral image reconstruction and medical imaging. In this work, we address the tensor linear system problem $\mathcal{A} \mathcal{X}=\mathcal{B}$, where $\mathcal{A}$ is a measurement operator, $\mathcal{X}$ is the unknown tensor-valued signal, and $\mathcal{B}$ contains the measurements, possibly corrupted by arbitrary errors. Such corruption is common in large-scale tensor data, where transmission, sensory, or storage errors are rare per instance but likely over the entire dataset and may be arbitrarily large in magnitude. We extend the Kaczmarz method, a popular iterative algorithm for solving large linear systems, to develop a Quantile Tensor Randomized Kaczmarz (QTRK) method robust to large, sparse corruptions in the observations $\mathcal{B}$. This approach combines the tensor Kaczmarz framework with quantile-based statistics, allowing it to mitigate adversarial corruptions and improve convergence reliability. We also propose and discuss the Masked Quantile Randomized Kaczmarz (mQTRK) variant, which selectively applies partial updates to handle corruptions further. We present convergence guarantees, discuss the advantages and disadvantages of our approaches, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods through experiments, including an application for video deblurring.</description>

      <title>Matrix Pencil-Based Analysis of Multirate Simulation Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on multirate time-domain simulations of power system models. It proposes a matrix pencil-based approach to evaluate the spurious numerical deformation introduced to power system dynamics by a given multirate integration scheme. Moreover, it considers the problem of multirate partitioning and discusses a strategy for allocating state and algebraic variables to fast and slow subsystems based on modal participation factors (PFs). The suitability and features of the proposed approach are illustrated through numerical simulations that assess the accuracy effects of interfacing as well as of various prediction and solution methods.</description>

      <title>Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator for the Helmholtz problem with general wavenumbers on the $n$-sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the Helmholtz problem in the exterior of a ball with Dirichlet boundary conditions and radiation conditions imposed at infinity. The differential Helmholtz operator depends on the complex wavenumber with non-negative real part and is formulated for general spatial dimension. We prove wavenumber explicit continuity estimates of the corresponding Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) operator which are valid for all wavenumbers under consideration and do not deteriorate as they tend to zero.
  The exterior Helmholtz problem can be equivalently reformulated on a bounded domain with DtN boundary conditions on the artificial boundary of a ball. We derive wavenumber independent trace and Friedrichs-type inequalities for the solution space in wavenumber-indexed norms.</description>

      <title>Wavelet Galerkin Method for an Electromagnetic Scattering Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.06770v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Helmholtz equation with variable wavenumbers is challenging to solve numerically due to the pollution effect, which often results in a huge ill-conditioned linear system. In this paper, we present a high-order wavelet Galerkin method to numerically solve an electromagnetic scattering from a large cavity problem modeled by the 2D Helmholtz equation with variable wavenumbers. The high approximation order and the sparse linear system with uniformly bounded condition numbers offered by wavelets are useful in dealing with the pollution effect. Using the direct approach in [B. Han and M. Michelle, Appl. Comp. Harmon. Anal., 53 (2021), 270-331], we present various optimized spline biorthogonal wavelets on a bounded interval. We provide a self-contained proof to show that the tensor product of such wavelets forms a 2D Riesz wavelet in the appropriate Sobolev space. Compared to the coefficient matrix of the finite element method (FEM), when an iterative scheme is applied to the coefficient matrix of our wavelet Galerkin method, much fewer iterations are needed for the relative residuals to be within a tolerance level. Furthermore, for a given bounded variable wavenumber, the number of required iterations is practically independent of the size of the wavelet coefficient matrix, due to the small uniformly bounded condition numbers of such wavelets. In contrast, when an iterative scheme is applied to the FEM coefficient matrix, the number of required iterations doubles as the mesh size for each axis is halved. The implementation can also be done conveniently thanks to the simple structure, the refinability property, and the analytic expression of our wavelet bases.</description>

      <title>Nehari manifold optimization and its application for finding unstable solutions of semilinear elliptic PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09892v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Nehari manifold optimization method (NMOM) is introduced for finding 1-saddles, i.e., saddle points with the Morse index equal to one, of a generic nonlinear functional in Hilbert spaces. Actually, it is based on the variational characterization that 1-saddles of this functional are local minimizers of the same functional restricted on the associated Nehari manifold. The framework contains two important ingredients: one is the retraction mapping to make the iterative points always lie on the Nehari manifold; the other is the tangential search direction to decrease the functional with suitable step-size search rules. Particularly, the global convergence is rigorously established by virtue of some crucial analysis techniques (including a weak convergence method) that overcome difficulties in the infinite-dimensional setting. In practice, combining with an easy-to-implement Nehari retraction and the negative Riemannian gradient direction, the NMOM is successfully applied to compute the unstable ground-state solutions of a class of typical semilinear elliptic PDEs, such as the stationary nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation and the H\'enon equation. In particular, the symmetry-breaking phenomenon of the ground states of the H\'enon equation is explored numerically in 1D and 2D with interesting numerical findings on the critical value of the symmetry-breaking reported.</description>

      <title>Minimum-norm solutions of the non-symmetric semidefinite Procrustes problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given two matrices $X,B\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times m}$ and a set $\mathcal{A}\subseteq \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$, a Procrustes problem consists in finding a matrix $A \in \mathcal{A}$ such that the Frobenius norm of $AX-B$ is minimized. When $\mathcal{A}$ is the set of the matrices whose symmetric part is positive semidefinite, we obtain the so-called non-symmetric positive semidefinite Procrustes (NSPDSP) problem. The NSPDSP problem arises in the estimation of compliance or stiffness matrix in solid and elastic structures. If $X$ has rank $r$, Baghel et al. (Lin. Alg. Appl., 2022) proposed a three-step semi-analytical approach: (1) construct a reduced NSPDSP problem in dimension $r\times r$, (2) solve the reduced problem by means of a fast gradient method with a linear rate of convergence, and (3) post-process the solution of the reduced problem to construct a solution of the larger original NSPDSP problem. In this paper, we revisit this approach of Baghel et al. and identify an unnecessary assumption used by the authors leading to cases where their algorithm cannot attain a minimum and produces solutions with unbounded norm. In fact, revising the post-processing phase of their semi-analytical approach, we show that the infimum of the NSPDSP problem is always attained, and we show how to compute a minimum-norm solution. We also prove that the symmetric part of the computed solution has minimum rank bounded by $r$, and that the skew-symmetric part has rank bounded by $2r$. Several numerical examples show the efficiency of this algorithm, both in terms of computational speed and of finding optimal minimum-norm solutions.</description>

      <title>A posteriori error estimation for an interior penalty virtual element method of Kirchhoff plates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11411v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a residual-type a posteriori error estimation for an interior penalty virtual element method (IPVEM) for the Kirchhoff plate bending problem. Building on the work in \cite{FY2023IPVEM}, we adopt a modified discrete variational formulation that incorporates the $ H^1 $-elliptic projector in the jump and average terms. This allows us to simplify the numerical implementation by including the $ H^1 $-elliptic projector in the computable error estimators.
  We derive the reliability and efficiency of the a posteriori error bound by constructing an enriching operator and establishing some related error estimates that align with $C^0$-continuous interior penalty finite element methods.
  As observed in the a priori analysis, the interior penalty virtual elements exhibit similar behaviors to $C^0$-continuous elements despite its discontinuity. This observation extends to the a posteriori estimate since we do not need to account for the jumps of the function itself in the discrete scheme and the error estimators.
  As an outcome of the error estimator, an adaptive VEM is introduced by means of the mesh refinement strategy with the one-hanging-node rule. Numerical results from several benchmark tests confirm the robustness of the proposed error estimators and show the efficiency of the resulting adaptive VEM.</description>

      <title>Improving sampling by modifying the effective diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00525v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Markov chain Monte Carlo samplers based on discretizations of (overdamped) Langevin dynamics are commonly used in the Bayesian inference and computational statistical physics literature to estimate high-dimensional integrals. One can introduce a non-constant diffusion matrix to precondition these dynamics, and recent works have optimized it in order to improve the rate of convergence to stationarity by overcoming entropic and energy barriers. However, the introduced methodologies to compute these optimal diffusions are generally not suited to high-dimensional settings, as they rely on costly optimization procedures. In this work, we propose to optimize over a class of diffusion matrices, based on one-dimensional collective variables (CVs), to help the dynamics explore the latent space defined by the CV. The form of the diffusion matrix is chosen in order to obtain an efficient effective diffusion in the latent space. We describe how this class of diffusion matrices can be constructed and learned during the simulation. We provide implementations of the Metropolis--Adjusted Langevin Algorithm and Riemann Manifold (Generalized) Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithms, and discuss numerical optimizations in the case when the CV depends only on a few degrees of freedom of the system. We illustrate the efficiency gains by computing mean transition durations between two metastable states of a dimer in a solvent.</description>

      <title>Galerkin Scheme Using Biorthogonal Wavelets on Intervals for 2D Elliptic Interface Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a wavelet Galerkin method for solving two-dimensional elliptic interface problems of the form $-\nabla\cdot(a\nabla u)=f$ in $\Omega\backslash \Gamma$, where $\Gamma$ is a smooth interface within $\Omega$. The variable scalar coefficient $a&gt;0$ and source term $f$ may exhibit discontinuities across $\Gamma$. By utilizing a biorthogonal wavelet basis derived from bilinear finite elements, which serves as a Riesz basis for $H^1_0(\Omega)$, we devise a strategy that achieves nearly optimal convergence rates: $O(h^2 |\log(h)|^2)$ in the $L_2(\Omega)$-norm and $O(h |\log(h)|)$ in the $H^1(\Omega)$-norm with respect to the approximation order. To handle the geometry of $\Gamma$ and the singularities of the solution $u$, which has a discontinuous gradient across $\Gamma$, additional wavelet elements are introduced along the interface. The dual part of the biorthogonal wavelet basis plays a crucial role in proving these convergence rates. We develop weighted Bessel properties for wavelets, derive various inequalities in fractional Sobolev spaces, and employ finite element arguments to establish the theoretical convergence results. To achieve higher accuracy and effectively handle high-contrast coefficients $a$, our method, much like meshfree approaches, relies on augmenting the number of wavelet elements throughout the domain and near the interface, eliminating the need for re-meshing as in finite element methods. Unlike all other methods for solving elliptic interface problems, the use of a wavelet Riesz basis for $H^1_0(\Omega)$ ensures that the condition numbers of the coefficient matrices remain small and uniformly bounded, regardless of the matrix size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04620v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we propose a second-order central scheme of the Nessyahu-Tadmor-type for a class of scalar conservation laws with discontinuous flux and present its convergence analysis. Since solutions to problems with discontinuous flux generally do not belong to the space of bounded variation (BV), we employ the theory of compensated compactness to establish the convergence of approximate solutions. A major component of our analysis involves deriving the maximum principle and showing the $\mathrm{W}^{-1,2}_{\mathrm{loc}}$ compactness of a sequence constructed from approximate solutions. The latter is achieved through the derivation of several essential estimates on the approximate solutions. Furthermore, by incorporating a mesh-dependent correction term in the slope limiter, we show that the numerical solutions generated by the proposed second-order scheme converge to the entropy solution. Finally, we validate our theoretical results by presenting numerical examples.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a quasi-Newton method optimized for efficiently solving quasi-linear elliptic equations and systems, with a specific focus on GPU-based computation. By approximating the Jacobian matrix with a combination of linear Laplacian and simplified nonlinear terms, our method reduces the computational overhead typical of traditional Newton methods while handling the large, sparse matrices generated from discretized PDEs. We also provide a convergence analysis demonstrating local convergence to the exact solution under optimal choices for the regularization parameter, ensuring stability and efficiency in each iteration. Numerical experiments in two- and three-dimensional domains validate the proposed method's robustness and computational gains with tensor-product implementation. This approach offers a promising pathway for accelerating quasi-linear elliptic equation and system solvers, expanding the feasibility of complex simulations in physics, engineering, and other fields leveraging advanced hardware capabilities.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we construct an asymptotic-preserving neural networks (APNNs) [21] for the linearized Boltzmann equation in the acoustic scaling and with uncertain parameters. Utilizing the micro-macro decomposition, we design the loss function based on the stochastic-Galerkin system conducted from the micro-macro equations. Rigorous analysis is provided to show the capability of neural networks in approximating solutions near the global Maxwellian. By employing hypocoercivity techniques, we demonstrate two key results: the existence of APNNs when the loss function approaches zero, and the convergence of the APNN approximated solution as the loss tends to zero, with the error exhibiting an exponential decay in time.</description>

Abstract: It is demonstrated that one of the equations from the Lie classification list of second-order ODEs is a first integral of the Schwarz equation. As symmetry-preserving finite-difference schemes have been previously constructed for both equations, the preservation of a similar connection between these schemes is studied. It is shown that the schemes for the Schwarz equation and the second-order ODE (with an arbitrary constant $C$) can be related through a B\"acklund-type difference transformation. In addition, previously unexamined aspects of the difference scheme for the second-order ODE are discussed, including its singular solution and the complete set of difference first integrals for the case $C^2=4$.</description>

      <title>lrAA: Low-Rank Anderson Acceleration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new framework for computing low-rank solutions to nonlinear matrix equations arising from spatial discretization of nonlinear partial differential equations: low-rank Anderson acceleration (lrAA). lrAA is an adaptation of Anderson acceleration (AA), a well-known approach for solving nonlinear fixed point problems, to the low-rank format. In particular, lrAA carries out all linear and nonlinear operations in low-rank form with rank truncation using an adaptive truncation tolerance. We propose a simple scheduling strategy to update the truncation tolerance throughout the iteration according to a residual indicator. This controls the intermediate rank and iteration number effectively. To perform rank truncation for nonlinear functions, we propose a new cross approximation, which we call Cross-DEIM, with adaptive error control that is based on the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM). Cross-DEIM employs an iterative update between the approximate singular value decomposition (SVD) and cross approximation. It naturally incorporates a warm-start strategy for each lrAA iterate. We demonstrate the superior performance of lrAA applied to a range of linear and nonlinear problems, including those arising from finite difference discretizations of Laplace's equation, the Bratu problem, the elliptic Monge-Amp\'ere equation and the Allen-Cahn equation.</description>

      <title>Existence, Stability and Uniqueness of the Integral Invariant in A Characteristic-type Semi-Lagrangian Discontinuous Galerkin Scheme</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A characteristic Galerkin-type semi-Lagrangian discontinuous finite element scheme (CSLDG) is investigated, which directly discretizes an integral invariant model derived from the coupling of a transport equation and its dual equation. Despite extensive research on the numerical implementation of this method, no studies have yet explored the well-posedness of the integral invariant model itself. To address this gap, a weak solution theory for CSLDG is developed: A precise definition of the weak solution for the integral invariant model is formulated. Utilizing the slice method, which is frequently employed in existence proofs for parabolic equations, the existence of the weak solution is established through the application of the Riesz Representation Theorem and mollifier techniques. The stability of the integral invariant weak solution is subsequently demonstrated by the strategic selection of the test function Psi, leading to the proof of its uniqueness.</description>

      <title>Optimal Estimation and Uncertainty Quantification for Stochastic Inverse Problems via Variational Bayesian Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10199v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Bayesian inversion method demonstrates significant potential for solving inverse problems, enabling both point estimation and uncertainty quantification. However, Bayesian maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation may become unstable when handling data from diverse distributions (e.g., solutions of stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs)). Additionally, Monte Carlo sampling methods are computationally expensive. To address these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage optimization method based on optimal control theory and variational Bayesian methods. This method not only achieves stable solutions for stochastic inverse problems but also efficiently quantifies the uncertainty of the solutions. In the first stage, we introduce a new weighting formulation to ensure the stability of the Bayesian MAP estimation. In the second stage, we derive the necessary condition to efficiently quantify the uncertainty of the solutions, by combining the new weighting formula with variational inference. Furthermore, we establish an error estimation theorem that relates the exact solution to the optimally estimated solution under different amounts of observed data. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated through numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Numerical Analysis and Dimension Splitting for A Semi-Lagrangian Discontinuous Finite Element Scheme Based on the Characteristic Galerkin Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A characteristic Galerkin-type semi-Lagrangian discontinuous Galerkin methods (CSLDG) is investigated, which directly discretizes an integral invariant model derived from the coupling of a transport equation and its dual equation. First, the existence and uniqueness of the CSLDG numerical solutions are proven, along with the stability of the numerical scheme. Subsequently, in contrast to the commonly used interpolation-based dimensional splitting schemes within the CSLDG framework, a separated-variable dimensional splitting approach based on the tensor product is proposed and applied to the two-dimensional case.</description>

      <title>Sequential Monte Carlo with Gaussian Mixture Approximation for Infinite-Dimensional Statistical Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By formulating the inverse problem of partial differential equations (PDEs) as a statistical inference problem, the Bayesian approach provides a general framework for quantifying uncertainties. In the inverse problem of PDEs, parameters are defined on an infinite-dimensional function space, and the PDEs induce a computationally intensive likelihood function. Additionally, sparse data tends to lead to a multi-modal posterior. These features make it difficult to apply existing sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithms. To overcome these difficulties, we propose new conditions for the likelihood functions, construct a Gaussian mixture based preconditioned Crank-Nicolson transition kernel, and demonstrate the universal approximation property of the infinite-dimensional Gaussian mixture probability measure. By combining these three novel tools, we propose a new SMC algorithm, named SMC-GM. For this new algorithm, we obtain a convergence theorem that allows Gaussian priors, illustrating that the sequential particle filter actually reproduces the true posterior distribution. Furthermore, the proposed new algorithm is rigorously defined on the infinite-dimensional function space, naturally exhibiting the discretization-invariant property. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the new approach has a strong ability to probe the multi-modality of the posterior, significantly reduces the computational burden, and numerically exhibits the discretization-invariant property (important for large-scale problems).</description>

      <title>Lower Bounds for the Convergence of Tensor Power Iteration on Random Overcomplete Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.03827v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tensor decomposition serves as a powerful primitive in statistics and machine learning, and has numerous applications in problems such as learning latent variable models or mixture of Gaussians. In this paper, we focus on using power iteration to decompose an overcomplete random tensor. Past work studying the properties of tensor power iteration either requires a non-trivial data-independent initialization, or is restricted to the undercomplete regime. Moreover, several papers implicitly suggest that logarithmically many iterations (in terms of the input dimension) are sufficient for the power method to recover one of the tensor components.
  Here we present a novel analysis of the dynamics of tensor power iteration from random initialization in the overcomplete regime, where the tensor rank is much greater than its dimension. Surprisingly, we show that polynomially many steps are necessary for convergence of tensor power iteration to any of the true component, which refutes the previous conjecture. On the other hand, our numerical experiments suggest that tensor power iteration successfully recovers tensor components for a broad range of parameters in polynomial time. To further complement our empirical evidence, we prove that a popular objective function for tensor decomposition is strictly increasing along the power iteration path.
  Our proof is based on the Gaussian conditioning technique, which has been applied to analyze the approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm. The major ingredient of our argument is a conditioning lemma that allows us to generalize AMP-type analysis to non-proportional limit and polynomially many iterations of the power method.</description>

      <title>Optimal Approximation of Zonoids and Uniform Approximation by Shallow Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15285v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the following two related problems. The first is to determine to what error an arbitrary zonoid in $\mathbb{R}^{d+1}$ can be approximated in the Hausdorff distance by a sum of $n$ line segments. The second is to determine optimal approximation rates in the uniform norm for shallow ReLU$^k$ neural networks on their variation spaces. The first of these problems has been solved for $d\neq 2,3$, but when $d=2,3$ a logarithmic gap between the best upper and lower bounds remains. We close this gap, which completes the solution in all dimensions. For the second problem, our techniques significantly improve upon existing approximation rates when $k\geq 1$, and enable uniform approximation of both the target function and its derivatives.</description>

      <title>Sharp Analysis of Power Iteration for Tensor PCA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the power iteration algorithm for the tensor PCA model introduced in Richard and Montanari (2014). Previous work studying the properties of tensor power iteration is either limited to a constant number of iterations, or requires a non-trivial data-independent initialization. In this paper, we move beyond these limitations and analyze the dynamics of randomly initialized tensor power iteration up to polynomially many steps. Our contributions are threefold: First, we establish sharp bounds on the number of iterations required for power method to converge to the planted signal, for a broad range of the signal-to-noise ratios. Second, our analysis reveals that the actual algorithmic threshold for power iteration is smaller than the one conjectured in literature by a polylog(n) factor, where n is the ambient dimension. Finally, we propose a simple and effective stopping criterion for power iteration, which provably outputs a solution that is highly correlated with the true signal. Extensive numerical experiments verify our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Maximum a posteriori testing in statistical inverse problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00686v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with a Bayesian approach to testing hypotheses in statistical inverse problems. Based on the posterior distribution $\Pi \left(\cdot |Y = y\right)$, we want to infer whether a feature $\langle\varphi, u^\dagger\rangle$ of the unknown quantity of interest $u^\dagger$ is positive. This can be done by the so-called maximum a posteriori test. We provide a frequentistic analysis of this test's properties such as level and power, and prove that it is a regularized test in the sense of Kretschmann et al. (2024). Furthermore we provide lower bounds for its power under classical spectral source conditions in case of Gaussian priors. Numerical simulations illustrate its superior performance both in moderately and severely ill-posed situations.</description>

Abstract: We prove the existence of infinite number of homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits to two periodic orbits for the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky PDE on the line with odd and periodic boundary conditions and for some fixed parameter value of the system. The proof is computer assisted and it is based on a new algorithm for rigorous integration of the variational equation for a class of dissipative PDEs on the torus.</description>

      <title>The effective use of BLAS interface for implementation of finite-element ADER-DG and finite-volume ADER-WENO methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12483v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical methods of the ADER family, in particular finite-element ADER-DG and finite-volume ADER-WENO methods, are among the most accurate numerical methods for solving quasilinear hyperbolic PDE systems. The internal structure of ADER-DG and ADER-WENO numerical methods contains a large number of basic linear algebra operations related to matrix multiplications. The main interface of software libraries for matrix multiplications for high-performance computing is BLAS. An effective method for integration the standard functions of the BLAS interface into the implementation of these numerical methods is presented. The calculated matrices are small matrices; and this allows to use effectively JIT technologies. The proposed approach immediately operates on AoS, which allows to efficiently calculate flux, source and non-conservative terms without transposition. The obtained computational costs demonstrated that the effective implementation, based on the use of the JIT functions of the BLAS, outperformed both the implementation based on the general BLAS functions and the vanilla implementations by several orders of magnitude. The complexity of developing an implementation based on the proposed approach does not exceed the complexity of developing a vanilla implementation. Performance analysis using roofline partly explains the observed features of the decreasing of computational costs.</description>

      <title>Precision and Cholesky Factor Estimation for Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the estimation of large precision matrices and Cholesky factors obtained by observing a Gaussian process at many locations. Under general assumptions on the precision and the observations, we show that the sample complexity scales poly-logarithmically with the size of the precision matrix and its Cholesky factor. The key challenge in these estimation tasks is the polynomial growth of the condition number of the target matrices with their size. For precision estimation, our theory hinges on an intuitive local regression technique on the lattice graph which exploits the approximate sparsity implied by the screening effect. For Cholesky factor estimation, we leverage a block-Cholesky decomposition recently used to establish complexity bounds for sparse Cholesky factorization.</description>
