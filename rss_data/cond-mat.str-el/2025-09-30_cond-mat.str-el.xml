      <title>Strong-coupling superconductivity near Gross-Neveu quantum criticality in Dirac systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study two-dimensional massless Dirac fermions at neutrality, coupled to bosonic modes through a Yukawa interaction. We then examine the intriguing possibility that such a system, devoid of carriers at zero temperature, might nevertheless exhibit superconductivity. Remarkably, we find that superconductivity emerges in the vicinity of Gross-Neveu quantum criticality, provided the fermions cease to behave as well-defined quasiparticles, that is, once their anomalous dimension in the normal state becomes sufficiently large. In other words, well-defined fermions do not superconduct, whereas ill-defined ones do. We analyze four symmetry-distinct bosonic modes, each capable of driving normal-state criticality and, in three of the four cases, giving rise to a distinct superconducting phase. While phase fluctuations are strong in this regime, we argue that they do not destroy the superconducting state. We further characterize the resulting pairing states for a concrete Dirac model of spin-orbit coupled systems with orbitals of different parity. Our results are obtained using the SYK-inspired framework for Dirac systems introduced by Kim et al.[1], which provides a controlled approach to the strongly coupled regime of Dirac fluids near Gross-Neveu criticality.</description>

      <title>The Sound of Electrons Shattering: Current Noise Composition Laws for Electron Fractionalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a theory of the non-equilibrium current response for metallic systems near quantum critical points where electronic quasiparticles fractionalize, such as systems near continuous metal-insulator transitions or composite Fermi liquid to Fermi liquid transitions. Applying a generalized response theory within a Keldysh path integral framework, we derive a non-perturbative current noise composition law, wherein the total noise is the sum of the noise of each fractionalized constituent (bosonic holons and fermionic spinons), weighted by their respective resistivities. We demonstrate that the formally derived composition relations can be interpreted in terms of a simple analogy with resistors in series. We leverage this composition rule near certain quantum critical points to show that the shot noise can be suppressed in long nanowires as compared to Fermi liquid expectations due to the collusion of quantum criticality with fractionalization.</description>

      <title>Probing phase transitions in non-Hermitian systems with quantum entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the quantum entanglement and quantum phase transition of the non-Hermitian anisotropic spin-1/2 XY model and XXZ model with the staggered imaginary field by analytical methods and numerical exact diagonalization, respectively. Various entanglement measures, including concurrence, negativity, mutual information, and quantum coherence, and both biorthogonal and self-normal quantities are investigated. Both the biorthogonal and self-normal entanglement quantities, except the biorthogonal concurrence, are found to be capable of detecting the first-order and $\mathcal{PT}$ transitions in the XXZ model, as well as the Ising and $\mathcal{RT}$ transitions in the XY model. In addition, we introduce the unconstrained concurrence and demonstrate its effectiveness in detecting these transitions. On the other hand, the Beresinskii-Kosterlitz-Thoules (BKT) transition in the XXZ model is revealed through concurrence and negativity at small non-Hermiticity strengths. Notably, the critical points observed in the Hermitian limit evolve into exceptional points as the strength of the non-Hermiticity increases. Furthermore, we find that the first-order transition survives up to a higher non-Hermiticity strength compared to the BKT transition within the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric regime of the XXZ model.</description>

      <title>Schwinger boson theory for $S=1$ Kitaev quantum spin liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kitaev model is an exactly solvable model with a quantum spin liquid ground state. While this model was originally proposed as an $S=1/2$ spin model on a honeycomb lattice, extensions to higher-spin systems have recently attracted attention. In contrast to the $S=1/2$ case, such higher-$S$ models are not exactly solvable and remain poorly understood, particularly for spin excitations at finite temperatures. Here, we focus on the $S=1$ Kitaev model, which is proposed to host bosonic quasiparticles. We investigate this model using Schwinger boson mean-field theory, introducing bosonic spinons as fractional quasiparticles by extending bond operators to address anisotropic spin interactions. We determine the mean-field parameters that realize a quantum spin liquid in both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic Kitaev models. Based on this ansatz, we calculate dynamical and equal-time spin structure factors. We find that the conventional scheme based on Wick decoupling with respect to spinons yields unphysical momentum dependence: it produces strong spectral weight indicating ferromagnetic (antiferromagnetic) correlations in the antiferromagnetic (ferromagnetic) Kitaev model. To resolve this issue, we propose an alternative evaluation based on decoupling with respect to bond operators. We demonstrate that, in our scheme, such unphysical behavior disappears and the momentum dependence of the spin structure factors is consistent with the sign of the exchange constant. We also compute the temperature evolution of the dynamical spin structure factor and find that the zero-temperature continuum splits into two distinct structures as temperature increases, which can be understood in terms of the bandwidth narrowing of spinons. Finally, we clarify why the two decoupling schemes result in different momentum dependences and discuss their relationship to previous studies.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic antiferromagnetic order in EuPd$_3$Si$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single crystals of EuPd$_3$Si$_2$ were grown using a high-temperature EuPd-flux method. The material was structurally and chemically characterized by single-crystal x-ray diffraction, powder x-ray diffraction, Laue method and energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. The structural analysis confirmed the orthorhombic crystal structure (space group $Imma$) but revealed differences in the lattice parameters and bond distances in comparison to previous work by Sharma et al.. The composition is close to the ideal 1:3:2 stoichiometry with an occupation of 7 % of the Si sites by Pd. The heat capacity, electrical resistivity, and magnetic susceptibility show two magnetic transitions indicating antiferromagnetic ordering below $T_{\rm N1}= 61\,\rm K$ and a spin reorientation at $T_{\rm N2}= 40\,\rm K$. The orthorhombic material shows magnetic anisotropy with field applied along the three main symmetry axes, which is summarized in the temperature-field phase diagrams. The susceptibility data hint to an alignment of the magnetic moments along $[100]$ between $T_{\rm N1}$ and $T_{\rm N2}$. Below $T_{\rm N2}$ the magnetic structure changes to an arrangement with moments canted away from $[100]$. In contrast to published work by Sharma et al., the single crystals investigated in this study show AFM order below $T_{\rm N1}$ instead of ferromagnetism that sets in at higher $T_{\rm C1}=78\,\rm K$ which might originate from certain differences in the structure, composition or defects that have an impact on the dominant coupling constants of the RKKY interaction.</description>

      <title>Spin-supersolidity induced quantum criticality and magnetocaloric effect in the triangular-lattice antiferromagnet Rb$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed high-field magnetization, magnetocaloric effect (MCE), and NMR measurements on the Ising triangular-lattice antiferromagnet Rb$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$. The observations of the 1/3-magnetization plateau, the split NMR lines, and the thermal activation behaviors of the spin-lattice relaxation rate $1/T_1$ between 2 T and 15.8 T provide unambiguous evidence of a gapped up-up-down (UUD) magnetic ordered phase. For fields between 15.8 T and 18.5 T, the anomaly in the magnetic susceptibility, the slow saturation of the NMR line spectral ratio with temperature, and the power-law temperature dependence of $1/T_1$ suggest the ground state to be a spin supersolid with gapless spin excitations. With further increasing the field, the Gr\"{u}neisen ratio, extracted from the MCE data, reveals a continuous quantum phase transition at $H_{\rm C}\approx$ 19.5 T and a universal quantum critical scaling with the exponents ${\nu}z~\approx~$1. Near $H_{\rm C}$, the large high-temperature MCE signal and the broad peaks in the NMR Knight shift and $1/T_1$, manifest the strong spin fluctuations driven by both magnetic frustration and quantum criticality. These results establish Rb$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$ as a candidate platform for cryogenic magnetocaloric cooling.</description>

      <title>Symmetry restoration in a fast scrambling system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement asymmetry -- used here as a direct probe of symmetry restoration -- provides a sharp diagnostic of post-quench dynamics. We test this idea in the complex Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (cSYK) model with a conserved U(1) charge. Using exact diagonalization, we track the joint evolution of entanglement entropy and entanglement asymmetry after quenches from charge-asymmetric product states. We find rapid volume-law entanglement growth consistent with the subsystem eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, accompanied by a concurrent decay of entanglement asymmetry to a late-time plateau set by finite-size effects: small subsystems display near-complete restoration, while residual cross-sector weight yields a finite plateau. Notably, we uncover a quantum Mpemba effect: states prepared further from symmetry relax faster and approach lower residual asymmetry; disorder in the couplings renders this behavior more robust and monotonic across parameters. We further derive a Pinsker-type lower bound that ties the decay of asymmetry to differences in subsystem purity, identifying dephasing between U(1) charge sectors as the operative mechanism. These results establish entanglement asymmetry as a sensitive probe of symmetry restoration and thermalization, clarifying finite-size limits in fast-scrambling, closed quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Magnetic phase transitions protected by topological quantum geometry transitions: effects of electron-electron interactions in the Creutz ladder system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between electronic correlations and band topology is a central theme in modern condensed matter physics. In this work, we investigate the effects of on-site Hubbard interactions on the topological, magnetic, and quantum geometric properties of the Creutz ladder, a paradigmatic model of a one-dimensional topological insulator. Using a self-consistent mean-field approach, we uncover a first-order, interaction-driven phase transition that is simultaneously magnetic and topological. We demonstrate that as the Hubbard interaction $U$ is increased, the system's ground state abruptly switches from an anti-ferromagnetic (AF) configuration to a ferromagnetic (F) one. This magnetic transition coincides with a topological transition, marked by a quantized jump in the Zak phase from $\pm\pi$ to $0$. We systematically compute the phase diagrams in the parameter space of on-site energy staggering ($\epsilon$) and inter-chain hopping asymmetry ($\lambda$), revealing the critical interaction strength $U_c$. Furthermore, we analyze the quantum geometry of the Bloch states by calculating the Fubini-Study metric, demonstrating that its components exhibit divergences that precisely signal the topological phase transition. By analyzing the full energy spectrum, we distinguish the true ground state from metastable excited states that emerge past the critical point. Our results establish the Creutz-Hubbard ladder as a minimal model for studying interaction-induced topological phenomena and suggest a potential route for controlling magnetic, topological, and geometric properties via electronic correlations.</description>

      <title>Non-local edge mode hybridization in the long-range interacting Kitaev chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In one-dimensional p-wave superconductors with short-range interactions, topologically protected Majorana modes emerge, whose mass decays exponentially with system size, as first shown by Kitaev. In this work, we extend this prototypical model by including power law long-range interactions within a self-consistent framework, leading to the self-consistent long-range Kitaev chain (seco-LRKC). In this model, the gap matrix acquires a rich structure where short-range superconducting correlations coexist with long-range correlations that are exponentially localized at both chain edges simultaneously. As a direct consequence, the topological edge modes hybridize even if their wavefunction overlap vanishes, and the edge mode mass inherits the asymptotic scaling of the interaction. In contrast to models with imposed power law pairing, where massive Dirac modes emerge for exponents $\nu &lt; d$, we analytically motivate and numerically demonstrate that, in the fully self-consistent model, algebraic edge mode decay with system size persists for all interaction exponents $\nu &gt; 0$, despite exponential wave function localization. While the edge mode remains massless in the thermodynamic limit, finite-size corrections can be experimentally relevant in mesoscopic systems with effective long-range interactions that decay sufficiently slowly.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum spin liquid (QSL) phases exist in theory, but real candidate QSL materials are often extraordinarily sensitive to structural defects which disrupt the ground state. Here, we investigate candidate triangular QSL material YbCu$_{1.14}$Se$_2$ and discover the absence of magnetic order, but also no compelling evidence of a QSL ground state due to significant structural disorder. We instead look at the results through a lens of a 2-dimensional (2D) random singlet phase. YbCu$_{1.14}$Se$_2$ behaves strikingly similar to other disordered triangular lattice materials, suggesting universal behavior of random singlet formation in 2D frustrated systems.</description>

      <title>Orbital altermagnetism on the kagome lattice and possible application to $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets, which encompass a broad landscape of materials, are compensated collinear magnetic phases in which the antiparallel magnetic moments are related by a crystalline rotation. Here, we argue that collinear altermagnetic-like states can also be realized in lattices with an odd number of sublattices, provided that the electronic interactions promote non-uniform magnetic moments. We demonstrate this idea for a kagome metal whose band filling places the Fermi level close to the van Hove singularity. Combining phenomenological and microscopic modeling, we show that the intertwined charge density-wave and loop-current instabilities of this model lead to a wide parameter range in which orbital ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and altermagnetic phases emerge inside the charge-ordered state. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling, their electronic structures display the usual spin-split fingerprints associated with the three types of collinear magnetic order. We discuss the possible realization of orbital altermagnetic phases in the $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ family of kagome metals.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Holstein-Primakoff boson representation of quantum spins and associated large-$S$ expansion have been the standard framework for describing the spin wave excitations in magnetically order phases of quantum spin systems. However, we will show that the omission of projection operators and normal-ordering in this representation can produce incorrect magnon hamiltonians for finite $S$. We will present the exact normal-ordered forms of the finite-$S$ projection operators and projected Holstein-Primakoff boson representations of spin and quadrupole operators, which can produce exact two-magnon interaction terms under ferromagnetic or fully polarized states. We will also discuss the difficulties of applying this projected representation to antiferromagnetic spin wave theory.</description>

      <title>Amplified response of cavity-coupled quantum-critical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum critical point develops when matter undergoes a continuous transformation between distinct ground states at absolute zero. It hosts pronounced quantum fluctuations, which render the system highly susceptible to external perturbations. While light-matter coupling has rapidly moved forward as a means to probe and control quantum materials, the capacity of quantum critical fluctuations in the photon-mediated responses has been largely unexplored. Here we advance the notion that directly coupling a quantum critical mode to a quantized cavity field dramatically facilitates the onset of superradiance. When the coupling between the two fields is bilinear, the transition is found to occur at vanishingly small light-matter coupling and is accompanied by strongly enhanced intrinsic squeezing. Our results identify a particularly favorable setting for realizing the elusive superradiant state, and point to a general principle by which quantum criticality amplifies photon-matter entanglement and enhances the associated metrological performance.</description>

Abstract: Over twenty years ago Alexei Abrikosov [A.A. Abrikosov, Metal-insulator transition in layered cuprates (SDW model), Physica C: Supercond. Vol. 391, 2, 147-159 (2003)] considered the Spin-Density-Waves (SDW) model for the metal-insulator transition in layered cuprates. In one of those cuprates, YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$, there are one-dimensional (1D) CuO chains of copper and oxygen ions. In the present work we consider the metal-insulator transition in the model case of a 1D CuO chain in the regime of half-filling of the band. Our model is essentially the same, but as an exchange interaction causing the metal-insulator transition, we consider Kondo-Zener two-electron exchange, which successfully describes many of the electronic properties of the layered cuprates.</description>

      <title>Error detection without post-selection in adaptive quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current quantum computers are limited by errors, but have not yet achieved the scale required to benefit from active error correction in large computations. We show how simulations of open quantum systems can benefit from error detection. In particular, we use Quantinuum's H2 quantum computer to perform logical simulations of a non-equilibrium phase transition using the [[4,2,2]] code. Importantly, by converting detected errors into random resets, which are an intended part of the dissipative quantum dynamics being studied, we avoid any post-selection in our simulations, thereby eliminating the exponential cost typically associated with error detection. The encoded simulations perform near break-even with unencoded simulations at short times.</description>

      <title>Generalized Wigner theorem for non-invertible symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the conditions under which a conservation law associated with a non-invertible operator may be realized as a symmetry in quantum mechanics. As illustrated by Wigner, all symmetries forming a group structure (and hence invertible) must be either unitary or antiunitary. Relinquishing this assumption of invertibility, we demonstrate that the fundamental invariance of quantum transition probabilities under the application of symmetries mandates that all non-invertible symmetries may only correspond to {\it projective} unitary or antiunitary transformations, i.e., {\it partial isometries}. This extends the notion of physical states beyond conventional rays in Hilbert space to equivalence classes in an {\it extended, gauged Hilbert space}, thereby broadening the traditional understanding of symmetry transformations in quantum theory. We discuss consequences of this result and explicitly illustrate how, in simple model systems, whether symmetries be invertible or non-invertible may be inextricably related to the particular boundary conditions that are being used.</description>

      <title>Krylov Winding and Emergent Coherence in Operator Growth Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The operator wavefunction provides a fine-grained description of quantum chaos and of the irreversible growth of simple operators into increasingly complex ones. Remarkably, at finite temperature this wavefunction can acquire a phase that increases linearly with the size of operator, a phenomenon called $\textit{size winding}$. Although size winding occurs naturally in a holographic setting, the emergence of a coherent phase in a scrambled operator remains mysterious from the standpoint of a thermalizing quantum many-body system. In this work, we elucidate this phenomenon by introducing the related concept of $\textit{Krylov winding}$, whereby the operator wavefunction has a phase which winds linearly with the Krylov index. We argue that Krylov winding is a generic feature of quantum chaotic systems. It gives rise to size winding under two additional conditions: (i) a low-rank mapping between the Krylov and size bases, which ensures phase alignment among operators of the same size, and (ii) the saturation of the ``chaos-operator growth'' bound $\lambda_L \leq 2 \alpha$ (with $\lambda_L$ the Lyapunov exponent and $\alpha$ the growth rate), which ensures a linear phase dependence on size. For systems which do not saturate this bound, with $h = \lambda_L / 2\alpha &lt;1$, the winding with Pauli size $\ell$ becomes $\textit{superlinear}$, behaving as $\ell^{1/h}$. We illustrate these results with two microscopic models: the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model and a disordered $k$-local spin model.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of Chern-Simons Wilson Loops via Flux Quantization in Cohomotopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the practice of physics model building, the process of renormalization, resummation, and anomaly cancellation is to incrementally repair initially ill-defined Lagrangian quantum field theories. Impressive as this is, one would rather have concisely defined complete theories to begin with, and understand these choices as emergent from fundamental principles. As an instructive example, we recall renormalization choices for Wilson loop observables in abelian Chern-Simons theory. Then we show that these emerge in a novel non-Lagrangian topological completion of 5D Maxwell-Chern-Simons QFT, by means of proper flux quantization in 2-Cohomotopy. This result is a modest cousin, with applications to topologically ordered quantum materials, of the more ambitious flux quantization of 11D supergravity in 4-Cohomotopy ("Hypothesis H").</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As present day quantum hardware is limited by various noise mechanisms, quantum advantage can only be reached in the near-term by designing noise-resilient quantum algorithms. In this work, we employ state-of-the-art quantum process tomography (QPT) techniques to characterize the noise channels of IBM quantum processors under realistic runtime constraints. As our main application, we compare the Trotter time-evolution of three- and four-qubit wave functions to a compressed quantum circuit version of the same evolution operator. By analysing the spectral properties of the two process channels, we find that the compressed circuit systematically yields larger eigenvalue moduli, demonstrating better noise resilience.</description>

      <title>Origin of Spin Stripes in Bilayer Nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has emerged as a new high temperature superconductor. We propose and study a microscopic Hamiltonian that addresses the interplay of lattice structure and magnetism in this system. Using state-of-the-art density matrix renormalization group calculations, we show that $(\pi/2,\pi/2)$ spin stripe order emerges in our model and exhibits a hidden quasi-one dimensionality. The spin stripe order occurs over a range of electron concentrations, but requires a sizable Hund's coupling $J_H$. Our model exhibits superconducting tendency only when the interlayer antiferromagnetic coupling $J_\bot$ becomes sufficiently large, which naturally occurs under pressure. Our study unveils the microscopic origin of both the unusual spin stripes and superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, and highlights the indispensable role of Hund's coupling $J_H$ in this system.</description>

      <title>Anderson localization: a density matrix approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anderson localization is a quantum phenomenon in which disorder localizes electronic wavefunctions. In this work, we propose a new approach to study Anderson localization based on the density matrix formalism. Drawing an analogy to the standard transfer matrix method, we extract the localization length from the modular density matrix in quasi-one-dimensional systems. This approach successfully captures the metal-insulator transition in the three-dimensional Anderson model and in the two-dimensional Anderson model with spin-orbit coupling. It can be also readily extended to multiorbital systems. We further generalize the formalism to interacting systems, showing that the one-dimensional spinless attractive model exhibits the expected metallic phase, consistent with previous studies. More importantly, we demonstrate the existence of a two-dimensional metallic phase in the presence of Hubbard interactions and disorder. This method offers a new perspective on Anderson localization and its interplay with interactions.</description>

      <title>Zeta expansion for long-range interactions under periodic boundary conditions with applications to micromagnetics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the efficient computation of power-law-based interaction potentials of homogeneous $d$-dimensional bodies with an infinite $n$-dimensional array of copies, including their higher-order derivatives. This problem forms a serious challenge in micromagnetics with periodic boundary conditions and related fields. Nowadays, it is common practice to truncate the associated infinite lattice sum to a finite number of images, introducing uncontrolled errors. We show that, for general interacting geometries, the exact infinite sum for both dipolar interactions and generalized Riesz power-law potentials can be obtained by complementing a small direct sum by a correction term that involves efficiently computable derivatives of generalized zeta functions. We show that the resulting representation converges exponentially in the derivative order, reaching machine precision at a computational cost no greater than that of truncated summation schemes. In order to compute the generalized zeta functions efficiently, we provide a superexponentially convergent algorithm for their evaluation, as well as for all required special functions, such as incomplete Bessel functions. Magnetic fields can thus be evaluated to machine precision in arbitrary cuboidal domains periodically extended along one or two dimensions. We benchmark our method against known formulas for magnetic interactions and against direct summation for Riesz potentials with large exponents, consistently achieving full precision. In addition, we identify new corrections to the asymptotic limit of the demagnetization field and tabulate high-precision benchmark values that can be used as a reliable reference for micromagnetic solvers. The techniques developed are broadly applicable, with direct impact in other areas such as molecular dynamics.</description>

      <title>Strong random unitaries and fast scrambling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how fast physical systems can resemble Haar-random unitaries is a fundamental question in physics. Many experiments of interest in quantum gravity and many-body physics, including the butterfly effect in quantum information scrambling and the Hayden-Preskill thought experiment, involve queries to a random unitary $U$ alongside its inverse $U^\dagger$, conjugate $U^*$, and transpose $U^T$. However, conventional notions of approximate unitary designs and pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) fail to capture these experiments. In this work, we introduce and construct strong unitary designs and strong PRUs that remain robust under all such queries. Our constructions achieve the optimal circuit depth of $O(\log n)$ for systems of $n$ qubits. We further show that strong unitary designs can form in circuit depth $O(\log^2 n)$ in circuits composed of independent two-qubit Haar-random gates, and that strong PRUs can form in circuit depth $\text{poly}(\log n)$ in circuits with no ancilla qubits. Our results provide an operational proof of the fast scrambling conjecture from black hole physics: every observable feature of the fastest scrambling quantum systems reproduces Haar-random behavior at logarithmic times.</description>

      <title>Half-filled metal and molecular-orbital-mediated pairing in cuprate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cuprates exhibit anomalous momentum-space structure with antinodal gap and nodal arc in the underdoped regime, which evolves into a complete hole-type Fermi surface with a large Luttinger volume in the overdoped regime. The real-space electronic structure is also quite complex, as characterized by microscopic inhomogeneities and intertwined density wave orders. Here we show that doped holes in cuprate form localized electronic molecules consisting of 4a0 plaquettes, and each plaquette contains approximately two holes. The effective local doping level is thus around 1/8, which is sufficient to destroy the underlying AF order and more importantly, recovers the half-filled metallic state of the original CuO2 plane. The restored Fermi surface, hosting one hole per unit cell, is consistent with experimental results and satisfies the Luttinger theorem. We then construct the momentum-space structure of the half-filled metal by considering the real-space configuration of electronic molecules. We show that the electronic potential with 4a0 periodicity imposed by the plaquettes and the quantum size effect of electronic molecules obliterate the nested antinodal Fermi surface sheets, leaving behind short arcs with coherent quasiparticles around the node. We propose that two doped holes in each plaquette occupy the shared molecular orbital and form a spin singlet, which can mediate the pairing of itinerant holes on the remnant Fermi surface of the half-filled metal. The electric dipole moment between the molecular orbitals and the dopant ions may also provide a novel attractive interaction between itinerant holes. This phenomenological model for pair formation between itinerant holes on the half-filled Fermi surface mediated by localized molecular orbitals resolves several core issues concerning the mechanism of superconductivity in cuprates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformal defects spontaneously break part of the symmetry algebra of a bulk CFT. We show that the broken Ward identities imply very general sum rules on the defect CFT data as well as on the DOE data of bulk operators, which we call defect soft theorems. Our derivation is elementary, allowing us to easily reproduce and generalize constraints on displacement and tilt operators previously obtained in the literature as well as a plethora of new ones, including constraints on bulk-defect correlation functions. For line defects we rewrite constraints in dispersive sum rule form, showing they lead to exact, optimal bounds on the OPE data of the defect. We test these sum rules in concrete perturbative examples, finding perfect agreement with existing calculations and making new predictions for various dCFT data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the low-energy dynamics of systems with exact and approximate higher-form symmetries using gauge/gravity duality. These symmetries are realised holographically via Maxwell-type theories for massless and massive $p$-forms in AlAdS spacetimes. Double-trace deformations of the boundary theory are considered. While massless theories describe systems with conserved higher-form current, the massive case provides a controlled linearised framework for explicit symmetry breaking induced by defects and charged operators. We perform holographic renormalisation and establish a unified holographic dictionary across a broad theory space, parametrised by spacetime dimension, form rank, quantisation scheme and deformation scale. We compute thermal correlation functions in isotropic black brane backgrounds to characterise the hydrodynamic and quasihydrodynamic regimes of the dual boundary theories. Our analysis reveals a rich structure of relaxation dynamics, emergent photons and duality relations -- including the conventional electric-magnetic Hodge duality and its massive counterpart. These results extend bottom-up holography to include weakly broken higher-form symmetries and open avenues for exploring generalised self-duality constraints and new classes of deformed holographic duals.</description>

Abstract: Generalized Wigner crystals (GWC) on triangular moir\'e superlattices, formed from stacking two layers of transition metal chalcogenides, have been observed at multiple fractional fillings [Nature 587, 214 - 218 (2020), Nat. Phys. 17, 715 - 719 (2021), Nature 597, 650 - 654 (2021)]. Motivated by these experiments, tied with the need for accurate microscopic descriptions of these materials, we explore the origins of GWC at $n=1/3$ and $2/3$ filling. We demonstrate the general limitations of theoretical descriptions relying on finite-range, versus long-range interactions, however, we clarify why some properties are captured by an effective nearest-neighbor model. We study both classical and quantum effects at zero and finite temperatures, discussing the role of charge frustration, identifying a ``pinball" phase, a partially quantum melted GWC, with no classical analog. Our work addresses several experimental observations and makes predictions for how many of the theoretical findings can be potentially realized in future experiments.</description>

      <title>The Two-Dimensional Rashba-Holstein Model: A Quantum Monte Carlo Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the impact of Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) on the formation of charge-density wave (CDW) and superconducting (SC) phases in the Holstein model on a half-filled square lattice. Using unbiased finite-temperature Quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we go beyond mean-field approaches to determine the ground state order parameter as a function of RSOC and phonon frequency. Our results reveal that the Rashba metal is unstable due to particle-hole instabilities, favoring the emergence of a CDW phase for any RSOC value. In the limit of a pure Rashba hopping, the model exhibits a distinct behavior with the appearance of four Weyl cones at half-filling, where quantum phase transitions are expected to occur at strong interactions. Indeed, a quantum phase transition, belonging to the Gross-Neveu Ising universality class between a semi-metal and CDW emerges at finite phonon frequency dependent coupling $\lambda_c$. In the antiadiabatic limit we observe an enhanced symmetry in the infrared that unifies SC and CDW orders. These results advance our understanding of competing CDW and SC phases in systems with spin-orbit coupling, providing insights that may help clarify the behavior of related materials.</description>

      <title>Bridging conformal field theory and parton approaches to SU(n)_k chiral spin liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09567v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ the $\mathrm{SU}(n)_k$ Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) model in conformal field theory to construct lattice wave functions in both one and two dimensions. The spins on all lattice sites are chosen to transform under the $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ irreducible representation with a single row and $k$ boxes in the Young tableau. It is demonstrated that the wave functions can be reinterpreted as parton states, which enables efficient conversion to matrix product states such that many physical properties can be evaluated directly. In one dimension, these wave functions describe critical spin chains whose universality classes are in one-to-one correspondence with the WZW models used in the construction. In two dimensions, our constructions yield model wave functions for chiral spin liquids, and we show how to find all topological sectors of them in a systematic way. Using the null vectors of Kac-Moody algebras, parent Hamiltonians of the $\mathrm{SU}(3)_k$ series are derived. The $\mathrm{SU}(3)_k$ chiral spin liquids are lattice analogs of non-Abelian spin-singlet fractional quantum Hall states, and the $k=2$ member hosts Fibonacci anyons.</description>

      <title>On the magnetic contribution of itinerant electrons to neutron diffraction in the topological antiferromagnet CeAlGe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a neutron diffraction study of the magnetic structure of CeAlGe, a candidate topological semimetal that hosts a non-collinear, multi-$\mathbf{k}$ magnetic phase. By measuring both low- and high-momentum-transfer magnetic Bragg peaks within a single experimental setup, we refine a magnetic structure model based solely on localized Ce moments. This model, which differs from that obtained using only high-$Q$ data, quantitatively reproduces the observed intensities, including the $(000)$ zeroth-order magnetic satellites that are especially sensitive to subtle components of the modulation. While a contribution from itinerant electrons to the zeroth satellite cannot be definitively excluded, our analysis reveals no unambiguous evidence for such effects within experimental uncertainty. The refined magnetic structures exhibit topologically nontrivial winding patterns, derived from the fitted magnetic parameters, that support localized, particle-like spin textures with half-integer topological charges. These features provide a natural microscopic origin for the observed topological Hall effect, establishing CeAlGe as a model system where magnetism and topology are intimately linked.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Evidence for Electron-Boson Coupling in Half-metallic CrO2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report quasiparticle properties of the half-metal ferromagnet CrO2 by means of high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). We clearly observed the Fermi surface (FS) and band dispersion in good agreement with the previous reports. Moreover, the ARPES band dispersion reveals a distinct kink structure around 68 meV, providing the first spectroscopic evidence for the elementary excitations in CrO2. The energy scale of this feature is comparable to the Debye temperature and the $A\subm{1g}$ phonon mode, suggesting the electron-phonon interaction. From the detailed analysis, we have extracted the self-energy and found two characteristic structures in the real part of the self-energy. Assuming the existence of the electron-magnon interaction as well as the electron-phonon interaction, we could reproduce the evaluated real and imaginary parts of the self-energy as well as ARPES intensity. Our findings reveal the renormalized quasiparticle (QP) dynamics in CrO$_2$ and provide valuable insights into the fundamental many-body interactions governing half-metallic ferromagnets.</description>

      <title>Splitting of electronic spectrum in paramagnetic phase of itinerant ferromagnets and altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study self-energy effects, induced by strong magnetic fluctuations in paramagnetic phase of strongly-correlated itinerant magnets within the density functional theory combined with the dynamical mean field theory (DFT+DMFT approach) and its non-local extension. As concrete examples, we consider $\alpha$-iron, half metal CrO$_2$, van der Waals material CrTe$_2$, and altermagnet CrSb. We show that both local and non-local magnetic correlations yield splitting of the electronic spectrum in the paramagnetic phase, such that it closely resembles the DFT band structure in the ordered phase. The relative importance of non-local vs. local correlations depends on the proximity to half filling of $d$ states: closer to half filling, the role of local correlations increases. Although the obtained split bands do not possess a certain spin projection, their splitting suppresses spectral weight at the Fermi level. The obtained electronic states are also expected to be easily spin polarized by a weak external magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Resolving the Bulk-Boundary Correspondence Paradox on Low-Symmetry Surfaces of Weyl Semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-symmetry surfaces of topological semimetals provide access to boundary phenomena hidden on conventional facets, yet systematic studies remain scarce due to experimental challenges and the lack of a general framework for reconciling bulk and surface periodicities. Inspired by experimental observations on the (103) surface of the Weyl semimetal NdAlSi, which reveal an apparent mismatch between the surface Brillouin zone and bulk-projected Weyl points, we establish a least common multiple criterion for surface commensuration. We show that successive bulk Brillouin zones generate laterally shifted replicas that only close after three unit cells, giving rise to a momentum-space moire modulation and thereby resolving the apparent breakdown of bulk-boundary correspondence. Density functional theory slab calculations based on this three-cell supercell, together with Green's function methods that naturally incorporate multiple bulk zones, quantitatively reproduce the experiment. Beyond NdAlSi, the least common multiple framework provides a universal prescription for reconciling bulk and surface states on arbitrary facets, suggesting that overlapping Fermi arcs may hybridize into closed loops and enabling unconventional transport and interference phenomena unique to low-symmetry surfaces, accompanied by emergent moire patterns in momentum space.</description>

      <title>Quantum Metric Corrections to Liouville's Theorem and Chiral Kinetic Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasiparticles may possess not only Berry curvature but also a quantum metric in momentum space. We develop a canonical formalism for such quasiparticles based on the Dirac brackets, and demonstrate that quantum metric modifies the phase-space density of states at $\mathcal{O}(\hbar^2)$, leading to corrections to Liouville's theorem, kinetic theory, and related physical quantities. In particular, we show that, in the presence of an inhomogeneous electric field, quantum metric induces corrections to the energy density and energy current. Applied to chiral fermions, this framework provides a nonlinear extension of chiral kinetic theory consistent with quantum field theory. Our work paves the way to potential applications of the quantum metric in high-energy physics and astrophysics.</description>
