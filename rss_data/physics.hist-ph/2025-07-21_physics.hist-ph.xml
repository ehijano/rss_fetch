      <title>A translation of the paper "Presentation of some observations that could be made to shed light on Meteorology" by Johann Heinrich Lambert (1771)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper is an English translation of the 1771 old-French paper by Johann Heinrich Lambert in the "M\'emoires de l'Acad\'emie Royale des Sciences et Belles-Lettres de Berlin" where he imagined in a prophetic way the same present global meteorological observation system. Johann Heinrich Lambert is the same polymath who also defined the azimuthal, cylindrical and conical equal area, as well as conformal conic map projections still used in Meteorology to plot the weather maps: the so-called Lambert's projections. Note also that Lambert (1779) will derive in a next paper an absolute lower limit for the temperatures (at about -270{\deg}C), long after the first attempt by Guillaume Amontons (1703) (at about -240{\deg}C), but far before the definition by William Thomson (1848, next Lord Kelvin) of the so-called absolute Kelvin's scale of temperature still used nowadays (at about -273{\deg}C).</description>

      <title>Historical origins of quantum entanglement in particle physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the historical origins of quantum entanglement in particle physics are systematically and thoroughly investigated. 1957, Bohm and Aharonov noted that the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen correlation had been experimentally realised in the 1949 experiment of Chien-Shiung Wu and Shaknov. This was the first time in history that spatially separated quantum entanglement was explicitly realised in a controlled experiment. Wheeler first proposed such an experiment as a test of quantum electrodynamics, but his calculation was in error; the correct theoretical calculations came from Ward and Price, as well as from Snyder, Pasternack and Hornbostel, and the result was in accordance with Yang's 1949 selection rule. After the publication of Bell's inequality in 1964, it was considered whether it could be tested by using the Wu-Shaknov experiment. This gave an impetus to the field, and a new experiment was done by Wu's group, though it was not successful as a test of Bell inequality violation. In 1957, Tsung-Dao Lee, Reinhard Oehme and Chen Ning Yang established the quantum mechanical description of the kaons and found that the neutral kaon is a two-state system. In 1958, based on an approach similar to Yang's 1949 selection rule, Goldhaber, Lee and Yang were the first to write down the entangled states of kaon pairs, in which a single kaon can be charged or neutral. This gave, for the first time, quantum entanglement of internal degrees of freedom of high-energy particles other than photons. In 1960, as unpublished work, Lee and Yang discussed the consequences of quantum entanglement of neutral kaon pairs. We also describe several physicists in the past, especially Ward. A Chinese version of this paper was published in early 2023.</description>

      <title>Strict renormalizability as a paradigm for fundamental physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An important theoretical achievement of the last century was the realization that strict renormalizability can be a powerful criterion to select Lagrangians in the framework of perturbative quantum field theory. The Standard Model Lagrangian (without gravity) is strictly renormalizable from a perturbative point of view. On the other hand, the inclusion of gravity seems not to respect this criterion, since general relativity is perturbatively non-renormalizable. The aim of this work is to provide concrete evidence that strict renormalizability is still a valid criterion even when applied to gravity. First, we show that adding quadratic curvature terms to the Einstein-Hilbert action gives rise to a strictly renormalizable theory known as quadratic gravity. Second, we argue that this unique theory represents the most conservative approach to quantum gravity and, at the same time, is highly predictive, as it can explain new physics beyond general relativity already in the sub-Planckian regime. In particular, it provides one of the best fits to the CMB anisotropies via Starobinsky inflation and makes sharp cosmological predictions that can be tested in the near future. Finally, we comment on the (super-)Planckian regime and conclude with a historical note.</description>
