      <title>Analyzing WGC and WCCC through Charged Scalar Fields Fluxes with Charged AdS Black Holes Surrounded by Perfect Fluid Dark Matter in the CFT Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive investigation into the weak cosmic censorship conjecture (WCCC) for Reissner-Nordstr\"om (R-N) AdS black holes that are influenced by Perfect Fluid Dark Matter (PFDM). Our study is framed within the context of Conformal Field Theory (CFT) thermodynamics. We delve into the principles of energy flux and mass-energy equivalence to explore the interplay between the weak gravity conjecture (WGC) and the WCCC. Our analysis begins by examining the interaction between incoming and outgoing energy fluxes, which induces changes in the black hole's properties. By applying the first law of thermodynamics, we assess the validity of the second law in these dynamic scenarios. We also consider equilibrium conditions that involve both absorption and superradiance processes. Utilizing the framework of black hole thermodynamics within CFT, we demonstrate that the WCCC is upheld if the black hole is in or near an extremal state, particularly when it is subjected to radiation and particle absorption. This finding is significant as it reinforces the robustness of the WCCC under these specific conditions. Furthermore, we uncover additional insights by employing mass-energy equivalence principles and conducting second-order approximations near the extremality state. Specifically, we find that when a black hole radiates and its central charge surpasses the scaled electric charge, the emitted superradiant particles adhere to the WGC. This adherence results in the black hole moving away from its extremal state, thereby maintaining the WCCC.</description>

      <title>Light-cone actions and correlators of self-dual theories in AdS$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-dual Yang-Mills and Einstein gravity in Euclidean AdS$_4$ are useful toy models because they can be described by simple scalar Lagrangians exhibiting a new manifestation of the colour/kinematics duality, as recently shown by two of the authors. In this paper, we clarify how the self-dual sectors fit into the full theories. In particular, we explicitly construct the light-cone action for Yang-Mills theory and Einstein gravity in AdS$_4$ in terms of positive and negative helicity fields, where we are able to pinpoint the self-dual sector as expected. We then show that the boundary correlators of these theories take a remarkably simple form in terms of Feynman diagrams in half of flat space, acted on by certain differential operators. We also analyse their soft limits and show that they exhibit Weinberg-like soft factors, where the soft pole which appears in scattering amplitudes is replaced by a derivative with respect to the energy.</description>

      <title>Superadditivity in large $N$ field theories and performance of quantum tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Field theories exhibit dramatic changes in the structure of their operator algebras in the limit where the number of local degrees of freedom ($N$) becomes infinite. An important example of this is that the algebras associated to local subregions may not be additively generated in the limit. We investigate examples and explore the consequences of this ``superadditivity'' phenomenon in large $N$ field theories and holographic systems. In holographic examples we find cases in which superadditive algebras can probe the black hole interior, while the additive algebra cannot. We also discuss how superaddivity explains the sucess of quantum error correction models of holography. Finally we demonstrate how superadditivity is intimately related to the ability of holographic field theories to perform quantum tasks that would naievely be impossible. We argue that the connected wedge theorems (CWTs) of May, Penington, Sorce, and Yoshida, which characterize holographic protocols for quantum tasks, can be re-phrased in terms of superadditive algebras and use this re-phrasing to conjecture a generalization of the CWTs that is an equivalence statement.</description>

      <title>Carroll in Shallow Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discover a surprising connection between Carrollian symmetries and hydrodynamics in the shallow water approximation. Carrollian symmetries arise in the speed of light going to zero limit of relativistic Poincar\'e symmetries. Using a recent gauge theoretic description of shallow water wave equations we find that the actions corresponding to two different waves, viz. the so called flat band solution and the Poincar\'e waves map exactly to the actions of the electric and magnetic sectors of Carrollian electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Tannakian QFT: from spark algebras to quantum groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a nonperturbative construction of Hopf algebras that represent categories of line operators in topological quantum field theory, in terms of semi-extended operators (spark algebras) on pairs of transverse topological boundary conditions. The construction is a direct implementation of Tannakian formalism in QFT. Focusing on d=3 dimensional theories, we find topological definitions of R-matrices, ribbon twists, and the Drinfeld double construction for generalized quantum groups. We illustrate our construction in finite-group gauge theory, and apply it to obtain new results for B-twisted 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ gauge theories, a.k.a. equivariant Rozansky-Witten theory, or supergroup BF theory (including ordinary BF theory with compact gauge group). We reformulate our construction mathematically in terms of abelian and dg tensor categories, and discuss connections with Koszul duality.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates marginal and dipole TsT transformations of a seed type IIB supergravity solution dual to a supersymmetry-preserving deformation of the Klebanov-Witten 4d SCFT. To explore key properties of the deformed theories, we holographically analyze various observables, including Wilson loops, 't Hooft loops, Entanglement Entropy, and holographic central charge flow. Moreover, we focus on detecting which of these observables are affected by the dynamics of the Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes resulting from the circle compactification.</description>

      <title>Background ambiguity and the G\"odel double copy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the assumptions regarding spacetime backgrounds underlying the classical double copy. We argue (contrary to the norm) that single-copy fields naturally constructed on the original curved background metric are only interpretable on a flat metric when such a well-defined limit exists, for which Kerr--Schild coordinates offer a natural choice. As an explicit example where such a distinction matters, we initiate an exploration of single-copies for the G\"odel universe. This metric lacks a (geodesic) Kerr--Schild representation yet is Petrov type-D, meaning the technology of the ``Weyl double copy" may be utilized. The Weyl derived single copy has many desirable features, including matching the defining properties of the spacetime, and being sourced by the mixed Ricci tensor just as Kerr--Schild single copies are. To compare, we propose a sourced flat-space single-copy interpretation for the G\"odel metric by leveraging its symmetries, and find that this proposal lacks the defining properties of the spacetime, and is not consistent with the flat limit of our curved-space single copy. Notably, this inconsistency does not occur in Kerr--Schild metrics. Our curved-space single copy also lead to the same electromagnetic analogue of the G\"odel universe found separately through tidal force analogies, opening a new avenue of exploration between the double copy and gravitoelectromagnetism programs.</description>

      <title>Super Yang-Mills Action from Hybrid Superstring Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explicitly compute the effective action from Open Superstring Field Theory in the hybrid formalism to quartic order in the $\alpha'\rightarrow 0$ limit, and show that it reproduces ten-dimensional Super Yang-Mills in terms of four-dimensional superfields. We also show that in this limit the gauge transformations coincide with SYM to all orders, which means that the effective action should reproduce SYM to all orders.</description>

      <title>Emergent supersymmetry in the gauged non-linear $\Sigma$-model and the transition from integrability to chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-linear $\Sigma$-Model minimally coupled with Maxwell theory in $3+1$ dimensions possesses a topologically non-trivial sector characterized by ``lasagna''-like configurations. We demonstrate that, when a specific quantization condition is met, the associated second-order field equations admit a first-order Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield system. This discloses a hidden $(1+1)$-dimensional supersymmetry with $\mathcal{N}=2$ supercharges. We examine the supersymmetric imprint on the time-dependent regime, with particular emphasis on the transition from integrability to chaos.</description>

      <title>On Chord Dynamics and Complexity Growth in Double-Scaled SYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the time evolution generated by the two-sided chord Hamiltonian in the double-scaled SYK model, which produces a probability distribution over operators in the double-scaled algebra. Via the bulk-to-boundary map, this distribution translates into dynamic profiles of bulk states within the chord Hilbert space. We derive analytic expressions for these states, valid across a wide parameter range and at all time scales. Additionally, we show how distinct semi-classical behaviors emerge by localizing within specific regions of the energy spectrum in the semi-classical limit.
  We reformulate the doubled Hilbert space formalism as an isometric map between the one-particle sector of the chord Hilbert space and the doubled zero-particle sector. Using this map, we obtain analytic results for correlation functions and examine the dynamical properties of operator Krylov complexity for chords, establishing an equivalence between the chord number generating function and the crossed four-point correlation function. We also consider finite-temperature effects, showing how operator spreading slows as temperature decreases.
  In the semi-classical limit, we apply a saddle point analysis and include the one-loop determinant to derive the normalized time-ordered four-point correlation function. The leading correction mirrors the \(1/N\) connected contribution observed in the large-\(p\) SYK model at infinite temperature. Finally, we analyze the time evolution of operator Krylov complexity for a matter chord in the triple-scaled regime, linking it to the renormalized two-sided length in JT gravity with matter.</description>

      <title>Ensembles of center vortices and chains: Insights from a natural lattice framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A scenario to understand the asymptotic properties of confinement between quark probes, based on a mixed ensemble of percolating center vortices and chains, was initially proposed by one of us in a non-Abelian setting. More recently, the same physics was reobtained by means of a Schr\"odinger wavefunctional peaked at Abelian-projected configurations, which deals with center-vortex lines and pointlike monopoles in real space. In this work, we will reassess both settings in the unified language provided by the Weingarten lattice representation for the sum over surfaces. In particular, in the phase where surfaces are stabilized by contact interactions and percolate, lattice gauge fields emerge. This generalizes the Goldstone modes in an Abelian loop condensate to the case where non-Abelian degrees of freedom are present. In this language, the different natural matching properties of elementary center-vortex worldsurfaces and monopole worldlines can be easily characterized. In the lattice, both the Abelian and non-Abelian settings implement the original idea that the mixed ensemble conciliates $N$-ality with the formation of a confining flux tube. Common features, differences in the continuum, and perspectives will also be addressed.</description>

      <title>Half-line kink scattering in the $\phi^4$ model with Dirichlet boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the dynamics of a scalar field in the nonintegrable $\displaystyle \phi ^{4}$ model, restricted to the half-line. Here we consider singular solutions that interpolate the Dirichlet boundary condition $\phi(x=0,t)=H$ and their scattering with the regular kink solution. The simulations reveal a rich variety of phenomena in the field dynamics, such as the formation of a kink-antikink pair, the generation of oscillons by the boundary perturbations, and the interaction between these objects and the boundary, which causes the emergence of boundary-induced resonant scatterings (for example, oscillon-boundary bound states and kink generation by oscillon-boundary collision) founded into complex fractal structures. Linear perturbation analysis was applied to interpret some aspects of the scattering process. The power spectral density of the scalar field at a fixed point leads to several frequency peaks. Most of them can be explained with some interesting insights for the interaction between the scattering products and the boundary.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study AdS form factors, given by the Mellin representation for CFT correlators of local operators in the presence of extended defects. We propose a formula for taking (and expanding around) the flat-space limit. This formula relates the flat-space form factors for particles scattering off an extended object to the high-energy limit of the Mellin amplitude, via a Borel transform. We check the validity of our proposal in a number of examples. As an application, we study the two-point function of local operators in the presence of a 't Hooft loop in 4d $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM, and compute the first few orders of stringy corrections to the AdS form factor of gravitons scattering off a D1 brane.</description>

      <title>Timelike Supersymmetric Solutions of D=3, N=4 Supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study timelike supersymmetric solutions of a $D=3, N=4$ gauged supergravity using Killing spinor bilinears method and prove that AdS$_3$ is the only solution within this class. We then consider the ungauged version of this model. It is found that for this type of solutions, the ungauged theory effectively truncates to a supergravity coupled to a sigma model with a 2-dimensional hyperbolic target space $\mathbb{H}^2$, and all solutions can be expressed in terms of two arbitrary holomorphic functions. The spacetime metric is a warped product of the time direction with a 2-dimensional space, and the warp factor is given in terms of the K\"ahler potential of $\mathbb{H}^2$. We show that when the holomorphic function that determines the sigma model scalar fields is not constant, the metric on the sigma model target manifold becomes part of the spacetime metric. We then look at some special choices for these holomorphic functions for which the spacetime metric and the Killing spinors are only radial dependent. We also derive supersymmetric null solutions of the ungauged model which are pp-waves on the Minkowski spacetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we relate the growth rate of Krylov complexity in the boundary to the radial momentum of an infalling particle in AdS geometry. We show that in general AdS black hole background, our proposal captures the universal behaviors of Krylov complexity at both initial and late times. Hence it can be generally considered as an approximate dual of the Krylov complexity at least in diverse dimensions. Remarkably, for BTZ black holes, our holographic Krylov complexity perfectly matches with that of CFT$_2$ at finite temperatures.</description>

      <title>Decoherence of quantum superpositions by Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, it was shown by Danielson-Satishchandran-Wald (DSW) that for the massive or charged body in a quantum spatial separated superposition state, the presence of a black hole can decohere the superposition inevitably towards capturing the radiation of soft photons or gravitons. In this work, we study the DSW decoherence effect for the static charged body in the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes. By calculating the decohering rate for this case, it is shown that the superposition is decohered by the low frequency photons that propagate through the black hole horizon. For the extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole, the decoherence of quantum superposition is completely suppressed due to the black hole Meissner effect.</description>

      <title>Scaling law for membrane lifetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Membrane configurations in the Banks-Fischler-Shenker-Susskind matrix model are unstable due to the existence of flat directions in the potential and the decay process can be seen as a realization of chaotic scattering. In this note, we compute the lifetime of a membrane in a reduced model. The resulting lifetime exhibits scaling laws with respect to energy, coupling constant and a cut-off scale. We numerically evaluate the scaling exponents, which cannot be fixed by the dimensional analysis. Finally, some applications of the results are discussed.</description>

      <title>Weyl double copy in type D spacetime in four and five dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a second realization of the Weyl double copy (WDC) in four-dimensional algebraic type D spacetime. We show that any type D vacuum solution admits an algebraically general Maxwell scalar on the curved background that squares to give the Weyl scalar. The WDC relation defines a scalar field that satisfies the Klein-Gordon equation sourced by the Weyl scalar on the curved background. We then extend the type D WDC to five dimensions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate ultra slow-roll inflation in a black hole background finding a correspondence between scalar solutions of ultra slow-roll inflation and quasi-normal modes of the cosmological black hole spacetime. Transitions from slow-roll to ultra slow-roll can enhance the peak of the primordial power spectrum increasing the likelihood of primordial black hole formation. By following such a transition in a black hole background, we observe a decay of the slow-roll attractor solution into the quasi-normal modes of the system. With a large black hole, the ringing modes dominate, which could have implications for the background of cosmological scalar perturbations and peak enhancement.</description>

      <title>5d-4d Correspondence in Twisted M-theory on a Conifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study twisted M-theory in a general conifold background, and describe it in terms of a 5d non-commutative Chern-Simons-matter theory. In an equivalent description as twisted type IIA string theory, the matter degrees of freedom arise from topological strings stretched between stacks of D6-branes. In order to study the 5d Chern-Simons-matter theory with a boundary, we first construct and investigate the properties of a 4d non-commutative gauged chiral WZW model. We prove the gauge invariant coupling of this 4d theory to the bulk 5d Chern-Simons theory defined on $\mathbb{R}_+ \times \mathbb{C}^2 $, and further generalize our results to the 5d Chern-Simons-matter theory. We also investigate the toroidal current algebra of the 4d chiral WZW model that arises from radial quantization along one of the complex planes. Finally, we show that a gauged non-commutative chiral 4d WZW model arises from the partition function for quantum 5d non-commutative Chern-Simons theory with boundaries in the BV-BFV formalism, and further generalize this 5d-4d correspondence to the 5d non-commutative Chern-Simons-matter theory for the case of adjoint matter.</description>

      <title>Spectral Constraints on Theories of Colored Particles and Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we consider effective field theories for light fields transforming under the fundamental or adjoint representation of a continuous group. We demonstrate that in the presence of gravity, crossing symmetry combined with two subtraction sum rules, leads to stringent constraints on the spectrum of its ultraviolet (UV) completion. Such constraints come in the form of necessary conditions on the symmetry group irreps of the UV states. This is in sharp contrast with non-gravitational theories where anything goes. Beautifully, the graviton pole is the anchor of our argument, not an obstruction. Using numerical methods, we also demonstrate that the massless spin-2 must be a singlet under said symmetry group.</description>

      <title>On Gravity Implication in the Wavefunction Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by an ontic view of the wavefunction in quantum mechanics and motivated by the universal interaction of gravity, we discuss a possible gravity implication in the state collapse mechanism. Concretely, we investigate the stability of the spatial superposition of a massive quantum state under the gravity effect. In this context, we argue that the stability of the spatially superposed state depends on its gravitational self-energy originating from the effective mass density distribution through the spatially localized eigenstates. We reveal that the gravitational self-interaction between the different spacetime curvatures created by the eigenstate effective masses leads to the reduction of the superposed state to one of the possible localized states. Among others, we discuss such a gravity-driven state reduction. Then, we approach the corresponding collapse time and the induced effective electric current in the case of a charged state, as well as the possible detection aspects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce supersymmetric extensions of the Hom-Lie deformation of the Virasoro algebra, as realized in the GL(1,1) quantum superspace, for Bloch electron systems under Zeeman effects. The construction is achieved by defining generators through magnetic translations and spin matrix bases, specifically for the N=1 and N=2 supersymmetric deformed algebras. This approach reveals a structural parallel between the deformed algebra in quantum superspace and its manifestation in Bloch electron systems.</description>

      <title>Holographic Carrollian Currents for Massless Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the Ward identities of a Carrollian CFT stress tensor at null infinity reproduce the leading and subleading soft graviton theorems for massless scattering in the bulk. We deduce the expressions of the stress tensor components in terms of the bulk radiative modes, and these components turn out to be local at $\mathscr{I}$ in terms of the twistor potentials. This analysis makes the correspondence between the large-time limit of Carrollian amplitudes and the soft limit of momentum space amplitudes manifest. We then construct Carrollian CFT currents from the ascendants of the hard graviton operator, which satisfy the $Lw_{1+\infty}$ algebra. We show that the large-time limit of their Ward identities implies an infinite tower of projected soft graviton theorems in the bulk, while their finite-time OPEs encode the collinear limit of scattering amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic charges of $p-$forms and their dualities in any $D$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the surface charges associated to $p-$form gauge fields in arbitrary spacetime dimension for large values of the radial coordinate. In the critical dimension where radiation and Coulomb falloff coincide we find asymptotic charges involving asymptotic parameters, i.e. parameters with a component of order zero in the radial coordinate. However, in different dimensions we still find nontrivial asymptotic charges now involving parameters that are not asymptotic times the radiation-order fields. For $p$=1 and $D&gt;4$, our charges thus differ from those presented in the literature. We then show that under Hodge duality electric charges for $p-$forms are mapped to magnetic charges for the dual $q-$forms, with $q = D-p-2$. For charges involving fields with radiation falloffs the duality relates charges that are finite and nonvanishing. For the case of Coulomb falloffs, above or below the critical dimension, Hodge duality exchanges overleading charges in one theory with subleading ones in its dual counterpart.</description>

      <title>On scale-separated supersymmetric AdS$_2$ flux vacua</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that scale-separated AdS$_2$ vacua with at least two preserved supercharges cannot arise from flux compactifications in a regime of computational control. We deduce this by showing that the AdS$_2$ scale is parametrically of the same order as the tension of a fundamental BPS domain wall, which provides an upper bound on the UV cutoff. Since the latter does not need to be associated to any geometric scale, the argument excludes scale separation in a broader sense than what commonly considered. Our claim is exemplified by a bottom-up 2D supergravity analysis as well as top-down models from Type II flux compactifications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the relationship between linear and non-linear causality in theories of dissipative relativistic fluid dynamics. While for some fluid-dynamical theories, a linearized causality analysis can be used to determine whether the full non-linear theory is causal, for others it can not. As an illustration, we study relativistic viscous magnetohydrodynamics supplemented by a neutral-particle current, with resistive corrections to the conservation of magnetic flux. The dissipative theory has 10 transport coefficients, including anisotropic viscosities, electric resistivities, and neutral-particle conductivities. We show how causality properties of this magnetohydrodynamic theory, in the most general fluid frame, may be understood from the linearized analysis.</description>

      <title>Holographic pseudoentanglement and the complexity of the AdS/CFT dictionary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The `quantum gravity in the lab' paradigm suggests that quantum computers might shed light on quantum gravity by simulating the CFT side of the AdS/CFT correspondence and mapping the results to the AdS side. This relies on the assumption that the duality map (the `dictionary') is efficient to compute. In this work, we show that the complexity of the AdS/CFT dictionary is surprisingly subtle: there might be cases in which one can efficiently apply operators to the CFT state (a task we call 'operator reconstruction') without being able to extract basic properties of the dual bulk state such as its geometry (which we call 'geometry reconstruction'). Geometry reconstruction corresponds to the setting where we want to extract properties of a completely unknown bulk dual from a simulated CFT boundary state.
  We demonstrate that geometry reconstruction may be generically hard due to the connection between geometry and entanglement in holography. In particular we construct ensembles of states whose entanglement approximately obey the Ryu-Takayanagi formula for arbitrary geometries, but which are nevertheless computationally indistinguishable. This suggests that even for states with the special entanglement structure of holographic CFT states, geometry reconstruction might be hard. This result should be compared with existing evidence that operator reconstruction is generically easy in AdS/CFT. A useful analogy for the difference between these two tasks is quantum fully homomorphic encryption (FHE): this encrypts quantum states in such a way that no efficient adversary can learn properties of the state, but operators can be applied efficiently to the encrypted state. We show that quantum FHE can separate the complexity of geometry reconstruction vs operator reconstruction, which raises the question whether FHE could be a useful lens through which to view AdS/CFT.</description>

      <title>Parametrization of GPDs from t-channel string exchange in AdS spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a string-based parametrization for nucleon quark and gluon generalized parton distributions (GPDs) that is valid for all skewness. Our approach leverages conformal moments, representing them as the sum of spin-j nucleon A-form factor and skewness-dependent spin-j nucleon D-form factor, derived from t-channel string exchange in AdS spaces consistent with Lorentz invariance and unitarity. This model-independent framework, satisfying the polynomiality condition due to Lorentz invariance, uses Mellin moments from empirical data to estimate these form factors. With just five Regge slope parameters, our method accurately produces various nucleon quark GPD types and symmetric nucleon gluon GPDs through pertinent Mellin-Barnes integrals. Our isovector nucleon quark GPD is in agreement with existing lattice data, promising to improve the empirical extraction and global analysis of nucleon GPDs in exclusive processes, by avoiding the deconvolution problem at any skewness, for the first time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive universal formulae for integrating out heavy degrees of freedom in scalar field theories up to one-loop level in terms of covariant quantities associated with the geometry of the field manifold. The universal matching results can be readily applied to phenomenologically interesting extensions of the Standard Model, as we demonstrate using a singlet scalar example. We also discuss the role of field redefinitions in effective field theory matching and simplifications resulting from going to a field basis where interactions are encoded in a nontrivial metric on the field manifold.</description>

      <title>Non-invertible duality and symmetry topological order of one-dimensional lattice models with spatially modulated symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between self-duality and spatially modulated symmetry of generalized $N$-state clock models, which include the transverse-field Ising model and ordinary $N$-state clock models as special cases. The spatially modulated symmetry of the model becomes trivial when the model's parameters satisfy a specific number-theoretic relation. We find that the duality is non-invertible when the spatially modulated symmetry remains nontrivial, and show that this non-invertibility is resolved by introducing a generalized $\mathbb{Z}_N$ toric code, which manifests ultraviolet/infrared mixing, as the bulk topological order. In this framework, the boundary duality transformation corresponds to the boundary action of a bulk symmetry transformation, with the endpoint of the bulk symmetry defect realizing the boundary duality defect. Our results illuminate not only a holographic perspective on dualities but also a relationship between spatially modulated symmetry and ultraviolet/infrared mixing in one higher dimension.</description>

      <title>Cosmic (super)strings with a time-varying tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic (super)strings offer promising ways to test ideas about the early universe and physics at high energies. While in field theory constructions their tension is usually assumed to be constant (or at most slowly-varying), this is often not the case in the context of String Theory. Indeed, the tensions of both fundamental and field theory strings within a string compactification depend on the expectation values of the moduli, which in turn can vary with time. We discuss how the evolution of a cosmic string network changes with a time-dependent tension, both for long-strings and closed loops, by providing an appropriate generalisation of the Velocity One Scale (VOS) model and its implications. The resulting phenomenology is very rich, exhibiting novel features such as growing loops, percolation and a radiation-like behaviour of the long string network. We conclude with a few remarks on the impact for gravitational wave emission.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Mutation-Acyclicity of Quivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool in mathematical research in recent years. This paper applies ML techniques to the study of quivers--a type of directed multigraph with significant relevance in algebra, combinatorics, computer science, and mathematical physics. Specifically, we focus on the challenging problem of determining the mutation-acyclicity of a quiver on 4 vertices, a property that is pivotal since mutation-acyclicity is often a necessary condition for theorems involving path algebras and cluster algebras. Although this classification is known for quivers with at most 3 vertices, little is known about quivers on more than 3 vertices. We give a computer-assisted proof of a theorem to prove that mutation-acyclicity is decidable for quivers on 4 vertices with edge weight at most 2. By leveraging neural networks (NNs) and support vector machines (SVMs), we then accurately classify more general 4-vertex quivers as mutation-acyclic or non-mutation-acyclic. Our results demonstrate that ML models can efficiently detect mutation-acyclicity, providing a promising computational approach to this combinatorial problem, from which the trained SVM equation provides a starting point to guide future theoretical development.</description>

      <title>Variety of disc wind-driven explosions in massive rotating stars. II. Dependence on the progenitor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We assess the variance of supernova(SN)-like explosions associated with the core collapse of rotating massive stars into a black hole-accretion disc system under changes in the progenitor structure. Our model of the central engine evolves the black hole and the disc through the transfer of matter and angular momentum and includes the contribution of the disc wind. We perform two-dimensional, non-relativistic, hydrodynamics simulations using the open-source hydrodynamic code Athena++, for which we develop a method to calculate self-gravity for axially symmetric density distributions. For a fixed model of the wind injection, we explore the explosion characteristics for progenitors with zero-age main-sequence masses from 9 to 40 $M_\odot$ and different degrees of rotation. Our outcomes reveal a wide range of explosion energies with $E_\mathrm{expl}$ spanning from $\sim 0.3\times10^{51}$~erg to $ &gt; 8\times 10^{51}$~erg and ejecta mass $M_\mathrm{ej}$ from $\sim 0.6$ to $&gt; 10 M_\odot$. Our results are in agreement with some range of the observational data of stripped-envelope and high-energy SNe such as broad-lined type Ic SNe, but we measure a stronger correlation between $E_\mathrm{expl}$ and $M_\mathrm{ej}$. We also provide an estimate of the $^{56}$Ni mass produced in our models which goes from $\sim0.04\;M_\odot$ to $\sim 1.3\;M_\odot$. The $^{56}$Ni mass shows a correlation with the mass and the angular velocity of the progenitor: more massive and faster rotating progenitors tend to produce a higher amount of $^{56}$Ni. Finally, we present a criterion that allows the selection of a potential collapsar progenitor from the observed explosion energy.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Amplification of Chiral Gravitational Waves and the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate cosmological vacuum amplification of gravitational waves in dynamical Chern-Simons gravity. We develop a comprehensive framework to compute graviton production induced by the parity violating Pontryagin coupling and study its imprint on the stochastic gravitational wave background energy power spectrum. We explore gravitational vacuum amplification in four concrete scenarios for the evolution of the Chern-Simons pseudoscalar. We show that a parity-violating contribution dominates over an initially flat spectrum when the velocity of the pseudoscalar quickly interpolates between two asymptotically constant values or when it is nonvanishing and constant through a finite period of time. This is also the case when we parametrize the pseudoscalar evolution by a perfect fluid with radiation- and dust-like equations of state for large enough values of its energy density. The resulting spectra are compared with the sensitivity curves of current and future gravitational wave observational searches.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Seebeck effect of the QGP medium using a novel relaxation time approximation model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The highly energetic particle medium formed in the ultrarelativistic heavy ion collision displays a notable difference in temperatures between its central and peripheral regions. This temperature gradient can generate an electric field within the medium, a phenomenon referred to as the Seebeck effect. We have estimated the Seebeck coefficient for a dense quark-gluon plasma medium by using the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation in the recently developed novel relaxation time approximation (RTA) model within the kinetic theory framework. This study explores the Seebeck coefficient of individual quark flavors as well as the entire partonic medium, with the emphasis on its dependence on the temperature and the chemical potential. Our observation indicates that, for given current quark masses, the magnitude of the Seebeck coefficient for each quark flavor as well as for the partonic medium decreases as the temperature rises and increases as the chemical potential increases. Furthermore, we have investigated the Seebeck effect by considering the partonic interactions described in perturbative thermal QCD within the quasiparticle model. In addition, we have presented a comparison between our findings and the results of the standard RTA model.</description>

      <title>Split Cherenkov radiation in isotropic chiral matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral matter exhibits unique electromagnetic responses due to the macroscopic manifestation of the chiral anomaly as anomalous transport currents. Here, we study the modification of electromagnetic radiation in isotropic chiral matter characterized by an axion coupling that varies linearly over time $\theta(t) = b_0 t$. Using Carroll-Field-Jackiw electrodynamics, we derive the causal Green's function to investigate the stability and radiation properties of the system. Even though the plane-wave modes of isotropic chiral matter exhibit imaginary frequencies for long wavelengths, which might suggest instability in the system, we show that their contribution is confined to the near-field region. Also we find no exponentially growing fields at arbitrarily large times, so that stability is preserved. Under these conditions the radiation yields a positive energy flux, although this is not an inherent property of the general definition. In the case of a fast-moving charge, we confirm the existence of vacuum Cherenkov radiation and show that, for refractive indices $n &gt; 1$, the Cherenkov cone can split into two concentric cones with opposite circular polarizations. This split, governed by the speed of the particle $v$, $n$ and $b_0$, resembles the optical spin-Hall effect and offers potential applications for creating circularly polarized terahertz (THz) light sources. Our Green's function approach provides a general method for analyzing radiation in chiral matter, from Weyl semimetals to quark-gluon plasmas, and can be extended to systems such as oscillating dipoles and accelerated charges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In mixed quantum states, the notion of symmetry is divided into two types: strong and weak symmetry. While spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) for a weak symmetry is detected by two-point correlation functions, SSB for a strong symmetry is characterized by the Renyi-2 correlators. In this work, we present a way to construct various SSB phases for strong symmetries, starting from the ground state phase diagram of lattice gauge theory models. In addition to introducing a new type of mixed-state topological phases, we provide models of the criticalities between them, including those with gapless symmetry-protected topological order. We clarify that the ground states of lattice gauge theories are purified states of the corresponding mixed SSB states. Our construction can be applied to any finite gauge theory and offers a framework to study quantum operations between mixed quantum phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the response function of an inertial Unruh-deWitt detector in an impulsive plane wave spacetime. Through symmetry considerations applied to the Wightman function, we demonstrate that the response function remains invariant for any inertial detector, even for those experiencing a discontinuous lightcone coordinate shift after interacting with the shockwave. This implies that the vacuum state in an impulsive plane wave spacetime is preserved under the associated spacetime symmetries. Additionally, we confirm that the quantum imprint of the shockwave, as discussed in [J. High Energ. Phys. 2021, 54 (2021)], is not an artifact and exhibits a distinct characteristic form. We identify this form by defining a "renormalized" response function for an eternally inertial detector, with Minkowski spacetime as a reference.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we start by examining a spherically symmetric black hole within the framework of non-commutative geometry and apply a modified Newman-Janis method to obtain a new rotating solution. We then investigate its consequences, focusing on the horizon structure, ergospheres, and the black hole's angular velocity. Following this, a detailed thermodynamic analysis is performed, covering surface gravity, Hawking temperature, entropy, and heat capacity. We also study geodesic motion, with particular emphasis on null geodesics and their associated radial accelerations. Additionally, the photon sphere and the resulting black hole shadows are explored. Finally, we compute the quasinormal modes for scalar perturbations using the 6th-order WKB approximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The no-cloning principle has played a foundational role in quantum information and cryptography. Following a long-standing tradition of studying quantum mechanical phenomena through the lens of interactive games, Broadbent and Lord (TQC 2020) formalized cloning games in order to quantitatively capture no-cloning in the context of unclonable encryption schemes.
  The conceptual contribution of this paper is the new, natural, notion of Haar cloning games together with two applications. In the area of black-hole physics, our game reveals that, in an idealized model of a black hole which features Haar random (or pseudorandom) scrambling dynamics, the information from infalling entangled qubits can only be recovered from either the interior or the exterior of the black hole -- but never from both places at the same time. In the area of quantum cryptography, our game helps us construct succinct unclonable encryption schemes from the existence of pseudorandom unitaries, thereby, for the first time, bridging the gap between "MicroCrypt" and unclonable cryptography. The technical contribution of this work is a tight analysis of Haar cloning games which requires us to overcome many long-standing barriers in our understanding of cloning games. Answering these questions provably requires us to go beyond existing methods (Tomamichel, Fehr, Kaniewski and Wehner, New Journal of Physics 2013). In particular, we show a new technique for analyzing cloning games with respect to binary phase states through the lens of binary subtypes, and combine it with novel bounds on the operator norms of block-wise tensor products of matrices.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the Berry phase arising from axion-gauge-boson and axion-fermion interactions. The effective Hamiltonians in these two systems are shown to share the same form, enabling a unified description of the Berry phase. This approach offers a new perspective on certain axion experiments, including photon birefringence and storage-ring experiments. Additionally, we conceptually propose a novel photon-ring experiment for axion detection. Furthermore, we demonstrate that measuring the axion-induced Berry phase provides a unique way for probing the global structure of the Standard Model (SM) gauge group and axion-related generalized symmetries.</description>

Abstract: This document summarizes the discussions which took place during the PITT-PACC Workshop entitled "Non-Standard Cosmological Epochs and Expansion Histories," held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Sept. 5-7, 2024. Much like the non-standard cosmological epochs that were the subject of these discussions, the format of this workshop was also non-standard. Rather than consisting of a series of talks from participants, with each person presenting their own work, this workshop was instead organized around free-form discussion blocks, with each centered on a different overall theme and guided by a different set of Discussion Leaders. This document is not intended to serve as a comprehensive review of these topics, but rather as an informal record of the discussions that took place during the workshop, in the hope that the content and free-flowing spirit of these discussions may inspire new ideas and research directions.</description>

      <title>Machine learning and optimization-based approaches to duality in statistical physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notion of duality -- that a given physical system can have two different mathematical descriptions -- is a key idea in modern theoretical physics. Establishing a duality in lattice statistical mechanics models requires the construction of a dual Hamiltonian and a map from the original to the dual observables. By using simple neural networks to parameterize these maps and introducing a loss function that penalises the difference between correlation functions in original and dual models, we formulate the process of duality discovery as an optimization problem. We numerically solve this problem and show that our framework can rediscover the celebrated Kramers-Wannier duality for the 2d Ising model, reconstructing the known mapping of temperatures. We also discuss an alternative approach which uses known features of the mapping of topological lines to reduce the problem to optimizing the couplings in a dual Hamiltonian, and explore next-to-nearest neighbour deformations of the 2d Ising duality. We discuss future directions and prospects for discovering new dualities within this framework.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking To GR in SO(4,2) Gravitational Yang-Mills Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a Yang-Mills type gauge theory of gravity based on the conformal group SO(4,2) coupled to a conformally invariant real scalar field. The goal is to generate fundamental dimensional constants via spontaneous breakdown of the conformal symmetry. In the absence of other matter couplings the resulting theory resembles Weyl-Einstein gravity, {with the Newton constant given by the square of the (constant) vacuum expectation value of the scalar, the cosmological constant determined by the quartic coupling constant of the scalar field and the Weyl to Einstein transition scale determined by the Yang-Mills coupling constant.} The emergent theory in the long-wave-length limit is Einstein gravity with cosmological constant. As an illustrative example we present an exact spherically symmetric cosmological solution with perfect fluid energy-momentum tensor that reduces to $\Lambda$FRW in the long-wavelength limit.</description>

      <title>Lattice simulations of axion-U(1) inflation: gravitational waves, magnetic fields, and black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically study axion-U(1) inflation, focusing on the regime where the coupling between axions and gauge fields results in significant backreaction from the amplified gauge fields during inflation. These amplified gauge fields not only generate high-frequency gravitational waves (GWs) but also induce spatial inhomogeneities in the axion field, which can lead to the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs). Both GWs and PBHs serve as key probes for constraining the coupling strength between the axion and gauge fields. We find that, when backreaction is important during inflation, the constraints on the coupling strength due to GW overproduction are relaxed compared to previous studies, in which backreaction matters only after inflation. For PBH formation, understanding the probability density function (PDF) of axion field fluctuations is crucial. While earlier analytical studies assumed that these fluctuations followed a $\chi^2$-distribution, our results suggest that the PDF tends toward a Gaussian distribution in cases where gauge field backreaction is important, regardless whether during or after inflation. We also calculate the spectrum of the produced magnetic fields in this model and find that their strength is compatible with the observed lower limits.</description>

      <title>Modular domain walls and gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss modular domain walls and gravitational waves in a class of supersymmetric models where quark and lepton flavour symmetry emerges from modular symmetry. In such models a single modulus field $\tau$ is often assumed to be stabilised at or near certain fixed point values such as $\tau = {\rm i}$ and $\tau = \omega$ (the cube root of unity), in its fundamental domain. We show that, in the global supersymmetry limit of certain classes of potentials, the vacua at these fixed points may be degenerate, leading to the formation of modular domain walls in the early Universe. Taking supergravity effects into account, in the background of a fixed dilaton field $S$, the degeneracy may be lifted, leading to a bias term in the potential allowing the domain walls to collapse. We study the resulting gravitational wave spectra arising from the dynamics of such modular domain walls, and assess their observability by current and future experiments, as a window into modular flavour symmetry.</description>

      <title>Long-range entanglement from spontaneous non-onsite symmetry breaking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the states of matter arising from the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ non-onsite symmetries. In one spatial dimension, we construct a frustration-free lattice model exhibiting SSB of a non-onsite symmetry, which features the coexistence of two ground states with distinct symmetry-protected topological (SPT) orders. We analytically prove the two-fold ground-state degeneracy and the existence of a finite energy gap. Fixing the symmetry sector yields a long-range entangled ground state that features long-range correlations among non-invertible charged operators. We also present a constant-depth measurement-feedback protocol to prepare such a state with a constant success probability in the thermodynamic limit, which may be of independent interest. Under a symmetric deformation, the SSB persists up to a critical point, beyond which a gapless phase characterized by a conformal field theory emerges. In two spatial dimensions, the SSB of 1-form non-onsite symmetries leads to a long-range entangled state (SPT soup) - a condensate of 1d SPT along any closed loops. On a torus, there are four such locally indistinguishable states that exhibit algebraic correlations between local operators, which we derived via a mapping to the critical $O(2)$ loop model. This provides an intriguing example of `topological quantum criticality'. Our work reveals the exotic features of SSB of non-onsite symmetries, which may lie beyond the framework of topological holography (SymTFT).</description>

      <title>One-loop Gravitational Bremsstrahlung and Waveforms from a Heavy-Mass Effective Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.06111v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using a heavy-mass effective field theory (HEFT), we study gravitational-wave emission in the scattering of two spinless black holes or neutron stars of arbitrary masses at next-to-leading order in the Post-Minkowskian expansion. We compute the contributions to the one-loop scattering amplitude with four scalars and one graviton which are relevant to the calculation of the waveforms, also presenting expressions of classical tree-level amplitudes with four scalars and up to two radiated gravitons. The latter are obtained using a novel on-shell recursion relation for classical amplitudes with four scalars and an arbitrary number of gravitons. Our one-loop five-point amplitude is expressed in terms of a single family of master integrals with the principal value prescription for linearised massive propagators, which we evaluate using differential equations. In our HEFT approach all hyper-classical iterations and quantum corrections to the amplitude are dropped at the diagrammatic level, thereby computing directly contributions to classical physics. Our result exhibits the expected factorisation of infrared divergences, the correct soft limits, and highly nontrivial cancellations of spurious poles. Finally, using our amplitude result we compute numerically the corresponding next-to-leading corrections to the spectral waveforms and the far-field time-domain waveforms using the Newman-Penrose scalar $\Psi_4$.</description>

Abstract: We construct a large family of quantum mechanical systems that give rise to an emergent type III$_1$ von Neumann algebra in the large $N$ limit. Their partition functions are matrix integrals that appear in the study of various gauge theories. We calculate the real-time, finite temperature correlation functions in these systems and show that they are described by an emergent type III$_1$ von Neumann algebra at large $N$. The spectral density underlying this algebra is computed in closed form in terms of the eigenvalue density of a discrete matrix model. Furthermore, we explain how to systematically promote these theories to systems with a Hagedorn transition, and show that a type III$_1$ algebra only emerges above the Hagedorn temperature. Finally, we empirically observe in examples a correspondence between the space of states of the quantum mechanics and Calabi--Yau manifolds.</description>

      <title>Extracting quadratic propagators by refined graphic rule</title>

Abstract: One-loop integrands in Cachazo-He-Yuan (CHY) formula, which is based on the forward limit of tree-level amplitudes, involves linear propagators that are different from quadratic ones in traditional Feynman diagrams. In this paper, we provide a general approach to converting linear propagators in one-loop CHY formula into quadratic propagators, by refined graphic rule stemming from the recursive expansion of tree-level Einstein-Yang-Mills amplitudes. Particularly, we establish the correspondence between refined graphs and bi-adjoint scalar (BS) Feynman diagrams with linear propagators (LPFD). Using this correspondence and graph-based relations of Berends-Giele currents in BS theory, the nonlocal terms accompanied by refined graphs can either be canceled out or be collected into local ones. Once the locality has been achieved, the integrand with linear propagators can be directly arranged into that with quadratic propagators. Following this approach, we first convert the linear propagators in single-trace Yang-Mills-scalar (YMS) integrands (with a pure-scalar loop) into quadratic ones. This result is then demonstrated to match the traditional one-loop Feynman diagrams. The discussions on single-trace YMS integrands are generalized to multi-trace YMS and Yang-Mills integrands.</description>

      <title>Non-invertible symmetries act locally by quantum operations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-invertible symmetries of quantum field theories and many-body systems generalize the concept of symmetries by allowing non-invertible operations in addition to more ordinary invertible ones described by groups. The aim of this paper is to point out that these non-invertible symmetries act on local operators by quantum operations, i.e. completely positive maps between density matrices, which form a natural class of operations containing both unitary evolutions and measurements and play an important role in quantum information theory. This observation will be illustrated by the Kramers--Wannier duality of the one-dimensional quantum Ising chain, which is a prototypical example of non-invertible symmetry operations.</description>

      <title>Stretched Horizon from Conformal Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, it has been observed that the Hartle-Hawking correlators, a signature of smooth horizon, can emerge from certain heavy excited state correlators in the (manifestly non-smooth) BTZ stretched horizon background, in the limit when the stretched horizon approaches the real horizon. In this note, we develop a framework of quantizing the CFT modular Hamiltonian, that explains the necessity of introducing a stretched horizon and the emergence of thermal features in the AdS-Rindler and (planar) BTZ backgrounds. In more detail, we quantize vacuum modular Hamiltonian on a spatial segment of $S^{1}$. Unlike radial quantization, (Euclidean) time circles emerge naturally here which can be contracted smoothly to the `fixed points'(end points of the interval) of this quantization thus providing a direct link to thermal physics. To define a Hilbert space with discrete normalizable states and to construct a Virasoro algebra with finite central extension, a natural regulator ($\epsilon$) is needed around the fixed points. Eventually, in the dual description the fixed points correspond to the horizons of AdS-Rindler patch or (planar) BTZ and the cut-off being the stretched horizon. We construct a (Lorentzian) highest weight representation of that Virasoro algebra. We further demonstrate that two point function in a (vacuum) descendant state of the regulated Hilbert space will reproduce thermal answer in $\epsilon \rightarrow 0$ limit which is analogous to the recent observation of emergent thermality in stretched horizon background. We also argue the thermal entropy of this quantization coincides with entanglement entropy of the subregion. Conversely, the microcanonical entropy corresponding to high energy density of states exactly reproduce the BTZ entropy. Quite remarkably, all these dominant high lying microstates are defined only at finite $\epsilon$ in the regulated Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Integrated correlators in a $\mathcal{N}=2$ SYM theory with fundamental flavors: a matrix-model perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The D theory is a $\mathcal{N}=2$ conformal SYM theory in four dimensions with gauge group SU($N$), four matter hypermultiplets in the fundamental and two in the anti-symmetric representation, and a flavor symmetry that contains a U(4) factor. Its holographic dual is obtained via a combination of orbifold and orientifold projections from Type II B string theory on $\mathrm{AdS}_5 \times S^5$ and possesses a sector of open strings attached to D7 branes with U(4) Chan-Paton factors. The AdS Veneziano amplitude of the U(4) gluons is dual to four-point correlators of moment-map operators of the U(4) flavor symmetry in the D theory. An integrated version of these correlators is captured by a deformation of the D theory in which the fundamental hypermultiplets acquire a mass. The partition function of this massive theory can be evaluated with matrix-model techniques using localization. In this paper we analyze the matrix model of the mass-deformed D theory arising from localization using the so-called "full Lie algebra" approach in a $1/N$ expansion. In particular, we study the partition function and its mass derivatives up to $O(1/N^2)$ corrections obtaining exact expressions that are valid for all values of the 't Hooft coupling. We also analyze their behavior at strong coupling where our results produce useful constraints on the dual open string scattering amplitudes in AdS.</description>

      <title>Krylov complexity as an order parameter for quantum chaotic-integrable transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17054v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Krylov complexity has recently emerged as a new paradigm to characterize quantum chaos in many-body systems. However, which features of Krylov complexity are prerogative of quantum chaotic systems and how they relate to more standard probes, such as spectral statistics or out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs), remain open questions. Recent insights have revealed that in quantum chaotic systems Krylov state complexity exhibits a distinct peak during time evolution before settling into a well-understood late-time plateau. In this work, we propose that this Krylov complexity peak (KCP) is a hallmark of quantum chaotic systems and suggest that its height could serve as an 'order parameter' for quantum chaos. We demonstrate that the KCP effectively identifies chaotic-integrable transitions in two representative quantum mechanical models at both infinite and finite temperature: the mass-deformed Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and the sparse Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. Our findings align with established results from spectral statistics and OTOCs, while introducing an operator-independent diagnostic for quantum chaos, offering more 'universal' insights and a deeper understanding of the general properties of quantum chaotic systems.</description>

Abstract: The dark dimension provides a mechanism to resolve the cosmological hierarchy problem and assembles a colosseum for dark matter contenders. In a series of recent publications we investigated whether primordial black holes (PBHs) perceiving the dark dimension could constitute all of the dark matter in the universe. A key assumption of these investigations is that PBHs remain confined to the brane during the entire evaporation process. As a consequence, the abundance of PBHs evaporating at the present epoch is severely constrained by observations of both the extragalactic and Galactic $\gamma$-ray backgrounds. As a natural outgrowth of these investigations, herein we relax the assumption of brane localized PBHs and reexamine the evaporation process of PBHs which are allowed to escape into the dark dimension. We show that the escape of PBHs from the brane is almost instantaneous. Armed with this pivotal finding we reassess the allowed mass range of PBHs to assemble all cosmological dark matter, which is estimated to be $10^{11} \lesssim M_{\rm BH}/{\rm g} \lesssim 10^{21}$.</description>

Abstract: We compute the electron self-energy in Quantum Electrodynamics to three loops in terms of iterated integrals over kernels of elliptic type. We make use of the differential equations method, augmented by an $\epsilon$-factorized basis, which allows us to gain full control over the differential forms appearing in the iterated integrals to all orders in the dimensional regulator. We obtain compact analytic expressions, for which we provide generalized series expansion representations that allow us to evaluate the result numerically for all values of the electron momentum squared. As a by product, we also obtain $\epsilon$-resummed results for the self-energy in the on-shell limit $p^2 = m^2$, which we use to recompute the known three-loop renormalization constants in the on-shell scheme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study ${\mathcal N} = 1$ $SU(N)$ super Yang-Mills (SYM) theory on $\mathbb{R}^2\times (S^1)_3\times (S^1)_4$ with the 't Hooft twist. The theory becomes weakly coupled if the length $L_4$ of $(S^1)_4$ is sufficiently small, $NL_4\Lambda\ll 1$. We explore the nonperturbative dynamics at the weak-coupling regime by changing the size of $L_3$ and uncover how $3$d monopole/bion-based effective theory for $L_3\gg L_4$ is related to the $2$d vortex-based theory for $L_3\approx L_4$. The highlights of our results are (1) the smooth "weak-weak" continuity of the vacuum structure and gluino condensate during the $3$d-$2$d dimensional reduction, (2) the crossover of Wilson loop behavior from the area law in $3$d to the perimeter law in $2$d via a "double-string" picture, (3) the role of mass deformation in breaking discrete chiral symmetry and restoring the area law in $2$d, and (4) the microscopic investigation of bions during the reduction from $3$d to $2$d and the cancellation of the vacuum energy due to the hidden topological angle. We also discuss the generalization of our results for (1)--(3) from $\mathcal{N}=1$ SYM to QCD with adjoint quarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22843v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by Son's model for graphene, we consider a $(2+1)$-dimensional fermionic system in which fermions are described by four-component spinors. These fermions are proposed to interact with an electromagnetic field originating from a four-dimensional setting, as the graphene plate is embedded in 4d Minkowski spacetime. In this framework, a chiral anomaly arises at the boundary of the plate, stemming from a non-local anomaly action that depends on both the electromagnetic and chiral gauge fields when the chiral transformation is localized. This results in boundary chiral and electric currents, and we explore potentially observable effects when external magnetic or electric fields are applied to the fermionic system.</description>

      <title>Mirror symmetric Gamma conjecture for Fano and Calabi-Yau manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15940v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mirror symmetric Gamma conjecture roughly speaking says that the Gamma class of a manifold determines the asymptotics of (exponential) periods of the mirror. We recast the method in [Iri11] in a more general context and show that the mirror symmetric Gamma conjecture for a Fano manifold F implies, via Laplace transformation, that for the total space K_F of the canonical bundle or for anticanonical sections in F. More generally, we discuss the mirror symmetric Gamma conjecture for the total space of a sum of anti-nef line bundles over F or for nef complete intersections in F.</description>

      <title>Damping of spin waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that, in ideal-spin hydrodynamics, the components of the spin tensor follow damped wave equations. The damping rate is related to nonlocal collisions of the particles in the fluid, which enter at first order in $\hbar$ in a semi-classical expansion. This rate provides an estimate for the timescale of spin equilibration and is computed by considering a system of spin-1/2 fermions interacting via a quartic self-interaction as well as via (screened) one-gluon exchange. It is found that the relaxation times of the components of the spin tensor can become very large compared to the usual dissipative timescales of the system. Our results suggest that the spin degrees of freedom in a heavy-ion collision may not be in equilibrium by the time of freeze-out, and thus should be treated dynamically.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the charge of the graviton using gravitational wave observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If the graviton possesses a non-zero charge $q_g$, gravitational waves (GW) originating from astrophysical sources would experience an additional time delay due to intergalactic magnetic fields. This would result in a modification of the phase evolution of the observed GW signal similar to the effect induced by a massive graviton. As a result, we can reinterpret the most recent upper limits on the graviton's mass as constraints on the joint mass-charge parameter space, finding $|q_g|/{e} &lt; 3\times 10^{-34}$ where $e$ represents the charge of an electron. Additionally, we illustrate that a charged graviton would introduce a constant phase difference in the gravitational waves detected by two spatially separated GW detectors due to the Aharonov-Bohm effect. Using the non-observation of such a phase difference for the GW event GW190814, we establish a mass-independent constraint $|q_g|/e &lt; 2\times 10^{-26}$. To the best of our knowledge, our results constitute the first-ever bounds on the charge of the graviton. We also discuss various caveats involved in our measurements and prospects for strengthening these bounds with future GW observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: New one parameter family of exact solutions in General Relativity with a scalar field is found. The metric is of Liouville type which admits complete separation of variables in the geodesic Hamilton-Jacobi equation. This solution exists for the exponential potential for a scalar field and is invariant with respect to global Lorentz transformations. It describes, in particular, evolution of the space-time with the naked singularity. Solutions corresponding to the naked singularity provide accelerating expansion of the homogeneous and isotropic Universe, and can be smoothly continued along geodesics to infinite past without Big Bang.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of quenched elastic disorder on the nature of the crumpling-to-flat transition of $D$-dimensional polymerized membranes using a two-loop computation near the upper critical dimension $D_c=4$. While the pure system undergoes fluctuation-induced first order transitions below $D_c$ and for an embedding dimension $d&lt;d_{c,pure}\simeq 218.2$, one observes, in presence of disorder, the emergence of various regions of second order governed by a disordered stable fixed point for $d&lt;d_{c1}\sim d_{c,pure}$. This opens the possibility of a new universality class associated with the crumpling-to-flat transition of disordered membranes in $d=3$</description>

      <title>Anomalies in mirror symmetry enriched topological orders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional mirror symmetry enriched topological (SET) orders can be studied using the folding approach: it can be folded along the mirror axis and turned into a bilayer system on which the mirror symmetry acts as a $\mathbb Z_2$ layer-exchange symmetry. How mirror symmetry enriches the topological order is then encoded at the mirror axis, which is a gapped boundary of the folded bilayer system. Based on anyon-condensation theory, we classify possible $\mathbb Z_2$-symmetric gapped boundaries of the folded system. In particular, we derive an $H^2$ obstruction function, which corresponds to an $H^3$ obstruction for topological orders enriched by the time-reversal symmetry instead of mirror symmetry. We demonstrate that states with a nontrivial $H^2$ obstruction function can be constructed on the surface of a three-dimensional mirror SET order.</description>

      <title>Relativistic theory of the viscosity of fluids across the entire energy spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18434v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The shear viscosity is a fundamental transport property of matter. Here we derive a general theory of the viscosity of gases based on the relativistic Langevin equation (deduced from a relativistic Lagrangian) and nonaffine linear response theory. The proposed relativistic theory is able to recover the viscosity of non-relativistic classical gases, with all its key dependencies on mass, temperature, particle diameter and Boltzmann constant, in the limit of Lorentz factor $\gamma=1$. It also unveils the relativistic enhancement mechanism of viscosity. In the limit of ultrarelativistic fluids, the theory provides a new analytical formula which reproduces the cubic increase of viscosity with temperature in agreement with various estimates for hot dense matter and the QGP-type fluid.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional Abelian and non-Abelian gauge Higgs theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gauge symmetries and Higgs mechanisms are key features of theories describing high-energy particle physics and collective phenomena in statistical and condensed-matter physics. In this review we address the collective behavior of systems of multicomponent scalar fields interacting with gauge fields, which can be already present in the underlying microscopic system or emerge only at criticality. The interplay between local gauge and global symmetries determines the phase diagram, the nature of the Higgs phases, and the nature of phase transitions between the high-temperature disordered and the low-temperature Higgs phases. However, additional crucial features determine the universal properties of the critical behavior at continuous transitions. Specifically, their nature also depends on the role played by the gauge modes at criticality. Effective (Abelian or non-Abelian) gauge Higgs field theories emerge when gauge modes develop critical correlations. On the other hand, a more standard critical behavior, which admits an effective description in terms of Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson $\Phi^4$ theories, occurs when gauge-field modes are short ranged at the transition. In the latter case, gauge fields only prevent non-gauge invariant correlation functions from becoming critical. This review covers the recent progress made in the study of Higgs systems with Abelian and non-Abelian gauge fields. We discuss the equilibrium thermodynamic properties of systems with a classical partition function, focusing mainly on three-dimensional systems, and only briefly discussing two-dimensional models. However, by using the quantum-to-classical mapping, the results on the critical behavior for classical systems in $D=d+1$ dimensions can be extended to quantum transitions in $d$ dimensions.</description>

      <title>Lee-Yang-zero ratios for locating a critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19345v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to numerically determine the location of a critical point in general systems using the finite-size scaling of Lee-Yang zeros. This method makes use of the fact that the ratios of Lee-Yang zeros on various spatial volumes intersect at the critical point. While the method is similar to the Binder-cumulant analysis, it is advantageous in suppressing the finite-volume effects arising from the mixing of variables in general systems. We show that the method works successfully for numerically locating the CP in the three-dimensional three-state Potts model with a nonzero external field.</description>

      <title>Kinematic censorship and high energy particle collisions in the Schwarzschild background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider near-horizon collisions between two particles moving freely in the Schwarzschild metric in the region outside the horizon. One of them emerges from a white hole. We scrutiny when such a process can lead to the indefinitely large growth of the energy in the center of mass frame in the point of collision. We also trace how the kinematics of collision manifests itself in preserving the principle of kinematic censorship according to which the energy released in any event of collision cannot be literally infinite. According to this principle, the energy released in any event of collision, must remain finite although it can be made as large as one likes. Also, we find that particle decay near the singularity leads to unbounded release of energy independently of its initial value.</description>
