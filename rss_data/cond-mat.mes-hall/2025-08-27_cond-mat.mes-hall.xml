      <title>Odd relaxation in three-dimensional Fermi liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent theoretical works predict a hierarchy of long-lived, non-hydrodynamic modes in two-dimensional Fermi liquids arising from the feature -- supposedly unique to two dimensions -- that relaxation by head-on scattering is not efficient in the presence of Pauli blocking. This leads to a parity-based separation of scattering rates, with odd-parity modes relaxing much more slowly than even-parity ones. In this work, we establish that a similar effect exists in isotropic three-dimensional Fermi liquids, even though relaxation does not proceed solely by head-on scattering. We show that while the relaxation rates of even and odd modes in 3D share the same leading-order $\sim T^2$ low-temperature scaling typical of Fermi liquids, their magnitudes differ, with odd-parity modes relaxing more slowly than even ones for a broad class of interactions. We find a relative difference between odd-and even-parity relaxation rates as large as $40\%$ just by Pauli blocking alone, with a strong additional dependence on the scattering potential, such that the odd-even staggering is further enhanced by interactions that favor large-angle scattering. We identify signatures of these odd-parity relaxation rates in the static transverse conductivity as well as the transverse collective mode structure. Our results establish the unexpected existence of a tomographic-like regime in higher-dimensional Fermi liquids and suggest experimental probes via transport measurements.</description>

      <title>Odd-Parity Altermagnetism Originated from Orbital Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18361v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Odd-parity spin-splitting plays a central role in spintronics and unconventional superconductivity, yet its microscopic realization in collinear magnetic systems remains elusive. We propose a general symmetry-based strategy for realizing odd-parity altermagnetism by stacking two noncentrosymmetric monolayers in an interlayer antiferromagnetic configuration and applying an in-plane layer-flip operation. In this setting, odd-parity spin-splitting originates from nonrelativistic orbital orders rather than spin-orbit coupling, and is protected by an effective time-reversal symmetry despite the explicit time-reversal symmetry being broken. By exploiting lattice symmetries, our framework enables the realization of both $p$- and $f$-wave altermagnets. The resulting models generically host quantum spin Hall insulator phases, featuring topologically protected helical edge states and quantized spin Hall conductance. Our work expands the landscape of altermagnetic phases and opens a pathway toward spintronics and unconventional superconductivity in altermagnetic systems.</description>

      <title>3D microwave imaging of a van der Waals heterostructure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures offer a tunable platform for the realization of emergent phenomena in layered electron systems. While scanning probe microscopy techniques have proven useful for the characterization of surface states and 2D crystals, the subsurface imaging of quantum phenomena in multi-layer systems presents a significant challenge. In 3D heterostructures, states that occupy different planes can simultaneously contribute to the signal detected by the microscope probe, which complicates image analysis and interpretation. Here we present a quantum imaging technique that offers a glimpse into the third dimension by resolving states out of plane: it extracts the charge density landscape of individual atomic planes inside a vdW heterostructure, layer by layer. As a proof-of-concept, we perform layer-resolved imaging of quantum Hall states and charge disorder in double-layer graphene using milliKelvin microwave impedance microscopy. Here the discrete energy spectrum of the top layer enables transmission of microwaves through gapped states, thus opening direct access to quantum phases in the subsurface layer. Resolving how charge is distributed out-of-plane offers a direct probe of interlayer screening, revealing signatures of negative quantum capacitance driven by many-body correlations. At the same time, we extract key features of the band structure and thermodynamics, including gap sizes. Notably, by imaging the charge distribution on different atomic planes beneath the surface, we shed light on the roles of surface impurities and screening on the stability of fractional quantum Hall states. We also show that the uppermost graphene layer can serve as a top gate: This unlocks access to a wide range of phenomena that require displacement field control, from fractional Chern insulators in Moir\'e superlattices to correlated states in multilayer graphene.</description>

      <title>Scalable Effective Models for Superconducting Nanostructures: Applications to Double, Triple, and Quadruple Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a versatile and scalable framework for constructing effective models of superconducting (SC) nanostructures described by the generalized SC Anderson impurity model with multiple quantum dots and leads. Our Chain Expansion (ChE) method maps each SC lead onto a finite tight-binding chain with parameters obtained from Pad\'e approximants of the tunneling self-energy. We provide an explicit algorithm for the general case as well as simple analytical expressions for the chain parameters in the wide-band and infinite-chain limits. This mapping preserves low-energy physics while enabling efficient simulations: short chains are tractable with exact diagonalization, and longer ones with density matrix renormalization group methods. The approach remains reliable and computationally efficient across diverse geometries, both in and out of equilibrium. We use ChE to map the ground-state phase diagrams of double, triple, and quadruple quantum dots coupled to a single SC lead. While half-filled symmetric systems show similar overall diagrams, the particular phases differ substantially with dot number. Here, large parameter regions are entirely missed by the widely used zero-bandwidth approximation but are captured by ChE. Away from half-filling, additional dots markedly increase diagram complexity, producing a rich variety of stable phases. These results demonstrate ChE as a fast, accurate, and systematically improvable tool for exploring complex SC nanostructures.</description>

      <title>Twisted light drives chiral excitations of interacting electrons in nanostructures with magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted light (TL), a special kind of light carrying orbital angular momentum, provides a powerful tool for driving symmetry resolved transitions in quantum confined nanostructures. We study a realistic model where a TL pulse excites two interacting electrons in a nanostructure under a perpendicular magnetic field. To include image charge effects in layered systems, we use an effective electron electron potential of the form 1/r^n. For n = 2, the system exhibits an underlying su(1,1) dynamical symmetry, enabling analytical solutions and a clear interpretation of selection rules, parity changes, and angular momentum resolved absorption. We show that the bare Coulomb 1/r interaction produces similar spectra, indicating that twisted light driven excitations are robust against the precise interaction form. The excitation spectrum reveals strong chiral properties: TL pulses, unlike conventional dipolar fields, directly access interaction-driven transitions otherwise symmetry-forbidden. In particular, TL breaks the generalized Kohn theorem, exposing internal excitations through multi quanta orbital processes. More broadly, our results establish TL as a sensitive probe of correlations, symmetry, and magneto-optical dynamics in strongly interacting quantum systems, uncovering features that remain invisible to standard infrared absorption.</description>

      <title>Light-programmable reorientation of the crystallographic c-axis of Tellurium thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tellurium (Te), a two-dimensional material with pronounced structural anisotropy, exhibits exceptional electrical and optical properties that are highly sensitive to its crystallographic orientation. However, conventional synthesis techniques offer limited control over the in-plane alignment of Te's crystallographic c-axis, hindering large-scale integration. Here, we report a novel, non-contact method to dynamically manipulate the c-axis orientation of Te thin films using linearly polarized picosecond laser pulses. We show that the c-axis can be omnidirectionally reoriented perpendicular to the laser polarization, even in initially polycrystalline films. This reorientation is fully reversible, allowing for rewritable and spatially selective control of the c-axis orientation post-deposition. Our light-driven approach enables programmable anisotropy in Te, opening new avenues for reconfigurable optoelectronic and photonic devices, such as active metasurfaces and CMOS-compatible architectures.</description>

      <title>Spin-Orbit Coupling-Driven Chirality Switching of Spin Waves in Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chirality of spin waves offers an advantageous binary carrier for data transmission and processing with ultrafast dynamics and low power consumption. Altermagnets possess intrinsic chirality-splitting spin waves and vanishing net magnetization, thus emerging as ideal platforms to host chirality bits. However, active control of the chiral states remains a key challenge for realizing logic operations in chirality-based circuits. Here, we propose a novel scheme for reversibly switching spin-wave chirality in altermagnets between right- and left-handedness by tuning spin-orbit coupling (SOC) strength. Specifically, for in-plane spin polarization, SOC hybridizes with the altermagnetism, which induces a momentum-dependent competition. The chirality-splitting structure of spin waves is dominated by either SOC or altermagnetism in different Brillouin zone regions, allowing chirality switching by altering their relative strength. An experimental design utilizing an antiferromagnetic substrate to induce SOC and a heavy-metal stripe for chirality detection is proposed. Our work establishes a novel pathway for controlling spin-wave chirality in altermagnets via SOC, laying the groundwork for developing spintronic devices utilizing switchable chiral spin waves as dynamic information carriers.</description>

      <title>Optical Control of Integer and Fractional Chern Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical control of topology, particularly in the presence of electron correlations, is a fascinating topic with broad scientific and technological impact. Twisted MoTe$_2$ bilayer (tMoTe$_2$) is a newly discovered zero-field fractional Chern insulator (FCI), exhibiting the fractionally quantized anomalous Hall (FQAH) effect. Since the chirality of the edge states and sign of the Chern number are determined by the underlying ferromagnetic polarization, manipulation of ferromagnetism would realize control of the CI/FCI states. Here, we demonstrate control and switching of ferromagnetic polarization, and thus the CI and FCI states by circularly polarized optical pumping in tMoTe$_2$. At low optical excitation power, we achieve on-demand preparation of ferromagnetic polarization by optical training, i.e., electrically tuning the system from non-ferromagnetic to desirable ferromagnetic states accompanied with helicity-selective optical pumping. With increased excitation power, we further realize direct optical switching of ferromagnetic polarization at a temperature far below the Curie temperature. Both optical training and direct switching of ferromagnetism are most effective near CI/FCI states, which we attribute to a gap enhanced valley polarization of photo-injected holes. We show that the magnetization can be dynamically switched by modulating the helicity of optical excitation. Spatially resolved measurements further demonstrate optical writing of a ferromagnetic, and thus a CI (or FCI) domain. Our work realizes precise optical control of a topological quantum many-body system with potential applications in topological spintronics, quantum memories, and creation of exotic edge states by programmable patterning of integer and fractional QAH domains.</description>

      <title>Emergent topology of flat bands in a twisted bilayer $\alpha$-$T_3$ lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate an interesting interplay of destructive interference due to lattice geometry and band folding due to enlargement of the Brillouin zone in generating and subsequently modifying the band topology in a twisted bilayer $\alpha$-$T_3$ system. The pronounced degeneracy of the emergent flat band in the dice limit of the $\alpha$-$T_3$ lattice is removed on alignment with h-BN layers, resulting in the formation of sub-bands with varying topological characteristics. Remarkably, while the sub-band near charge neutrality exhibits a trivial behavior, a topologically non-degenerate singular sub-band emerges away from charge neutrality. The topological band remains isolated from the rest of the bands for a substantial area of the $\alpha - \theta$ plane (where $\alpha$ and $\theta$ correspond to the hopping ratio and twist angle respectively) while exhibiting multiple phase transitions as a function of the aforementioned parameters via hybridization with its nearest bands. We study the evolution of the hybrid Wannier charge center and the Chern number to characterize the different emergent topological phases. Finally, the degree of flatness of the topological band is studied as a function of both $\alpha$ and $\theta$ to explicitly show the influence of quantum interference and band folding on the width of the topological band.</description>

      <title>Theoretical investigation of Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect in Potassium Tri-vanadium Pentantimonide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kagome metal Potassium Tri-vanadium Pent-antimonide can support the quantum anomalous Hall effect theoretically. This is justified by flat bands and Dirac points susceptible to gap opening by spin-orbit coupling or magnetic ordering. The theoretical investigation of this quantum effect is possible exploring strategies like magnetic proximity, and strain or electric gating tuning. Our goal here is to explore the possibility of quantum anomalous Hall effect with a system Hamiltonian involving nearest-neighbour and complex next nearest-neighbour hopping, Rashba spin-orbit coupling, exchange field due to magnetic proximity, and charge density wave. Our preliminary analysis with these ingredients reveals that the system hosts multiple bands whose Chern numbers values suggest weak topological characteristics-not yet quantized, but showing signs of nontrivial Berry curvature accumulation. Upon introducing momentum-space winding, mimicking an orbital magnetic flux, through the momentum-dependence of the phase of the complex hopping, we find that two bands in the multiple band system carry opposite Chern numbers, indicating the emergence of chiral edge states and a quantized anomalous Hall effect. The rest remain trivial, but the system as a whole is no longer topologically inert.</description>

      <title>Room temperature giant magnetoresistance detection of spin hall nano-oscillator dynamics in synthetic antiferromagnetic Spin-Valve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional spin Hall nano-oscillators (SHNOs) face fundamental power limitations due to the low anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR &lt; 0.3%) of ferromagnetic layers. To address this, we developed a synthetic antiferromagnetic spin-valve (SAF-SV) heterostructure [Ta/NiFe/Ru/NiFe/Cu/NiFe/Hf/Pt] that enables efficient giant magnetoresistance (GMR)-based detection of SHNO dynamics at room temperature. The NiFe/Ru/NiFe SAF reference layer, operating in the spin-flop state, couples with the NiFe free layer through a Cu spacer to achieve a remarkable GMR ratio of 0.568% - exhibiting complete independence of magnetic field/current orientation. Spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR) verifies that the ferromagnetic resonance linewidth of the free layer can be effectively modulated by dc current through the Pt heavy metal layer, while maintaining decoupled dynamics from the SAF layer. Thermal management via high-thermal-conductivity SiC substrates and AlN capping layers successfully mitigates current-shunting-induced Joule heating. Notably, stable auto-oscillation peaks are observed at 820 mA bias current, with oscillation frequency tunable by external magnetic field and potential dual-mode behavior at low fields. This work establishes a new paradigm for room-temperature, high-power spintronic oscillators, offering significant potential for neuromorphic computing and coherent RF communication applications.</description>

      <title>Isofrequency spin-wave imaging using color center magnetometry for magnon spintronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnon spintronics aims to harness spin waves in magnetic films for information technologies. Color center magnetometry is a promising tool for imaging spin waves, using electronic spins associated with atomic defects in solid-state materials as sensors. However, two main limitations persist: the magnetic fields required for spin-wave control detune the sensor-spin detection frequency, and this frequency is further restricted by the color center nature. Here, we overcome these limitations by decoupling the sensor spins from the spin-wave control fields -- selecting color centers with intrinsic anisotropy axes orthogonal to the film magnetization -- and by using color centers in diamond and hexagonal boron nitride to operate at complementary frequencies. We demonstrate isofrequency imaging of field-controlled spin waves in a magnetic half-plane and show how intrinsic magnetic anisotropies trigger bistable spin textures that govern spin-wave transport at device edges. Our results establish color center magnetometry as a versatile tool for advancing spin-wave technologies.</description>

      <title>Non-Exponential Relaxation in the Rotating Frame of a Driven Nanomechanical Mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present direct observation of the ring-down dynamics in the rotating frame of a resonantly driven single-mode nonlinear nanomechanical resonator. An additional close to resonance harmonic force excites nonlinear oscillations about the fixed point in the rotating frame. When the secondary drive is removed, we measure decay of the in-phase and quadrature components toward this fixed point. We show that the decay of the in-phase signal is non-exponential, even though the vibration amplitude decays exponentially if both forces are switched off. A minimalistic model captures these dynamics as well as the spectrum of the vibrations excited by the additional force, relating them to the dissipation-induced symmetry breaking of the dynamics in the rotating frame.</description>

      <title>Mass-induced Coulomb drag in capacitively coupled superconducting nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate Coulomb drag in a system of two capacitively coupled superconducting nanowires. In this context, drag refers to the appearance of a stationary voltage in the passive wire in response to a current bias applied to the active one. Quantum phase slips (QPS) in the biased wire generate voltage fluctuations that can be transmitted to the other. Using perturbative and semiclassical approaches, we show that when both wires are superconducting the induced voltage vanishes due to exact cancellation of plasmon contributions. By contrast, when the second wire is tuned below the superconductor-insulator transition and develops a mass gap, this cancellation is lifted and a finite drag voltage emerges. The drag coefficient exhibits a crossover from weak drag in short wires to a maximal value set by the mutual capacitance in long wires. A semiclassical picture of voltage pulse propagation clarifies the physical origin of the effect: the mass term synchronizes plasmon modes and prevents complete cancellation of induced signals. Our results establish a mechanism of mass-induced Coulomb drag in low-dimensional superconductors and suggest new routes for probing nonlocal transport near quantum criticality.</description>

      <title>Giant octupole moment in magnetic multilayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multipole moments serve as order parameters for characterizing higher-order magnetic effects in momentum space, providing a framework to describe diverse magnetic responses by extending the concept of magnetism. In this letter, we introduce a methodology to quantitatively determine the multipole moment contributions in anomalous Hall effect through angle-dependent anomalous Hall current, with explicit incorporation of discrete crystal symmetries. Our technique uniquely enables the investigation of octupole contribution in non-periodic systems, particularly at interfaces and surfaces. Typically, in (Ag$_{2}$Fe$_{5}$)$_{n}$ multilayers with quantum-well-engineered $k$-point selectivity, we observe an octupole-dominated anomalous Hall effect in conventional ferromagnetic materials, through first-principles calculations. These results fundamentally challenge the existing theoretical understanding of the anomalous Hall effect, showing that even the conventional contribution arises not only from the dipole moment (net magnetization). Furthermore, we establish practical control over the octupole contribution through two distinct approaches: interface engineering and magnetic ordering reconfiguration, opening new possibilities for manipulating higher-order transport effects.</description>

      <title>YSGAG: The Ideal Substrate for YIG in Quantum Magnonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum magnonics leverages the quantum mechanical properties of magnons for advancing nanoscale quantum information technologies. Ferrimagnetic yttrium iron garnet (YIG), known for its exceptionally long magnon lifetimes, is a cornerstone material for magnonics and is typically grown into thin films on gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) substrates due to near-perfect lattice matching. However, the paramagnetic nature of GGG introduces damping mechanisms detrimental to quantum applications at low temperatures. Here, we present a study of magnetic damping in a 150$\,$nm-thick YIG film grown on a 500$\,\mu$m-thick yttrium scandium gallium aluminium garnet (YSGAG) substrate, a newly developed diamagnetic alternative to GGG. Using ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectroscopy at temperatures as low as 30$\,$mK, we compare the damping characteristics of the YIG/YSGAG system with those of a conventional YIG/GGG reference system. Our results demonstrate that the YIG/YSGAG system maintains low magnetic damping from room temperature, with $\alpha = 4.29\times10^{-5}$, which is the lowest value reported so far for YIG/GGG films and comparable to the best YIG bulk material, and down to 30$\,$mK, with no significant temperature-dependent increase in damping. In this substrate, the low-temperature damping mechanisms associated with paramagnetic spins, prominent in GGG, are effectively eliminated. Consequently, YSGAG serves as an ideal substrate for YIG films in quantum magnonics and is paving the way for the development of spin-wave-based quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Optical control over topological Chern number in moir\'e materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling quantum matter with light offers a promising route to dynamically tune its many-body properties, ranging from band topology to superconductivity. However, achieving such optical control for strongly correlated electron systems in the steady-state has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate all-optical switching of the spin-valley degree of freedom of itinerant ferromagnets in twisted MoTe2 homobilayers. This system uniquely features flat valley-contrasting Chern bands and exhibits a range of strongly correlated phases at various moir\'e lattice fillings, including Chern insulators and ferromagnetic metals. We show that the spin-valley orientation of all of these phases can be dynamically reversed by resonantly exciting the attractive polaron transition with circularly-polarized light. These findings not only constitute the first direct evidence for non-thermal switching of a ferromagnetic spin state at zero magnetic field, but also demonstrate the possibility of dynamical control over topological order parameter, paving the way for all-optical generation of chiral edge modes and topological quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Interferences Measure Topology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological materials are characterized by integer invariants that underpin their robust quantized electronic features, as famously exemplified by the Chern number in the integer quantum Hall effect. Yet, in most candidate systems, the observable linked to the topological invariant is unknown, preventing direct verification of their topological nature. Here we present a general method to identify topological materials by analyzing the local electronic density, $\delta \rho(\boldsymbol{r})$, and connecting it to Atiyah Singer index theorems. This approach enables a direct measurement of the winding number, the topological invariant of Hamiltonians with chiral symmetry, through a contour independent dislocation pattern of $\delta \rho(\boldsymbol{r})$ created by interference from topological defects. Our method thus provides a direct route to detect and characterize quantum topological states, paving the way for their use as robust and entangleable building blocks in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Measuring high field gradients of cobalt nanomagnets in a spin-mechanical setup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid systems composed of a single nitrogen-vacancy center spin magnetically coupled to a macroscopic mechanical resonator constitute promising platforms for the realization of quantum information protocols and for quantum sensing applications. The magnetic structure that mediates the interaction must ensure high field gradients while preserving the spin and mechanical properties. We present a spin-mechanical setup built around a cobalt nanomagnet grown with focused electron beam-induced deposition. The magnetic structure is fully characterized, and a maximum gradient of $170\,\mathrm{kT/m}$ is directly measured at a spin-oscillator distance of a few hundred nanometers. Spin coherence was preserved at the value of $20\,\mathrm{ \mu s}$ up to a gradient of $25\,\mathrm{kT/m}$. The effect of the mechanical motion onto the spin dynamics was observed, thus signifying the presence of spin-mechanics coupling. Given the noninvasive nature of the nanomagnet deposition process, we foresee the adoption of such structures in hybrid platforms with high-quality factor resonators, in the "magnet on oscillator" configuration.</description>

      <title>The charge-carrier trapping effect on 1/f noise in monolayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The frequency exponent of 1/f noise in graphene-boron nitride heterostructures is known to have multiple extrema in its dependence on the charge carrier concentration. This behavior is explained in the present paper as a result of the charge carrier trapping by impurities in the boron nitride. A kinetic equation for the charge carriers subject to trapping and interacting with acoustic phonons is derived. This equation is solved numerically, and the equilibrium solutions are used to evaluate the frequency exponent according to the quantum theory of 1/f noise. It is found that the frequency exponent does develop several minima and maxima, provided that the trapping probability is sufficiently wide and has a threshold with respect to the charge carrier energy. A detailed comparison with the experimental data is made, and the results are used to estimate the energy threshold and the trapping cross-section.</description>

      <title>Phase Coherent Transport in Two-Dimensional Tellurium Flakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elemental tellurium (Te) is a compelling van der Waals material due to its interesting chiral crystal structure and predicted topological properties. Here, we report the fabrication and comprehensive quantum transport study of devices based on Te flakes with varying thicknesses. We demonstrate a hole mobility reaching up to 1000 cm2/V.s in a 17 nm thick flake at 30 Kelvin. At deep cryogenic temperatures (&lt; 50mK), the transport characteristics transition from Coulomb blockade in the low carrier density regime to pronounced Fabry-P\'erot (F-P) interference at higher densities. Notably, the visibility of these F-P oscillations is significantly enhanced in the thinner flake device. The application of a magnetic field reveals a clear Zeeman splitting of the conductance peaks. The rich variety of quantum transport phenomena observed underscores the high quality of our thin Te flakes and establishes them as a promising platform for exploring novel physics and device concepts, such as topological superconductivity and low-power spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity and Ferroelectric Orbital Magnetism in Semimetallic Rhombohedral Hexalayer Graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rhombohedral multilayer graphene has emerged as a promising platform for exploring correlated and topological quantum phases, enabled by its Berry-curvature-bearing flat bands. While prior work has focused on separated conduction and valence bands, we probe the extensive semimetallic regime of rhombohedral hexalayer graphene. We survey a rich phase diagram dominated by flavor-symmetry breaking and reveal an electric-field-driven band inversion through fermiology. Near this inversion, we find a superconducting-like state confined to a region with emergent electron and hole Fermi surfaces. In addition, two multiferroic orbital-magnetic phases are observed: a ferrovalley state near zero field and a ferroelectric state at large fields around charge neutrality. The latter shows electric-field-reversible magnetic hysteresis, consistent with a $\Delta P \cdot M$ multiferroic order parameter. Our fermiology analysis elucidates the correlated semimetal regime in rhombohedral graphene and underscores its potential to host diverse quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Light-induced odd-parity altermagnets on dimerized lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets are an emerging class of collinear magnets with momentum-dependent spin splitting and zero net magnetization. These materials can be broadly classified into two categories based on the behavior of spin splitting at time-reversal-related momenta: even-parity and odd-parity altermagnets. While even-parity altermagnets have been thoroughly investigated both theoretically and experimentally, the systems capable of hosting odd-parity altermagnetism remain largely unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate that circularly polarized light dynamically converts collinear PT-symmetric antiferromagnets on dimerized lattices into odd parity p-wave altermagnets. Because of the underlying Dirac band structure of the dimerized lattice, we find that the resulting p-wave altermagnets can realize Chern insulators (2D) and Weyl semimetals (3D) under appropriate drive conditions. Our findings demonstrate that collinear antiferromagnets on dimerized lattices provide ideal platforms to investigate the dynamical generation of odd-parity altermagnetism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the strong coupling model of $d^1$ transition metal tri-halides in the large spin-orbit coupled limit. By considering ab-initio-calculation-inspired hierarchy of hopping pathways of these compounds, SU(4) symmetry is found to emerge at multiple points in the parameter space of the hopping parameters. The resultant Dirac spin-orbital liquids, within the parton mean field description, are distinct. The calculated dynamical structure factor fingerprints this distinctive nature, giving rise to observable effects. This opens up a playground for SU(4) Dirac Spin-Orbital liquid in $d^1$ Honeycomb lattice systems.</description>

      <title>Full counting statistics and first-passage times in quantum Markovian processes: Ensemble relations, metastability, and fluctuation theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a comprehensive framework for characterizing fluctuations in quantum transport and nonequilibrium thermodynamics using two complementary approaches: full counting statistics and first-passage times. Focusing on open quantum systems governed by Markovian Lindblad dynamics, we derive general ensemble relations that connect the two approaches at all times, and we clarify how the steady states reached at long times relate to those reached at large jump counts. In regimes of metastability, long-lived intermediate states cause violations of experimentally testable cumulant relations, as we discuss. We also formulate a fluctuation theorem governing the probability of rare fluctuations in the first-passage time distributions based on results from full counting statistics. Our results apply to general integer-valued trajectory observables that do not necessarily increase monotonically in time. Three illustrative applications, a two-state emitter, a driven qubit, and a variant of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, highlight the physical implications of our results and provide guidelines for practical calculations. Our framework provides a complete picture of first-passage time statistics in Markovian quantum systems, encompassing multiple earlier results, and it has direct implications for current experiments in quantum optics, superconducting circuits, and nanoscale heat engines.</description>

      <title>Single-Photon Detection in Few-Layer NbSe$_2$ Superconducting Nanowires</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting Nanowire Single-Photon Detectors (SNSPDs) are key building blocks for photonic quantum technologies due to their ability to detect single photons with ultra-high efficiency, low dark counts and fast temporal resolution. Superconducting materials exhibiting high uniformity, large absorption cross-section and atomic-scale thickness are desirable to extend single-photon detection from the near-infrared up to the terahertz regime, where existing material choices are especially constrained. Substrate independence would further open the way to integrate detectors onto functional materials and heterostructures, enhancing performance and enabling proximal read-out of a wide range of individual excitations. Here, we top-down shape the prototypical two-dimensional superconductor niobium diselenide (NbSe$_2$) into few-layer nanowires less than 100 nm wide and demonstrate single-photon detection at 780 and 1550 nm. At the same time, the dark-count rate remains below 1 Hz up to the switching current and we achieve a timing jitter below 50 ps. We use a diffusive hot-spot model to estimate a theoretical cut-off wavelength that surpasses the millimetre range. Our results open up routes toward quantum limited detectors integrated into quantum-photonic circuits and quantum devices, with the potential for novel detection capabilities and unprecedented energy sensitivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We computationally design antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 chains in fullerene nanoribbons by introducing extra C$_{60}$ cages at one of their edges. The resulting odd number of intermolecular bonds induces an unpaired $\pi$-electron and hence a quantised magnetic moment in otherwise non-magnetic nanoribbons. We further reveal the formation of an antiferromagnetic ground state upon the linear arrangement of spin-$1/2$ C$_{60}$ cages that is insensitive to the specific structural motifs. Compared with graphene nanoribbons, Janus fullerene nanoribbons may offer an experimentally more accessible route to magnetic edge states with atomic precision in low-dimensional carbon nanostructures, possibly serving as a versatile nanoarchitecture for scalable spin-based devices and the exploration of many-body quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Ab-initio Quantum Transport with the GW Approximation, 42,240 Atoms, and Sustained Exascale Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing nanoscale electronic devices such as the currently manufactured nanoribbon field-effect transistors (NRFETs) requires advanced modeling tools capturing all relevant quantum mechanical effects. State-of-the-art approaches combine the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism and density functional theory (DFT). However, as device dimensions do not exceed a few nanometers anymore, electrons are confined in ultra-small volumes, giving rise to strong electron-electron interactions. To account for these critical effects, DFT+NEGF solvers should be extended with the GW approximation, which massively increases their computational intensity. Here, we present the first implementation of the NEGF+GW scheme capable of handling NRFET geometries with dimensions comparable to experiments. This package, called QuaTrEx, makes use of a novel spatial domain decomposition scheme, can treat devices made of up to 84,480 atoms, scales very well on the Alps and Frontier supercomputers (&gt;80% weak scaling efficiency), and sustains an exascale FP64 performance on 42,240 atoms (1.15 Eflop/s).</description>

      <title>Enhanced superconductivity in PbTe-In hybrids</title>

Abstract: We report the realization of epitaxial indium thin films on PbTe nanowires. The film is continuous and forms an atomically sharp interface with PbTe. Tunneling devices reveal a hard superconducting gap. The gap size, 1.08 to 1.18 meV, is twice as large as bulk indium's ($\sim$ 0.5 meV), due to the presence of PbTe. A similar enhancement is also observed in the critical temperature of In on a PbTe substrate. Subgap peaks appear at finite magnetic fields. The effective $g$-factor (15-45) is notably enhanced compared to bare PbTe wires ($&lt;$ 10) due to the presence of In, differing from Al-hybrids. Josephson devices exhibit gate-tunable supercurrents. The PbTe-In hybrid enhances the properties of both, the superconductivity of In and g-factors of PbTe, and thus may enable exotic phases of matter such as topological superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Interlayer Exchange Coupling-Induced Critical-Metal-to-Insulator Phase Transition in Quantum Anomalous Hall Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02430v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interlayer exchange coupling (IEC) between two magnetic layers sandwiched by a nonmagnetic spacer layer plays a critical role in shaping the magnetic properties of such heterostructures. The quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect has been realized in a structure composed of two magnetically doped topological insulator (TI) layers separated by an undoped TI layer. In this work, we employ molecular beam epitaxy to synthesize a series of magnetic TI sandwiches with varying thicknesses of the middle TI spacer layer. The well-quantized QAH effect is observed in all these samples, and the IEC modulates its critical behavior between the top and bottom magnetic TI layers. Near the plateau phase transition (PPT), thinner QAH samples exhibit a two-dimensional critical metal behavior with nearly temperature-independent longitudinal resistance. In contrast, thicker QAH samples behave as a three-dimensional insulator with reduced longitudinal resistance at higher temperatures. We employ a magnetic TI Hamiltonian with random magnetic domains to understand the IEC-induced critical-metal-to-insulator transition observed near QAH PPT.</description>

      <title>Localized states, topology and anomalous Hall conductivity on a 30 degrees twisted bilayer honeycomb lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02373v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider $30^{\circ}$ twisted bilayer formed by two copies of Haldane model and explore its evolution with varying interlayer coupling strength. Specifically, we compute the system's energy spectrum, its fractal dimensions, topological entanglement entropy, local Chern markers and anomalous Hall conductivity. We find that at weak interlayer coupling, the system %remains gapped still has a bulk energy gap, topological edge states and retains topological properties of the isolated layers, but at strong interlayer coupling, this energy gap closes, but it is possible that another bulk gap may open. Such a system possesses multiple states localized at various locations of the lattice. We also establish that topological entanglement entropy and anomalous Hall conductivity can be used to characterize the system's topological properties in the same way as a local Chern marker.</description>

      <title>Enhanced shot noise in graphene quantum point contacts with electrostatic reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shot noise measurements in quantum point contacts are a powerful tool to investigate charge transport in the integer and fractional quantum Hall regime, in particular to unveil the charge, quantum statistics and tunneling dynamics of edge excitations. In this letter, we describe shot noise measurements in a graphene quantum point contact in the quantum Hall regime. At large magnetic field, the competition between confinement and electronic interactions gives rise to a quantum dot located at the saddle point of the quantum point contact. We show that the presence of this quantum dot leads to a $50-100~\%$ increase in the shot noise, which we attribute to correlated charge tunneling. Our results highlight the role played by the electrostatic environment in those graphene devices.</description>

      <title>Spin-orbit torque driven motion of chiral domain walls induced by radial magnetization in nanotube geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate chiral domain walls (DWs) formed in radially magnetized nanotubes composed of ultrathin layers with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). Unlike those with in-plane magnetic anisotropy, the stable configurations of DWs in PMA nanotubes are influenced not only by exchange interactions but also by magnetostatic interactions induced by the radial component of magnetization. Particularly, the magnetostatic interactions lead to Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI)-like effects that stabilize chiral N\'{e}el-type DWs. We derive expressions for the effective magnetic fields acting on DWs within PMA nanotubes and quantify spin-orbit torque (SOT) driven DW motion using an analytical one-dimensional model, which is validated by micromagnetic simulations. Our results show that the DMI-like field due to magnetostatic interactions can be as significant as the contribution of material-induced DMI in nanotubes with diameters below $100\,$nm. This implies that the direction and speed of DW motion in the PMA nanotubes could differ from those observed in flat nanoribbons composed of the same material. Furthermore, we demonstrate that DW velocity can be effectively controlled by adjusting the tube diameter and exchange stiffness constant of the magnetic layer, rather than relying solely on material-induced DMI. These insights are expected to greatly expand the potential applications of PMA nanotube-based DW devices.</description>

      <title>Interlayer Coupling-Induced Quantum Phase Transition in Quantum Anomalous Hall Multilayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A quantum phase transition arises from competition between different ground states and is typically accessed by varying a single physical parameter near absolute zero temperature. The quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect with high Chern number C has recently been achieved in magnetic topological insulator (TI) multilayers. In this work, we employ molecular beam epitaxy to synthesize a series of magnetic TI penta-layers by varying the thickness of the middle magnetic TI layer, designated as m quintuple layers. Electrical transport measurements demonstrate a quantum phase transition between C = 1 and C = 2 QAH states. For m 1 and m 2, the sample exhibits the well-quantized C = 1 and C = 2 QAH states, respectively. For 1 m 2, we observe a monotonic decrease in Hall resistance from h/e2 to h/2e2 with increasing m, accompanied by a peak in the longitudinal resistance. The quantum phase transition between C = 1 and C = 2 QAH states is attributed to the weakening of the interlayer coupling between the top and the bottom C = 1 QAH layers. Our findings provide a scalable strategy for engineering QAH devices with a tunable Chern number. This approach enables precise control and enhanced functionality in chiral edge current-based electronic devices.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the rich topology and interesting quasi-band structure of twisted moire materials subjected to light, we study a non-twisted moire material under the influence of light. Our work is in part motivated by a desire to find an easier-to-synthesize platform that can help experimentally elucidate the interesting physics of moir\'e materials coupled to light. Similar to twisted moire materials, we uncover rich topology and interesting band flattening effects, which we summarize in relevant plots such as a topological phase diagram. Our work demonstrates that much of the interesting phenomenology of twisted moire materials under the influence of electromagnetic waves seems to be generically present even in more experimentally accessible untwisted moire platforms, which remain highly tunable by light.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity from incoherent Cooper pairs in the strong-coupling regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04508v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a scenario for superconductivity at strong electron-electron attractive interaction, in the case when the increase of the interaction strength promotes the nucleation of the local Cooper pairs and forms a state with a spatially phase incoherent Cooper pair order parameter. We show that this state can be characterized by a pseudogap which is determined by the electron scattering by phase fluctuations. At low temperatures, however, long-range correlations between the regions with different phases become important and establish global phase coherence and hence superconductivity in the system. We develop a mean-field theory to describe a phase transition between the preformed Cooper pair and superconducting states. This scenario of superconductivity applies not only to conductors with parabolic bands but also to the flat-band systems in which flat and dispersive bands coexist and are responsible for the formation of Cooper pairs as well as their phase synchronization.</description>

      <title>Tailoring 4H-SiC Surface Electronic States by Atomic-Layer Deposition for Ideal Peta-Ohm Resistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High resolution resistors capable of detecting minuscule currents are vital for advanced sensors, but existing off-shelf models struggle with inconsistent resistance under varying voltages. The underlying physics of this issue is rooted in unstable surface charges and intrinsic inhomogeneity of surface potential caused by spontaneous polarization (SP) in commercial semi-insulating silicon carbide (SiC) devices. In this work, we found that coating SiC surfaces with an ultrathin zinc oxide layer immobilizes the dangling surface charges in place and balances the natural electric field of the material, ensuring stable resistance even at extreme voltages up to 1000 V. The resulting SiC resistor maintains a record-high resistance of one peta-ohm (10^15 {\Omega}) with negligible voltage fluctuations, outperforming conventional options. Additionally, these devices can switch states when exposed to light or heat, making them dual-purpose tools for ultra-sensitive measurements and sensors. This breakthrough combines high stability, scalability for mass production, and multifunctionality, opening doors to next-generation precision technologies in fields like quantum sensing and environmental monitoring.</description>

      <title>Spectral densities of a dispersive dielectric sphere in the modified Langevin noise formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12485v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with the spectral densities of a dispersive dielectric object in the framework of macroscopic quantum electrodynamics based on the modified Langevin noise formalism. In this formalism, the electromagnetic field in the presence of a dielectric object has two contributions, one taking into account the polarization current fluctuations of the object and the other taking into account the vacuum field fluctuations scattered by the object. The combined effect of these fields on the dynamics of a quantum emitter is described via two independent continuous bosonic reservoirs, a medium-assisted reservoir and a scattering-assisted reservoir, each characterized by its own spectral density and initial quantum state. For initial thermal states of the two reservoirs at different temperatures, the standard approach based on the knowledge of the dyadic Green function of the dielectric object at the quantum emitter position cannot be employed. We map the two reservoirs to a single equivalent reservoir with a temperature-dependent effective spectral density and initially in its vacuum state, focusing on the case of a homogeneous dielectric sphere. We derive analytical expressions for the medium-assisted, scattering-assisted, and effective spectral densities in this setting. We then study the dynamics of the quantum emitter for initial thermal states of the two reservoirs, adopting a non-perturbative approach.</description>

      <title>Time-bin encoded quantum key distribution over 120 km with a telecom quantum dot source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) with deterministic single photon sources has been demonstrated over intercity fiber and free-space channels. The previous implementations relied mainly on polarization encoding schemes, which are susceptible to birefringence, polarization-mode dispersion and polarization-dependent loss in practical fiber networks. In contrast, time-bin encoding offers inherent robustness and has been widely adopted in mature QKD systems using weak coherent laser pulses. However, its feasibility in conjunction with a deterministic single-photon source has not yet been experimentally demonstrated. In this work, we construct a time-bin encoded QKD system employing a high-brightness quantum dot (QD) single-photon source operating at telecom wavelength. Our proof-of-concept experiment successfully demonstrates the possibility of secure key distribution over fiber link of 120 km, while maintaining extraordinary long-term stability over 6 hours of continuous operation. This work provides the first experimental validation of integrating a quantum dot single-photon source with time-bin encoding in a telecom-band QKD system. In addition, it demonstrates the highest secure key rate among the time-bin QKDs based on single-photon sources. This development signifies a substantial advancement in the establishment of a robust and scalable QKD network based on solid-state single-photon technology</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19136v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the out-of-equilibrium driving protocol of score-based generative models (SGMs) can be learned via local learning rules. The gradient with respect to the parameters of the driving protocol is computed directly from force measurements or from observed system dynamics. As a demonstration, we implement an SGM in a network of driven, nonlinear, overdamped oscillators coupled to a thermal bath. We first apply it to the problem of sampling from a mixture of two Gaussians in 2D. Finally, we train a 12x12 oscillator network on the MNIST dataset to generate images of handwritten digits 0 and 1.</description>
