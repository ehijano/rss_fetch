      <title>Transfer Learning (Il)liquidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The estimation of the Risk Neutral Density (RND) implicit in option prices is challenging, especially in illiquid markets. We introduce the Deep Log-Sum-Exp Neural Network, an architecture that leverages Deep and Transfer learning to address RND estimation in the presence of irregular and illiquid strikes. We prove key statistical properties of the model and the consistency of the estimator. We illustrate the benefits of transfer learning to improve the estimation of the RND in severe illiquidity conditions through Monte Carlo simulations, and we test it empirically on SPX data, comparing it with popular estimation methods. Overall, our framework shows recovery of the RND in conditions of extreme illiquidity with as few as three option quotes.</description>

      <title>High-Frequency Analysis of a Trading Game with Transient Price Impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the high-frequency limit of an $n$-trader optimal execution game in discrete time. Traders face transient price impact of Obizhaeva--Wang type in addition to quadratic instantaneous trading costs $\theta(\Delta X_t)^2$ on each transaction $\Delta X_t$. There is a unique Nash equilibrium in which traders choose liquidation strategies minimizing expected execution costs. In the high-frequency limit where the grid of trading dates converges to the continuous interval $[0,T]$, the discrete equilibrium inventories converge at rate $1/N$ to the continuous-time equilibrium of an Obizhaeva--Wang model with additional quadratic costs $\vartheta_0(\Delta X_0)^2$ and $\vartheta_T(\Delta X_T)^2$ on initial and terminal block trades, where $\vartheta_0=(n-1)/2$ and $\vartheta_T=1/2$. The latter model was introduced by Campbell and Nutz as the limit of continuous-time equilibria with vanishing instantaneous costs. Our results extend and refine previous results of Schied, Strehle, and Zhang for the particular case $n=2$ where $\vartheta_0=\vartheta_T=1/2$. In particular, we show how the coefficients $\vartheta_0=(n-1)/2$ and $\vartheta_T=1/2$ arise endogenously in the high-frequency limit: the initial and terminal block costs of the continuous-time model are identified as the limits of the cumulative discrete instantaneous costs incurred over small neighborhoods of $0$ and $T$, respectively, and these limits are independent of $\theta&gt;0$. By contrast, when $\theta=0$ the discrete-time equilibrium strategies and costs exhibit persistent oscillations and admit no high-frequency limit, mirroring the non-existence of continuous-time equilibria without boundary block costs. Our results show that two different types of trading frictions -- a fine time discretization and small instantaneous costs in continuous time -- have similar regularizing effects and select a canonical model in the limit.</description>
