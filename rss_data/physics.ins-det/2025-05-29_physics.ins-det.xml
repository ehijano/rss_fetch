      <title>Time-tagging data acquisition system for testing superconducting electronics based on an RFSoC and custom analog frontend</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Novel electronic devices can often be operated in a plethora of ways, which makes testing circuits comprised of them difficult. Often, no single tool can simultaneously analyze the operating margins, maximum speed, and failure modes of a circuit, particularly when the intended behavior of subcomponents of the circuit is not standardized. This work demonstrates a cost-effective data acquisition system for electronic circuits that enables more intricate verification techniques than are practical with conventional experimental setups. We use high-speed digital-to-analog converters and real-time multi-gigasample-per-second waveform processing to push experimental circuits beyond their maximum operating speed. Our custom time-tagging data capture firmware reduces memory requirements and can be used to determine when errors occur. The firmware is combined with a thermal-noise-limited analog frontend with over $50\,\mathrm{dB}$ of dynamic range. Compared to currently available commercial test equipment, this data acquisition system was able to operate a superconducting shift register at a nearly three-times-higher clock frequency ($200\,\mathrm{MHz}$ vs. $80\,\mathrm{MHz}$) at roughly one seventh the cost.</description>

      <title>Rise Time and Charge Collection Efficiency of Graphene-Optimized 4H-SiC PIN Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon carbide detectors exhibit good detection performance and are being considered for detection applications. However, the presence of surface electrode of detector limits the application of low-penetration particle detectors, photodetectors and heavy-ion detection. A graphene-optimized 4H-SiC detector has been fabricated to expand the application of SiC detectors.Its electrical properties and the charge collection performance of {\alpha} particles are reported. The effective doping concentration of lightly doped 4H-SiC epitaxial layer is about 4.5\times10^{13}cm^{-3}, approaching the limit of the lowest doping level by the SiC epitaxial growth technique. The rise time of the graphene-optimized ring electrode detector is reduced by 24% at 200 V, compared to ring electrode detector. The charge collection efficiency (CCE) of graphene-optimized 4H-SiC PIN is 99.22%. When the irradiation dose is 2\times10^{11} n_{eq}/cm^2, the irradiation has no significant impact on the rise time and uniformity of the rise time for the graphene-optimized 4H-SiC detectors. This study proves that graphene has a certain radiation resistance. Graphene-optimized 4H-SiC detectors can not only reduce the signal rise time, but also improve uniformity of signal rise time and stability of charge collection. This research will expand the application of graphene-based 4H-SiC detectors in fields such as low energy ions, X-ray, UV light detection, particle physics, medical dosimetry and heavy-ion detection.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the JadePix-3 CMOS Pixel Sensor for the CEPC Vertex Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Circular Electron-Positron Collider (CEPC), a proposed next-generation $e^+e^-$ collider to enable high-precision studies of the Higgs boson and potential new physics, imposes rigorous demands on detector technologies, particularly the vertex detector. JadePix-3, a prototype Monolithic Active Pixel Sensor (MAPS) designed for the CEPC vertex detector, targets a spatial resolution of 3 $\rm \mu m$ to meet the key requirement. This paper presents a detailed laboratory-based characterization of the JadePix-3 sensor, focusing on the previously under-explored effects of substrate reverse bias voltage on key performance metrics: charge collection efficiency, average cluster size, and detection efficiency. Systematic testing demonstrated that JadePix-3 operates reliably under reverse bias, exhibiting a reduced input capacitance, an expanded depletion region, enhanced charge collection efficiency, and a lower fake-hit rate. Simultaneously, an extensive methodology for MAPS characterization is established, which determined the optimal operational working conditions for the JadePix-3 sensor. Furthermore, these findings confirm the sensor's potential for high-precision particle tracking and vertexing at the CEPC while offering valuable references for future iterational R&amp;D of the JadePix series.</description>

      <title>Complete Catalog of Laser Locking Configurations for LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will enable direct observations of low-frequency gravitational waves, offering unprecedented insight into astrophysical and cosmological phenomena. LISA's heterodyne interferometric measurement system requires phase-locking five of its six onboard lasers with tunable frequency offsets to ensure that all beatnotes remain within the metrology system's operational range, despite Doppler-induced frequency shifts. The selection of these offset frequencies -- collectively forming a frequency plan -- is a complex optimization problem constrained by the spacecraft's orbital dynamics and instrument limitations. While previous work established an algorithmic solution for deriving time-dependent frequency plans, this study takes a complementary approach by systematically analyzing and cataloging all possible laser locking configurations. We present an automated method to explore, validate, and classify viable locking schemes, identifying 36 unique non-frequency-swapping configurations and 72 additional frequency-swapping configurations for an arbitrary choice of primary laser. This exhaustive classification provides a foundation for frequency planning across the full range of operational scenarios.</description>

      <title>First measurement of neutron capture multiplicity in neutrino-oxygen neutral-current quasi-elastic-like interactions using an accelerator neutrino beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the first measurement of neutron capture multiplicity in neutrino-oxygen neutral-current quasi-elastic-like interactions at the gadolinium-loaded Super-Kamiokande detector using the T2K neutrino beam, which has a peak energy of about 0.6 GeV. A total of 30 neutral-current quasi-elastic-like event candidates were selected from T2K data corresponding to an exposure of $1.76\times10^{20}$ protons on target. The $\gamma$ ray signals resulting from neutron captures were identified using a neural network. The flux-averaged mean neutron capture multiplicity was measured to be $1.37\pm0.33\text{ (stat.)}$$(^{+0.17}_{-0.27})$, which is compatible within $2.3\,\sigma$ than predictions obtained using our nominal simulation. We discuss potential sources of systematic uncertainty in the prediction and demonstrate that a significant portion of this discrepancy arises from the modeling of hadron-nucleus interactions in the detector medium.</description>

      <title>Applying TDI to Hardware-Simulated Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many years of development have gone into producing instruments that meet the required noise performance of the LISA interferometric detection system. Concurrently, software simulations have been used to extensively develop the data analysis libraries to be used in the LISA pipeline, not least among which are the Time Delay Interferometry (TDI) algorithms. To bridge the gap between these two, we are developing a hardware-in-the-loop testbed to apply realistic, time-varying delays to signals traveling between phasemeters. We have shown that the testbed adds a sufficiently low amount of noise across the entire relevant LISA spectrum. We have also injected a realistic gravitational wave signal, generated via the LISA Data Challenge codebase, and successfully extracted it using TDI to remove the obscuring frequency noise of the carrier signal. Future efforts will expand the testbed to create a representative simulation of the entire LISA constellation, with an eye towards its use as a tool to aid in the development of the LISA data analysis pipelines.</description>

      <title>Proof of principle for a light dark matter search with low-energy positron beams at NA64</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04053v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermal light dark matter (LDM) with particle masses in the 1 MeV - 1 GeV range could successfully explain the observed dark matter abundance as a relic from the primordial Universe. In this picture, a new feeble interaction acts as a "portal" between the Standard Model and LDM particles, allowing for the exploration of this paradigm at accelerator experiments. In the last years, the "missing energy" experiment NA64e at CERN SPS (Super Proton Synchrotron) has set world-leading constraints in the vector-mediated LDM parameter space, by exploiting a 100 GeV electron beam impinging on an electromagnetic calorimeter, acting as an active target. In this paper, we report a detailed description of the analysis of a preliminary measurement with a 70 GeV positron beam at NA64e, performed during summer 2023 with an accumulated statistic of 1.6 x 10^10 positrons on target. This data set was analyzed with the primary aim of evaluating the performance of the NA64e detector with a lower energy positron beam, towards the realization of the post-LS3 program. The analysis results, other than additionally probing unexplored regions in the LDM parameter space, provide valuable information towards the future NA64e positron campaign.</description>

      <title>Calibration features of a polarimetric backscattering setup with a beamsplitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of calibrating a polarimetric backscattering setup that includes a beamsplitter, taking its optical properties into account. Using Fisher information, we justify a specific calibration configuration involving reference optical elements for the maximum likelihood method and demonstrate its effectiveness through Monte Carlo simulations. This approach leads to higher precision, as the described set of measurements allows the beamsplitter to be treated as an integral part of the setup, without requiring separate processing or reconfiguration of the setup for the beamsplitter calibration. Furthermore, we emphasize the significance of considering the beamsplitter's optical properties by proposing a test to estimate the error that arises from neglecting these properties during the calibration procedure.</description>

      <title>Performance and radiation damage mitigation strategy for silicon photomultipliers on LEO space missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00532v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Space missions require lightweight, low-power consuming, radiation-tolerant components. Silicon photomultipliers are increasingly used for detecting near-UV, optical, and infrared light in space due to their compact design, low cost, low power consumption, robustness, and high photo-detection efficiency, which makes them sensitive to single photons. Although SiPMs outperform traditional photomultiplier tubes in many areas, concerns about their radiation tolerance and noise remain. In this study, we estimate the radiation effects on a satellite in sun-synchronous low Earth orbit (LEO) at an altitude of 550~km during the declining phase of solar cycle 25 (2026-2029). We evaluated silicon photomultipliers produced by the Foundation Bruno Kessler (FBK) using front-side illuminated technology with metal trenches (NUV-HD-MT), assessing their response to a 50~MeV proton beam and exposure to a $\beta$-radioactive source (strontium-90). Simulations with SPENVIS and Geant4 were used to validate the experimental results. Based on our findings, we propose a photosensor annealing strategy for space-based instruments.</description>
