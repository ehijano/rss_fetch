      <title>Free-energy perturbation in the exchange-correlation space accelerated by machine learning: Application to silica polymorphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a free-energy-perturbation approach accelerated by machine-learning potentials to efficiently compute transition temperatures and entropies for all rungs of Jacob's ladder. We apply the approach to the dynamically stabilized phases of SiO$_2$, which are characterized by challengingly small transition entropies. All investigated functionals from rungs 1-4 fail to predict an accurate transition temperature by 25-200%. Only by ascending to the fifth rung, within the random phase approximation, an accurate prediction is possible, giving a relative error of 5%. We provide a clear-cut procedure and relevant data to the community for, e.g., developing and evaluating new functionals.</description>

      <title>On recovering intragranular strain fields from grain-averaged strains obtained by high-energy X-ray diffraction microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address an unusual problem in the theory of elasticity motivated by the problem of reconstructing the strain field from partial information obtained using X-ray diffraction. Referred to as either high-energy X-ray diffraction microscopy~(HEDM) or three-dimensional X-ray diffraction microscopy~(3DXRD), these methods provide diffraction images that, once processed, commonly yield detailed grain structure of polycrystalline materials, as well as grain-averaged elastic strains. However, it is desirable to have the entire (point-wise) strain field. So we address the question of recovering the entire strain field from grain-averaged values in an elastic polycrystalline material. The key idea is that grain-averaged strains must be the result of a solution to the equations of elasticity and the overall imposed loads. In this light, the recovery problem becomes the following: find the boundary traction distribution that induces the measured grain-averaged strains under the equations of elasticity. We show that there are either zero or infinite solutions to this problem, and more specifically, that there exist an infinite number of kernel fields, or non-trivial solutions to the equations of elasticity that have zero overall boundary loads and zero grain-averaged strains. We define a best-approximate reconstruction to address this non-uniqueness. We then show that, consistent with Saint-Venant's principle, in experimentally relevant cylindrical specimens, the uncertainty due to non-uniqueness in recovered strain fields decays exponentially with distance from the ends of the interrogated volume. Thus, one can obtain useful information despite the non-uniqueness. We apply these results to a numerical example and experimental observations on a transparent aluminum oxynitride (AlON) sample.</description>

      <title>Composition-dependent ultrafast luminescence in Cu-Ni alloys: Combined experimental and ab initio study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Properties of Cu-Ni solid solutions have long been studied in physical and materials sciences. Yet, their many-body properties have not been well understood. Here, we investigate ultrafast luminescence in near infrared region for Cu$_{1-x}$Ni$_x$ alloys. The luminescence intensity was the highest in Cu and decreased dramatically by adding Ni, approaching close to the value for pure Ni at $x=0.45$. This composition dependence was well reproduced by calculations assuming two body scattering of the energetic electrons. The luminescent decay rate was not straightforward, i.e., it decreased first by adding Ni up to $x=0.17$ and then started to increase approaching twice the initial value at $x=0.45$. This behavior was in good agreement with ab initio calculations of electron-phonon (e-ph) coupling strength. This work provides a new perspective on the electron relaxation dynamics in solid solutions systems.</description>

      <title>Magnetic excitons in non-magnetic CrCl3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) materials, with their unique combination of electronic, optical, and magnetic properties, are emerging as promising platforms for exploring excitonic phenomena. Thus far, the choice of materials with exceptional excitonic response has been limited to two-dimensional (2D) configurations of vdW materials. At the same time, large interlayer distance and the possibility to create a variety of heterostructures offers an opportunity to control the dielectric screening in van der Waals heterostructures and van der Waal 3D materials, thus engineering the excitonic properties. Here, we reveal that bulk vdW crystal CrCl3 answers this quest with a record exciton binding energy of 1.64 eV owing to a delicate interplay of quasi-2D electronic confinement and short-range magnetic correlations. Furthermore, we observe colossal binding energies in vdW crystals NbOCl2 (0.66 eV) and MoCl3 (0.35 eV) and formulate a universal exciton binding energy dependence on bandgap for 2D and 3D vdW materials. Hence, our findings establish a fundamental link between the layered structure of vdW materials and their excitonic properties.</description>

      <title>Kinetic roughening transition of ice crystals and its implications during recrystallization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growth and morphology of ice crystals are highly sensitive to environmental conditions. Under atmospheric pressure, rapid growth from the liquid phase produces dendritic structures with sixfold symmetry. This morphology results from subtle variations in surface tension linked to crystallographic orientation, which guides arm growth under supercooled conditions. In contrast, slow growth yields disk-shaped crystals with rounded surfaces, suggesting surface roughness on all but the basal planes. Roughening is a thermodynamic phenomenon where a crystal surface becomes non-faceted due to the absence of a step-edge barrier, leading to large surface fluctuations. A kinetic roughening transition is a temperature-dependent shift in growth behaviour, in which faceted surfaces at low temperatures transform into rounded surfaces at higher temperatures. To observe slow growth at low temperatures, supercooling must be minimized, which can be achieved by lowering the melting point. This study investigates the kinetic roughening transition in ice crystals grown in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and proline-water solutions. Using cryomicroscopy and real-time image analysis, we identified a distinct roughening transition temperature (TR = -15.4 oC). At TR, the crystal growth morphology shifted from circular disks at higher temperatures to hexagonal plates at lower temperatures. This transition was solute-independent and governed primarily by temperature. Ice consistently melted as circular disks, regardless of temperature. Recrystallization experiments confirmed that crystals grew as hexagonal plates below TR but melted as disks. We also examined the influence of antifreeze protein III (AFPIII), which binds to specific crystallographic planes and modifies morphology through a distinct mechanism, effectively suppressing kinetic roughening</description>

      <title>Coarse-grained graph architectures for all-atom force predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a machine-learning framework termed coarse-grained all-atom force field (CGAA-FF), which incorporates coarse-grained message passing within an all-atom force field using equivariant nature of graph models. The CGAA-FF model employs grain embedding to encode atomistic coordinates into nodes representing grains rather than individual atoms, enabling predictions of both grain-level energies and atom-level forces. Tested on organic electrolytes, CGAA-FF achieves root-mean-square errors of 4.96 meV atom-1 for energy and 0.201 eV A-1 for force predictions. CGAA-FF significantly reduces computational costs, achieving about 22- and 14-fold improvements in simulation speed and memory efficiency, respectively, compared to the all-atom potential (SevenNet-0). Since this CGAA framework can be integrated into any equivariant architecture, we believe this work opens the door to efficient all-atom simulations of soft-matter systems.</description>

      <title>In-Situ Growth and Ionic Switching Behavior of Single-Crystalline Silver Iodide Nanoflakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silver iodide (AgI) is a prototypical superionic conductor, undergoing a first-order phase transition at 147 Celsius that enables rapid ionic transport through its lattice, making it attractive for solid-state ionic devices. However, due to the presence of mobile Ag ions, controlled chemical vapor deposition (CVD) synthesis of high-quality AgI single crystals has remained largely unexplored. Here, we present the controllable synthesis of thin, single-crystalline {\beta}-AgI nanoflakes using a home-built CVD setup with real-time optical observation capability, offering insights into their nucleation and growth dynamics. We evaluate the material's environmental stability through temperature-dependent photodegradation and Ag nanoparticle formation induced by electron beam irradiation. Electrical measurements on two-terminal devices with silver contacts demonstrate a remarkable six-order-of-magnitude resistance drop in lateral configurations at elevated temperatures, indicative of switchable ionic conductivity. Additionally, vertical device architectures exhibit clear memristive (resistive switching) characteristics, likely due to the formation of conductive filaments. Our work addresses the key synthesis challenges and highlights the unique electrical properties of thin AgI single crystals, suggesting its potential for innovative devices in unconventional computing, data storage, and advanced neuromorphic systems.</description>

      <title>On Simulating Thin-Film Processes at the Atomic Scale Using Machine Learned Force Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomistic modeling of thin-film processes provides an avenue not only for discovering key chemical mechanisms of the processes but also to extract quantitative metrics on the events and reactions taking place at the gas-surface interface. Molecular dynamics (MD) is a powerful computational method to study the evolution of a process at the atomic scale, but studies of industrially relevant processes usually require suitable force fields, which are in general not available for all processes of interest. However, machine learned force fields (MLFF) are conquering the field of computational materials and surface science. In this paper, we demonstrate how to efficiently build MLFFs suitable for process simulations and provide two examples for technologically relevant processes: precursor pulse in the atomic layer deposition of HfO2 and atomic layer etching of MoS2.</description>

      <title>Systematic investigation of the generation of luminescent emitters in hBN via irradiation engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), a two-dimensional (2D) material, garners interest for hosting bright quantum emitters at room temperature. A great variety of fabrication processes have been proposed with various yields of quantum emitters. In this work, we study the influence of several parameters, such as irradiation energy, annealing environment, and the type of hBN, on the emitter density in hBN. Our results show (i) high emitter density with oxygen irradiation at 204 eV, (ii) post-annealing in carbon-rich atmospheres significantly increases emitter density, reinforcing carbon's potential role, (iii) no significant effect of oxygen pre-annealing, and (iv) a slightly increased emitter density from hBN crystals with lower structural quality. Although the precise origin of the emitters remains unclear, our study shows that oxygen irradiation and subsequent inert annealing in a carbon-rich environment play a crucial role in emitter generation, while the other processing parameters have a smaller influence. As such, our systematic study and findings show relevant advances towards the reproducible formation of visible-frequency quantum emitters in hBN.</description>

      <title>Direct Evidence of Metal-Ligand Redox in Li-ion Battery Cathodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Describing Li-ion battery cathodes in terms of distinct transition metal or oxygen redox regimes can lead to confusion in understanding metal-ligand hybridisation, oxygen dimerisation, and degradation. There is a pressing need to study the electronic structure of these materials and determine the role each cation and anion plays in charge compensation. Here, we employ transition metal Ledge X-ray Resonance Photoemission Spectroscopy in conjunction with Single Impurity Anderson simulations to directly evaluate the redox mechanisms in (de-)lithiated battery electrodes. This approach reconciles the redox description of two canonical cathodes -- LiMn$_{0.6}$Fe$_{0.4}$PO$_{4}$ and LiNiO$_{2}$ -- in terms of varying degrees of charge transfer using the established Zaanen-Sawatzky-Allen framework, common to condensed matter physics. In LiMn$_{0.6}$Fe$_{0.4}$PO$_{4}$, we show that capacity arises due to the depopulation of metal 3d states. Whereas, in LiNiO$_{2}$, charge transfer dominates and redox occurs through the formation and elimination of ligand hole states. This work clarifies the role of oxygen in Ni-rich system and provides a framework to explain how capacity can be extracted from oxygen-dominated states in highly covalent systems without needing to invoke dimerisation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This short review appears on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of discovery of intrinsic magnetic topological insulators (MTIs) of the MnBi${}_2$Te${}_4$ family, which have attracted a great deal of attention recently. This family of materials has been discovered in attempts to increase the observation temperature of the quantum anomalous Hall effect as well as to facilitate the eventual realization of the topological magnetoelectric effect. Therefore, we first briefly introduce these effects, then describe the experimental state-of-the-art in the MTIs field just prior to MnBi${}_2$Te${}_4$ appearance, after which we discuss the basic properties of this material and its family. Finally, we overview the exciting progress made during five years of intense research in this field.</description>

Abstract: MAB phases have appealing physical features that make them appropriate for a wide range of applications. Motivated by this, we present density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the structural, elastic, bonding, electronic band dispersion, acoustic behavior, phonon spectrum, various thermomechanical and optoelectronic properties of VAlB and TaAlB ternary borides for the first time. The computed ground state lattice parameters of both compounds are very consistent with experimental data. The formation enthalpy, elastic constants, and phonon dispersion calculations indicate that both compounds are chemically, mechanically, and dynamically stable, respectively. The physical parameters of VAlB and TaAlB are studied and compared with those of MoAlB and NbAlB MAB compounds.</description>

      <title>Tunable resonant Raman scattering with temperature in vertically aligned 2H-SnS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional semiconducting materials have a wide range of applications in various fields due to their excellent properties and rich physics. Here, we report a detailed investigation of the temperature dependent Raman and Photoluminescence measurements on the vertically aligned 2H-SnS2 grown by CVD method. Our results established the tunability of the resonant Raman scattering with varying temperature, i.e. a crossover between resonance and non-resonance conditions for the current system. We also discussed the temperature as well as laser power dependence of the low frequency asymmetric Raman mode which is interlayer shear mode. Temperature dependence of the intensity of the phonon modes also manifests the tunability of the resonant Raman scattering with temperature. Our temperature dependent Photoluminescence measurement shows the strong temperature dependence of the excitonic peaks which is confirmed with laser power dependence of the Photoluminescence measurement at room temperature. Our investigation may help to design and fabricate devices based on vertically aligned 2H-SnS2 and other similar materials in future.</description>

      <title>Phase-field modeling of elastic microphase separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel phase-field model to predict elastic microphase separation in polymer gels. To this end, we extend the Cahn-Hilliard free-energy functional to incorporate an elastic strain energy and a coupling term. These contributions are naturally obtained from a derivation that starts from an entropic elastic energy density combined with the assumption of weak compressibility, upon second-order approximation around the swollen state. The resulting terms correspond to those of a poroelastic formulation where the coupling energetic term can be interpreted as the osmotic work of the solvent within the polymer matrix. Additionally, a convolution term is included in the total energy to model non-local forces responsible for coarsening arrest. With analytical derivations in 1D and finite element computations in 2D we show that the mechanical deformation controls the composition of the stable phases, the initial characteristic length and time, the coarsening rates and the arrested characteristic length. Moreover, we demonstrate that the proposed coupling is able to predict the arrest of coarsening at a length scale controlled by the stiffness of the dry polymer. The numerical results show excellent agreement with the experimental evidence in terms of phase-separated morphology and scaling of the characteristic length with the stiffness of the dry polymer.</description>

      <title>Accelerating point defect photo-emission calculations with machine learning interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a computational framework leveraging universal machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) to dramatically accelerate the calculation of photoluminescence (PL) spectra of atomic or molecular emitters with \emph{ab initio} accuracy. By replacing the costly density functional theory (DFT) computation of phonon modes with much faster MLIP phonon mode calculations, our approach achieves speed improvements exceeding an order of magnitude with minimal precision loss. We benchmark the approach using a dataset comprising \emph{ab initio} emission spectra of 791 color centers spanning various types of crystal point defects in different charge and magnetic states. The method is also applied to a molecular emitter adsorbed on a hexagonal boron nitride surface. Across all the systems, we find excellent agreement for both the Huang-Rhys factor and the PL lineshapes. This application of universal MLIPs bridges the gap between computational efficiency and spectroscopic fidelity, opening pathways to high-throughput screening of defect-engineered materials. Our work not only demonstrates accelerated calculation of PL spectra with DFT accuracy, but also makes such calculations tractable for more complex materials.</description>

      <title>Real-space orbital tiling approach for the design of novel superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite substantial advances in the field, we still lack a predictive framework capable of guiding the discovery of new families of superconductors. While momentum-space approaches have advanced the microscopic understanding of superconductivity, they offer limited guidance for materials design based on atomic building blocks. Here, we propose a real-space framework which conceptualizes Cooper pairs as confined standing waves resulting from coherent tilings of atomic orbitals. We call this model the Real-space Orbital Superconducting Pathway (ROSP). Using a tight-binding toy model, we show that the energetics of electron pairing depend on the configuration and overlap of real-space orbitals, which motivates \textit{a priori} design of superconducting families from orbital tiling. We connect the ROSP model to Roald Hoffmann's isolobal analogy to classify families of superconductors based on shared orbital tilings, rather than structure or electron count. As an example, we suggest that superconductivity in La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ and LaNiO$_{2}$, despite differing structures and electron counts, may arise from a common ROSP. We introduce a new notation to classify two-dimensional square-net ROSPs and further propose several new families of superconductors on the anti-cuprate lattice. This framework provides a new model for predicting and designing families of high-T$_c$ superconductors from real-space orbital architecture, even without microscopic knowledge of the attractive pairing interaction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review recent studies on quantum materials where transition-metal atoms give rise to $d$-bands typical of kagome metals. Using examples from several material families - AV$_3$Sb$_5$, FeGe, RV$_6$Sn$_6$, and LaRu$_3$Si$_2$ - we argue that $p$-bands contributed by elements beyond the kagome network also play a crucial role in the electronic instabilities, including the charge-density-waves and superconductivity in kagome metals.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Chern Half-Metal with High Anomalous Hall Conductivity in 2D BaNiCl$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) half-metals offer complete spin polarization at the Fermi level, making them candidates for dissipationless spin transport. Yet intrinsic 2D half-metals exhibiting robust topological features, particularly large Chern number anomalous Hall conductivities, remain exceptionally rare. Using first-principles calculations, we identify atomically thin BaNiCl$_3$, a layered halide perovskite (perovskene), as a topological half-metal. It exhibits a high Chern number ($C \ge 2$), a large anomalous Hall conductivity of 316~$\Omega^{-1},\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, and a Fermi velocity of $\approx 0.78 \times 10^6$ m/s. The coexistence of complete spin polarization and high carrier velocity suggests low-dissipation spin transport. Spin-orbit coupling opens a sizable topological gap of $\sim 20\,$ meV, yielding nontrivial Berry curvature and enhancing the anomalous Hall response. Ferromagnetism is stabilized by the Ni$^{2+}$ ($d^8$) configuration and Cl-mediated superexchange, supporting magnetic ordering at elevated temperatures. These results establish BaNiCl$_3$ as a rare intrinsic Chern half-metal, with potential applications in quantum and spintronic technologies.</description>

      <title>Quantum Monte Carlo assessment of embedding for a strongly-correlated defect: interplay between mean-field and interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Point defects are of interest for many applications, from quantum sensing to modifying bulk properties of materials. Because of their localized orbitals, the electronic states are often strongly correlated, which has led to a proliferation of quantum embedding techniques to treat this correlation. In these techniques, a weakly correlated reference such as density functional theory is used to treat most of the one-particle states, while certain states are singled out as an active space to be treated with an effective interaction. We assess these techniques in the context of an iron defect in aluminum nitride by referencing to a fully correlated quantum Monte Carlo description. This comparison allows us to have access to detailed information about the many-body wave functions, which are not available experimentally. We find that errors in the underlying density functional theory calculation, and thus choice of the active space, lead to qualitatively incorrect excited states from the embedded model. These errors are extremely difficult to recover from by adding corrections such as double counting or many-body perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Tailoring Heat Transfer at Silica-Water Interfaces via Hydroxyl and Methyl Surface Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient thermal transport across solid-liquid interfaces is essential for optimizing heat dissipation in modern technological applications. This study employs molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the impact of surface functionalization on heat transfer at the silica/water interface. It has been shown that the surface functionalization changes significantly the wetting characteristics of silica surface: from one hand hydroxyl groups render such surfaces more hydrophilic, while methyl groups more hydrophobic. Here, we reveal that modifying the surface functionalization from methylated to hydroxylated groups results in: (i) up to an approximately eightfold increase in adhesion energy, (ii) a reorientation of interfacial water molecules to align perpendicular to the surface normal, (iii) a reduction in the liquid depletion length near the interface, and (iv) an overall enhancement of interfacial heat conduction. We quantify interfacial thermal resistance through the calculation of the contribution of each functional group to the total heat flux, providing insights into the physical mechanisms governing heat transfer at functionalized interfaces. We demonstrated that manipulation of the concentrations of the functional groups can be used to tailor interfacial thermal transport.</description>

      <title>Multi Moire Networks in Engineered Lateral Hetero-Bilayers: Programmable Phononic Reconfiguration and Second Harmonic Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moire engineering in two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides enables access to correlated quantum phenomena. Realizing such effects demands simultaneous control over twist angle and material composition to modulate phonons, excitons, and their interactions. However, most studies rely on exfoliated flakes, limiting scalability and systematic exploration. Here, we demonstrate a scalable multi-moire network by vertically stacking CVD-grown monolayer lateral heterostructures. Signatures of moire non-rigidity, including phonon frequency softening, linewidth broadening, and strain localization, are attributed to two lattice relaxation modes; rotational reconstruction and volumetric dilation. Micro-angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy reveals that interfacial orbital interactions modulate interlayer coupling. At aligned angles, molybdenum diselenides exhibit reduced valley polarization and Davydov splitting, indicating strain-induced symmetry breaking and chiral phonon effects. Notably, SHG modulation was obderved with variation in twist angle due to lower coherence and band-offset-driven phase delay. First-principles calculations support these findings. This work provides a route to programmable, scalable multi-moire platforms for opto-straintronics, quantum sensing, and on-chip photonics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diamond defects are among the most promising qubits. Modelling their properties through accurate quantum mechanical simulations can further their development into robust units of information. We use the recently developed capped density functional embedding theory (capped-DFET) with the multiconfigurational n-electron valence second-order perturbation theory to characterize the electronic excitation energies for different spin manifolds of the well-characterized negatively charged substitutional N defect adjacent to a vacancy (V$_C$) in diamond (N$_C$V$_C^-$). We successfully reproduce vertical excitation energies for both triplet and singlet states of N$_C$V$_C^-$ with errors &lt; 0.1 eV. Unlike other embedding methods, capped-DFET exhibits robust predictions that are approximately independent of the embedded cluster size: it only requires a cluster to contain the defect atoms and their nearest neighbors (as small as a 40-atom capped cluster). Furthermore, our method is free from slowly converging Coulomb interactions between charged defects, and thus also only weakly dependent on supercell size.</description>

      <title>Direct evidence for two-gap superconductivity in hydrogen-intercalated titanium diselenide</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) offer an extremely rich material platform in the exploration of unconventional superconductivity. The unconventional aspects include exotic coupling mechanisms such as the Ising pairing, a complex interplay with other electronic orders such as charge-density waves (CDWs), symmetry-breaking and topological effects, and non-trivial gap structures such as multi-gap and possible nodal phases. Among TMDs, titanium diselenide (1$T$-TiSe$_2$) is one of the most studied and debated cases. Hints to an anomalous structure of its superconducting order parameter have emerged over the years, possibly linked to its spatial texturing in real and reciprocal space due to the presence of a 2$\times$2$\times$2 CDW phase, or to a pressure-driven multi-band Fermi surface. However, a direct evidence for a non-trivial structure of the superconducting gap in this material is still lacking. In this work, we bring the first evidence for a two-gap structure in the recently-discovered H-intercalated TiSe$_2$ superconductor (with T$_c \simeq 3.6$ K) by an extensive experimental study that combines magnetotransport measurements, point-contact spectroscopy and scanning tunnel spectroscopy. We show that the temperature dependence of the upper critical field (for $\vec B \parallel c$) as well as the shape of the point-contact and tunneling spectra strongly suggest the existence of two distinct superconducting gaps, and can indeed all be fitted in a self-consistent way with the same gap amplitudes $\Delta_1 = 0.26 \pm 0.12$ meV and $\Delta_2 =0.62 \pm 0.18$ meV.</description>

      <title>Designing Band Gaps with Randomly Distributed Sub-Wavelength Helmholtz Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that band gaps, in the frequency domain, can be achieved by using periodic metamaterials. However it has been challenging to design materials with broad band gaps or that have multiple overlapping band gaps. For periodic materials this difficulty arises because many different length scales would have to be repeated periodically within the same structure to have multiple overlapping band gaps. Here we present an alternative: to design band gaps with disordered materials. We show how to tailor band gaps by choosing any combination of Helmholtz resonators that are positioned randomly within a host acoustic medium. One key result is that we are able to reach simple formulae for the effective material properties, which work over a broad frequency range, and can therefore be used to rapidly design tailored metamaterials. We show that these formulae are robust by comparing them with high-fidelity Monte Carlo simulations over randomly positioned resonant scatterers.</description>

      <title>Hacktive Matter: data-driven discovery through hackathon-based cross-disciplinary coding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The past decade has seen unprecedented growth in active matter and autonomous biomaterials research, yielding diverse classes of materials that promise revolutionary applications such as self-healing infrastructure and self-sensing tissue implants. However, inconsistencies in metrics, definitions, and analysis algorithms across research groups, as well as the high-dimension data streams, has hindered identification of performance intersections. Progress in this arena demands multi-disciplinary team approaches to discovery with scaffolded training and cross-pollination of ideas, and requires new learning and collaboration methods. To address this challenge, we have developed a hackathon platform to train future scientists and engineers in big data, interdisciplinary collaboration, and community coding; and to design and beta-test high-throughput (HTP) biomaterials analysis software and workflows. We enforce a flat hierarchy, pairing participants ranging from high school students to faculty with varied experiences and skills to collectively contribute to data acquisition and processing, ideation, coding, testing and dissemination. With clearly-defined goals and deliverables, participants achieve success through a series of tutorials, small group coding sessions, facilitated breakouts, and large group report-outs and discussions. These modules facilitate efficient iterative algorithm development and optimization; strengthen community and collaboration skills; and establish teams, benchmarks, and community standards for continued productive work. Our hackathons provide a powerful model for the soft matter community to educate and train students and collaborators in cutting edge data-driven analysis, which is critical for future innovation in complex materials research.</description>

      <title>SEAMM: A Simulation Environment for Atomistic and Molecular Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Simulation Environment for Atomistic and Molecular Modeling (SEAMM) is an open-source software package written in Python that provides a graphical interface for setting up, executing, and analyzing molecular and materials simulations. The graphical interface reduces the entry barrier for the use of new simulation tools, facilitating the interoperability of a wide range of simulation tools available to solve complex scientific and engineering problems in computational molecular science. Workflows are represented graphically by user-friendly flowcharts which are shareable and reproducible. When a flowchart is executed within the SEAMM environment, all results, as well as metadata describing the workflow and codes used, are saved in a datastore that can be viewed using a browser-based dashboard, which allows collaborators to view the results and use the flowcharts to extend the results. SEAMM is a powerful productivity and collaboration tool that enables interoperability between simulation codes and ensures reproducibility and transparency in scientific research.</description>

Abstract: This is a response to the comments [arXiv:2407.15682 and Phys.Rev.B 111, 146401 (2025)] by Yokouchi et al. on our paper in Phys.Rev.B 110, 174402 (2024). In this Reply, we note that (i) their arguments lack a discussion of whether the overall characteristics of the observed nonlinear impedance, including its magnitude and unphysical negative inductance interpretation, can be explained by the emergent induction scenario, whereas the Joule heating model can, (ii) they incorrectly refer to the Joule heating model, and (iii) their new data in the Comment are also quantitatively explained by the Joule heating model. These findings suggest that, contrary to the opinion by Yokouchi et al., the overall behavior of the observed impedance is irrelevant to emergent induction.</description>

      <title>Cartesian atomic moment machine learning interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have substantially advanced atomistic simulations in materials science and chemistry by balancing accuracy and computational efficiency. While leading MLIPs rely on representing atomic environments using spherical tensors, Cartesian representations offer potential advantages in simplicity and efficiency. Here, we introduce the Cartesian Atomic Moment Potential (CAMP), an approach to building MLIPs entirely in Cartesian space. CAMP constructs atomic moment tensors from neighboring atoms and employs tensor products to incorporate higher body-order interactions, providing a complete description of local atomic environments. Integrated into a graph neural network (GNN) framework, CAMP enables physically motivated, systematically improvable potentials. The model demonstrates excellent performance across diverse systems, including periodic structures, small organic molecules, and two-dimensional materials, achieving accuracy, efficiency, and stability in molecular dynamics simulations that rival or surpass current leading models. CAMP provides a powerful tool for atomistic simulations to accelerate materials understanding and discovery.</description>

      <title>Beware of the water: Hidden hydrogenation of perovskite membranes made by the water-soluble sacrificial layer method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fabrication of perovskite oxide free-standing films (membranes) by lift-off methods using water-soluble sacrificial layers is appealing because of the new mechanical degrees of freedom that these membranes present over conventional epitaxial films. However, little is known about how their fabrication process, and in particular the exposure to water during the etching step, affects their properties. Here, we investigate how membranes of two perovskite archetypes, antiferroelectric PbZrO3 and paraelectric SrTiO3, are affected by water-based etching step. Using Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction, we find evidence that hydrogen penetrates the perovskite structure. Concomitant with this protonation, the functional properties also change, and both materials display ferroelectric-like behavior that is absent in bulk ceramics or hydrogen-free films at room temperature. We also find that thermal annealing can be used to expel the hydrogen from the membranes, which henceforth recover bulk-like properties. The two main conclusions of this work are that (i) any perovskite membrane made by sacrificial layer hydrolysis is vulnerable to hydrogen penetration (protonation) that can induce important but extrinsic changes in functional properties, and (ii) the hydrogen can, and should, be expelled by annealing to recover intrinsic behaviour.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Fine Structure and Energy-driven Transition of Photoelectron Kikuchi Diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The intricate fine structure of Kikuchi diffraction plays a vital role in probing phase transformations and strain distributions in functional materials, particularly in electron microscopy. Beyond these applications, it also proves essential in photoemission spectroscopy (PES) at high photon energies, aiding in the disentanglement of complex angle-resolved PES data and enabling emitter-site-specific studies. However, the detection and analysis of these rich faint structures in photoelectron diffraction (PED), especially in the hard X-ray regime, remain highly challenging, with only a limited number of simulations successfully reproducing these patterns. The strong energy dependence of Kikuchi patterns further complicates their interpretation, necessitating advanced theoretical approaches. To enhance structural analysis, we present a comprehensive theoretical study of fine diffraction patterns and their evolution with energy by simulating core-level emissions from Ge(100) and Si(100). Using multiple-scattering theory and the fully relativistic one-step photoemission model, we simulate faint pattern networks for various core levels across different kinetic energies (106 eV - 4174 eV), avoiding cluster size convergence issues inherent in cluster-based methods. Broadening in patterns is discussed via the inelastic scattering treatment. For the first time, circular dichroism has been observed and successfully reproduced in the angular distribution of Si (100) 1s, revealing detailed features and asymmetries up to 31%. Notably, we successfully replicate experimental bulk and more "surface-sensitivity" diffraction features, further validating the robustness of our simulations. The results show remarkable agreement with the experimental data obtained using circularly polarized radiations, demonstrating the potential of this methodology for advancing high-energy PES investigations.</description>

      <title>Exciton Basis Description of Ultrafast Triplet Separation in Pentacene-(Tetracene)2-Pentacene Intramolecular Singlet Fission Chromophore</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16519v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precise understanding of the electronic structures of optically dark triplet-triplet multiexcitons that are the intermediate states in singlet fission (SF) continues to be a challenge. This is particularly true for intramolecular singlet fission (iSF) chromophores, that are oligomers of large monomer molecules. We have performed quantum many-body calculations of the complete set of excited states relevant to iSF in Pentacene-(Tetracene)2-Pentacene oligomers, consisting of two terminal pentacene monomers linked by two tetracene monomers. Our computations use an exciton basis that gives physical pictorial descriptions of all eigenstates, and are performed over an active space of twenty-eight monomer molecular orbitals, including configuration interaction with all relevant quadruple excitations within the active space, thereby ensuring very high precision. We discuss the many-electron structures of the optical predominantly intramonomer spin-singlets, intermonomer charge-transfer excitations, and most importantly, the complete set of low energy covalent triplet-triplet multiexcitons. We are able to explain the weak binding energy of the pentacene-tetracene triplet-triplet eigenstate that is generated following photoexcitation. We explain the increase in lifetime with increasing numbers of tetracene monomers of the transient absorption associated with contiguous pentacene-tetracene triplet-triplet in this family of oligomers. We are consequently able to give a pictorial description of the triplet separation following generation of the initial triplet-triplet, leading to a state with individual triplets occupying only the two pentacene monomers. We expect many applications of our theoretical approach to triplet separation.</description>

      <title>A rigorous data-driven approach to the nucleation of defects in metals exploiting the link between kinetic properties and (dis)order parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nucleation processes, through which a new structure progressively forms within a pre-existing homogeneous phase, are fundamental in materials science, but are also typically non-trivial to elucidate. Cases in which to nucleate are defects (or disorder) in an initially ordered structure make no exception. A prominent example is the nucleation of dislocations in metals, which critically govern their mechanical, electronic, thermal, and chemical properties. While atomic-level insights can be attained using, \textit{e.g.}, molecular dynamics simulations, systematically characterizing nucleation mechanisms and accurately quantifying kinetic rates remain challenging tasks. In this work, we demonstrate how the choice of the order parameter used to track the transition has a very strong effect on the accuracy of the kinetic rate predicted from the corresponding free-energy barrier and diffusion coefficient, a fact that has been often overlooked in the past. By exploiting this systematic error to our advantage, we demonstrate that it is possible to rigorously characterize the nucleation process using a data-driven scheme based on a variational principle, leading to optimal order parameters and a faithful mechanistic description. We apply this method to characterize, as a representative case study, the nucleation of dislocations in crystalline $fcc$ copper by analyzing replica molecular dynamics simulations at the elastic-plastic limit. By means of committor analysis and Langevin modeling, our approach allows to systematically rank candidate (dis)order parameters, identify the critical nuclei (transition states), and infer the free-energy landscapes. Given its general foundations, this method can be extended to nucleation phenomena in a broad class of materials.</description>

      <title>Towards Space Group Determination from EBSD Patterns: The Role of Deep Learning and High-throughput Dynamical Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The design of novel materials hinges on the understanding of structure-property relationships. However, in recent times, our capability to synthesize a large number of materials has outpaced our speed at characterizing them. While the overall chemical constituents can be readily known during synthesis, the structural evolution and characterization of newly synthesized samples remains a bottleneck for the ultimate goal of high throughput nanomaterials discovery. Thus, scalable methods for crystal symmetry determination that can analyze a large volume of material samples within a short time-frame are especially needed. Kikuchi diffraction in the SEM is a promising technique for this due to its sensitivity to dynamical scattering, which may provide information beyond just the seven crystal systems and fourteen Bravais lattices. After diffraction patterns are collected from material samples, deep learning methods may be able to classify the space group symmetries using the patterns as input, which paired with the elemental composition, would help enable the determination of the crystal structure. To investigate the feasibility of this solution, neural networks were trained to predict the space group type of background corrected EBSD patterns. Our networks were first trained and tested on an artificial dataset of EBSD patterns of 5,148 different cubic phases, created through physics-based dynamical simulations. Next, Maximum Classifier Discrepancy, an unsupervised deep learning-based domain adaptation method, was utilized to train neural networks to make predictions for experimental EBSD patterns. We introduce a relabeling scheme, which enables our models to achieve accuracy scores higher than 90% on simulated and experimental data, suggesting that neural networks are capable of making predictions of crystal symmetry from an EBSD pattern.</description>

      <title>Topology-induced symmetry breaking demonstrated in antiferromagnetic magnons on a M\"obius strip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07846v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a mechanism of topology-induced symmetry breaking, where certain local symmetry preserved by the Hamiltonian is explicitly broken in the eigenmodes of excitation due to nontrivial real-space topology. We demonstrate this phenomenon by studying magnonic excitations on a M\"obius strip comprising of two antiferromagnetically coupled spin chains. Even with a simple Hamiltonian respecting local rotational symmetry and all local curvature effects ignored, magnons exhibit linear polarization of the N\'eel vector devoid of chirality, forming two non-degenerate branches that cannot be smoothly connected to or be globally decomposed by the circularly-polarized magnons. Correspondingly, one branch undergoes a spectral shift and only admits standing waves of half-integer wavelength, whereas the other only affords standing waves of integer wavelength. Under the M\"obius boundary condition, we further identify an exotic phase hosting spontaneous antiferromagnetic order whilst all exchange couplings are ferromagnetic. The suppression of chirality in the order parameter dynamics, hence the pattern of standing waves, can be generalized to other elementary excitations on non-orientable surfaces. Our findings showcase the profound influence of real-space topology on the physical nature of not just the ground state but also the quasiparticles.</description>

      <title>Fully independent response in disordered solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unlike in crystals, it is difficult to trace emergent material properties of amorphous solids to their underlying structure. Nevertheless, one can tune features of a disordered spring network, ranging from bulk elastic constants to specific allosteric responses, through highly precise alterations of the structure. This has been understood through the notion of independent bond-level response -- the observation that in many cases, different springs have different effects on different properties. While this idea has motivated inverse design in numerous contexts, it has not been formalized and quantified in a general context that not just informs but enables and predicts inverse design. Here, we show how to quantify independent response by linearizing the simultaneous change in multiple emergent features, and introduce the much stronger notion of fully independent response. Remarkably, we find that the mechanical properties of disordered solids are always fully independent across a wide array of scenarios, regardless of the target features, tunable parameters, and details of particle-particle interactions. Furthermore, our formulation quantifies the susceptibility of feature changes to parameter changes, which we find to be correlated with the maximum linear tunability. These results formalize our understanding of a key fundamental difference between ordered and disordered solids while also creating a practical tool to both understand and perform inverse design.</description>

      <title>SA-GAT-SR: Self-Adaptable Graph Attention Networks with Symbolic Regression for high-fidelity material property prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have demonstrated an enormous utility of deep learning approaches, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for materials science. These methods have emerged as powerful tools for high-throughput prediction of material properties, offering a compelling enhancement and alternative to traditional first-principles calculations. While the community has predominantly focused on developing increasingly complex and universal models to enhance predictive accuracy, such approaches often lack physical interpretability and insights into materials behavior. Here, we introduce a novel computational paradigm, Self-Adaptable Graph Attention Networks integrated with Symbolic Regression (SA-GAT-SR), that synergistically combines the predictive capability of GNNs with the interpretative power of symbolic regression. Our framework employs a self-adaptable encoding algorithm that automatically identifies and adjust attention weights so as to screen critical features from an expansive 180-dimensional feature space while maintaining O(n) computational scaling. The integrated SR module subsequently distills these features into compact analytical expressions that explicitly reveal quantum-mechanically meaningful relationships, achieving 23 times acceleration compared to conventional SR implementations that heavily rely on first principle calculations-derived features as input. This work suggests a new framework in computational materials science, bridging the gap between predictive accuracy and physical interpretability, offering valuable physical insights into material behavior.</description>
