      <title>Exploiting the packing-field route to craft custom time crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time crystals are many-body systems that spontaneously break time-translation symmetry, and thus exhibit long-range spatiotemporal order and robust periodic motion. Recent results have demonstrated how to build time-crystal phases in driven diffusive fluids using an external packing field coupled to density fluctuations. Here we exploit this mechanism to engineer and control on-demand custom continuous time crystals characterized by an arbitrary number of rotating condensates, which can be further enhanced with higher-order modes. We elucidate the underlying critical point, as well as general properties of the condensates density profiles and velocities, demonstrating a scaling property of higher-order traveling condensates in terms of first-order ones. We illustrate our findings by solving the hydrodynamic equations for various paradigmatic driven diffusive systems, obtaining along the way a number of remarkable results, e.g. the possibility of explosive time crystal phases characterized by an abrupt, first-order-type transition. Overall, these results demonstrate the versatility and broad possibilities of this promising route to time crystals.</description>

      <title>Finite-size generators for weak integrability breaking perturbations in the Heisenberg chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An integrable model perturbed by special ''weak integrability-breaking'' perturbations thermalizes at timescales much longer than predicted by Fermi's golden rule. Recently, a systematic construction of such perturbations based on the so-called long-range deformations of integrable chains was formulated. These perturbations, obtained as truncations of the long-range deformations in some small parameter expansions, can be viewed as produced by unitary rotations of the short-range integrable models. For infinite systems, several ''generators'' (extensive local, boosted, and bilocal operators) of weak perturbations are known. The main aim of this work is to understand the appropriate generators in finite systems with periodic boundaries since simple counterparts to boosted and bilocal operators are not known in such cases. We approach this by studying the structure of the adiabatic gauge potential (AGP), a proxy for such generators in finite chains, which was originally introduced as a very sensitive measure of quantum chaos. We prove an exact relation between the AGPs for the boosted and bilocal classes of generators and note that the counterpart to boost does not seem to have a closed analytic form in finite systems but shows quasi-locality nonetheless. We also introduce and study strictly local variants of weak integrability-breaking perturbations.</description>

      <title>Relation between Entropy, Diffusion and Relaxation Kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intermolecular correlations lower values of both diffusion and entropy. We present an analysis of the existing relations between long-time diffusion (D) and entropy. S. A recently proposed inequality, a lower bound, by Sorkin et al., expresses the long-time diffusion in terms of diffusion in a reference state and the entropy difference. Such a relationship may provide a measure of intermolecular correlations. We show that for a one-dimensional rugged energy landscape, the lower bound becomes equality only if certain three-site correlations are neglected. When these correlations are included, we can derive an accurate expression that agrees with computer simulations. The strong dimensionality dependence of diffusion of a Brownian particle in a rugged energy landscape also resembles the recently proposed inequality. We show that for interacting colloids, a mode-coupling theory-type calculation of diffusion coefficient can be combined with the new inequality to estimate entropy change from long-range inter-colloid correlations. Interestingly, the rate of barrier crossing in a multidimensional potential energy surface, related to diffusion in a periodic lattice, is shown to admit a relation that depends on the entropy change in a way reminiscent of the relation between D and S.</description>

      <title>Effective affinity for generic currents in nonequilibrium processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In mesoscopic experiments it is common to observe a single fluctuating current, such as the position of a molecular motor, while the complete set of currents is inaccessible. For such scenarios with partial information we introduce an effective affinity for generic currents in Markov processes. The effective affinity quantifies dissipative and fluctuation properties of fluctuating currents. Notably, the effective affinity multiplied by the current lower bounds the rate of dissipation, and the effective affinity determines first-passage and extreme value statistics of fluctuating currents. In addition, we determine the conditions under which the effective affinity has a stalling force interpretation. To derive these results we introduce a family of martingales associated with generic currents.</description>

      <title>Drift-diffusive resetting search process with stochastic returns: speed-up beyond optimal instantaneous return</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic resetting has emerged as a useful strategy to reduce the completion time for a broad class of first passage processes. In the canonical setup, one intermittently resets a given system to its initial configuration only to start afresh and continue evolving in time until the target goal is met. This is, however, an instantaneous process and thus less feasible for any practical purposes. A crucial generalization in this regard is to consider a finite-time return process which has significant ramifications to the first passage properties. Intriguingly, it has recently been shown that for diffusive search processes, returning in finite but stochastic time can gain significant speed-up over the instantaneous resetting process. Unlike diffusion which has a diverging mean completion time, in this paper, we ask whether this phenomena can also be observed for a first passage process with finite mean completion time. To this end, we explore the set-up of a classical drift-diffusive search process in one dimension with stochastic resetting and further assume that the return phase is modulated by a potential $U(x)=\lambda |x|$ with $\lambda&gt;0$. For this process, we compute the mean first passage time exactly and underpin its characteristics with respect to the resetting rate and potential strength. We find a unified phase space that allows us to explore and identify the system parameter regions where stochastic return supersedes over both the underlying process and the process under instantaneous resetting. Furthermore and quite interestingly, we find that for a range of parameters the mean completion time under stochastic return protocol can be reduced further than the \textit{optimally restarted} instantaneous processes. We thus believe that resetting with stochastic returns can serve as a better optimization strategy owing to its dominance over classical first passage under resetting.</description>

      <title>Learning dynamical behaviors in physical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physical learning is an emerging paradigm in science and engineering whereby (meta)materials acquire desired macroscopic behaviors by exposure to examples. So far, it has been applied to static properties such as elastic moduli and self-assembled structures encoded in minima of an energy landscape. Here, we extend this paradigm to dynamic functionalities, such as motion and shape change, that are instead encoded in limit cycles or pathways of a dynamical system. We identify the two ingredients needed to learn time-dependent behaviors irrespective of experimental platforms: (i) learning rules with time delays and (ii) exposure to examples that break time-reversal symmetry during training. After providing a hands-on demonstration of these requirements using programmable LEGO toys, we turn to realistic particle-based simulations where the training rules are not programmed on a computer. Instead, we elucidate how they emerge from physico-chemical processes involving the causal propagation of fields, like in recent experiments on moving oil droplets with chemotactic signalling. Our trainable particles can self-assemble into structures that move or change shape on demand, either by retrieving the dynamic behavior previously seen during training, or by learning on the fly. This rich phenomenology is captured by a modified Hopfield spin model amenable to analytical treatment. The principles illustrated here provide a step towards von Neumann's dream of engineering synthetic living systems that adapt to the environment.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hardware-Enabled Molecular Dynamics via Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to perform ab initio molecular dynamics simulations using potential energies calculated on quantum computers would allow virtually exact dynamics for chemical and biochemical systems, with substantial impacts on the fields of catalysis and biophysics. However, noisy hardware, the costs of computing gradients, and the number of qubits required to simulate large systems present major challenges to realizing the potential of dynamical simulations using quantum hardware. Here, we demonstrate that some of these issues can be mitigated by recent advances in machine learning. By combining transfer learning with techniques for building machine-learned potential energy surfaces, we propose a new path forward for molecular dynamics simulations on quantum hardware. We use transfer learning to reduce the number of energy evaluations that use quantum hardware by first training models on larger, less accurate classical datasets and then refining them on smaller, more accurate quantum datasets. We demonstrate this approach by training machine learning models to predict a molecule's potential energy using Behler-Parrinello neural networks. When successfully trained, the model enables energy gradient predictions necessary for dynamics simulations that cannot be readily obtained directly from quantum hardware. To reduce the quantum resources needed, the model is initially trained with data derived from low-cost techniques, such as Density Functional Theory, and subsequently refined with a smaller dataset obtained from the optimization of the Unitary Coupled Cluster ansatz. We show that this approach significantly reduces the size of the quantum training dataset while capturing the high accuracies needed for quantum chemistry simulations.</description>

      <title>Family of Exact and Inexact Quantum Speed Limits for Completely Positive and Trace-Preserving Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional quantum speed limits formulated in density matrix space perform poorly for dynamics beyond unitary, as they are generally unattainable and fail to characterize the fastest possible dynamics. To address this, we derive two distinct quantum speed limits in Liouville space for Completely Positive and Trace-Preserving (CPTP) dynamics that outperform previous bounds. The first bound saturates for time-optimal CPTP dynamics, while the second bound is exact for all states and all CPTP dynamics. Our bounds have a clear physical and geometric interpretation arising from the uncertainty of superoperators and the geometry of quantum evolution in Liouville space. They can be regarded as the generalization of the Mandelstam-Tamm bound, providing uncertainty relations between time, energy, and dissipation for open quantum dynamics. Additionally, our bounds are significantly simpler to estimate and experimentally more feasible as they require to compute or measure the overlap of density matrices and the variance of the Liouvillian. We have also obtained the form of the Liouvillian, which generates the time-optimal (fastest) CPTP dynamics for given initial and final states. We give two important applications of our bounds. First, we show that the speed of evolution in Liouville space bounds the growth of the spectral form factor and Krylov complexity of states, which are crucial for studying information scrambling and quantum chaos. Second, using our bounds, we explain the Mpemba effect in non-equilibrium open quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Continuous time crystals as a PT symmetric state and the emergence of critical exceptional points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous time-translation symmetry is often spontaneously broken in open quantum systems, and the condition for their emergence has been actively investigated. However, there are only a few cases in which its condition for appearance has been fully elucidated. In this Letter, we show that a Lindladian parity-time (PT) symmetry can generically produce persistent periodic oscillations, including dissipative continuous time crystals, in one-collective spin models. By making an analogy to non-reciprocal phase transitions, we demonstrate that a transition point from the dynamical phase is associated with spontaneous PT symmetry breaking and typically corresponds to a \textit{critical exceptional point}. Interestingly, the periodic orbits in the PT-symmetric phase are found to be center-type, implying an initial-state-dependent amplitude. These results are established by proving that the Lindbladian PT symmetry at the microscopic level implies a non-linear PT symmetry, and by performing a linear stability analysis near the transition point. This research will further our understanding of novel non-equilibrium phases of matter and phase transitions with spontaneous anti-unitary symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Perfectly hidden order and Z2 confinement transition in a fully packed monopole liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a simple variant of spin ice whose degenerate ground states are densely packed monopole configurations. An applied field drives this model through a Z2 confinement transition, in absence of any local order parameter. Instead, this hidden order turns out to be diagnosed by a string order invisible to any local probe. We describe the transition in terms of a bosonic field theory with a pairing term, as well as a Kramers-Wannier duality into a 3D Ising model, which establishes its Z2 nature. This topological transition can be thought of as a variant of the celebrated U(1) Kasteleyn transition; but instead of the traditional '3/2'-order kink, the system shows critical scaling expected near a 3D Ising transition. Remarkably, however, the magnetic response scales with the critical exponent not of the susceptibility, but of the specific heat.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluctuation theorems are generalisations of the second law that describe the relations between work, temperature, and free energy in thermodynamic processes and are used extensively in studies of irreversibility and entropy. Many experiments have verified these relations for different physical systems in the setting of thermodynamics. In this study, we observe the same behavior away from physical thermodynamics, namely for the card game UNO, by performing numerical simulations of the game. As the analog of work, we choose the number of steps one player needs to effect a transition in her deck; the other players and the remaining cards play the role of a finite, non-Markovian bath. We also compare our observation with is expected for a Markovian random walk.</description>

      <title>Entanglement dynamics and eigenstate correlations in strongly disordered quantum many-body systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The many-body localised phase of quantum systems is an unusual dynamical phase wherein the system fails to thermalise and yet, entanglement grows unboundedly albeit very slowly in time. We present a microscopic theory of this ultraslow growth of entanglement in terms of dynamical eigenstate correlations of strongly disordered, interacting quantum systems in the many-body localised regime. These correlations involve sets of four or more eigenstates and hence, go beyond correlations involving pairs of eigenstates which are usually studied in the context of eigenstate thermalisation or lack thereof. We consider the minimal case, namely the second R\'enyi entropy of entanglement, of an initial product state as well as that of the time-evolution operator, wherein the correlations involve quartets of four eigenstates. We identify that the dynamics of the entanglement entropy is dominated by the spectral correlations within certain special quartets of eigenstates. We uncover the spatial structure of these special quartets and the ensuing statistics of the spectral correlations amongst the eigenstates therein, which reveals a hierarchy of timescales or equivalently, energyscales. We show that the hierarchy of these timescales along with their non-trivial distributions conspire to produce the logarithmic in time growth of entanglement, characteristic of the many-body localised regime. The underlying spatial structures in the set of special quartets also provides a microscopic understanding of the spacetime picture of the entanglement growth. The theory therefore provides a much richer perspective on entanglement growth in strongly disordered systems compared to the commonly employed phenomenological approach based on the $\ell$-bit picture.</description>

Abstract: The emergence of detailed maps of physical networks, like the brain connectome, vascular networks, or composite networks in metamaterials, whose nodes and links are physical entities, have demonstrated the limits of the current network science toolset. Link physicality imposes a non-crossing condition that affects both the evolution and the structure of a network, in a way that the adjacency matrix alone -- the starting point of all graph-based approaches -- cannot capture. Here, we introduce a meta-graph that helps us discover an exact mapping between linear physical networks and independent sets, a central concept in graph theory. The mapping allows us to analytically derive both the onset of physical effects and the emergence of a jamming transition, and show that physicality impacts the network structure even when the total volume of the links is negligible. Finally, we construct the meta-graphs of several real physical networks, which allows us to predict functional features, such as synapse formation in the brain connectome, that agree with empirical data. Overall, our results show that, in order to understand the evolution and behavior of real complex networks, the role of physicality must be fully quantified.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.01583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physical networks are made of nodes and links that are physical objects embedded in a geometric space. Understanding how the mutual volume exclusion between these elements affects the structure and function of physical networks calls for a suitable generalization of network theory. Here, we introduce a network-of-networks framework where we describe the shape of each extended physical node as a network embedded in space and these networks are bound together by physical links. Relying on this representation, we introduce a minimal model of network growth and we show for a general class of physical networks that volume exclusion induces heterogeneity in both node volume and degree, with the two becoming correlated. These emergent properties strongly affect the dynamics on physical networks: by calculating their Laplacian spectrum as a function of the coupling strength between the nodes we show that degree-volume correlations suppress the role of hubs as early spreaders in diffusive dynamics. We apply the network-of-networks framework to describe several real systems and find properties analog to the minimal model networks. The prevalence of these properties points towards general growth mechanisms that do not depend on the specifics of the systems.</description>

      <title>Neural-network quantum state study of the long-range antiferromagnetic Ising chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09709v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate quantum phase transitions in the transverse field Ising chain with algebraically decaying long-range (LR) antiferromagnetic interactions using the variational Monte Carlo method with the restricted Boltzmann machine employed as a trial wave function ansatz. First, we measure the critical exponents and the central charge through the finite-size scaling analysis, verifying the contrasting observations in the previous tensor network studies. The correlation function exponent and the central charge deviate from the short-range (SR) Ising values at a small decay exponent $\alpha_\mathrm{LR}$, while the other critical exponents examined are very close to the SR Ising exponents regardless of $\alpha_\mathrm{LR}$ examined. However, in the further test of the critical Binder ratio, we find that the universal ratio of the SR limit does not hold for $\alpha_\mathrm{LR} &lt; 2$, implying a deviation in the criticality. On the other hand, we find evidence of the conformal invariance breakdown in the conformal field theory (CFT) test of the correlation function. The deviation from the CFT description becomes more pronounced as $\alpha_\mathrm{LR}$ decreases, although a precise breakdown threshold is yet to be determined.</description>

      <title>Hyperuniformity in the Manna Model, Conserved Directed Percolation and Depinning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09123v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hyperuniformity is an emergent property, whereby the structure factor of the density $n$ scales as $S(q) \sim q^\alpha$, with $\alpha&gt;0$. We show that for the conserved directed percolation (CDP) class, to which the Manna model belongs, there is an exact mapping between the density $n$ in CDP, and the interface position $u$ at depinning, $n(x)=n_0+\nabla^2 u(x)$, where $n_0$ is the conserved particle density. As a consequence, the hyperuniformity exponent equals $\alpha={4-d-2\zeta}$, with $\zeta$ the roughness exponent at depinning, and $d$ the dimension. In $d=1$, $\alpha=1/2$, while $0.6&gt; \alpha\ge0$ for other $d$. Our results fit well simulations in the literature, except in $d=1$, where we perform our own to confirm this result. Such an exact relation between two seemingly different fields is surprising, and paves new paths to think about hyperuniformity and depinning. As corollaries, we get results of unprecedented precision in all dimensions, exact in $d=1$. This corrects earlier work on hyperuniformity in CDP.</description>

      <title>Non-Reciprocal Interactions Reshape Topological Defect Annihilation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how non-reciprocal ferromagnetic interactions between neighbouring planar spins in two dimensions, affect the behaviour of topological defects. Non-reciprocity is introduced by weighting the coupling strength of the two-dimensional XY model by an anisotropic kernel. As a consequence, in addition to the topological charge $q$, the actual shape of the defects becomes crucial to faithfully describe their dynamics. Non-reciprocal coupling twists the spin field, selecting specific defect shapes, dramatically altering the pair annihilation process. Defect annihilation can either be enhanced or hindered, depending on the shape of the defects concerned and the degree of non-reciprocity in the system. We introduce a continuous description -- for which the phenomenological coefficients can be explicitly written in terms of the microscopic ones -- that captures the behaviour of the lattice model.</description>

Abstract: For continuous-time Markov chains and open unimolecular chemical reaction networks, we prove that any two stationary currents are linearly related upon perturbations of a single edge's transition rates, arbitrarily far from equilibrium. We extend the result to non-stationary currents in the frequency domain, provide and discuss an explicit expression for the current-current susceptibility in terms of the network topology, and discuss possible generalizations. In practical scenarios, the mutual linearity relation has predictive power and can be used as a tool for inference or model proof-testing.</description>

      <title>Smoothly vanishing density in the contact process by an interplay of disorder and long-distance dispersal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Realistic modeling of ecological population dynamics requires spatially explicit descriptions that can take into account spatial heterogeneity as well as long-distance dispersal. Here, we present Monte Carlo simulations and numerical renormalization group results for the paradigmatic model, the contact process, in the combined presence of these factors in both one and two-dimensional systems. Our results confirm our analytic arguments stating that the density vanishes smoothly at the extinction threshold, in a way characteristic of infinite-order transitions. This extremely smooth vanishing of the global density entails an enhanced exposure of the population to extinction events. At the same time, a reverse order parameter, the local persistence displays a discontinuity characteristic of mixed-order transitions, as it approaches a non-universal critical value algebraically with an exponent $\beta_p'&lt;1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use advances in the formalism of boost agnostic passive fluids to constrain transport in polar active fluids, which are subsequently described by the Toner-Tu equations. Acknowledging that the system fundamentally breaks boost symmetry we compel what were previously entirely phenomenological parameters in the Toner-Tu model to satisfy precise relationships among themselves. Consequently, we propose a thermodynamic argument to determine the exact scalings of the transport coefficients under dynamical renormalisation group flow. These scalings perfectly agree with the results of recent state-of-the-art numerical simulation and experiments</description>

      <title>Dissipation bounds precision of current response to kinetic perturbations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The precision of currents in Markov networks is bounded by dissipation via the so-called thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR). In our work, we demonstrate a similar inequality that bounds the precision of the static current response to perturbations of kinetic barriers. Perturbations of such type, which affect only the system kinetics but not the thermodynamic forces, are highly important in biochemistry and nanoelectronics. We prove that our inequality cannot be derived from the standard TUR. Instead, it implies the standard TUR and provides an even tighter bound for dissipation. We also provide a procedure for obtaining the optimal response precision for a given model.</description>

      <title>Variational quantum eigensolver with embedded entanglement using a tensor-network ansatz</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a tensor network (TN) scheme into the entanglement augmentation process of the synergistic optimization framework by Rudolph et al. [arXiv:2208.13673] to build its process systematically for inhomogeneous systems. Our synergistic approach first embeds the variational optimal solution of the TN state with the entropic area law, which can be perfectly optimized in conventional (classical) computers, in a quantum variational circuit ansatz inspired by the TN state with the entropic volume law. Next, the framework performs a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) process with embedded states as the initial state. We applied the synergistic to the ground-state analysis of the all-to-all coupled random transverse-field Ising, XYZ, Heisenberg model, employing the binary multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) state and branching MERA states as TN states with entropic area law and volume law, respectively. We then show that the synergistic accelerates VQE calculations in the three models without an initial parameter guess of the branching-MERA-inspired ansatz and can avoid a local solution trapped by a standard VQE with the ansatz in the Ising model. The improvement of optimizers for MERA in all-to-all coupled inhomogeneous systems, enhancement, and potential synergistic applications are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical descriptions of dissipative dynamics of strongly interacting Bose gases in optical lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.16170v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop semiclassical methods for describing real-time dynamics of dissipative Bose-Hubbard systems in a strongly interacting regime, which can be realized in experiments with ultracold gases. Specifically, we present two kinds of SU(3) truncated Wigner approximation (TWA) for solving an effective Lindblad master equation of the systems. The first one employs the discrete TWA for finite levels or spin systems and is based on a classical equation of motion in which the onsite dissipation term, as well as the onsite interaction term, is linearized in the phase space variables. The other approach utilizes a stochastic Langevin equation, including decoherence effects in terms of nonlinear drift force and stochastic force terms, in which the initial conditions of trajectories are weighted with a quasiprobability distribution for a typical initial quantum state. We apply these methods to the systems with two-body losses and compare their results with the exact numerical solutions for a small system. We show that the former approach can simulate correctly longer-time dynamics than the latter one. We also calculate the time evolution for a large size setup that is comparable to experiments. We numerically demonstrate that the discrete TWA approach is able to qualitatively capture the continuous quantum Zeno effect on dynamics subjected to a gradual change of the ratio between the hopping amplitude and the onsite interaction across the superfluid-Mott insulator crossover, which has been observed experimentally.</description>

      <title>Elasticity-Controlled Jamming Criticality in Soft Composite Solids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02354v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Soft composite solids are made of inclusions dispersed within soft matrices. They are ubiquitous in nature and form the basis of many biological tissues. In the field of materials science, synthetic soft composites are promising candidates for building various engineering devices due to their highly programmable features. However, when the volume fraction of the inclusions increases, predicting the mechanical properties of these materials poses a significant challenge for the classical theories of composite mechanics. The difficulty arises from the inherently disordered, multi-scale interactions between the inclusions and the matrix. To address this challenge, we systematically investigated the mechanics of densely filled soft elastomers containing stiff microspheres. We experimentally demonstrated how the strain-stiffening response of the soft composites is governed by the critical scalings in the vicinity of a shear-jamming transition of the included particles. The proposed criticality framework quantitatively connects the overall mechanics of a soft composite with the elasticity of the matrix and the particles, and captures the diverse mechanical responses observed across a wide range of material parameters. The findings uncover a novel design paradigm of composite mechanics that relies on engineering the jamming properties of the embedded inclusions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider one-dimensional interacting quantum fluids, such as the Lieb-Liniger gas. By computing the low-temperature limit of its (generalised) hydrodynamics we show how in this limit the gas is well described by a conventional viscous (Navier-Stokes) hydrodynamics for density, fluid velocity and the local temperature, and the other generalised temperatures in the case of integrable gases. The dynamic viscosity is proportional to temperature and can be expressed in a universal form only in terms of the emergent Luttinger Liquid parameter $K$ and its density. We show that the heating factor is finite even in the zero temperature limit, which implies that viscous contribution remains relevant also at zero temperatures. Moreover, we find that in the semi-classical limit of small couplings, kinematic viscosity diverges, reconciling with previous observations of Kardar-Parisi-Zhang fluctuations in mean-field quantum fluids.</description>

      <title>Generally applicable physics-based equation of state for liquids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-based first-principles pressure-volume-temperature equations of state (EOS) exist for solids and gases but not for liquids due to the long-standing fundamental problems involved in liquid theory. Current EOS models that are applicable to liquids and supercritical fluids at liquid-like density under conditions relevant to planetary interiors and industrial processes are complex empirical models with many physically meaningless adjustable parameters. Here, we develop a generally applicable physics-based (GAP) EOS for liquids including supercritical fluids at liquid-like density. The GAP equation is explicit in the internal energy, and hence links the most fundamental macroscopic static property of fluids, the pressure-volume-temperature EOS, to their key microscopic property: the molecular hopping frequency or liquid relaxation time, from which the internal energy can be obtained. We test our GAP equation against available experimental data in several different ways and find good agreement. Our GAP equation, unavoidably and similarly to solid EOS, contains a semi-empirical term giving the energy of the static sample as a function of volume only ($E_{ST}(V)$). Our testing includes studies along isochores, in order to examine the validity of the GAP equation independently of the validity of any function we may choose to utilize for $E_{ST}(V)$. The only other adjustable parameter in the equation is the Gr\"uneisen parameter for the fluid. We observe that the GAP equation is similar to the Mie-Gr\"{u}neisen solid EOS in a wide range of the liquid phase diagram. This similarity is ultimately related to the condensed state of these two phases. On the other hand, the differences between the GAP equation and EOS for gases are fundamental. Finally, we identify the key gaps in the experimental data that need to be filled in to proceed further with the liquid EOS.</description>

Abstract: We address the variational preparation of the Thermofield Double state (TFD) as the ground state of a suitably engineered Hamiltonian acting on the doubled Hilbert space. Through the use of the entanglement forging ansatz, we propose a solution that involves only circuits of width $N$. We illustrate the method with generic fermionic hamiltonians. The free fermion case can be solved in closed form, and yields a warm start state for the variational circuits whenever interactions are present.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the information capacity of open quantum systems, focusing on the effective channels formed by the subsystem of random quantum circuits and quantum Hamiltonian evolution. By analyzing the subsystem information capacity, which is closely linked to quantum coherent information of these effective quantum channels, we uncover a diverse range of dynamical and steady behaviors depending on the types of evolution. Therefore, the subsystem information capacity serves as a valuable tool for studying the intrinsic nature of various dynamical phases, such as integrable, localized, thermalized, and topological systems. We also reveal the impact of different initial information encoding schemes on information dynamics including one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many. To support our findings, we provide representative examples for numerical simulations, including random quantum circuits with or without mid-circuit measurements, random Clifford Floquet circuits, free and interacting Aubry-Andr\'e models, and Su-Schrieffer-Heeger models. Those numerical results are further quantitatively explained using the effective statistical model mapping and the quasiparticle picture in the cases of random circuits and non-interacting Hamiltonian dynamics, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct and study the relativistic Gross-Neveu-Yukawa field theory for the $\text{SO}(2N)$ real symmetric second-rank tensor order parameter coupled to $N_f$ flavors of $4N$-component Majorana fermions in 2+1 dimensions. Such a tensor order parameter unifies all Lorentz-invariant mass-gap orders for $N$ two-component Dirac fermions in two dimensions except for the $\text{SO}(2N)$-singlet anomalous quantum Hall state. The value $N_f=1$ corresponds to the canonical Gross-Neveu model. Within the leading-order $\epsilon$-expansion around the upper critical dimension of $3+1$ the field theory exhibits a critical fixed point in its renormalization group flow which describes spontaneous symmetry breaking to $\text{SO}(N)\times \text{SO}(N)$ for the number of flavors of Majorana fermions higher than a critical value $N_{f,c2}\approx 2N$. For $N_{f, c1}&lt; N_f &lt; N_{f,c2}$ , with $N_{f,c1} \approx 1.080 N$ the critical fixed point resides in the unstable region of the theory where the effective potential is unbounded from below, whereas for $N_f &lt; N_{f,c1}$ there is no real critical fixed point, and the flow runs away. In either case, for $N_f &lt; N_{f,c2}$ the transition should become fluctuation-induced first-order, and we discuss the dependence of its size on the parameters in the theory. One-loop critical exponents for the new universality class at $N_{f, c2}&lt; N_f $ are computed and the flow diagram in various regimes is discussed.</description>
