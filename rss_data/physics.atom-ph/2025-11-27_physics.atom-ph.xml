      <title>High-Resolution Laser Spectroscopy on the Hyperfine Structure of $^{255}$Fm (Z=100)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on high-resolution laser spectroscopy of $^{255}$Fm ($T_{1/2} = 20$h), one of the heaviest nuclides available from reactor breeding. The hyperfine structures in two different atomic ground-state transitions at 398.4~nm and 398.2~nm were probed by in-source laser spectroscopy at the RISIKO mass separator in Mainz, using the PI-LIST high-resolution ion source. Experimental results were combined with hyperfine fields from various atomic ab-initio calculations, in particular using MultiConfigurational Dirac-Hartree-Fock theory, as implemented in GRASP18. In this manner, the nuclear magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moments were derived to be $\mu = -0.75(5)~ \mu_\textrm{N}$ and $Q_\textrm{S} = +5.84(13)$~eb, respectively.
  The magnetic moment indicates occupation of the $\nu$~7/2[613] Nilsson orbital, while the large quadrupole moment confirms strong, stable prolate deformation consistent with systematics in the heavy actinides. Comparisons with available expectation values from nuclear theory show good agreement, providing a stringent benchmark for the used theoretical models.
  These results revise earlier data and establish $^{255}$Fm as a reference isotope for future high-resolution studies.</description>

      <title>Directional loss of contrast by dephasing in temporal double-slit interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attosecond streaking camera is an ex situ technique in which a linearly polarized (LP) XUV attopulse produces an electron wavepacket by photoionization in the presence of an IR femtopulse. By moving the two synchronous oppositely circularly polarized XUV pulses (that make the ionizing LP pulse) apart in time, we propose an attosecond double-slit streak camera scheme to see information loss in polarization-dependent two-slit phenomena. Such streaking interferogram is then composed of several Feynman's thought experiments in time domain, in which electrons are affected by the IR pulse as they exit the two attoslits upon XUV ionization processes to form Archimedean spiral patterns. As a proof-of-principle, when the IR femtofield and first XUV attopulse are synchronous, a loss of contrast through dephasing is seen in the simulated momentum and energy distributions of the photoelectron. It is shown that the contrast between bright and dark interference fringes diminishes predominantly along the IR-field polarization axis and is sensitive to the IR-field waveform. Our which-time information scheme provides further confirmation of the wave-particle duality.</description>

      <title>Quantum theory of electrically levitated nanoparticle-ion systems: Motional dynamics and sympathetic cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop the theory describing the quantum coupled dynamics of the center-of-mass motion of a nanoparticle and an ensemble of ions co-trapped in a dual-frequency linear Paul trap. We first derive analytical expressions for the motional frequencies and classical trajectories of both nanoparticle and ions. We then derive a quantum master equation for the ion-nanoparticle system and quantify the sympathetic cooling of the nanoparticle motion enabled by its Coulomb coupling to a continuously Doppler-cooled ion. We predict that motional cooling down to sub-kelvin temperatures is achievable in state-of-the-art experiments even in the absence of motional feedback and in the presence of micromotion. We then extend our analysis to an ensemble of $N$ ions, predicting a linear increase of the cooling rate as a function of $N$ and motional cooling of the nanoparticle down to tenths of millikelvin in current experimental platforms. Our work establishes the theoretical toolbox needed to explore the ion-assisted preparation of non-Gaussian motional states of levitated nanoparticles.</description>

      <title>Multilevel Electromagnetically Induced Transparency Cooling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT) cooling is a well-established method for preparing trapped ion systems in their motional ground state. However, isolating a three-level system, as required for EIT cooling, is often challenging or impractical. Nonetheless, multilevel systems can inherently host dark states. In this work, we extend the EIT cooling framework to such multilevel systems. We develop a formalism to accurately determine the cooling rate in the weak sideband coupling regime and provide an approximate estimate for cooling rates beyond this regime, without the need for explicit simulation of the motional degree of freedom. We clarify the connection between the cooling rate and the absorption spectrum, offering a pathway for efficient near-ground-state cooling of ions with complex electronic structures.</description>

      <title>Static Laboratory-Frame Polarization of a Trapped Molecular Ion for CP-Violation Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Today's most sensitive experiments for detecting CP-violating permanent electric dipole moments (EDM) rely on molecular spectroscopy. The high sensitivity arises from large internal electric fields that interact with the constituents of the molecule. For molecular ions it has long been assumed that experiments with static polarization from dc electric fields are infeasible, as the ion's charge would either shift it to a field free region or eject it from the trap. This constraint appears to make single ion quantum-logic clocks, among the most precise measurement devices available, incompatible with EDM measurements. Here, we demonstrate that, under typical trapping conditions, heavy molecular ions with small $\Omega/\Lambda$-doubling can be polarized by a static electric field while remaining confined in the Paul trap. This effect arises from a cancellation between the electrostatic force and the trap's ponderomotive force, resulting in an equilibrium position where the ion experiences a dc electric field component. Dynamic decoupling allows to implement co-magnetometry schemes in a single molecule and provides long interrogation times. This will allow the operation of a quantum-logic molecular radio-frequency clock in static electric fields, providing sensitivity to EDMs. Working with only a few ions and non-destructive detection techniques opens the door to the use of highly sensitive, rare, and radioactive molecular species as well as quantum-enhanced metrology schemes to achieve unprecedented levels of accuracy and precision.</description>

      <title>In-situ mid-circuit qubit measurement and reset in a single-species trapped-ion quantum computing system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12544v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We implement in-situ mid-circuit measurement and reset (MCMR) operations on a trapped-ion quantum computing system by using metastable qubit states in $^{171}\textrm{Yb}^+$ ions. We introduce and compare two methods for isolating data qubits from measured qubits: one shelves the data qubit into the metastable state and the other drives the measured qubit to the metastable state without disturbing the other qubits. We experimentally demonstrate both methods on a crystal of two $^{171}\textrm{Yb}^+$ ions using both the $S_{1/2}$ ground state hyperfine clock qubit and the $S_{1/2}$-$D_{3/2}$ optical qubit. These MCMR methods result in errors on the data qubit of about $2\%$ without degrading the measurement fidelity. With straightforward reductions in laser noise, these errors can be suppressed to less than $0.1\%$. The demonstrated method allows MCMR to be performed in a single-species ion chain without shuttling or additional qubit-addressing optics, greatly simplifying the architecture.</description>

      <title>High-fidelity entanglement and coherent multi-qubit mapping in an atom array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutral atoms in optical tweezer arrays possess broad applicability for quantum information science, in computing, simulation, and metrology. Among atomic species, Ytterbium-171 is unique as it hosts multiple qubits, each of which is impactful for these distinct applications. Consequently, this atom is an ideal candidate to bridge multiple disciplines, which, more broadly, has been an increasingly effective strategy within the field of quantum science. Realizing the full potential of this synergy requires high-fidelity generation and transfer of many-particle entanglement between these distinct qubit degrees of freedom, and thus between these distinct applications. Here we demonstrate the creation and coherent mapping of entangled quantum states across multiple qubits in Ytterbium-171 tweezer arrays. We map entangled states onto the optical clock qubit from the nuclear spin qubit or the Rydberg qubit. We coherently transfer up to 20 atoms of a $Z_2$-ordered Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state from the interacting Rydberg manifold to the metastable nuclear spin manifold. The many-body state is generated via a novel disorder-robust pulse in a two-dimensional ladder geometry. We further find that clock-qubit-based spin detection applied to Rydberg and nuclear spin qubits facilitates atom-loss-detectable qubit measurements and $&gt;90\%$ Rydberg decay detection. This enables mid-circuit and delayed erasure detection, yielding an error-detected two-qubit gate fidelity of $99.78(4)\%$ in the metastable qubits. This error detection also enables Rydberg qubit evolution with an effective lifetime of $1.2(2)$ ms, enhancing the fidelity of the observed many-body dynamics. These results establish a versatile architecture that advances multiple fields of quantum information science while also establishing bridges between them.</description>
