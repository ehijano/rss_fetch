      <title>Random boundaries: quantifying segmentation uncertainty in solutions to boundary-value problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.06842v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Engineering simulations using boundary-value partial differential equations often implicitly assume that the uncertainty in the location of the boundary has a negligible impact on the output of the simulation. In this work, we develop a novel method for describing the geometric uncertainty in image-derived models and use a naive method for subsequently quantifying a simulation's sensitivity to that uncertainty. A Gaussian random field is constructed to represent the space of possible geometries, based on image-derived quantities such as pixel size, which can then be used to probe the simulation's output space. The algorithm is demonstrated with examples from biomechanics where patient-specific geometries are often segmented from low-resolution, three-dimensional images. These examples show the method's wide applicability with examples using linear elasticity and fluid dynamics. We show that important biomechanical outputs of these example simulations, namely maximum principal stress and wall shear stress, can be highly sensitive to realistic uncertainties in geometry.</description>

      <title>Curvature-driven transport of thin Bingham fluid layers in airway bifurcations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.11084v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mucus on the bronchial wall forms a thin layer of non-Newtonian fluid. One of the roles of mucus is to protect the lungs by capturing inhaled pollutants. It is transported by mucocilliary clearance toward the tracheo-pharyngeal bifurcation, where it is eliminated. Due to the corrugation of its interface with air, the mucus layer is subject to surface tension forces that interact with its rheology. It is still not clear whether these forces can affect mucus displacement and, if they can, under what conditions and how this displacement can occur. In this work, we model the mucus as a thin Bingham fluid layer located on the wall of idealized, multi-scaled airway bifurcations. We analyze the resulting physical system using lubrication theory and 3D simulations. The theoretical analysis allows us to characterize the nonlinear behavior of the system and determine the geometric conditions under which the Bingham fluid can be moved by surface tension. 3D simulations are then used to quantify the effects in idealized airway bifurcations on a range of scales corresponding to those of bronchial bifurcations. Our results suggest that surface tension effects can displace overly thick mucus layers in airway bifurcations, a typical situation in obstructive lung pathologies (asthma, BPCO, cystic fobrosis, etc.). Moreover, our results indicate that this movement can disrupt mucociliary clearance and the homogeneity of the layer thickness, thus increasing the risk of lung infection.</description>
