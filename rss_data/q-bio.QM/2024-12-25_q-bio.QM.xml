      <title>7 Tesla multimodal MRI dataset of ex-vivo human brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ex-vivo MRI offers invaluable insights into the complexity of the human brain, enabling high-resolution anatomical delineation and integration with histopathology, and thus, contributes to both basic and clinical studies on normal and pathological brains. However, ex-vivo MRI is challenging in sample preparation, acquisition, and data analysis, and existing ex-vivo MRI datasets are often single image modality and lack of ethnic diversity. In our study, we aimed to address these limitations by constructing a comprehensive multimodal MRI database acquired from six ex-vivo Chinese human brains. This database included structural MRI, high-angular resolution diffusion MRI, quantitative susceptibility mapping, and quantitative T1 and T2 maps, which enabled multifaceted depiction of brain microstructure and connectivity. Furthermore, we generated population-averaged multimodal templates and the segmentation labels to facilitate analysis of ex-vivo brain MRI. This public database offers a collection of high-resolution and multi-parametric ex-vivo human brain MRI and filled the gap of lacking Asian brain samples in existing databases.</description>

      <title>Utilizing Causal Network Markers to Identify Tipping Points ahead of Critical Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early-warning signals of delicate design are always used to predict critical transitions in complex systems, which makes it possible to render the systems far away from the catastrophic state by introducing timely interventions. Traditional signals including the dynamical network biomarker (DNB), based on statistical properties such as variance and autocorrelation of nodal dynamics, overlook directional interactions and thus have limitations in capturing underlying mechanisms and simultaneously sustaining robustness against noise perturbations. This paper therefore introduces a framework of causal network markers (CNMs) by incorporating causality indicators, which reflect the directional influence between variables. Actually, to detect and identify the tipping points ahead of critical transition, two markers are designed: CNM-GC for linear causality and CNM-TE for non-linear causality, as well as a functional representation of different causality indicators and a clustering technique to verify the system's dominant group. Through demonstrations using benchmark models and real-world datasets of epileptic seizure, the framework of CNMs shows higher predictive power and accuracy than the traditional DNB indicator. It is believed that, due to the versatility and scalability, the CNMs are suitable for comprehensively evaluating the systems. The most possible direction for application includes the identification of tipping points in clinical disease.</description>

      <title>Cross-Attention Graph Neural Networks for Inferring Gene Regulatory Networks with Skewed Degree Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inferencing Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) from gene expression data is a pivotal challenge in systems biology, and several innovative computational methods have been introduced. However, most of these studies have not considered the skewed degree distribution of genes. Specifically, some genes may regulate multiple target genes while some genes may be regulated by multiple regulator genes. Such a skewed degree distribution issue significantly complicates the application of directed graph embedding methods. To tackle this issue, we propose the Cross-Attention Complex Dual Graph Embedding Model (XATGRN). Our XATGRN employs a cross-attention mechanism to effectively capture intricate gene interactions from gene expression profiles. Additionally, it uses a Dual Complex Graph Embedding approach to manage the skewed degree distribution, thereby ensuring precise prediction of regulatory relationships and their directionality. Our model consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across various datasets, underscoring its efficacy in elucidating complex gene regulatory mechanisms. Our codes used in this paper are publicly available at: https://github.com/kikixiong/XATGRN.</description>

      <title>Generic consistency and nondegeneracy of vertically parametrized systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.02302v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We determine the generic consistency, dimension and nondegeneracy of the zero locus over $\mathbb{C}^*$, $\mathbb{R}^*$ and $\mathbb{R}_{&gt;0}$ of vertically parametrized systems: parametric polynomial systems consisting of linear combinations of monomials scaled by free parameters. These systems generalize sparse systems with fixed monomial support and freely varying parametric coefficients. As our main result, we establish the equivalence among three key properties: the existence of nondegenerate zeros, the zero set having generically the expected dimension, and the system being generically consistent. Importantly, we prove that checking whether a vertically parametrized system has these properties amounts to an easily computed matrix rank condition.</description>

      <title>A statistical framework for detecting therapy-induced resistance from drug screens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18879v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Resistance to therapy remains a significant challenge in cancer treatment, often due to the presence of a stem-like cell population that drives tumor recurrence post-treatment. Moreover, many anticancer therapies induce plasticity, converting initially drug-sensitive cells to a more resistant state, e.g. through epigenetic processes and de-differentiation programs. Understanding the balance between therapeutic anti-tumor effects and induced resistance is critical for identifying treatment strategies. In this study, we introduce a robust statistical framework, based on multi-type branching process models of the evolutionary dynamics of tumor cell populations, to detect and quantify therapy-induced resistance phenomena from high throughput drug screening data. Through comprehensive in silico experiments, we show the efficacy of our framework in estimating parameters governing population dynamics and drug responses in a heterogeneous tumor population where cell state transitions are influenced by the drug. Finally, using recent in vitro data from multiple sources, we demonstrate that our framework is effective for analyzing real-world data and generating meaningful predictions.</description>
