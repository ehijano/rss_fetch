      <title>Exact cospectrality probabilities for uniform random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the conjugation action of orthogonal matrices on symmetric random matrices. Given a fixed orthogonal matrix over an algebraic number field and a random matrix with entries sufficiently uniform in the ring of integers, we wonder what the probability is that the conjugate is again integral. Our main result establishes an exact formula for this probability in terms of the Smith ideals associated to the orthogonal matrix.
  As an illustrative application, we establish exact formulas for the expected number of rational orthogonal matrices that preserve the integrality of a random matrix for every fixed denominator in dimensions two and three. Notably, the dependence on the denominator turns out to be non-monotone due to number-theoretic fluctuations. We also prove bounds on the probability of rational cospectrality with bounded but arbitrarily large denominator.</description>

      <title>The geometry of the adapted Bures--Wasserstein space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The adapted Bures--Wasserstein space consists of Gaussian processes endowed with the adapted Wasserstein distance. It can be viewed as the analogue of the classical Bures--Wasserstein space in optimal transport for the setting of stochastic processes, where the standard Wasserstein distance is inadequate and has to be replaced by its adapted counterpart. We develop a comprehensive geometric theory for the adapted Bures--Wasserstein space, thereby also providing the first results on the fine geometric structure of adapted optimal transport. In particular, we show that the adapted Bures--Wasserstein space is an Alexandrov space with non-negative curvature and provide explicit descriptions of tangent cones and exponential maps. Moreover, we show that Gaussian processes satisfying a natural non-degeneracy condition form a geodesically convex subspace. This subspace is characterized precisely by the property that its tangent cones are linear and hence coincide with the tangent space.</description>

      <title>Long term convergence rate of Smoluchowski-Kramers approximation by Stein's method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the following second-order stochastic differential equation on $\mathbb{R}^{2d}$:
  \begin{equation*}
  dX_t^m=Y_t^mdt, \quad
  mdY_t^m=b(X_t^m)dt+\sigma(X_t^m)dB_t-Y^m_tdt,
  \end{equation*} where $X^m_t$ and $Y^m_t$ represent the position and velocity of a particle at time $t$, $m&gt;0$ denotes its mass, $b:\mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^d$ is the drift field, $\sigma:\mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$ is the diffusion coefficient, and $\{B_t\}_{t \ge 0}$ is a $d$-dimensional standard Brownian motion.
  The Smoluchowski--Kramers approximation states that as $m \rightarrow 0$, this system converges to the limiting equation: \begin{equation*}
  dX_t=b(X_t)dt+\sigma(X_t)dB_t.
  \end{equation*} Utilizing Stein's method, we prove that the $1$-Wasserstein distance between the invariant distribution of $X_t^m$ and that of its small-mass limit $X_t$ is of order $O(\sqrt{m}|\ln m|).$ Particularly, in the one-dimensional case, the convergence rate can be improved to $O(\sqrt{m}).$</description>

      <title>Lecture Notes on Edge Universality for Random Regular Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this note is to explain the structure, general strategy, and main ideas of the proof in the work of Huang, McKenzie, and Yau (2024) on the Ramanujan property and edge universality of random regular graphs. The core of the argument is the derivation of self-consistent equations and a microscopic version of the loop equations for random $d$-regular graphs. We first recall the local law for random $d$-regular graphs, and then illustrate the main ideas behind the derivation of the self-consistent equations and the first loop equation.</description>

      <title>Wealth exchange under ceiling and flooring constraints: a modified Bennati-Dragulescu-Yakovenko model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the classical Bennati-Dragulescu-Yakovenko (BDY) dollar exchange model introduced in \cite{dragulescu_statistical_2000} where the effects of wealth ceiling and wealth flooring are explored. In our model, $N$ identical economical agents involved in the BDY game are also subjected to certain policies issued by a (artificial) government, which prevent agents whose wealth exceeds some prescribed threshold value (denoted by $b \in \mathbb N_+$) from receiving money and which prohibit agents whose wealth falls below certain threshold value (denoted by $a \in \mathbb N$) from giving out their money. We derive a mean-field system of coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) governing the evolution of the distribution of money as the number of agents $N$ tends to infinity and study the large time behavior of the resulting ODE system. The impact of a wealth cap and a wealth floor on economic inequality (measured by the Gini index) will also be explored numerically.</description>

      <title>Superconcentration and chaos in Bernoulli percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the chemical distance of supercritical Bernoulli percolation on $\mathbb{Z}^d$. Recently, Dembin [Dem22] showed that the chemical distance exhibits sublinear variance, a phenomenon now referred to as superconcentration. In this article, we establish an equivalence between this phenomenon and chaotic behavior of geodesics under small perturbations of the configuration, thereby confirming Chatterjee's general principle relating anomalous fluctuations to chaos in the context of Bernoulli percolation. Our methods rely on a dynamical version of the effective radius, refining the notion first proposed in [CN25], in order to measure the co-influence of a given edge whose weight may be infinite. Together with techniques from the theory of lattice animals, this approach allows us to quantify the total co-influence of edges in terms of the overlap between original and perturbed geodesics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We rigorously derive a two-dimensional Keller-Segel type system with signal-dependent sensitivity from a stochastic interacting particle model. By employing suitably defined stopping times, we prove that the convergence of the interacting particle system towards the corresponding mean-field limit equations in probability under an algebraic scaling regime which improves upon existing results with logarithmic scaling. Building on this, we apply the relative-entropy method to obtain strong $L^1$ propagation of chaos, and establish an algebraic convergence rate.</description>

      <title>Large deviations for sums of multivariate stretched-exponential random variables: the few-big-jumps principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large deviations for sums of i.i.d.\ random variables with stretched-exponential tails (also called Weibull or semi-exponential tails) have been well understood since the 60's, going back to Nagaev's seminal work. Many extensions in the $1$-dimensional setting have been developed since then, showing that such deviations are typically governed by a single big jump. In higher dimensions, a corresponding theory has remained largely undeveloped. This work provides such a multivariate extension and establishes large deviation results for sums of i.i.d.\ random vectors in $\mathbb{R}^k$ under fairly general assumptions. Roughly speaking, for some $\alpha\in(0,1)$, the log-probability of one random vector divided by $x$ exceeding a threshold $t$ in all components behaves asymptotically, for large $x$, as $x^\alpha$ times a negative infimum of a function $\mathcal{J}$. We prove large deviation results for sums of i.i.d.\ copies, where the rate function is given by a minimization of at most $k$ summands of $\mathcal{J}$. This establishes a few-big-jumps principle that generalizes the classical $1$-dimensional phenomenon: the deviation is typically realized by \emph{at most} $k$ independent vectors. The results are applied to absolute powers of multivariate Gaussian vectors as well as to various other examples. They also allow us to study random projections of high-dimensional $\ell_p^N$-balls, revealing interesting insights about the appearance of light- and heavy-tailed distributions in high-dimensional geometry.</description>

      <title>On Empirical Spectral Distributions for Random Tensor Product Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In statistics, assuming samples are independent is reasonable. However, this property can fail to hold for the features, a distinction that has led to several lines of work aiming to remove the latter assumption of independence present in the early literature, while preserving the original conclusions. Empirical spectral distributions of covariance matrices are key for understanding the data, and their almost sure convergence is oftentimes desirable. The random tensor product model, $X=(x_{i_1}x_{i_2}...x_{i_d})_{1 \leq i_1&lt;...&lt;i_d \leq n}$ for $x_1,x_2,\hspace{0.05cm}...\hspace{0.05cm},x_n$ i.i.d., introduced by the machine learning community, has a dependence structure for its features far from trivial and has been studied in recent years. When $x_1 \in \mathbb{R}, \mathbb{E}[x_1^4]&lt;\infty, \frac{d}{n^{1/3}}=o(1),$ the empirical spectral distributions of the covariance matrices were proved to converge almost surely to Marchenko-Pastur laws in the random matrix theory regime. This work extends this result to the range $\frac{d}{n^{1/2}}=~o(1)$ when $x_1$ is symmetric with a subgaussian norm slowly growing in $n$ (the aforesaid range arises naturally, and the result failing when $\frac{d}{n^{1/2}} \to \infty$ appears to be a plausible claim) and shows that similarly to the case with independent features, the almost sure convergence holds under more general conditions on the covariance structure than the isotropic case. The latter result provides a means of deriving convergence for empirical spectral distributions of random matrices, applicable to other models as well so long as their entries exhibit a certain degree of concentration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study positive definite kernels pulled back along a finite family of self-maps under a subinvariance inequality for the associated branching operator. Iteration produces an increasing kernel tower with defect kernels. Under diagonal boundedness, the tower has a smallest invariant majorant, with a canonical defect space realization and an explicit diagonal harmonic envelope governing finiteness versus blow-up. We also give probabilistic and boundary representations: a Gaussian martingale model whose quadratic variation is the defect sequence, and canonical Doob path measures with a boundary feature model for the normalized defects.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Convergence and Gaussian Fluctuations for Sequential Interacting Diffusions via Incremental Relative Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a sequential system of interacting diffusions in which particle $i$ interacts only with its predecessors through the empirical measure $\mu_t^{i-1}$, yielding a directed, non-exchangeable mean-field approximation of a McKean--Vlasov diffusion. Under bounded coefficients and a non-degenerate constant diffusion, we prove the sharp decay of incremental path-space relative entropies,
  $$
  R_i(T):=H\left(P^{1:i}_{[0,T]}\vert P^{1:i-1}_{[0,T]}\otimes \bar P_{[0,T]}\right)
  \ \lesssim\ \frac{1}{i-1}, \qquad i\ge2,
  $$
  where $P^{1:i}_{[0,T]}$ is the law of the first $i$ particle paths and $\bar P_{[0,T]}$ the McKean--Vlasov path law.
  Summing the increments yields the global estimate
  $$
  H \left(P^{1:N}_{[0,T]}\, \vert \,\bar P_{[0,T]}^{\otimes N}\right)\ \lesssim\ \log N,
  $$
  together with quantitative decoupling bounds for tail blocks. As a consequence, the empirical measure converges to the McKean--Vlasov equation in negative Sobolev topologies at the canonical $N^{-1/2}$ scale. We also establish a Gaussian fluctuation limit for the fluctuation measure, where the sequential architecture produces an explicit feedback correction in the limiting linear SPDE. Our proofs rely on a Girsanov representation, a martingale-difference replacement of predecessor empirical measures by average conditional measures, and an upper-envelope argument.</description>

      <title>A forward algorithm for a class of Markov zero-sum stopping games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new efficient algorithm to compute the value function for zero-sum stopping games featuring two players with opposing interests. This can be seen as a game version of the ''forward algorithm'' for (one-player) optimal stopping problem, first introduced by Irle [6] for discrete-time Markov processes and later revisited by Miclo \&amp; Villeneuve [8] for continuous-time Markov processes on general state spaces. This paper focuses on a game driven by a homogeneous Markov process taking values in a finite state space and also discusses about the number of iterations needed. Illustrated computational implementations for a few particular examples are also provided.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we extend existing results on the numerical approximation of one-dimensional SDEs with drift in a negative order Besov space and driven by Brownian motion. Using the Yamada-Watanabe approximation technique, we prove rates in $L^p$, for all $p\geq 2$, applying a Gronwall-type lemma previously used in the literature for SDEs with H\"older continuous coefficients. Additionally, we obtain an explicit convergence rate in the $L^1$-$\sup$ norm.</description>

      <title>Refined Berry-Esseen bounds under local dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish Berry--Esseen bounds for both self-normalized and non-self-normalized sums of locally dependent random variables. The proofs are based on Stein's method together with a concentration inequality approach. We develop a new class of concentration inequalities that extend classical results and achieve optimal convergence rates under more general dependence structures. As applications, we apply our main results to derive sharper Berry--Esseen bounds for graph dependency, distributed $U$-statistics, constrained $U$-statistics, and decorated injective homomorphism sums.</description>

      <title>Analysis of multivariate symbol statistics in primitive rational models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behaviour of sequences of multivariate random variables representing the number of occurrences of a given set of symbols in a word of length $n$ generated at random according to a rational stochastic model. Assuming primitive the matrix of the total weights of transitions of the model, we first determine asymptotic expressions for the mean values and the covariances of such statistics. Then we establish two asymptotic results that generalize known univariate cases to different regimes: a large deviation principle with speed $n$, implying almost sure convergence, and a multivariate Gaussian limit. Additionally, we introduce a novel moderate deviation result as a bridge between these regimes. Central to our proofs is a quasi-power property for the moment generating function of the statistics, allowing us to employ the G\"artner-Ellis Theorem for both large and moderate deviations.</description>

      <title>Stochastic bifurcation in economic growth model driven by L\'evy noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper enhances the classical Solow model of economic growth by integrating L\'evy noise, a type of non-Gaussian stochastic perturbation, to capture the inherent uncertainties in economic systems. The extended model examines the impact of these random fluctuations on capital stock and output, revealing the role of jump-diffusion processes in long-term GDP fluctuations. Both continuous and discrete-time frameworks are analyzed to assess the implications for forecasting economic growth and understanding business cycles. The study compares deterministic and stochastic scenarios, providing insight into the stability of equilibrium points and the dynamics of economies subjected to random disturbances. Numerical simulations demonstrate how stochastic noise contributes to economic volatility, leading to abrupt shifts and bifurcations in growth trajectories. This research offers a comprehensive perspective on the influence of external shocks, presenting a more realistic depiction of economic development in uncertain environments.</description>

      <title>Rough Martingale Optimal Transport: Theory, Implementation, and Regulatory Applications for Non-Modelable Risk Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB) poses a significant challenge for exotic derivatives pricing, particularly for non-modelable risk factors (NMRF) where sparse market data leads to infinite audit bounds under classical Martingale Optimal Transport (MOT). We propose a unified Rough Martingale Optimal Transport (RMOT) framework that regularizes the transport plan with a rough volatility prior, yielding finite, explicit, and asymptotically tight extrapolation bounds. We establish an identifiability theorem for rough volatility parameters under sparse data, proving that 50 strikes are sufficient to estimate the Hurst exponent within $\pm 0.05$. For the multi-asset case, we prove that the correlation matrix is locally identifiable from marginal option surfaces provided the Hurst exponents are distinct. Model calibration on SPY and QQQ options (2019--2024) confirms that the optimal martingale measure exhibits stretched exponential tail decay ($\sim\exp(-k^{1-H})$), consistent with rough volatility asymptotics, whereas classical MOT yields trivial bounds. We validate the framework on live SPX/NDX data and scale it to $N = 30$ assets using a block-sparse optimization algorithm. Empirical results show that RMOT provides approximately \$880M in capital relief per \$1B exotic book compared to classical methods, while maintaining conservative coverage confirmed by 100-seed cross-validation. This constitutes a pricing framework designed to align with FRTB principles for NMRFs with explicit error quantification.</description>

      <title>Efficiency-Reward Trade-Off in Queues with Dynamic Arrivals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by applications in online marketplaces such as ride-hailing platforms and payment channel networks, we study a single-server queue with state-dependent arrival control. The service operator dynamically chooses the arrival rate as a function of the current queue length and receives a reward determined by the induced rate, capturing objectives such as throughput, revenue, or social welfare. The goal is to design control policies that simultaneously achieve high long-run operating reward and low congestion, measured by the expected steady-state queue length.
  We adopt a regret-based framework relative to an optimal benchmark and characterize the efficiency--reward trade-off under an $\varepsilon$-optimal reward constraint. Our results reveal a sharp dichotomy between small-market and large-market regimes. In small markets, including state-independent policies, any admissible control incurs poor efficiency, with the expected queue length growing on the order of $1/\varepsilon$. In contrast, in large markets, state-dependent policies can achieve substantially better performance. When the reward function exhibits sufficient curvature, the optimal queue length scales as $\Theta(1/\sqrt{\varepsilon})$; otherwise, it scales as $\Theta(\log(1/\varepsilon))$.
  For each regime, we establish universal lower bounds on the achievable efficiency and construct simple state-dependent policies that attain these bounds. Our results provide a non-asymptotic heavy-traffic characterization for queues with dynamic arrivals and offer structural insights into the design of efficient pricing and admission control policies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.00375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic behaviour of solutions of a class of nonlocal Fokker--Planck equations defined by nonsingular, heavy-tailed convolution kernels and characterised by a scaling parameter $\e\in(0,1]$ and a fractional index $s\in(1/2,1)$. By employing a suitable version of the generalised central limit for heavy-tailed distributions and the use of Harris's theorem, we prove exponential convergence to the equilibrium with a rate that is independent of both $\e$ and $s$. This allows us to show uniform--in--time convergence for both $\e\to 0$ and $s\to1$ recovering the limiting equations.</description>

      <title>A short proof of confinement in three-dimensional lattice gauge theories with a central $\mathrm{U}(1)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pure lattice gauge theories in three dimensions are widely expected to confine. A rigorous proof of confinement for three-dimensional $\mathrm{U}(1)$ lattice gauge theory with Villain action was given by G\"opfert and Mack. Beyond the abelian case, rigorous confinement results are comparatively scarce; one general mechanism applies when the gauge group has a central copy of $\mathrm{U}(1)$. Indeed, combining a comparison inequality of Fr{\"o}hlich with earlier work of Glimm and Jaffe yields confinement with a logarithmically growing quark-antiquark potential for this class of theories. The purpose of this note is to give a short, self-contained proof of this classical result for three-dimensional Wilson lattice gauge theory: when $G\subseteq \mathrm{U}(n)$ contains the full circle of scalar matrices $\{zI:\ |z|=1\}$, rectangular Wilson loops obey an explicit upper bound of the form $\lvert\langle W_\ell\rangle\rvert \le n\exp\{-c(1+n\beta)^{-1}T\log(R+1)\}$.</description>

      <title>Non-standard analysis for coherent risk estimation: hyperfinite representations, discrete Kusuoka formulae, and plug-in asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a non-standard analysis framework for coherent risk measures and their finite-sample analogues, coherent risk estimators, building on recent work of Aichele, Cialenco, Jelito, and Pitera. Coherent risk measures on $L^\infty$ are realised as standard parts of internal support functionals on Loeb probability spaces, and coherent risk estimators arise as finite-grid restrictions.
  Our main results are: (i) a hyperfinite robust representation theorem that yields, as finite shadows, the robust representation results for coherent risk estimators; (ii) a discrete Kusuoka representation for law-invariant coherent risk estimators as suprema of mixtures of discrete expected shortfalls on $\{k/n:k=1,\ldots,n\}$; (iii) uniform almost sure consistency (with an explicit rate) for canonical spectral plug-in estimators over Lipschitz spectral classes; (iv) a Kusuoka-type plug-in consistency theorem under tightness and uniform estimation assumptions; (v) bootstrap validity for spectral plug-in estimators via an NSA reformulation of the functional delta method (under standard smoothness assumptions on $F_X$); and (vi) asymptotic normality obtained through a hyperfinite central limit theorem.
  The hyperfinite viewpoint provides a transparent probability-to-statistics dictionary: applying a risk measure to a law corresponds to evaluating an internal functional on a hyperfinite empirical measure and taking the standard part. We include a standardd self-contained introduction to the required non-standard tools.</description>

Abstract: We study the joint distribution of SYK Hamiltonians for different systems with specified overlaps. We show that, in the large-system limit, their joint distribution converges in distribution to a mixed $q$-Gaussian system. We explain that the graph product of diffusive abelian von Neumann algebras is isomorphic to a $W^*$-probability space generated by the corresponding $\varepsilon$-freely independent random variables with semicircular laws which form a special case of mixed $q$-Gaussian systems that can be approximated by our SYK Hamiltonian models. Thus, we obtain a random model for asymptotic $\varepsilon$-freeness.</description>

      <title>From Riesz to Kakutani: Representation Theorems and the Analytical Foundations of Probablility</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.00964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The analytical foundations of modern probability trace back to a sequence of representation theorems that reshaped functional analysis in the twentieth century. From Fr\'echet identification of linear functionals with vectors in Hilbert spaces to Kakutani characterization of measures on spaces of continuous functions, each theorem reveals how linearity, duality, and measure intertwine. Following this historical and conceptual path, from Fr\'echet Riesz to Riesz Stieltjes, from Lp duality to Riesz Markov Kakutani, we show that expectation, distribution, conditional expectation, and the Wiener measure are analytic manifestations of a single principle of representation. Viewed through this lens, probability theory appears not merely as an extension of measure theory, but as the geometric realization of functional analysis itself: every probabilistic notion embodies an existence-and-uniqueness principle in a space of functions.</description>

      <title>L-Moment-Based LOS and NLOS Channel Characterization via Four-parameter Kappa Distribution for AoA BLE CTE Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) CTE transmissions provide in-phase and quadrature (IQ) samples whose empirical statistics are strongly governed by the propagation regime. in particular, the distributions differ markedly between line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions. In NLOS, multipath-induced distortions typically degrade Angle-of-Arrivial (AoA) estimation accuracy. Existing BLE direction finding datasets rarely provide tightly controlled, IQ-level paired LOS and NLOS measurements with rigorous statistical validation, and commonly used flat-fading models can be inadequate for cluttered indoor environments exhibiting heavy-tailed power distributions. To address these limitations, we conduct a paired-geometry BLE AoA measurement campaign using an off-the-shelf module, collecting 132000 labeled CTE packets under matched anchor-tag conditions. A robust preprocessing stage removes anomalous CTEs using combined univariate and multivariate criteria. Feature-wise hypothesis tests on IQ-derived power features confirm strong LOS and NLOS separability. All mean differences are statistically significant; additionally, 92 percent of feature-wise variance differences are significant. We further compute L-moment ratios (LMRs) and analyze them in the L-moment Ratio Diagram (LMRD), showing that NLOS subsets exhibit markedly heavier tails and stronger asymmetry than LOS. Kappa-family distributions fitted from LMRs provide substantially improved dual scored L--moment goodness-of-fit (GoF), Specifically, for NLOS, which is the smallest discrepancy in the LMRD and a near-zero standardized L-kurtosis deviation. As a practice, we apply a self-supervised clustering to L-moment statistics, achieving a more separable representation, compared to product moments.</description>

      <title>Non-stability of Liouville measures under convex combinations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For every non-hyper-FC-central countable amenable group and every $k\geq 2$, we provide a sequence of symmetric, fully supported probability measures such that their convex combination is non-Liouville (that is it admits a non-constant bounded harmonic function, equivalently, the Poisson boundary is non-trivial) if and only if at least $k$ of them appear in the convex combination. Particularly, our result implies that the set of Liouville measures is not closed under convex combination, which answers a question of Kaimanovich. We also provide a similar result under the additional assumption of finite entropy for those non-hyper-FC-central countable groups with the property that every symmetric, finitely supported probability measure is Liouville. These groups are the only known non-trivial examples of countable groups that admit Liouville measures with finite entropy. Examples include the lamplighter group over $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Z}^2$, and the infinite symmetric group of finite permutations on $\mathbb{Z}$.</description>

      <title>A Fractional M/M/1 Queue Governed by Stretched Non-Local Time Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a non-Markovian generalization of the classical M/M/1 queue by incorporating extended nonlocal time dynamics into Kolmogorov forward equations. We obtain the model by replacing the standard time derivative with an extended Caputo-type operator. It preserves the birth-death transition structure of the standard queue while introducing memory effects into the temporal evolution. We derive explicit representations for transient state probabilities in terms of the Kilbas-Saigo function, which naturally emerges as the relaxation kernel associated with the stretched operator, using Laplace transform techniques. We construct a time-varying interpretation and show that the fractional queue can be viewed as a distribution of a classical M/M/1 process evaluated at a non-decreasing random time. It is observed that the fractional queue can be viewed as a distribution of a classical M/M/1 process evaluated at a non-decreasing random time. We prove that under the standard stability condition $\rho&lt;1$, the steady-state distribution remains geometric and coincides with the distribution of the classical queue, whilst we prove that the stretched fractional parameters significantly affect the convergence rate in the transient regime. Numerical examples based on Monte Carlo simulations highlight the effect of the parameters $(\alpha,\gamma)$ on the distribution of empty states, tail length distributions, and the average tail evolution, and validate the flexibility of the proposed framework in capturing long-memory tail dynamics.</description>

      <title>Dimension-Free Multimodal Sampling via Preconditioned Annealed Langevin Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing algorithms that can explore multimodal target distributions accurately across successive refinements of an underlying high-dimensional problem is a central challenge in sampling. Annealed Langevin dynamics (ALD) is a widely used alternative to classical Langevin since it often yields much faster mixing on multimodal targets, but there is still a gap between this empirical success and existing theory: when, and under which design choices, can ALD be guaranteed to remain stable as dimension increases? In this paper, we help bridge this gap by providing a uniform-in-dimension analysis of continuous-time ALD for multimodal targets that can be well-approximated by Gaussian mixture models. Along an explicit annealing path obtained by progressively removing Gaussian smoothing of the target, we identify sufficient spectral conditions - linking smoothing covariance and the covariances of the Gaussian components of the mixture - under which ALD achieves a prescribed accuracy within a single, dimension-uniform time horizon. We then establish dimension-robustness to imperfect initialization and score approximation: under a misspecified-mixture score model, we derive explicit conditions showing that preconditioning the ALD algorithm with a sufficiently decaying spectrum is necessary to prevent error terms from accumulating across coordinates and destroying dimension-uniform control. Finally, numerical experiments illustrate and validate the theory.</description>

      <title>Local Exponential Stability of Mean-Field Langevin Descent-Ascent in Wasserstein Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the mean-field Langevin descent-ascent (MFL-DA), a coupled optimization dynamics on the space of probability measures for entropically regularized two-player zero-sum games. Although the associated mean-field objective admits a unique mixed Nash equilibrium, the long-time behavior of the original MFL-DA for general nonconvex-nonconcave payoffs has remained largely open. Answering an open question posed by Wang and Chizat (COLT 2024), we provide a partial resolution by proving that this equilibrium is locally exponentially stable: if the initialization is sufficiently close in Wasserstein metric, the dynamics trends to the equilibrium at an exponential rate. The key to our analysis is to establish a coercivity estimate for the entropy near equilibrium via spectral analysis of the linearized operator. We show that this coercivity effectively reveals a local displacement convex-concave structure, thereby driving contraction. This result settles the local stability and quantitative rate questions of Wang and Chizat, leaving global convergence as a remaining open challenge.</description>

      <title>Sharp Thresholds for Temporal Motifs and Doubling Time in Random Temporal Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study two natural models of \textit{random temporal} graphs. In the first, the \textit{continuous} model, each edge $e$ is assigned $l_e$ labels, each drawn uniformly at random from $(0,1]$, where the numbers $l_e$ are independent random variables following the same discrete probability distribution. In the second, the \textit{discrete} model, the $l_e$ labels of each edge $e$ are chosen uniformly at random from a set $\{1,2,\ldots,T\}$. In both models we study the existence of \textit{$\delta$-temporal motifs}. Here a $\delta$-temporal motif consists of a pair $(H,P)$, where $H$ is a fixed static graph and $P$ is a partial order over its edges. A temporal graph $\mathcal{G}=(G,\lambda)$ contains $(H,P)$ as a $\delta$-temporal motif if $\mathcal{G}$ has a simple temporal subgraph on the edges of $H$ whose time labels are ordered according to $P$, and whose life duration is at most $\delta$. We prove \textit{sharp existence thresholds} for all $\delta$-temporal motifs, and we identify a qualitatively different behavior from the analogous static thresholds in Erdos-Renyi random graphs. Applying the same techniques, we then characterize the growth of the largest $\delta$-temporal clique in the continuous variant of our random temporal graphs model. Finally, we consider the \textit{doubling time} of the reachability ball centered on a small set of vertices of the random temporal graph as a natural proxy for temporal expansion. We prove \textit{sharp upper and lower bounds} for the maximum doubling time in the continuous model.</description>

      <title>On the strength of connectedness of unions of random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G_1,\dots, G_m$ be independent identically distributed random subgraphs of the complete graph ${\cal K}_n$. We analyse the threshold behaviour of the strength of connectedness of the union $\cup_{i=1}^mG_i$ defined on the vertex set of ${\cal K}_n$. Let $a=\min\{t\ge 1:\, \PP\{\delta(G_1)=t&gt;0\}\}$ be the minimal non zero vertex degree attained with positive probability. Given $k\ge 0$ let $\lambda(k)=\ln n+k\ln\frac{m}{n}-\frac{m}{n} \E X$, where $X$ stands for the number of non isolated vertices of $G_1$. Letting $n,m\to+\infty$ we show that $\PP\{\cup_{i=1}^mG_i$ is $a(k+1)$-connected$\} \to 1 $ for $\lambda(k)\to -\infty$, and $\PP\{\cup_{i=1}^mG_i$ is $ak+1$-connected$\} \to 0 $ for $\lambda(k)\to +\infty$. In particular, the connectivity strength of the union graph $\cup_{i=1}^mG_i$ increases in steps of size $a$. Our results are obtained in a more general setting where the contributing random subgraphs do not need to be identically distributed.</description>

      <title>Renewal theory for a run-and-tumble particle with stochastic resetting and a sticky boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a run-and-tumble particle (RTP) with stochastic resetting confined to the half line $[0,\infty)$ with a sticky boundary at $x=0$. In the bulk the RTP tumbles at a constant rate $\alpha&gt;0$ between velocity states $\pm v$ with $v&gt;0$ and randomly resets to its initial position and orientation $(x_0,k_0)\in(\mathbb{R}^+,\pm)$. When the RTP reaches the target at $x=0$ it attaches to the boundary for a random waiting time before either detaching and continuing to navigate the bulk domain or (permanently) entering the target. These events are the analogs of adsorption, desorption, and absorption of a particle by a partially reactive surface in physical chemistry. We use renewal theory to characterize the particle trajectory in terms of successive binding events under two distinct desorption protocols: via resetting to $(x_0,k_0)$ and via continuous movement from $x=0$ with velocity $+v$. First we derive the nonequilibrum stationary state (NESS) in the case of no absorption and characterize the accumulation at the boundary. Second, we compute the mean first passage time (MFPT) statistics. In addition to observing the usual unimodal dependence of the MFPT on bulk resetting, both the NESS and MFPT strongly depend on the initial orientation $k_0$ and the desorption protocol. For instance, if the initial orientation is toward the boundary, we find that the desorption-induced resetting protocol can reduce the MFPT more effectively than the non-resetting desorption protocol. We also show how matching the desorption kinetics with the bulk resetting or tumbling rate introduces a trade-off between minimizing the adsorption and absorption times. In this setting we find that the desorption protocol which minimizes the absorption MFPT for a given set of parameters is almost always the opposite of that favored when desorption and bulk kinetics are not the same.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.00319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This note contains old instead of new results about random walks on groups, which may serve as a small supplement to the author's monograph ``Random Walks on Infinite Graphs and Groups'' (Cambridge Univ. Press 2000/2009). First, we exhibit a basic exercise on the periodicity classes of random walk. The second topic concerns some basics on ratio limits for random walks, which had been published ``only'' in German in the 1970ies.</description>

      <title>The Gittins index is optimal for dynamic allocation with conditionally independent filtrations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamic allocation problem, also known as the `multi-armed bandit' problem, simulates a situation in which an agent is faced with a tradeoff between actions that yield an immediate reward and actions whose benefits can only be perceived in the future. In this paper, we show that the non-Markovian, discrete-time problem can be solved by following a Gittins index strategy, without the assumption that the rewards processes are independent. Instead, we require the underlying multi-parameter filtration to satisfy a conditional independence property. We provide three representations of the maximal attainable value under an optimal strategy. Furthermore, we discuss the relationship between index-type strategies and the `synchronization' paradigm from operations research.</description>

      <title>A stochastic model for immune response with mutations and evolution: the non-spatial setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17950v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a stochastic model for a pathogen population in the presence of an immune response, in which pathogen types are partially ordered by ancestry and the immune system must eliminate ancestor types before it can eliminate their descendants. In this model, pathogens reproduce independently at rate $\lambda&gt;0$ and, at each birth, a mutation occurs with probability $r\in(0,1]$, producing a novel type that is antigenically distinct and whose elimination by the immune system is delayed relative to its ancestors. We provide an explicit characterization of the survival--extinction phase transition and compute the expected total progeny in the subcritical regime. We then extend the model by allowing mutations to be deleterious: conditional on mutation, with probability $p\in(0,1]$ the mutation is beneficial and with probability $1-p$ it is deleterious, producing a sterile offspring. For this extension, we obtain an explicit survival criterion in terms of $(\lambda,r,p)$ and identify parameter regimes in which survival is possible only for an intermediate range of mutation probabilities, reflecting the balance between immune escape and mutational load.</description>

      <title>Fringe trees of Patricia tries, compressed binary search trees, and three other random full binary trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01239v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the distribution of fringe trees in Patricia tries (extending earlier results by Ischebeck (2025)) and compressed binary search trees; both cases are random binary trees that have been compressed by deleting nodes of outdegree 1 so that they are random full binary trees. The main results are central limit theorems for the number of fringe trees of a given type, which imply quenched and annealed limit results for the fringe tree distribution; for Patricia tries, this is complicated by periodic oscillations in the usual manner. We also consider extended fringe trees. The results are derived from earlier results for uncompressed tries and binary search trees. In the case of compressed binary search trees, it seems difficult to give a closed formula for the asymptotic fringe tree distribution, but we provide a recursion and give examples.
  For comparison, we give also results, simpler and partly known, for three other models of random full binary trees: the extended binary search tree, the critical beta-spltting random tree, and the uniform random full binary tree.</description>

Abstract: Building on the notes [Hai17], we give a sufficient condition for the marginal distribution of the solution of singular SPDEs on the $d$-dimensional torus to be singular with respect to the law of the Gaussian measure induced by the linearised equation. As applications we obtain the singularity of the $\Phi^4_3$-measure with respect to the Gaussian free field measure and the border of parameters for the fractional $\Phi^4$-measure to be singular with respect to the Gaussian free field measure. Our approach is applicable to quite a large class of singular SPDEs.</description>

      <title>Randomized Geodesic Flow on Hyperbolic Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14350v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by Gromov's geodesic flow problem on hyperbolic groups $G$, we develop in this paper an analog using random walks. This leads to a notion of a harmonic analog $\Theta$ of the Bowen-Margulis-Sullivan measure on $\partial^2 G$. We provide three different but related constructions of $\Theta$: 1) by moving the base-point along a quasigeodesic ray 2) by moving the base-point along random walk trajectories 3) directly as a push-forward under the boundary map to $\partial^2 G$ of a measure inherited from studying all bi-infinite random walk trajectories (with no restriction on base-point) on $G^\mathbb{Z}$. Of these, the third construction is the most involved and needs new techniques. It relies on developing a framework where we can treat bi-infinite random walk trajectories as analogs of bi-infinite geodesics on complete simply connected negatively curved manifolds. Geodesic flow on a hyperbolic group is typically not well-defined due to non-uniqueness of geodesics. We circumvent this problem in the random walk setup by considering \emph{all} trajectories. We thus get a well-defined discrete flow that we call the \emph{randomized geodesic flow}, given by the $\mathbb{Z}-$shift on bi-infinite random walk trajectories. The $\mathbb{Z}-$shift is the random analog of the time one map of the geodesic flow. As an analog of ergodicity of the geodesic flow on a closed negatively curved manifold, we establish ergodicity of the $G$-action on $(\partial^2G, \Theta)$. As a consequence of our construction, we prove that the randomized geodesic flow is exponentially mixing of all orders and establish a functional CLT.</description>

      <title>A refinement of the Sylvester problem: Probabilities of combinatorial types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X_1,\ldots, X_{d+2}$ be random points in $\mathbb R^d$. The classical Sylvester problem asks to determine the probability that the convex hull of these points, denoted by $P:= [X_1,\ldots, X_{d+2}]$, is a simplex. In the present paper, we study a refined version of this problem which asks to determine the probability that $P$ has a given combinatorial type. It is known that there are $\lfloor d/2\rfloor+1$ possible combinatorial types of simplicial $d$-dimensional polytopes with at most $d+2$ vertices. These types are denoted by $T_0^d, T_1^d, \ldots, T_{\lfloor d/2 \rfloor}^d$, where $T_0^d$ is a simplex with $d+1$ vertices, while the remaining types have exactly $d+2$ vertices. Our aim is thus to compute the probability $$ p_{d,m} := \mathbb P[P \text{ is of type } T_{m}^d], \qquad m\in \{0,1,\ldots, \lfloor d/2 \rfloor\}. $$ The classical Sylvester problem corresponds to the case $m=0$. We shall compute $p_{d,m}$ for all $m$ in the following cases: (a) $X_1,\ldots, X_{d+2}$ are i.i.d. normal; (b) $X_1,\ldots, X_{d+2}$ follow a $d$-dimensional beta or beta prime distribution, which includes the uniform distribution on the ball or on the sphere as special cases; (c) $X_1,\ldots, X_{d+2}$ form a random walk with exchangeable increments. As a by-product of case (a) we recover a recent solution to Youden's demon problem which asks to determine the probability that, in a one-dimensional i.i.d. normal sample $\xi_1,\ldots, \xi_n$, the empirical mean $\frac 1n (\xi_1 + \ldots + \xi_n)$ lies between the $k$-th and the $(k+1)$-st order statistics. We also consider the conic (or spherical) version of the refined Sylvester problem and solve it in several special cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish explicit quantitative Berry-Esseen bounds in the hyper-rectangle distance $d_R$, the convex distance $d_{\mathscr{C}}$ and the $1$-Wasserstein distance $d_W$ for high-dimensional, non-linear functionals of Gaussian processes, allowing for strong dependence between variables. Our main result demonstrates that, under a smoothness assumption, the convergence rate under $d_R$ is sub-polynomial in the dimension and polynomial under $d_{\mathscr{C}}$ and $d_W$. To the best of our knowledge, our results under $d_R$ provide the first explicit sub-polynomial bound for high-dimensional, non-linear functionals of Gaussian processes beyond the i.i.d. setting. Building on this, we derive explicit Berry-Esseen bounds under both $d_R$ and $d_{\mathscr{C}}$ for multiple statistical examples, such as the method of moments, empirical characteristic functions, empirical moment-generating functions, and functional limit theorems in high-dimensional settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23142v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of multiple extremal integrals as an extension of single extremal integrals, which have played important roles in extreme value theory. The multiple extremal integrals are formulated in terms of a product-form random sup measure derived from the $\alpha$-Fr\'{e}chet random sup measure. We establish a LePage-type representation similar to that used for multiple sum-stable integrals, which have been extensively studied in the literature. This approach allows us to investigate the integrability, tail behavior, and independence properties of multiple extremal integrals. Additionally, we discuss an extension of a recently proposed stationary model that exhibits an unusual extremal clustering phenomenon, now constructed using multiple extremal integrals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the exact quenched asymptotic growth of the solution to the parabolic Anderson model (PAM) in the hyperbolic space with a regular, stationary, time-independent Gaussian potential. More precisely, we show that with probability one, the solution $u$ to PAM with constant initial data has pointwise growth asymptotics \[ u(t,x)\sim e^{L^{*}t^{5/3}+o(t^{5/3})} \] as $t \rightarrow +\infty$. Both the power $t^{5/3}$ on the exponential and the exact value of $L^*$ are different from their counterparts in the Euclidean situation. They are determined through an explicit optimisation procedure. Our proof relies on certain fine localisation techniques, which also reveals a stronger non-Euclidean localisation mechanism.</description>

      <title>Weak Existence and Uniqueness for Super-Brownian Motion with Irregular Drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish weak existence and uniqueness for random field solutions of the one-dimensional SPDE \[ d_tX_t = \frac{1}{2}\Delta X_t +h(X_t)+ \sqrt{X_t}\dot{W}, \quad t\geq 0,\] where $\dot{W}$ is space-time white noise and $h$ is a bounded drift with $h(0)\geq 0$. The proof relies on an extension of the duality relation of the super-Brownian motion, which allows us to treat a broad class of admissible drifts, including functions that are non-Lipschitz or discontinuous at zero. In particular, well-posedness is derived for certain drifts that are H\"older continuous at zero with exponent $\alpha\in(0,1)$. We also allow discontinuous drifts of the form $h(x) = b_0\unicode{x1D7D9}_{x = 0} + b_1\unicode{x1D7D9}_{x&gt;0},$ where $b_0 \geq 0$, $b_1 \in \mathbb{R}$. Additionally, if $h(0)=0$ and the initial condition is continuous and compactly supported, we show that the Lebesgue measure of the non-zero set of $X$ is finite. The proofs are based on duality. We use a log-Laplace equation, which is perturbed by jump noise as the equation for the dual process, and the jumps of the dual process are allowed to take infinite values. We believe that the results for the dual process are also of independent interest. Under suitable assumptions on $h$ we also prove survival of $X$ with positive probability, using rescaling and comparison to the KPP-equation with branching noise.</description>

      <title>A Caveat on Metrizing Convergence in Distribution on Hilbert Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13427v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider Sobolev-type distances on probability measures over separable Hilbert spaces involving the Schatten-$p$ norms, which include as special cases a distance first introduced by Bourguin and Campese (2020) when $p=2$, and a distance introduced by Gin\'e and Leon (1980) when $p=\infty$. Our analysis shows that, unless $p=\infty$, these distances fail to metrize convergence in distribution in infinite dimensions. This clarifies several inconsistencies and misconceptions in the recent literature that arose from confusion between different types of distances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by critical planar percolation, we investigate a ``backbone'' event of planar Brownian motion, i.e.~the existence of two disjoint subpaths on the Brownian trajectory connecting the $\varepsilon$-neighborhood of the starting point to a macroscopic distance. We show that the probability of this event is $C(\log|\log\varepsilon|)^{-1}(1+o(1))$ as $\varepsilon\to0$ for some constant $C\in(0,\infty)$.</description>

      <title>Ergodic Theorems for Random Walks in Random Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04161v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Ergodic Properties of Random Walks in stationary ergodic environments without uniform ellipticity under a minimal assumption. There are two main components in our work. The first step is to adopt the arguments of Lawler to first prove a uniqueness principle. We use a more general definition of environments using~\textit{Environment Functions}. As a corollary, we can deduce an invariance principle under these assumptions for balanced environments under some assumptions. We also use the uniqueness principle to show that any balanced, elliptic random walk must have the same transience behaviour as the simple symmetric random walk. The second is to transfer the results we deduce in balanced environments to general ergodic environments(under some assumptions) using a control technique to derive a measure under which the \textit{local process} is stationary and ergodic. As a consequence of our results, we deduce the Law of Large Numbers for the Random Walk and an Invariance Principle under our assumptions.</description>

      <title>Forming invariant stochastic differential systems with a given first integral</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article proposes a method for forming invariant stochastic differential systems, namely dynamic systems with trajectories belonging to a given smooth manifold. The It\^o or Stratonovich stochastic differential equations with the Wiener component describe dynamic systems, and the manifold is implicitly defined by a differentiable function. A convenient implementation of the algorithm for forming invariant stochastic differential systems within symbolic computation environments characterizes the proposed method. It is based on determining a basis associated with a tangent hyperplane to the manifold. The article discusses the problem of basis degeneration and examines variants that allow for the simple construction of a basis that does not degenerate. Examples of invariant stochastic differential systems are given, and numerical simulations are performed for them.</description>

      <title>Large Deviations for the d'Arcais Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The d'Arcais polynomials $P_n(z)$ for $n\in\{0,1,\dots\}$ are defined as $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} P_n(z) q^n = \exp(-z\ln((q;q)_{\infty}))$ where the $q$-Pochhammer symbol is $(q;q)_{\infty} = \prod_{k=1}^{\infty} (1-q^k)$ for $|q|&lt;1$. Denoting the coefficients for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ by the formula $P_n(z) = \sum_{k=1}^{n} A(2,n,k) z^k/n!$, we prove that $k_n! A(2,n,k_n)/n!$ satisfies a Bahadur-Rao type large deviation formula in the limit $n \to \infty$ with $k_n/n \to \kappa \in [0,1)$ as long as $k_n \to \infty$. The large deviation rate function is the Legendre-Fenchel transform $g^*(-\kappa)$ where $g(\kappa) = f^{-1}(\kappa)$ for the function $f : (0,\infty) \to \mathbb{R}$ given by $f(y)= \ln(-\ln((e^{-y};e^{-y})_{\infty}))$. We relate this fact to information about the abundancy index.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Genetic algorithms are high-level heuristic optimization methods which enjoy great popularity thanks to their intuitive description, flexibility, and, of course, effectiveness. The optimization procedure is based on the evolution of possible solutions following three mechanisms: selection, mutation, and crossover. In this paper, we look at the algorithm as an interacting particle system and show that it is described by a Boltzmann-type equation in the many particles limit. Specifically, we prove a propagation of chaos result with a novel technique that leverages the optimal transport formulation of the bounded Lipschitz norm and naturally incorporates the crossover mechanism into the analysis. The convergence admits a rate with respect to the number of particles, corresponding to the optimal rate in the Wasserstein-1 distance.</description>

      <title>An Information-Theoretic Analysis of Continuous-Time Control and Filtering Limitations by the I-MMSE Relationships</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.00995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.00995v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While information theory has been introduced to characterize the fundamental limitations of control and filtering for a few decades, the existing information-theoretic methods are indirect and cumbersome for analyzing the limitations of continuous-time systems. To answer this challenge, we lift the information-theoretic analysis to continuous function spaces by the I-MMSE relationships. Continuous-time control and filtering systems are modeled into the additive Gaussian channels with and without feedback, and the total information rate is identified as a control and filtering trade-off metric and calculated from the estimation error of channel inputs. Fundamental constraints for this trade-off metric are first derived in a general setup and then used to capture the limitations of various control and filtering systems subject to linear and nonlinear plant models. For linear scenarios, we show that the total information rate quantifies the performance limits, such as the minimum entropy cost and the lowest achievable mean-square estimation error, in the time domain. For nonlinear systems, we provide a direct method to calculate and interpret the total information rate and its lower bound by the Stratonovich-Kushner equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.01035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a deep learning-based numerical algorithm to solve path-dependent partial differential equations arising in the context of rough volatility. Our approach is based on interpreting the PDE as a solution to an BSDE, building upon recent insights by Bayer, Qiu and Yao, and on constructing a neural network of reservoir type as originally developed by Gonon, Grigoryeva, Ortega. The reservoir approach allows us to formulate the optimisation problem as a simple least-square regression for which we prove theoretical convergence properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.03038v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The envelope of an elliptical Gaussian complex vector, or equivalently, the amplitude or norm of a bivariate normal random vector has application in many weather and signal processing contexts. We explicitly characterize its distribution in the general case through its probability density, cumulative distribution and moment generating function. Moments and limiting distributions are also derived. These derivations are exploited to also characterize the special cases where the bivariate Gaussian mean vector and covariance matrix have a simpler structure, providing new additional insights in many cases. Simulations illustrate the benefits of using our formulae over Monte Carlo methods. We also use our derivations to get a better initial characterization of the distribution of the observed values in structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging datasets, and of wind speed.</description>

      <title>Unbiased Approximations for Stationary Distributions of McKean-Vlasov SDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the development of unbiased estimators, to approximate the stationary distribution of Mckean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations (MVSDEs). These are an important class of processes, which frequently appear in applications such as mathematical finance, biology and opinion dynamics. Typically the stationary distribution is unknown and indeed one cannot simulate such processes exactly. As a result one commonly requires a time-discretization scheme which results in a discretization bias and a bias from not being able to simulate the associated stationary distribution. To overcome this bias, we present a new unbiased estimator taking motivation from the literature on unbiased Monte Carlo. We prove the unbiasedness of our estimator, under assumptions. In order to prove this we require developing ergodicity results of various discrete time processes, through an appropriate discretization scheme, towards the invariant measure. Numerous numerical experiments are provided, on a range of MVSDEs, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our unbiased estimator. Such examples include the Currie-Weiss model, a 3D neuroscience model and a parameter estimation problem.</description>

      <title>Data denoising with self consistency, variance maximization, and the Kantorovich dominance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new framework for data denoising, partially inspired by martingale optimal transport. For a given noisy distribution (the data), our approach involves finding the closest distribution to it among all distributions which 1) have a particular prescribed structure (expressed by requiring they lie in a particular domain), and 2) are self-consistent with the data. We show that this amounts to maximizing the variance among measures in the domain which are dominated in convex order by the data. For particular choices of the domain, this problem and a relaxed version of it, in which the self-consistency condition is removed, are intimately related to various classical approaches to denoising. We prove that our general problem has certain desirable features: solutions exist under mild assumptions, have certain robustness properties, and, for very simple domains, coincide with solutions to the relaxed problem.
  We also introduce a novel relationship between distributions, termed Kantorovich dominance, which retains certain aspects of the convex order while being a weaker, more robust, and easier-to-verify condition. Building on this, we propose and analyze a new denoising problem by substituting the convex order in the previously described framework with Kantorovich dominance. We demonstrate that this revised problem shares some characteristics with the full convex order problem but offers enhanced stability, greater computational efficiency, and, in specific domains, more meaningful solutions. Finally, we present simple numerical examples illustrating solutions for both the full convex order problem and the Kantorovich dominance problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23189v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the competition between random multiplicative growth and redistribution/migration in the mean-field limit, when the number of sites is very large but finite. We find that for static random growth rates, migration should be strong enough to prevent localisation, i.e. extreme concentration on the fastest growing site. In the presence of an additional temporal noise in the growth rates, a third partially localised phase is predicted theoretically, using results from Derrida's Random Energy Model. Such temporal fluctuations mitigate concentration effects, but do not make them disappear. We discuss our results in the context of population growth and wealth inequalities.</description>

      <title>Optimal Hardness of Online Algorithms for Large Independent Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the algorithmic problem of finding a large independent set in the Erd{\"o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graph $G(n,p)$. For constant $p$ and $b=1/(1-p)$, the largest independent set has size $2\log_b n$, while a simple greedy algorithm - revealing vertices sequentially and making decisions based only on previously seen vertices - finds an independent set of size $\log_b n$. In his seminal 1976 paper, Karp challenged to either improve this guarantee or establish its hardness. Decades later, this problem remains open - one of the most prominent algorithmic problems in the theory of random graphs.
  In this paper, we establish that a broad class of online algorithms fails to find an independent set of size $(1+\epsilon)\log_b n$ whp. This class includes Karp's algorithm as a special case, and extends it by allowing the algorithm to query exceptional edges, not yet "seen" by the algorithm. Our lower bound holds for $p\in [d/n,1-n^{-1/d}]$. In the dense regime (constant $p$), we also prove that our result is asymptotically tight with respect to the number of exceptional edges queried, by designing an online algorithm which beats the half-optimality threshold when the number of exceptional edges slightly exceeds our bound.
  Our result provides evidence for the algorithmic hardness of Karp's problem, by supporting the conjectured optimality of the greedy algorithm and establishing it within the class of online algorithms. Our proof relies on a refined analysis of the geometric structure of large independent sets, establishing a variant of the Overlap Gap Property (OGP). While OGP has predominantly served as a barrier to stable algorithms, online algorithms are inherently unstable, necessitating new ideas. Our proof refines the OGP framework by incorporating several new ideas (including temporal interpolation paths and stopping-times) that we expect to be useful for other online models.</description>

      <title>Duality and Policy Evaluation in Distributionally Robust Bayesian Diffusion Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19294v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study diffusion control problems under parameter uncertainty. Controllers based on plug-in estimation can be brittle due to potential distribution shifts. Bayesian control with a prior on the parameters offers a formulation with beliefs about such shifts. However, as with any Bayesian model, the prior may be misspecified. To mitigate misspecification and reduce over-pessimism compared to classical robust control approaches (e.g. \citet{hansen2008robustness}), we propose a distributionally robust Bayesian control (DRBC) formulation in which an adversary perturbs the prior within a divergence neighborhood of a baseline prior. We develop a strong duality result that reduces the distributionally robust prior evaluation to a low-dimensional optimization and yields a practical simulation-based policy evaluation and learning procedure with structured policy parameterizations. We validate the efficiency of the algorithm on a synthetic linear-quadratic control example and real-data portfolio selection.</description>

      <title>Flatness-Aware Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02174</link>

Abstract: Flatness of the loss landscape has been widely studied as an important perspective for understanding the behavior and generalization of deep learning algorithms. Motivated by this view, we propose Flatness-Aware Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (fSGLD), a first-order optimization method that biases learning its dynamics toward flat basins while retaining the computational and memory efficiency of SGD and SGLD. We provide a non-asymptotic theoretical analysis showing that fSGLD converges to a flatness-biased Gibbs distribution under a theoretically prescribed coupling between the noise scale $\sigma$ and the inverse temperature $\beta$, together with explicit excess risk guarantees. We empirically evaluate fSGLD across standard optimizer benchmarks, Bayesian image classification, uncertainty quantification, and out-of-distribution detection, demonstrating consistently strong performance and reliable uncertainty estimates. Additional experiments confirm the effectiveness of the theoretically prescribed $\beta$-$\sigma$ coupling compared to decoupled choices.</description>

      <title>Donsker-Varadhan large deviation principle for locally damped and randomly forced NLS equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study large deviations from the invariant measure for nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with colored noises on determining modes. The proof is based on a new abstract criterion, inspired by [V. Jak\v{s}i\'{c} et al., Comm. Pure Appl. Math., 68 (2015), 2108-2143]. To address the difficulty caused by fixed squeezing rate, we introduce a bootstrap argument to derive Lipschitz estimates for Feynman-Kac semigroups. This criterion is also applicable to wave equations and Navier-Stokes system.</description>

      <title>Milstein-type Schemes for Hyperbolic SPDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19647v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article studies the temporal approximation of hyperbolic semilinear stochastic evolution equations with multiplicative Gaussian noise by Milstein-type schemes. We take the term hyperbolic to mean that the leading operator generates a contractive, not necessarily analytic $C_0$-semigroup. Optimal convergence rates are derived for the pathwise uniform strong error \[
  E_h^\infty := \Big(\mathbb{E}\Big[\max_{1\le j \le M}\|U_{t_j}-u_j\|_X^p\Big]\Big)^{1/p} \] on a Hilbert space $X$ for $p\in [2,\infty)$. Here, $U$ is the mild solution and $u_j$ its Milstein approximation at time $t_j=jh$ with step size $h&gt;0$ and final time $T=Mh&gt;0$. For sufficiently regular nonlinearity and noise, we establish strong convergence of order one, with the error satisfying $E_h^\infty\lesssim h\sqrt{\log(T/h)}$ for rational Milstein schemes and $E_h^\infty \lesssim h$ for exponential Milstein schemes. This extends previous results from parabolic to hyperbolic SPDEs and from exponential to rational Milstein schemes. Moreover, root-mean-square error estimates are strengthened to pathwise uniform estimates. Numerical experiments validate the convergence rates for the stochastic Schr\"odinger equation. Further applications to Maxwell's and transport equations are included.</description>

      <title>Generalised Entanglement Entropies from Unit-Invariant Singular Value Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce generalisations of von Neumann entanglement entropy that are invariant with respect to certain scale transformations. These constructions are based on the Unit-Invariant Singular Value Decomposition (UISVD) in its left-, right-, and bi-invariant incarnations, which are variations of the standard Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) that remain invariant under the corresponding class of diagonal transformations. These measures are naturally defined for non-Hermitian or rectangular operators and remain useful when the input and output spaces possess different dimensions or metric weights. We apply the UISVD entropy and discuss its advantages in the physically interesting framework of Biorthogonal Quantum Mechanics, whose important aspect is indeed the behaviour under scale transformations. Further, we illustrate features of UISVD-based entropies in other well-known setups, from simple quantum mechanical bipartite states to random matrices relevant to quantum chaos and holography, and in the context of Chern-Simons theory. In all cases, the UISVD yields stable, physically meaningful entropic spectra that are invariant under rescalings and normalisations.</description>

      <title>A unified theory of order flow, market impact, and volatility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a microstructural model for the order flow in financial markets that distinguishes between {\it core orders} and {\it reaction flow}, both modeled as Hawkes processes. This model has a natural scaling limit that reconciles a number of salient empirical properties: persistent signed order flow, rough trading volume and volatility, and power-law market impact. In our framework, all these quantities are pinned down by a single statistic $H_0$, which measures the persistence of the core flow. Specifically, the signed flow converges to the sum of a fractional process with Hurst index $H_0$ and a martingale, while the limiting traded volume is a rough process with Hurst index $H_0-1/2$. No-arbitrage constraints imply that volatility is rough, with Hurst parameter $2H_0-3/2$, and that the price impact of trades follows a power law with exponent $2-2H_0$. The analysis of signed order flow data yields an estimate $H_0 \approx 3/4$. This is not only consistent with the square-root law of market impact, but also turns out to match estimates for the roughness of traded volumes and volatilities remarkably well.</description>
