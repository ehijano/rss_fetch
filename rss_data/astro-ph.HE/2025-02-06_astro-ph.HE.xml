      <title>Quantifying Advantages of a Moving Mesh in Nuclear Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many astrophysical explosions, such as type Ia supernovae, classical novae, and X-ray bursts, are dominated by thermonuclear runaway. To model these processes accurately, one must evolve nuclear reactions concurrently with hydrodynamics. We present an application of the moving mesh technique to this field of computation with the aim of explicitly testing the advantages of the method against the fixed mesh case. By way of traditional Strang splitting, our work couples a 13 isotope nuclear reaction network to a 1D moving mesh, Cartesian geometry hydrodynamics code. We explore three reacting problems: an acoustic pulse, a burning shock, and an advecting deflagration. Additionally using the shock jump conditions, we semi-analytically solve the burning shock problem under the assumption of quick, complete burning with the hope of establishing a useful and easy to set-up test problem. Strong moving mesh advantages are found in advecting, deflagrating flame fronts, where the technique dramatically reduces numerical diffusion that would otherwise lead to very fast artificial deflagration.</description>

      <title>Propagation-induced Frequency-dependent Polarization Properties of Fast Radio Burst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequency-dependent polarization properties provide crucial insights into the radiation mechanisms and magnetic environments of fast radio bursts (FRBs). We explore an analytical solution of radiative transfer of the polarization properties of FRBs as a strong incoming wave propagates in a homogeneous magnetized plasma. The case of a thermal plasma is studied in more detail. The rotational axis of the polarization spectrum undergoes precession with frequency on the Poincar\'e sphere when the medium has both strong Faraday rotation and conversion. Such precession on the Poincar\'e sphere could occur in hot or cold plasma with a strong magnetic field component perpendicular to the line of sight. The analytical solution with the mixing Faraday case offers a more physical description of the physical properties of the magnetic environment of FRBs than the empirical ``generalized Faraday rotation'' method commonly adopted in the literature. Significant absorption can exist in a dense plasma medium, which may give rise to a highly circularly polarized outgoing wave. The frequency-dependent Stokes parameters may be associated with reversing rotation measures or the presence of a persistent radio source around an FRB.</description>

      <title>Probing intermediate-mass black hole binaries with the Lunar Gravitational-wave Antenna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New concepts for observing the gravitational waves (GWs) using a detector on the Moon, such as the Lunar Gravitational-wave Antenna (LGWA), have gained increasing attention. By utilizing the Moon as a giant antenna, the LGWA is expected to detect GWs in the frequency range from 1 millihertz (mHz) to several hertz, with optimal sensitivity in the decihertz band. Despite the debated formation and evolution channel of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) with masses in the range of $[10^2, 10^5]\ {\rm M_\odot}$, binary systems containing at least one IMBH are widely believed to generate GWs spanning from mHz to a few Hz, making them a key scientific target for the LGWA. We explore the detectability of IMBH binaries with the LGWA in this work. The LGWA is more sensitive to nearby binaries (i.e. with redshift $z\lesssim0.5$) with the primary mass $m_1 \in [10^4, 10^5] \ {\rm M_\odot}$, while it prefers distant binaries (i.e. $z \gtrsim 5$) with $m_1 \in [10^3, 10^4] \ {\rm M_\odot}$. Considering a signal-to-noise ratio threshold of 10, our results imply that the LGWA can detect IMBH binaries up to $z \sim \mathcal{O}(10)$. We further show that the LGWA can constrain the primary mass with relative errors $\lesssim 0.1\%$ for binaries at $z \lesssim 0.5$. Furthermore, we show that the IMBH binaries at $z \lesssim 0.1$ can be used to constrain redshift with relative errors $\lesssim 10\%$, and those with $m_1 \in [10^4, 10^5] \ {\rm M_\odot}$ can be localized by the LGWA to be within $\mathcal{O} (10)$ $\rm deg^2$.</description>

      <title>Multiband Nonthermal Radiative Properties of the Pulsar Wind Nebula CTB 87</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pulsar wind nebula CTB 87 (G74.9+1.2) is one of the sources emitting $\gamma$-rays with energies higher than 10 TeV, as measured by the Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System telescope (VERITAS). In this study, we undertake a reanalysis of the GeV emission from the CTB 87 region, utilising $\sim$16 years of high-energy $\gamma$-ray data collected with the Fermi Large Area Telescope. In the energy range of 0.03--1 TeV, the spectrum can be adequately described by a power-law model with an index of 1.34 $\pm$ 0.18, and the integral energy flux is calculated to be (7.25 $\pm$ 1.36) $\times$ 10$^{-13}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. Based on the multiband data, we have employed a time-dependent model to investigate the non-thermal emission properties of CTB 87. In the model, it is assumed that particles with broken power-law energy distributions are continuously injected into the nebula. This results in multiband non-thermal emission being produced by relativistic leptons via synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton processes. Furthermore, the model suggests an energy of approximately 2.4 PeV for the most energetic particle in the nebula.</description>

      <title>Energy Diffusion and Advection Coefficients in Kinetic Simulations of Relativistic Plasma Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulent, relativistic nonthermal plasmas are ubiquitous in high-energy astrophysical systems, as inferred from broadband nonthermal emission spectra. The underlying turbulent nonthermal particle acceleration (NTPA) processes have traditionally been modelled with a Fokker-Planck (FP) diffusion-advection equation for the particle energy distribution. We test FP-type NTPA theories by performing and analysing particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of turbulence in collisionless relativistic pair plasma. By tracking large numbers of particles in simulations with different initial magnetisation and system size, we first test and confirm the applicability of the FP framework. We then measure the FP energy diffusion ($D$) and advection ($A$) coefficients as functions of particle energy $\gamma m c^2$, and compare their dependence to theoretical predictions. At high energies, we robustly find $D \sim \gamma^2$ for all cases. Hence, we fit $D = D_0 \gamma^2$ and find a scaling consistent with $D_0 \sim \sigma^{3/2}$ at low instantaneous magnetisation $\sigma(t)$, flattening to $D_0 \sim \sigma$ at higher $\sigma \sim 1$. We also find that the power-law index $\alpha(t)$ of the particle energy distribution converges exponentially in time. We build and test an analytic model connecting the FP coefficients and $\alpha(t)$, predicting $A(\gamma) \sim \gamma \log \gamma$. We confirm this functional form in our measurements of $A(\gamma,t)$, which allows us to predict $\alpha(t)$ through the model relations. Our results suggest that the basic second-order Fermi acceleration model, which predicts $D_0 \sim \sigma$, may not be a complete description of NTPA in turbulent plasmas. These findings encourage further application of tracked particles and FP coefficients as a diagnostic in kinetic simulations of various astrophysically relevant plasma processes like collisionless shocks and magnetic reconnection.</description>

      <title>Pair creation from radial electromagnetic perturbation of a compact astrophysical object</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently Usov's mechanism of pair creation on the surface of compact astrophysical objects has been revisited [1] with a conclusion that the pair creation rate was previously underestimated in the literature by nearly two orders of magnitude. Here we consider an alternative hypothesis of pair creation due to a perturbation of the surface of a compact object. Radial perturbation is induced in hydrodynamic velocity resulting in a microscopic displacement of the negatively charged component with respect to the positively charged one. The result depends on the ratio between the spatial scale of the perturbation $\lambda$ and the mean free path $l$. When $\lambda\sim l$ the perturbation energy is converted into a burst of electron-positron pairs which are created in collisionless plasma oscillations at the surface; after energy excess is dissipated electrosphere returns to its electrostatic configuration. When instead $\lambda\gg l$, the perturbation is thermalized, its energy is transformed into heat, and pairs are created continuously by the heated electrosphere. We discuss the relevant astrophysical scenarios.</description>

      <title>High-resolution radio observations of TeV candidate sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN) with their jets pointed close to our line of sight constitute the majority of extragalactic $\gamma$-ray sources and significantly contribute to the radiation observed in the even higher energy regime. The upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) is expected to detect fainter TeV objects, leading to an anticipated increase in the proportion of non-blazar extragalactic high-energy sources. Here we present the results of our dual-frequency (1.7 and 5~GHz) European VLBI Network (EVN) and enhanced Multi Element Remotely Linked Interferometer Network (e-MERLIN) observations of two faint radio sources from the list of TeV candidate sources. They do not show signs of nuclear activity in their optical spectra, but they were hypothesized to contain faint AGN that is outshone by the host galaxy. We used the mas-scale resolution radio data to try to pinpoint the location of the compact radio emitting feature, determine its spectral index, radio power, brightness temperature and radio-X-ray luminosity ratio and thus identify the origin of the radio emission. Our results suggest that both optically passive-looking galaxies host faint compact radio-emitting AGN with steep spectra.</description>

      <title>Detection of the Extended $\gamma$-ray Emission around TeV source 1LHAASO J0249+6022 with Fermi-LAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 1LHAASO J0249+6022 is an extended very-high-energy gamma-ray source discovered by the Large High-Altitude Air Shower Observatory. Based on nearly 16.1 years of data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope, we report the probable gamma-ray emission from 1LHAASO J0249+6022 in the 0.03-1 TeV energy range. The results show that its gamma-ray spectrum can be well fitted by a single power law with an index of 1.54 $\pm$ 0.17, and integral photon flux is (4.28 $\pm$ 1.03) $\times$ 10$^{-11}$ photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. We also considered theoretically whether the non-thermal emission could originate from a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) scenario. Assuming that the particles injected into the nebula have a power-law distribution, the resulting spectrum from the inverse Compton scattering is consistent with the detected GeV and TeV gamma-ray fluxes. Our study shows that the PWN scenario is reasonable for 1LHAASO J0249+6022.</description>

      <title>SACRA-2D: New axisymmetric general relativistic hydrodynamics code with fixed mesh refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present \texttt{SACRA-2D}, a new MPI and OpenMP parallelized, fully relativistic hydrodynamics (GRHD) code in dynamical spacetime under axial symmetry with the cartoon method using the finite-volume shock-capturing schemes for hydrodynamics. Specifically, we implemented the state-of-the-art HLLC Riemann solver and found better accuracy than the standard Total Variation Diminishing Lax-Friedrich Riemann solver. The spacetime evolves under the Baumgarte-Shapiro-Shibata-Nakamura formalism with Z4c constraint propagation. We demonstrate the accuracy of the code with some benchmark tests and excellent agreement with other codes in the literature. A wide variety of test simulations, including the head-on collision of black holes, the migration and collapse of neutron stars, and the collapse of a rotating supermassive star to a massive black hole and a disk, is also performed to show the robustness of our new code.</description>

      <title>Gamma Ray Burst GRB 221009A: two distinct hints at once at new physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The brightest ever observed gamma ray burst GRB 221009A at redshift $z = 0.151$ was detected on October 9, 2022. Its highest energy photons have been recorded by the LHAASO collaboration up to above $12 \, \rm TeV$, and one of the at ${\cal E} = 251 \, \rm TeV$ by the Carpet-2 collaboration. Very recently, the Carpet-3 collaboration has completed the data analysis, showing that the evidence of the $251 \, {\rm TeV}$ photon is quite robust. Still, according to conventional physics photons with ${\cal E} \gtrsim 10 \, \rm TeV$ cannot be observed owing to the absorption by the extragalactic background light (EBL). Previously it has been demonstrated that an axion-like particle (ALP) with allowed parameters ensures the observability of the LHAASO photons. Here we show that the Lorentz invariance violation allows the ${\cal E} = 251 \, {\rm TeV}$ (now around 300 TeV) Carpet photon to be detected.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Calipers: Precise and Accurate Neutron Star Radius Measurements with Next-Generation Gravitational Wave Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves from merging binary neutron stars carry characteristic information about their astrophysical properties, including masses and tidal deformabilities, that are needed to infer their radii. In this study, we use Bayesian inference to quantify the precision with which radius can inferred with upgrades in the current gravitational wave detectors and next-generation observatories such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer. We assign evidences for a set of plausible equations of state, which are then used as weights to obtain radius posteriors. We find that prior choices and the loudness of observed signals limit the precision and accuracy of inferred radii by current detectors. In contrast, next-generation observatories can resolve the radius precisely and accurately, across most of the mass range to within $\lesssim 5\%$ for both soft and stiff equations of state. We also explore how the choice of the neutron star mass prior can influence the inferred masses and potentially affect radii measurements, finding that choosing an astrophysically motivated prior does not notably impact an individual neutron star's radius measurements.</description>

      <title>On the origin of mid-infrared colors in $\gamma$-ray blazars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The combination between non-thermal and thermal emission in $\gamma$-ray blazars pushes them to a specific region of the mid-infrared three-dimensional color diagram, the so-called blazar locus, built based on observations performed with the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer. The selection of blazar candidates based on these mid-infrared colors has been extensively used in the past decade in the hunt for the counterparts of unassociated $\gamma$-ray sources observed with the Fermi Large Area Telescope and in the search for new blazars in optical spectroscopic campaigns.
  Aims. In this work, we provide a theoretical description of the origin of the blazar locus and show how we can reasonably reproduce it with a model consisting of only three spectral components: a log-parabola accounting for the non-thermal emission, and an elliptical host and dust torus accounting for the thermal emission.
  Methods. We simulate spectral energy distributions for blazars, starting with a pure log-parabola model and then increasing its complexity by adding a template elliptical galaxy and dust torus. From these simulations, we compute the mid-infrared magnitudes and corresponding colors to create our own version of the blazar locus.
  Results. Our modeling allows for the selection of spectral parameters that better characterize the mid-infrared emission of $\gamma$-ray blazars, such as the log-parabola curvature ($\beta &lt; 0.04$ for 50\% of our sample) and an average spectral peak around $E_p \approx 1.5 \times 10^{-13}$ erg. We also find that the log-parabola is the main spectral component behind the observed mid-infrared blazar colors, although additional components such as a host galaxy and a dust torus are crucial to obtain a precise reconstruction of the blazar locus.</description>

      <title>On the Convergence of Strong Cylindrical and Spherical Shock Waves in Solid Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we present a description of the behaviour of shock-compressed solid materials following the Geometrical Shock Dynamics (GSD) theory. GSD has been successfully applied to various gas dynamics problems, and here we have employed it to investigate the propagation of cylindrically and spherically symmetric converging shock waves in solid materials. The analytical solution of shock dynamics equations has been obtained in strong-shock limit, assuming the solid material to be homogeneous and isotropic and obeying the Mie-Gruneisen equation of state. The non-dimensional expressions are obtained for the velocity of shock, the pressure, the mass density, the particle velocity, the temperature, the speed of sound, the adiabatic bulk modulus, and the change-in-entropy behind the strong converging shock front. The influences as a result of changes in (i) the propagation distance r from the axis or centre (r=0) of convergence, (ii) the Gruneisen parameter, and (iii) the material parameter are explored on the shock velocity and the domain behind the converging shock front. The results show that as the shock focuses at the axis or origin, the shock velocity, the pressure, the temperature, and the change-in-entropy increase in the shock-compressed titanium Ti6Al4V, stainless steel 304, aluminum 6061-T6, etc.</description>

      <title>Ball Lightning as a profound manifestation of the Dark Matter physics</title>

Abstract: Ball lighting (BL) has been observed for centuries. There are large number of books, review articles, and original scientific papers devoted to different aspects of BL phenomenon. Yet, the basic features of this phenomenon have never been explained by known physics. The main problem is the source which could power the dynamics of the BL. We advocate an idea that the dark matter in form of the axion quark nuggets (AQN) made of standard model quarks and gluons (similar to the old idea of the Witten's strangelets) could internally generate the required power. The corresponding macroscopically large object in form of the AQN behaves as {\it chameleon}: it does not interact with the surrounding material in dilute environment and serves as perfect cold DM candidate. However, AQN becomes strongly interacting object in sufficiently dense environment. The AQN model was invented long ago without any relation to the BL physics. It was invented with a single motivation to explain the observed similarity $\Omega_{\rm DM}\sim \Omega_{\rm visible}$ between visible and DM components. This relation represents a very generic feature of this framework, not sensitive to any parameters of the construction. However, with the same set of parameters being fixed long ago this model is capable to address the key elements of the BL phenomenology, including the source of the energy powering the BL events. In particular, we argue that the visible size of BL, its typical life time, the frequency of appearance , etc are all consistent with suggested proposal when BL represents a profound manifestation of the DM physics represented by the AQN objects. We also formulate a unique possible test which can refute or unambiguously substantiate this unorthodox proposal on nature of BL.</description>

      <title>New stellar bow shocks and bubbles found around runaway stars</title>

Abstract: Runaway stars with peculiar high velocities can generate stellar bow shocks. Only a few bow shocks show clear radio emission. Our goal is to identify and characterize new stellar bow shocks around O and Be runaway stars in the infrared (IR), and to study their possible radio emission and nature. Our input data is a catalog of O and Be runaways compiled using Gaia DR3. We used WISE IR images to search for bow shocks around these runaways, Gaia DR3 data to determine the actual motion of the runaway stars corrected for interstellar medium (ISM) motion caused by Galactic rotation, and archival radio data to search for emission signatures. We finally explored the radio detectability of these sources under thermal and nonthermal scenarios. We found 9 new stellar bow shock candidates, 3 new bubble candidates, and 1 intermediate structure candidate. One of them is an in situ bow shock candidate. We also found 17 already known bow shocks in our sample, though we discarded one, and 62 miscellaneous sources showing some IR emission around the runaways. We geometrically characterized the sources in IR using the WISE-4 band and estimated the ISM density at the bow shock positions, obtaining median values of ~6 and ~4 cm$^{-3}$ using 2D and 3D peculiar velocities. Most of the new discovered bow shocks come from new runaway discoveries. Within our samples we found that ~24% of the O-type runaway stars show bow shocks, while this decreases to ~3% for Be-type runaway stars. Two bow shocks present radio emission but not as clear counterparts, and two others show hints of radio emission. The physical scenarios indicate that two sources could still be compatible with nonthermal radio emission. The new sample of O and Be runaway stars allowed us to discover both new stellar bow shocks and bubbles. Their geometrical characterization can be used to assess the physical scenario of the radio emission. (Abridged)</description>

      <title>Cherenkov emission by fast-moving uncharged Schwarzschild black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that in the presence of an external magnetic field, an uncharged classical Schwarzschild black hole moving superluminally in a dielectric with permittivity $\epsilon &gt; 1$ produces Cherenkov emission. This is a new physical effect: classical (non-quantum) emission of electromagnetic waves by a completely charge-neutral ``particle''. The governing equations (involving General Relativity, electromagnetism, and the physics of continuous media) have no external electromagnetic source - it is the distortion of the initial electromagnetic fields by the gravity of the black hole that plays the role of a superluminally moving source. The effect relies on nonzero values of both the magnetic field and the gravitational radius, as well as on the usual Cherenkov condition on the velocity, $v/c &gt; 1/\sqrt{\epsilon}$. Unlike Cherenkov emission by a point charge, the effective source in this case is spatially distributed, with emission generated along the single Cherenkov emission cone. The emitted spectrum is red-dominated, with power $\propto dk_z /|k_z|$ for wave numbers $|k_z| \leq 1/R_G$, where $R_G$ is the Schwarzschild radius. We comment on possible observability of this process during black hole -- neutron star mergers.</description>

      <title>Contaminating Electromagnetic Transients in LISA Gravitational Wave Localization Volumes. I: The Intrinsic Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will soon detect gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by massive black hole (MBH) mergers. Some theoretical models have predicted transient electromagnetic (EM) emission from these mergers, enabling the association of LISA GW sources with their EM counterparts via telescope follow-up. However, the number of unrelated EM transients that might contaminate telescope searches for the true transient counterparts of LISA MBH mergers is unknown. We investigate the expected numbers of unrelated EM transients that will coincide with simulated LISA localization volumes of MBH mergers, as a function of the merger total mass and redshift. We find that the number of potential contaminants in LISA localization volumes drops to unity for mergers at $z \lesssim 0.8$ and at 1 hour before coalescence. After coalescence, the parameter space corresponding to a maximum of one potential contaminant expands to $z \lesssim 1.5$. In contrast, if the redshifts for all transients detected in LISA sky localization regions are not available, the number of potential contaminants increases by an average factor of $\sim100$, and never drops below unity. Overall, we expect the average number of contaminating transients in telescope follow-up of LISA MBH mergers to be non-negligible, especially without redshift information for the detected transients. We recommend that endeavors designing follow-up strategies of LISA events should focus on: (1) building large redshift catalogs for host galaxies, (2) developing robust real-time transient classification algorithms, (3) and coordinating telescope resources to obtain redshifts for candidate transient EM counterparts in a timely manner.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional simulations of accretion disks in pre-CE systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Before a binary system enters into a common envelope (CE) phase, accretion from the primary star onto the companion star through Roche Lobe overflow (RLOF) will lead to the formation of an accretion disk, which may generate jets. Accretion before and during the CE may alter the outcome of the interaction. Previous studies have considered different aspects of this physical mechanism. Here we study the properties of an accretion disk formed via 3D hydrodynamic simulations of the RLOF mass transfer between a 7 M$_\odot$, red supergiant star and a 1.4 M$_\odot$, neutron star companion. We simulate only the volume around the companion for improved resolution. We use a 1D implicit MESA simulation of the evolution of the system during 30,000 years between the on-set of the RLOF and the CE to guide the binary parameters and the mass-transfer rate, while we simulate only 21 years of the last part of the RLOF in 3D using an ideal gas isothermal equation of state. We expect that a pre-CE disk under these parameters will have a mass of $\sim 5\times 10^{-3}$ M$_\odot$ and a radius of $\sim$40 R$_\odot$ with a scale height of $\sim$5 R$_\odot$. The temperature profile of the disk is shallower than that predicted by the formalism of Shakura and Sunyaev, but more reasonable cooling physics would need to be included. We stress test these results with respect to a number of physical and numerical parameters, as well as simulation choices, and we expect them to be reasonable within a factor of a few for the mass and 15% for the radius. We also contextualize our results within those presented in the literature, in particular with respect to the dimensionality of simulations and the adiabatic index. We consider what properties of magnetic fields and jets may be supported by our disk and discuss prospects for future work.</description>

      <title>Ensemble noise properties of the European Pulsar Timing Array</title>

Abstract: The null hypothesis in Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) analyses includes assumptions about ensemble properties of pulsar time-correlated noise. These properties are encoded in prior probabilities for the amplitude and the spectral index of the power-law power spectral density of temporal correlations of the noise. Because multiple realizations of time-correlated noise processes are found in pulsars, these ensemble noise properties could and should be modelled in the full-PTA observations by parameterising the respective prior distributions using the so-called hyperparameters. This approach is known as the hierarchical Bayesian inference. In this work, we introduce a new procedure for numerical marginalisation over hyperparameters. The procedure may be used in searches for nanohertz gravitational waves and other PTA analyses to resolve prior misspecification at negligible computational cost. Furthermore, we infer the distribution of amplitudes and spectral indices of the power spectral density of spin noise and dispersion measure variation noise based on the observation of 25 millisecond pulsars by the European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA). Our results may be used for the simulation of realistic noise in PTAs.</description>

      <title>Confronting new NICER mass-radius measurements with phase transition in dense matter and twin compact stars</title>

Abstract: The (re)analysis of data on the X-ray emitting pulsars PSR J0030+0451 and J0740+6620, as well as new results on PSR J0437-4715 and J1231-1411, are confronted with the predictions of the equation of state (EoS) models allowing for strong first-order phase transition for the mass-radius ($M$-$R$) diagram. We use models that are based on a covariant density functional (CDF) EoS for nucleonic matter at low densities and a quark matter EoS, parameterized by the speed of sound, at higher densities. To account for the variations in the ellipses for PSR J0030+0451 obtained from different analyses, we examined three scenarios to assess their consistency with our models, focusing particularly on the potential formation of twin stars. We found that in two scenarios, where the ellipses for PSR J0030+0451 and J0437-4715 with masses close to the canonical mass $\sim 1.4\,M_{\odot}$ are significantly separated, our models allow for the presence of twin stars as a natural explanation for potential differences in the radii of these stars.</description>

      <title>Hanging on the cliff: Extreme mass ratio inspiral formation with local two-body relaxation and post-Newtonian dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) are anticipated to be primary gravitational wave sources for LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna). They form in dense nuclear clusters when a compact object (CO) is captured by the central massive black holes (MBHs) due to frequent two-body interactions among orbiting objects. We present a novel Monte Carlo approach to evolve the post-Newtonian (PN) equations of motion of a CO orbiting an MBH accounting for two-body relaxation locally on the fly, without the assumption of orbit-averaging. We estimate the fraction $S(a_0)$ of EMRIs to total captures (including direct plunges, DPs) as a function of the initial semi-major axis $a_0$ for COs around MBHs of $M_\bullet\in[10^4\,{\rm M}_\odot,4\times10^6\,{\rm M}_\odot]$. Previous results indicate $S(a_0)\rightarrow 0$ at large $a_0$, with a sharp transition from EMRIs to DPs around a critical scale $a_{\rm c}$. This notion has been recently challenged for low-mass MBHs, with EMRIs forming at $a\gg a_{\rm c}$, the so-called "cliffhangers''. Our simulations confirm their existence, at larger numbers than previously expected. Cliffhangers start to appear for $M_\bullet\lesssim3\times 10^5\,{\rm M}_\odot$ and can account for up to 55% of the overall EMRIs formed. We find $S(a_0)\gg 0$ for $a\gg a_{\rm c}$, reaching values as high as 0.6 for $M_\bullet=10^4\,{\rm M}_\odot$, much larger than previously found. We find that the PN description of the system greatly enhances the number of EMRIs by shifting $a_{\rm c}$ to larger values at all MBH masses, and that the local treatment of relaxation significantly boosts the number of cliffhangers for small MBHs. Our work shows the limitations of standard assumptions for estimating EMRI formation rates, most importantly their dynamical models. Future estimates of rates and properties of EMRIs detectable by LISA should account for these improvements.</description>

      <title>The formation of mini-AGN disks around IMBHs and their dynamical implications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores the formation and implications of mini-active galactic nuclei (mAGN) disks around intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) embedded in gas-rich globular/nuclear clusters (GCs). We examine the parameter space for stable mAGN disks, considering the influence of IMBH mass, disk radius, and gas density on disk stability. The dynamics of stars and black holes within the mAGN disk are modeled, with a focus on gas-induced migration and gas dynamical friction. These dynamical processes can lead to several potentially observable phenomena, including the alignment of stellar orbits into the disk plane, the enhancement of gravitational wave mergers (particularly IMRIs and EMRIs), and the occurrence of mili/centi-tidal disruption events (mTDEs/cTDEs) with unique observational signatures. We find that gas hardening can significantly accelerate the inspiral of binaries within the disk, potentially leading to a frequency shift in the emitted gravitational waves. Additionally, we explore the possibility of forming accreting IMBH systems from captured binaries within the mAGN disk, potentially resulting in the formation of ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs). The observational implications of such accreting systems, including X-ray emission, optical signatures, and transient phenomena, are discussed. Furthermore, we investigate the possibility of large-scale jets emanating from gas-embedded IMBHs in GCs. While several caveats and uncertainties exist, our work highlights the potential for mAGN disks to provide unique insights into IMBH demographics, accretion physics, and the dynamics of GCs.</description>

      <title>Two-temperature treatments in magnetically arrested disk GRMHD simulations more accurately predict light curves of Sagittarius A*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09556v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration (EHTC) observed the Galactic centre source Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) and used emission models primarily based on single ion temperature (1T) general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations. This predicted emission is strongly dependent on a modelled prescription of the ion-to-electron temperature ratio. The most promising models are magnetically arrested disk (MAD) states. However, nearly all MAD models exhibit larger temporal fluctuations in radiative 230 GHz emission compared to observations. This limitation possibly stems from the fact that the actual temperature ratio depends on microphysical dissipation, radiative processes and other effects not captured in ideal fluid simulations. Therefore, we investigate the effects of two-temperature (2T) thermodynamics in MAD GRMHD simulations of Sgr A*, where the temperatures of both species are evolved. We find that the 230 GHz synchrotron flux variability more closely matches historical observations when we include the 2T treatment compared to 1T simulations. For the low accretion rates of Sgr A*, a common assumption is to neglect radiative cooling. However, we find that the radiative cooling of electrons-via synchrotron, inverse Compton, and bremsstrahlung processes-reduces the electron temperature in the inner disk, where the EHT observes, by about 10%, which, in turn, decreases both the (sub)millimetre synchrotron flux and its temporal fluctuations compared to uncooled simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relics are diffuse, highly-polarized radio sources that trace merger-driven shocks at the periphery of merging galaxy clusters. The LOFAR survey recently discovered a rare example of double relics in the low-mass cluster PSZ2 G181.06+48.47. Through a detailed exploration of new Chandra and XMM-Newton observations, we reveal that PSZ2 G181.06+48.47 has a lower mass ($M_{500,X}=2.32^{+0.29}_{-0.25}\times10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$) than previously thought. Despite its cool global temperature of $kT_{500}=3.62^{+0.15}_{-0.07}$ keV, PSZ2 G181.06+48.47 is one of the most disturbed clusters in the Planck sample, with a complex morphological and thermodynamic structure. We discover a set of three discontinuities within &lt;500 kpc of the cluster center, and, from a surface brightness analysis, place $5\sigma$ upper limits of $M_{NE}&lt;1.43$ and $M_{SW}&lt;1.57$ for any shock associated with the relic locations. We also revise established scaling relations for double radio-relics by adding 12 new systems not included in previous work. The PSZ2 G181.06+48.47 relics have the widest separation (scaled for $r_{500}$) of all known double-relic systems. The exceptional distance from the cluster center ($&gt;r_{200}$), indicates the relics may be associated with shocks in the ``run-away" phase. We propose that this late-stage, post-apocenter merger is captured as the two subclusters with a mass ratio of 1.2-1.4 fall back into each other. The outer relic shocks were likely produced at the first core passage, while the inner discontinuities are associated with the second infall.</description>

Abstract: Accurate thermal emission models of neutron stars are essential for constraining the dense matter equation of state. However, incorporating realistic magnetic field structures is computationally prohibitive, severely constraining feasible parameter space exploration. In this work, we develop a NN emulator to generate model thermal bolometric X-ray light curves of millisecond pulsars with multipolar magnetic fields. We assess the NN's predictive and computational performance across a broad parameter space. We find that for a SVF model, the NN provides a &gt;400 times speedup. We integrate this NN emulator into a MCMC framework to replace the computationally expensive physical model during parameter exploration. Applied to PSR J0030+0451, this approach allows the MCMC to reach equilibrium in ~1 day on 4000 cores, where with the original physical model alone it would have taken more than a year on the same hardware. We compare posterior distributions by running equivalent MCMC iterations with both the NN and the physical model, evaluate differences in distributions when continuing the physical model MCMC from the NN MCMC equilibrium state, and assess variations in posterior distributions resulting from NNs trained on datasets of different sizes. Our NN architecture is agnostic to the underlying physics of the physical model and can be trained for any other physical model, opening many avenues of analysis that were previously intractable. The NN speed remains the same regardless of the complexity of the physical model it was trained to emulate, allowing even greater speedups for physical models that are more complex than the SVF model.</description>

      <title>First spectro-polarimetric study of the neutron star low-mass X-ray binary GX 9+1</title>

Abstract: We present the first spectro-polarimetric study of the bright atoll source GX 9+1, using the simultaneous Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE), and Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) observations. The source was observed to remain in the soft state, with no changes in state throughout the observation period. The source does not show significant polarization in the 2-8 keV energy range. However, a significant polarization (3.3 sigma) was detected in the 2-3 keV range, with a polarization degree of 3.3 +/- 0.8% and a polarization angle of 11 +/- 7 deg. We used the simultaneous energy spectra from NICER (0.6 - 11 keV) and IXPE (2-8 keV) to study the spectral properties of the source during observations. The observed spectrum of the source can be well described by a combination of Comptonized blackbody emission from the neutron star surface (compbb model in XSPEC) and thermal Comptonized component with seed photons from the accretion disc. The spectral properties of GX 9+1 during the observation are consistent with those of other bright atoll-sources in the soft state. However, the high polarization degree observed in the low-energy band does not align with previous IXPE observations of other atoll-sources. This observed polarization in the source is attributed to the strong polarization of the Comptonized blackbody component. We discuss the results from the spectro-polarimetric studies in the context of various accretion disc and coronal geometries of the source.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the Magnetic Field in an Arbitrary Domain via Data-driven Bayesian Methods and Numerical Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15745v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inverse problems are prevalent in numerous scientific and engineering disciplines, where the objective is to determine unknown parameters within a physical system using indirect measurements or observations. The inherent challenge lies in deducing the most probable parameter values that align with the collected data. This study introduces an algorithm for reconstructing parameters by addressing an inverse problem formulated through differential equations underpinned by uncertain boundary conditions or variant parameters. We adopt a Bayesian approach for parameter inference, delineating the establishment of prior, likelihood, and posterior distributions, and the subsequent resolution of the maximum a posteriori problem via numerical optimization techniques. The proposed algorithm is applied to the task of magnetic field reconstruction within a conical domain, demonstrating precise recovery of the true parameter values.</description>

      <title>Spatial and Spectral Characterization of the Gravitational-wave Background with the PTA Optimal Statistic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11954v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) have made tremendous progress and are now showing strong evidence for the gravitational-wave background (GWB). Further probing the origin and characteristics of the GWB will require more generalized analysis techniques. Bayesian methods are most often used but can be computationally expensive. On the other hand, frequentist methods, like the PTA Optimal Statistic (OS), are more computationally efficient and can produce results that are complementary to Bayesian methods, allowing for stronger statistical cases to be built from a confluence of different approaches. In this work we expand the capabilities of the OS through a technique we call the Per-Frequency Optimal Statistic (PFOS). The PFOS removes the underlying power-law assumption inherent in previous implementations of the OS, and allows one to estimate the GWB spectrum in a frequency-by-frequency manner. We have also adapted a recent generalization from the OS pipeline into the PFOS, making it capable of accurately characterizing the spectrum in the intermediate and strong GW signal regimes using only a small fraction of the necessary computational resources when compared with fully-correlated Bayesian methods, while also empowering many new types of analyses not possible before. We find that even in the strong GW signal regime, where the GWB dominates over noise in all frequencies, the injected value of the signal lies within the 50th-percentile of the PFOS uncertainty distribution in 41-45% of simulations, remaining 3$\sigma$-consistent with unbiased estimation.</description>

      <title>Cold fronts in galaxy clusters I: A case for the large-scale global eigen modes in unmagnetized and weakly magnetized cluster core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03988v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Galaxy clusters show large-scale azimuthal X-ray surface brightness fluctuations known as cold fronts. Cold fronts are argued to originate due to sloshing driven by sub-halo passage at close proximity to the cluster center. While this causes large-scale perturbations, the physical mechanisms that can sustain spiral density structures are not clear. In this work, we explore whether long wavelength thermal instability is an explanation for cold front formation in a cluster core which is perturbed by sub-halos or AGN activity. Using global linear perturbation analysis, we show that unstable internal gravity waves form large-scale three-dimensional spirals, akin to observed cold fronts. We explore if the presence of magnetic field (along spherical $\hat{\phi}$) may support such structures (by suppressing small scale Kelvin-Helmholtz modes) or disrupt them (by promoting additional thermal instability). We find that latter happens at shorter wavelengths and above characteristic Brunt V\"ais\"al\"a frequency ($&gt;N_{\rm BV}$). Our work implies that large-scale spirals are sustained over a long timescale ($&gt;N^{-1}_{\rm BV}$) even in presence of aligned magnetic fields that is otherwise supportive against mixing at the interface. Secondly, short-wavelength (but relatively longer along the field) unstable compressive modes may form within or in the vicinity of such spirals. The instability is an overstable slow wave, and grows in 2D at timescales $\gtrsim 2-3$ times longer than the spiral growth timescale (via thermal instability). Thus this instability cannot destroy the large scale coherence.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Rapidly Rotating Stars with Chemically Homogeneous Evolution in the First Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02002v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed an unexpectedly high abundance of UV luminous galaxies at redshifts $z\gtrsim 10$, challenging `standard' galaxy formation models. This study investigates the role of rapidly rotating (massive) stars undergoing chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE) in reconciling this potential tension. These stars are more compact, hotter, and exhibit enhanced UV emission. We find that the rest-frame UV luminosity of star-forming galaxies can be significantly enhanced by a factor of $\sim 3-6$ when CHE stars above a minimum initial mass of $m_{\star,\min}^{\rm CHE}\sim 2-10\ \rm M_\odot$ account for more than half of the total stellar mass following a Salpeter initial mass function. As a result, the UV luminosity functions observed at $z\sim 12-16$ can be reproduced with less extreme values of star formation efficiency and UV luminosity stochastic variability. Our results highlight the potential of CHE in explaining the UV-bright galaxy populations detected by JWST and call for future work to explore the broader astrophysical implications of CHE and its associated phenomena in the early universe, such as gamma-ray bursts, compact object binaries, and metal enrichment.</description>

      <title>Significant increase in sensitive volume of a gravitational wave search upon including higher harmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most gravitational wave searches to date have included only the quadrupole mode in their search templates. Here, we demonstrate that incorporating higher harmonics improves the search sensitive volume for detecting binary black hole mergers, challenging the conclusion of previous studies. Using the $\tt{IAS-HM}$ detection pipeline, and the simulated (injection) signals from the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra (LVK) collaboration, we quantify the improvement in sensitivity due to the inclusion of higher harmonics. This improvement is significant for systems with higher mass ratios and larger total masses, with gains in sensitivity even exceeding $100\%$ at certain high masses. We also show that, due to using a marginalized detection statistic, the $\tt{IAS-HM}$ pipeline performs roughly as well as its quadrupole-mode-only counterpart even for equal mass-ratio mergers, and its sensitive volume is either better than or comparable to that of the individual LVK pipelines.</description>

      <title>A Poisson Process AutoDecoder for X-ray Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: X-ray observing facilities, such as the Chandra X-ray Observatory and the eROSITA, have detected millions of astronomical sources associated with high-energy phenomena. The arrival of photons as a function of time follows a Poisson process and can vary by orders-of-magnitude, presenting obstacles for common tasks such as source classification, physical property derivation, and anomaly detection. Previous work has either failed to directly capture the Poisson nature of the data or only focuses on Poisson rate function reconstruction. In this work, we present Poisson Process AutoDecoder (PPAD). PPAD is a neural field decoder that maps fixed-length latent features to continuous Poisson rate functions across energy band and time via unsupervised learning. PPAD reconstructs the rate function and yields a representation at the same time. We demonstrate the efficacy of PPAD via reconstruction, regression, classification and anomaly detection experiments using the Chandra Source Catalog.</description>
