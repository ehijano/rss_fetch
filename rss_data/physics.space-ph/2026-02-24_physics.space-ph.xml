      <title>The Free-Electron Laser Model of Magnetospheric Chorus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chorus waves are electromagnetic waves named for their resemblance to birds chirping at dawn when their radio frequencies are played as audio. The amplification of chorus in Earth's magnetosphere has been the subject of intense scientific inquiry since the discovery of the Van Allen radiation belts in 1958. Resonant interactions between chorus and radiation belt electrons can lead to the exponential growth of small seed waves by a factor of fifty within milliseconds. These powerful modes can cause rapid acceleration of electrons and endanger space-based technologies. Recent efforts to understand chorus amplification have drawn upon parallels to free-electron lasers, laboratory devices that generate intense coherent light with tunable frequencies. This approach, known as the free-electron laser model of magnetospheric chorus, is the subject of this dissertation. In this work, we build on previous research on the free-electron laser model, ultimately presenting a novel nonlinear model of whistler-mode chorus in the magnetosphere. In the first chapter, we provide a brief introduction to whistlers, magnetospheric chorus, and free-electron lasers. We also derive the 2N+2 equations foundational to the interaction of chorus with N resonant electrons. In the second chapter, we derive a reduced set of just three nonlinear equations using the method of collective variables. We then derive a Ginzburg-Landau equation (GLE) for the behavior of a chorus wave packet with a spectrum of frequencies with spatially varying amplitudes and discuss the prediction of solitary chorus waves. In the third chapter, we focus on the behavior of the single-mode solutions predicted by the GLE, including their linear stability and the phenomenon of mode condensation, where a single mode can emerge from a noisy spectrum. In the final chapter, we summarize the results and discuss open questions and future directions.</description>

      <title>The impact of electron precipitation on Earth's thermospheric NO production and the drag of LEO satellites</title>

Abstract: We investigate the response of space weather events on Earth's upper atmosphere over the polar regions by studying their effect on the drag of the CHAMP and GRACE satellites. Increasing solar activity that results in heating and the expansion of the upper atmosphere threatens low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites. Auroral events are closely related to the stellar energy deposition of solar EUV radiation and precipitating energetic electrons, which influence photochemical processes such as the production of nitric oxide (NO) in the upper atmosphere. To study the production of NO molecules and their influence on the thermospheric structure and satellite drag, we first model Earth's background thermosphere with the 1D upper atmosphere model Kompot by considering the incident X-ray, EUV, and IR radiation during selected space weather events. To investigate the effect of electron precipitation in the production of NO molecules in the polar thermosphere, we apply a Monte Carlo model accounting for the stochastic nature of collisional scattering of auroral electrons in collisions with the surrounding N$_2$-O$_2$ atmosphere, including the production of suprathermal N atoms. The observed effect of the atmospheric drag on CHAMP and GRACE during the two studied events indicates that a sporadic enhancement of NO molecule production in the polar thermosphere and its IR-cooling capability, which counteracts thermospheric expansion and can lead to an ``overcooling'' with decreased density after the space weather event, can have a protective effect on LEO satellites. Their production efficiency, however, is highly dependent on the energy flux of the precipitating electrons. Our results have direct implications for empirical satellite orbit prediction models, as our simulations highlight the need to consider precipitation-induced NO production to improve the predictive power of these models.</description>

      <title>On flying near the base of a pseudo-streamer</title>

Abstract: Near the 10 solar radius perihelion of Parker Solar Probe encounter 24, a confined region containing an enhanced plasma density (25,000 per cubic centimeter) and broadband electrostatic waves was encountered. The solar wind velocity (200 kilometers per second) and ion temperature (25 electron Volts) were significantly reduced as compared to their values in the ambient solar wind. Because the polarity of the radial magnetic field did not change sign on the two sides of the crossing and the crossed region contained a double-peaked plasma structure, the spacecraft must have passed near the base of a pseudo-streamer. In the plasma frame, an electric field as large as 400 millivolts per meter was detected during the crossing. This field is not associated with an ExB drift because it is observed in the plasma rest frame. Instead, it is balanced by the Generalized Ohm's Law terms whose current dependent term associated with this electric field was less than 1 milliampere per square meter, corresponding to a drift velocity less than 2.5 kilometers per second. The region also contained a turbulent plasma with density fluctuations as large as 0.3, suggesting that the resistive term in the Generalized Ohm's Law could be significant. In addition, both the density and electric field had non-zero slopes as functions of time, suggesting that the pressure gradient term in the Generalized Ohm's Law also mattered. This large electric field in the plasma rest frame may be the first and largest such field ever reported.</description>
