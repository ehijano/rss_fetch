      <title>Bijective solutions to the Pentagon Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A complete classification of all finite bijective set-theoretic solutions $(S,s)$ to the Pentagon Equation is obtained. First, it is shown that every such a solution determines a semigroup structure on the set $S$ that is the direct product $E\times G$ of a semigroup of left zeros $E$ and a group $G$. Next, we prove that this leads to a decomposition of the set $S$ as a Cartesian product $X\times A\times G$, for some sets $X,A$ and to a discovery of a hidden group structure on $A$. Then an unexpected structure of a matched product of groups $A,G$ is found such that the solution $(S,s)$ can be explicitly described as a lift of a solution determined on the set $A\times G$ by this matched product of groups. Conversely, every matched product of groups leads to a family of solutions arising in this way. Moreover, a simple criterion for the isomorphism of two solutions is obtained. The results provide a far reaching extension of the results of Colazzo, Jespers and Kubat, dealing with the special case of the so called involutive solutions. Connections to the solutions to the Yang--Baxter equation and to the theory of skew braces are derived.</description>

      <title>Relatively hyperbolic groups with planar boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we prove a version of Martin and Skora's conjecture that convergence groups on the $2$-sphere are covered by Kleinian groups. Given a relatively hyperbolic group pair $(G,\mathcal{P})$ with planar boundary and no Sierpinski carpet or cut points in its boundary, and with $G$ one ended and virtually having no $2$-torsion, we show that $G$ is virtually Kleinian. We also give applications to various versions of the Cannon conjecture and to convergence groups acting on $S^2$.</description>

      <title>GGS-groups acting on trees of growing degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider analogues of Grigorchuk-Gupta-Sidki (GGS-)groups acting on trees of growing degree; the so-called growing GGS-groups. These groups are not just infinite and do not possess the congruence subgroup property, but many of them are branch and have the $p$-congruence subgroup property, for a prime $p$. Among them, we find groups with maximal subgroups only of finite index, and with infinitely many such maximal subgroups. These give the first examples of finitely generated branch groups with infinitely many finite-index maximal subgroups. Additionally, we prove that congruence quotients of growing GGS-groups associated to a defining vector of zero sum give rise to Beauville groups.</description>

      <title>Profinite groups with soluble centralisers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a profinite group, in which the centralisers of non-trivial elements are metabelian, is either virtually pro-$p$ or virtually soluble of derived length at most 4. We furthermore show that a prosoluble group, in which the centralisers of non-trivial elements are soluble of bounded derived length, is either soluble or virtually pro-$p$.</description>

      <title>The bounded cohomology of transformation groups of Euclidean spaces and discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the groups of orientation-preserving homeomorphisms and diffeomorphisms of $\mathbb{R}^n$ are boundedly acyclic, in all regularities. This is the first full computation of the bounded cohomology of a transformation group that is not compactly supported, and it implies that many characteristic classes of flat $\mathbb{R}^n$- and $S^n$-bundles are unbounded. We obtain the same result for the group of homeomorphisms of the disc that restrict to the identity on the boundary, and for the homeomorphism group of the non-compact Cantor set. In the appendix, Alexander Kupers proves a controlled version of the annulus theorem which we use to study the bounded cohomology of the homeomorphism group of the discs.</description>
