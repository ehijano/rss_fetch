      <title>The unknotting numbers for plus-welded knotoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knotoid theory is a generalization of knot theory introduced by Turaev in 2012. In recent years, various invariants of knotoids have been studied. In this paper, we mainly discuss unknotting moves and unknotting numbers of plus-welded knotoids. Firstly, we prove that a descending diagram of a plus-welded knotoid can be transformed into a trivial one through a finite sequence of $\Omega_1$, $V\Omega_1 - V\Omega_4$, $\Omega_v$, $\Phi_{\text{over}}$, and $\Phi_+$-moves. Secondly, we extend the warping degree of knots to plus-welded knotoids and discuss its properties. Finally, by utilizing the descending diagram and the warping degree, we obtain two unknotting operations for plus-welded knotoids, referred as a crossing change and a crossing virtualization. For both operations, we find upper bounds for corresponding unknotting numbers of plus-welded knotoids.</description>

      <title>Knot invariants from XC-structures on the Sweedler algebra are trivial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An XC-algebra is the minimum algebraic structure needed to define a framed, oriented knot invariant and generalises Lawrence's invariant obtained from ribbon Hopf algebras. In this note, we show that the knot invariant produced by any XC-structure on the Sweedler algebra is completely determined by the framing of the knot. Furthermore, we also exhibit explicit families of XC-structures on the Sweedler algebra that do not have a ribbon Hopf-algebraic origin.</description>

      <title>On the gauge invariance of the Kuperberg invariant of certain high genus framed 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the Kuperberg invariant of the Weeks manifold with any framing is a gauge invariant of finite-dimensional Hopf algebras, which provides the first example of gauge invariants of general finite-dimensional Hopf algebras via hyperbolic 3-manifolds. We also show that the Kuperberg invariant of the 3-torus is gauge invariant, which further supports the idea of systematically producing gauge invariants of Hopf algebras via topological methods proposed in \cite{CNW25}.</description>

      <title>Quantitative FUP and spectral gap for quasi-Fuchsian group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive an explicit formula for the exponent $\beta$ in the higher-dimensional fractal uncertainty principle (FUP) established by Cohen 2023, quantifying its dependence on the porosity parameter $\nu$ of the Fourier support. This quantitative version of FUP yields an explicit essential spectral gap for convex co-compact hyperbolic 3-manifolds arising from quasi-Fuchsian groups, thereby refining the result of Tao 2025. Our result extends the earlier work of Jin-Zhang 2020 to higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>A CW complex homotopy equivalent to spaces of locally convex curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.14539v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Locally convex curves in the sphere $S^n$ have been studied for several reasons, including the study of linear ordinary differential equations. Taking Frenet frames obtains corresponding curves $\Gamma$ in the group $Spin_{n+1}$; $\Pi: Spin_{n+1} \to Flag_{n+1}$ is the universal cover of the space of flags. Determining the homotopy type of spaces of such curves $\Gamma$ with prescribed initial and final points appears to be a hard problem. We may focus on $L_n$, the space of locally convex curves $\Gamma: [0,1] \to Spin_{n+1}$ with $\Gamma(0) = 1$, $\Pi(\Gamma(1)) = \Pi(1)$. Convex curves form a contractible connected component of $L_n$; there are $2^{n+1}$ other components, one for each endpoint. The homotopy type of $L_n$ has so far been determined only for $n=2$. This paper is a step towards solving the problem for larger values of $n$.
  The itinerary of $\Gamma$ belongs to $W_n$, the set of finite words in the alphabet $S_{n+1} \setminus \{e\}$. The itinerary of a curve lists the non open Bruhat cells crossed. Itineraries stratify the space $L_n$. We construct a CW complex $D_n$ which is a kind of dual of $L_n$ under this stratification: the construction is similar to Poincar\'e duality. The CW complex $D_n$ is homotopy equivalent to $L_n$. The cells of $D_n$ are naturally labeled by words in $W_n$; $D_n$ is locally finite. Explicit glueing instructions are described for lower dimensions.
  We describe an open subset $Y_n \subset L_n$, a union of strata of $L_n$. In each non convex component of $L_n$, the intersection with $Y_n$ is connected and dense. Most connected components of $L_n$ are contained in $Y_n$. For $n &gt; 3$, in the other components the complement of $Y_n$ has codimension at least $2$. The set $Y_n$ is homotopy equivalent to the disjoint union of $2^{n+1}$ copies of $\Omega Spin_{n+1}$. For all $n \ge 2$, all connected components of $L_n$ are simply connected.</description>

      <title>Algebraic interaction strength for translation surfaces with multiple singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the maximal ratio of the algebraic intersection of two closed curves on two families of translation surfaces with multiple singularities. This ratio, called the interaction strength, is difficult to compute for translation surfaces with several singularities as geodesics can change direction at singularities. The main contribution of this paper is to deal with this type of surfaces. Namely, we study the interaction strength of the regular $n-$gons for $n \equiv 2 \pmod 4$ and the Bouw-M\"oller surfaces $S_{m,n}$ with $1 &lt; \gcd(m,n) &lt; n$. This answers a conjecture of the author from (Boulanger, Algebraic intersection, lengths and Veech surfaces, arXiv:2309.17165). and it completes the study of the algebraic interaction strength KVol on the regular polygon Veech surfaces. Our results on Bouw-M\"oller surfaces extends the results of (Boulanger-Pasquinelli, Algebraic intersections on Bouw-M\"oller surfaces, and more general convex polygons, arXiv:2409.01711). This is also the first exact computation of KVol on translation surfaces with several singularities, and the pairs of curves that achieve the best ratio are singular geodesics made of two saddle connections with different directions.</description>

      <title>Random quotients preserve acylindrical and hierarchical hyperbolicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16677v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new model for random quotients of groups using independent random walks. In this model, we show that random quotients of acylindrical hyperbolic groups asymptotically almost surely remain acylindrically hyperbolic. Our main tools relate the theories of spinning families and projection complexes to random walks. In the presence of a hierarchical hyperbolic structure on the group, we leverage the fine control of projections to show that this structure is preserved in the quotient asymptotically almost surely. The same techniques yield that random quotients of a non-elementary hyperbolic group (relative to any finite collection of finitely generated peripheral subgroups) are asymptotically almost surely hyperbolic (relative to commensurable peripheral subgroups). Finally, we also prove that any two groups that are both acylindrically and hierarchically hyperbolic have a common quotients which is itself acylindrically and hierarchically hyperbolic. This produces "exotic" hierarchically hyperbolic groups with strong fixed point properties, such as Kazhdan's property (T).</description>
