      <title>Planar Collisionless Shock Simulations with Semi-Implicit Particle-in-Cell Model FLEKS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the applicability of the semi-implicit particle-in-cell code FLEKS to collisionless shock simulations, with a focus on the parameter regime relevant to global magnetosphere modeling. We examine one- and two-dimensional local planar shock simulations, initialized using MHD states with upstream conditions representative of the solar wind at 1 au, for both quasi-perpendicular and quasi-parallel configurations. The refined algorithm in FLEKS proves robust, enabling accurate shock simulations with a grid resolution on the order of the electron inertial length $d_e$. Our simulations successfully capture key shock features, including shock structures (foot, ramp, overshoot, and undershoot), upstream and downstream waves (fast magnetosonic, whistler, Alfv\'en ion-cyclotron, and mirror modes), and non-Maxwellian particle distributions. Crucially, we find that at least two spatial dimensions are critical for accurately reproducing downstream wave physics in quasi-perpendicular shocks and capturing the complex dynamics of quasi-parallel shocks, including surface rippling, shocklets, SLAMS, and jets. Furthermore, our parameter studies demonstrate the impact of mass ratio and grid resolution on shock physics. This work provides valuable guidance for selecting appropriate physical and numerical parameters for a semi-implicit PIC code, paving the way for incorporating kinetic shock processes into large-scale space plasma simulations with the MHD-AEPIC model.</description>

      <title>Meter-scale Observations of Equatorial Plasma Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multi-Needle Langmuir Probe collects an electron current through four fixed-bias cylindrical copper needles. This allows for an extremely high sampling frequency, with plasma properties being inferred through polynomial fitting in the current-voltage plane. We present initial results from such a multi-needle probe mounted on the International Space Station, orbiting Earth at an altitude of around 400 km. That altitude, and its orbital inclination (~50 degrees), place the ISS as a suitable platform for observing equatorial plasma bubbles. In case studies of such turbulent structuring of the F-region plasma, we observe density timeseries that conserve considerable detail at virtually every level of magnification down to its Nyquist scale of 2-5 meters. We present power spectral density estimates of the turbulent structuring found inside equatorial plasma bubbles, and we discuss apparent break-points at scale-sizes between 1 m and 300 m, which we interpret in the light of turbulent dissipation as kilometer-scale swirls produced by the gradient-drift instability dissipate in the plasma.</description>

      <title>Switchbacks near Boundaries of Small-scale Magnetic Flux Ropes in the Young Solar Wind from Parker Solar Probe Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Parker Solar Probe (PSP) mission has revealed frequent occurrences of switchbacks (SBs) and small-scale magnetic flux ropes (SMFRs) as prominent structures within the solar wind. These mesoscale features are observed across all heliocentric distances, with heightened activity in the young solar wind, such as successive SMFRs, blobs, and SBs using PSP in situ observations. One study, in particular, focuses on SMFRs observed during the intervals of PSP co-rotating with the Sun, which suggests a similar source of the observed solar wind. In this letter, we identified SBs at the boundaries of SMFRs as a regularly observed phenomenon and found instances where SBs and SMFRs co-occur, with the significance level $\alpha&lt;0.05$. The SMFR-related SBs - observed at the leading and trailing edges of an SMFR - exhibit well-organized axial co-orientations, with their polarity flipping, meaning the radial direction remains constrained while the transversal field reverses. Furthermore, the axial field directions of SMFRs-related SBs appear to be more closely connected than to another SB that is spatially closer and are linked to the SMFR orientation. Our analysis of their relative geometry, which examines the alignment between SBs and the SMFR axis, reveals a distinct tendency emphasizing their correlation, further supporting the idea that the axes of SMFR-related SBs are presumably determined by the SMFR orientation. Observations suggest that a fraction of SBs is spatially and temporally associated with SMFRs, implying that processes related to SMFR boundaries may contribute to SB formation, or that SBs tend to develop in magnetic environments shaped by SMFRs.</description>
