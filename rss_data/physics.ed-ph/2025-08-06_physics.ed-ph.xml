      <title>Pathways to Quantum: Fostering High School Student Interest in Quantum Information Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the Pathways to Quantum Immersion Program at George Mason University, which introduces high school students to quantum concepts and careers. Fifteen group interviews with a total of 45 students were analyzed to examine how the program supported student awareness, knowledge, and perceptions of quantum careers. Participants gained a better understanding of various quantum and quantum-adjacent careers, as well as the paths they might follow to pursue these careers. Interactions with professionals helped adjust academic and career expectations, solidifying student interest in these fields. Peers and mentors played crucial roles in students learning journey.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised and semi-supervised clustering methods to identify and refine participant experience levels in educational research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The progression from novice to disciplinary expert is a longstanding area of inquiry in educational research. Studies investigating such progressions have often resorted to participants' self-assessments or other qualitative indicators as a starting point to define experience. But does a participant's estimated experience coincide with metrics derived from their conceptual understanding of a discipline? Using data extracted from over 150 concept maps, we first demonstrate that disciplinary experience is a reliable variable to explain differences in conceptual understanding across a highly diverse learners' population. Through a comparison of unsupervised and semi-supervised models, we then motivate clustering participants into three distinguished experience levels, and support such a classification performed in other studies of educational research. By analysing cluster composition, we also identify discrepancies between the perceived and predicted experience levels of the study participants. Lastly, for studies processing participants data through network analysis, we present insights into statistically significant metrics that can characterise each experience level, and advocate for the use of node-level metrics in such studies.</description>

      <title>Why Teach Quantum?: Elementary Teachers Initial Beliefs about Quantum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the initial beliefs held by elementary educators (n=11) and their students about teaching and learning quantum concepts at the elementary level. All teachers were participants in a grant-funded project focused on developing teachers' quantum content knowledge and creating curricular resources to use in elementary classrooms. Although elementary teachers had limited knowledge of quantum at the beginning of the project, they expressed excitement and a belief that learning quantum would create future possibilities for their students.</description>

      <title>Building Student Understanding of Quantum Information Science and Engineering through Projects on Applications to Medical Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical technologies, including quantum machine learning (QML) and quantum sensing, represent transformative tools for addressing some of the most pressing challenges in healthcare and drug discovery today. We discuss the ways that these topics engage the interest of high-school, undergraduate, and graduate students in understanding quantum information science and engineering. We describe how students built their understanding of these areas through a research project that allowed them to gain an understanding of the technology, its limitations, and the associated ethical considerations. We also consider the challenges of building this kind of work into the curriculum and of bringing students with interests in the biological and medical areas into quantum science and engineering.</description>
