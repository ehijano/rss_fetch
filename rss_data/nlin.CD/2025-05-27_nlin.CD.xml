      <title>Chaotic Kramers' Law: Hasselmann's Program and AMOC Tipping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In bistable dynamical systems driven by Wiener processes, the widely used Kramers' law relates the strength of the noise forcing to the average time it takes to see a noise-induced transition from one attractor to the other. We extend this law to bistable systems forced with fast chaotic dynamics, which we argue to be a more realistic modeling approach than unbounded noise forcing in some cases. We test our results numerically in a reduced-order model of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and discuss the limits of the chaotic Kramers' law as well as its surprisingly wide parameter range of applicability. Hereby, we show in detail how to apply Hasselmann's program in practice and give a possible explanation for recent findings of AMOC collapse and recovery in complex climate models.</description>

      <title>Mechanochemical feedback drives complex inertial dynamics in active solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active solids combine internal active driving with elasticity to realize states with nonequilibrium mechanics and autonomous motion. They are often studied in overdamped settings, e.g., in soft materials, and the role of inertia is less explored. We construct a model of a chemically active solid that incorporates mechanochemical feedback and show that, when feedback overwhelms mechanical damping, autonomous inertial dynamics can spontaneously emerge through sustained consumption of chemical fuel. By combining numerical simulations, analysis and dynamical systems approaches, we show how active feedback drives complex nonlinear dynamics on multiple time-scales, including limit cycles and chaos. Our results suggest design principles for creating ultrafast actuators and autonomous machines from soft, chemically-powered solids.</description>

      <title>The influence of data gaps and outliers on resilience indicators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19034v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The resilience, or stability, of major Earth system components is increasingly threatened by anthropogenic pressures, demanding reliable early warning signals for abrupt and irreversible regime shifts. Widely used data-driven resilience indicators based on variance and autocorrelation detect `critical slowing down', a signature of decreasing stability. However, the interpretation of these indicators is hampered by poorly understood interdependencies and their susceptibility to common data issues such as missing values and outliers. Here, we establish a rigorous mathematical analysis of the statistical dependency between variance- and autocorrelation-based resilience indicators, revealing that their agreement is fundamentally driven by the time series' initial data point. Using synthetic and empirical data, we demonstrate that missing values substantially weaken indicator agreement, while outliers introduce systematic biases that lead to overestimation of resilience based on temporal autocorrelation. Our results provide a necessary and rigorous foundation for preprocessing strategies and accuracy assessments across the growing number of disciplines that use real-world data to infer changes in system resilience.</description>

      <title>Understanding Plasma Turbulence Through Exact Coherent Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasma turbulence is a key challenge in understanding transport phenomena in magnetically confined plasmas. This work presents a novel approach using periodic orbit theory to analyze plasma turbulence, identifying fundamental structures that underpin chaotic motion. By applying numerical optimization techniques to the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation - a reduced model for drift-wave-driven trapped particle turbulence - we extract coherent spacetime patterns that serve as building blocks of turbulent dynamics. These structures provide a framework to systematically describe turbulence as a composition of recurrent solutions, revealing an underlying order within chaotic plasma motion. Our findings suggest that multi-periodic orbit theory can be effectively applied to spatiotemporal turbulence, offering a new method for predicting and potentially controlling transport processes in fusion plasmas. This study provides a bridge between nonlinear dynamical systems theory and plasma physics, highlighting the relevance of periodic orbit approaches for understanding complex plasma behavior.</description>

      <title>Multiple Descents in Deep Learning as a Sequence of Order-Chaos Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We observe a novel 'multiple-descent' phenomenon during the training process of LSTM, in which the test loss goes through long cycles of up and down trend multiple times after the model is overtrained. By carrying out asymptotic stability analysis of the models, we found that the cycles in test loss are closely associated with the phase transition process between order and chaos, and the local optimal epochs are consistently at the critical transition point between the two phases. More importantly, the global optimal epoch occurs at the first transition from order to chaos, where the 'width' of the 'edge of chaos' is the widest, allowing the best exploration of better weight configurations for learning.</description>

      <title>Chaos Meets Attention: Transformers for Large-Scale Dynamical Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generating long-term trajectories of dissipative chaotic systems autoregressively is a highly challenging task. The inherent positive Lyapunov exponents amplify prediction errors over time. Many chaotic systems possess a crucial property - ergodicity on their attractors, which makes long-term prediction possible. State-of-the-art methods address ergodicity by preserving statistical properties using optimal transport techniques. However, these methods face scalability challenges due to the curse of dimensionality when matching distributions. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose a scalable transformer-based framework capable of stably generating long-term high-dimensional and high-resolution chaotic dynamics while preserving ergodicity. Our method is grounded in a physical perspective, revisiting the Von Neumann mean ergodic theorem to ensure the preservation of long-term statistics in the $\mathcal{L}^2$ space. We introduce novel modifications to the attention mechanism, making the transformer architecture well-suited for learning large-scale chaotic systems. Compared to operator-based and transformer-based methods, our model achieves better performances across five metrics, from short-term prediction accuracy to long-term statistics. In addition to our methodological contributions, we introduce a new chaotic system benchmark: a machine learning dataset of 140$k$ snapshots of turbulent channel flow along with various evaluation metrics for both short- and long-term performances, which is well-suited for machine learning research on chaotic systems.</description>

      <title>Phase space contraction rate for classical mixed states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09361v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physical systems with non-reciprocal or dissipative forces evolve according to a generalization of Liouville's equation that accounts for the expansion and contraction of phase space volume. Here, we connect geometric descriptions of these non-Hamiltonian dynamics to a recently established classical density matrix theory. In this theory, the evolution of a ``maximally mixed'' classical density matrix is related to the well-known phase space contraction rate that, when ensemble averaged, is the rate of entropy exchange with the surroundings. Here, we extend the definition of mixed states to include statistical and mechanical components, describing both the deformations of local phase space regions and the evolution of ensembles within them. As a result, the equation of motion for this mixed state represents the rate of contraction for an ensemble of dissipative trajectories. Recognizing this density matrix as a covariance matrix, its contraction rate is another measure of entropy flow characterizing nonequilibrium steady states.</description>
