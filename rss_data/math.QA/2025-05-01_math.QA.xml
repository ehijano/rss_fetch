      <title>Generalized Kac-Paljutkin algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we construct a family of semisimple Hopf algebras $H_{n,m}$ of dimension $n^m m!$ over a field of characteristic zero containing a primitive $n$th root of unity, where $n, m \geq 2$ are integers. The well-known eight-dimensional Kac--Paljutkin algebra arises as the special case $H_{2,2}$, while the Hopf algebras previously constructed by Pansera correspond to the instances $H_{n,2}$. Each algebra $H_{n,m}$ is defined as an extension of the group algebra $\mathbb{K} \Sigma_m$ of the symmetric group by the $m$-fold tensor product $R = \mathbb{K} \mathbb{Z}_n^{\otimes m}$, where $\mathbb{Z}_n$ denotes the cyclic group of order $n$. This extension admits a realization as a crossed product: $H_{n,m} = \mathbb{K} \mathbb{Z}_n^{\otimes m} \#_\gamma \Sigma_m$. In the final section, we construct a family of irreducible $m$-dimensional representations of $H_{n,m}$ that are inner faithful as $R$-modules and exhibit a nontrivial inner-faithful action of a subalgebra of $H_{n,m}$ on a quantum polynomial algebra.</description>

      <title>Quantum Littlewood correspondences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the 1940s Littlewood formulated three fundamental correspondences for the immanants and Schur symmetric functions on the general linear group, which establish deep connections between representation theory of the symmetric group and the general linear group parallel to the Schur-Weyl duality. In this paper, we introduce the notion of quantum immanants in the quantum coordinate algebra using primitive idempotents of the Hecke algebra. By employing $R$-matrix techniques, we establish the quantum analog of Littlewood correspondences between quantum immanants and Schur functions for the quantum coordinate algebra. In the setting of the Schur-Weyl-Jimbo duality, we construct an exact correspondence between the Gelfand-Tsetlin bases of the irreducible representations of the quantum enveloping algebra $U_q(\mathfrak{gl}(n))$ and Young's orthonormal basis of an irreducible representation of the Hecke algebra $\mathcal H_m$. This isomorphism leads to our trace formula for the quantum immanants, which settled the generalization problem
  of $q$-analog of Kostant's formular for $\lambda$-immanants. As applications, we also derive general $q$-Littlewood-Merris-Watkins identities and $q$-Goulden-Jackson identities as special cases of the quantum Littlewood correspondence III.</description>

      <title>Minimal Factorization of Chern-Simons Theory - Gravitational Anyonic Edge Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One approach to analyzing entanglement in a gauge theory is embedding it into a factorized theory with edge modes on the entangling boundary. For topological quantum field theories (TQFT), this naturally leads to factorizing a TQFT by adding local edge modes associated with the corresponding CFT. In this work, we instead construct a minimal set of edge modes compatible with the topological invariance of Chern-Simons theory. This leads us to propose a minimal factorization map. These minimal edge modes can be interpreted as the degrees of freedom of a particle on a quantum group. Of particular interest is three-dimensional gravity as a Chern-Simons theory with gauge group SL$(2,\mathbb{R}) \times$ SL$(2,\mathbb{R})$. Our minimal factorization proposal uniquely gives rise to quantum group edge modes factorizing the bulk state space of 3d gravity. This agrees with earlier proposals that relate the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy in 3d gravity to topological entanglement entropy.</description>

      <title>Notes on a homomorphism from the affine Yangian associated with $\hat{\mathfrak{sl}}(n)$ to the affine Yangian associated with $\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}(n+1)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01870v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the previous paper, we constructed a homomorphism from the affine Yangian associated with $\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}(n)$ to the standard degreewise completion of the affine Yangian associated with $\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}(n+1)$. In this article, by using this homomorphism, we construct homomorphisms from the affine Yangian to the universal enveloping algebra of a non-rectangular $W$-algebra of type $A$, which are different from the one in \cite{U7}. Based on this result, we discuss a new definition of the affine shifted Yangian, from which it is expected that there exists a homomorphism to the universal enveloping algebra of a non-rectangular $W$-algebra of type $A$. In the appendix, we also show that this homomorphism is related to the one from the quantum affine algebra associated with $\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}(n)$ to the quantum affine algebra associated with $\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}(n+1)$ given by Li.</description>

      <title>Reflections to set-theoretic solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19105v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main aim of this paper is to determine reflections to bijective and non-degenerate solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation, by exploring their connections with their derived solutions. This is motivated by a recent description of left non-degenerate solutions in terms of a family of automorphisms of their associated left rack. In some cases, we show that the study of reflections for bijective and non-degenerate solutions can be reduced to those of derived type. Moreover, we extend some results obtained in the literature for reflections of involutive non-degenerate solutions to more arbitrary solutions. Besides, we provide ways for defining reflections for solutions obtained by employing some classical construction techniques of solutions. Finally, we gather some numerical data on reflections for bijective non-degenerate solutions associated with skew braces of small order.</description>

      <title>Categorical diagonalization of full twists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00191</link>
      <description>arXiv:1801.00191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conjecture that the complex of Soergel bimodules associated with the full twist braid is categorically diagonalizable, for any finite Coxeter group. This utilizes the theory of categorical diagonalization introduced earlier by the authors. We prove our conjecture in type $A$, and as a result we obtain a categorification of the Young idempotents.</description>

      <title>Rotation-invariant web bases from hourglass plabic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12501v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Webs give a diagrammatic calculus for spaces of tensor invariants. We introduce hourglass plabic graphs as a new avatar of webs, and use these to give the first rotation-invariant $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_4)$-web basis, a long-sought object. The characterization of our basis webs relies on the combinatorics of these new plabic graphs and associated configurations of a symmetrized six-vertex model. We give growth rules, based on a novel crystal-theoretic technique, for generating our basis webs from tableaux and we use skein relations to give an algorithm for expressing arbitrary webs in the basis. We also discuss how previously known rotation-invariant web bases can be unified in our framework of hourglass plabic graphs.</description>
