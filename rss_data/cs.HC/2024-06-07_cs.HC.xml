      <title>Why is "Problems" Predictive of Positive Sentiment? A Case Study of Explaining Unintuitive Features in Sentiment Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) algorithms aim to help users understand how a machine learning model makes predictions. To this end, many approaches explain which input features are most predictive of a target label. However, such explanations can still be puzzling to users (e.g., in product reviews, the word "problems" is predictive of positive sentiment). If left unexplained, puzzling explanations can have negative impacts. Explaining unintuitive associations between an input feature and a target label is an underexplored area in XAI research. We take an initial effort in this direction using unintuitive associations learned by sentiment classifiers as a case study. We propose approaches for (1) automatically detecting associations that can appear unintuitive to users and (2) generating explanations to help users understand why an unintuitive feature is predictive. Results from a crowdsourced study (N=300) found that our proposed approaches can effectively detect and explain predictive but unintuitive features in sentiment classification.</description>

      <title>VisLTR: Visualization-in-the-Loop Table Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Table reasoning transforms user requirements into corresponding answers according to the provided table, which is often integrated with natural language interfaces for lay users to explore tabular data effortlessly. Recent research exploits large language models to facilitate table reasoning, by transforming vague user requirements into structured query languages (SQLs). However, these SQL-based approaches often overlook changes in data patterns, suffer from LLM drift, and limit exploration to only text queries. To this end, VisLTR is designed as a visualization-in-the-loop table reasoning framework that leverages visualizations as a proxy to provide concise data representations, capture interesting data patterns, and support cross-modal analysis. We describe VisLTR as a process consisting of four major modules: 1) visualization alignment that utilizes large vision-language models to align visualizations across various modalities, including chart, text, and sketch; 2) visualization referencing that decomposes a table into multifaceted visualization references that comprehensively represent the table; 3) visualization pruning that incorporates data and retrieval pruning to excise visualization references with poor information and enhance retrieval efficiency; and 4) visualization interaction that offers an interactive visual interface with multi-modal interactions for user-friendly table reasoning. Quantitative evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the alignment model in cross-modal visualization pairings. We further demonstrate applications of the framework on various table reasoning tasks such as table summarization and pattern detection.</description>

      <title>POEM: Interactive Prompt Optimization for Enhancing Multimodal Reasoning of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive abilities for multimodal content comprehension and reasoning with proper prompting in zero- or few-shot settings. Despite the proliferation of interactive systems developed to support prompt engineering for LLMs across various tasks, most have primarily focused on textual or visual inputs, thus neglecting the complex interplay between modalities within multimodal inputs. This oversight hinders the development of effective prompts that guide model multimodal reasoning processes by fully exploiting the rich context provided by multiple modalities. In this paper, we present POEM, a visual analytics system to facilitate efficient prompt engineering for enhancing the multimodal reasoning performance of LLMs. The system enables users to explore the interaction patterns across modalities at varying levels of detail for a comprehensive understanding of the multimodal knowledge elicited by various prompts. Through diverse recommendations of demonstration examples and instructional principles, POEM supports users in iteratively crafting and refining prompts to better align and enhance model knowledge with human insights. The effectiveness and efficiency of our system are validated through two case studies and interviews with experts.</description>

      <title>Exploring Topic Modelling of User Reviews as a Monitoring Mechanism for Emergent Issues Within Social VR Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Users of social virtual reality (VR) platforms often use user reviews to document incidents of witnessed and/or experienced user harassment. However, at present, research has yet to be explore utilising this data as a monitoring mechanism to identify emergent issues within social VR communities. Such a system would be of much benefit to developers and researchers as it would enable the automatic identification of emergent issues as they occur, provide a means of longitudinally analysing harassment, and reduce the reliance on alternative, high cost, monitoring methodologies, e.g. observation or interview studies. To contribute towards the development of such a system, we collected approximately 40,000 Rec Room user reviews from the Steam storefront. We then analysed our dataset's sentiment, word/term frequencies, and conducted a topic modelling analysis of the negative reviews detected in our dataset. We report our approach was capable of longitudinally monitoring changes in review sentiment and identifying high level themes related to types of harassment known to occur in social VR platforms.</description>

      <title>Watching Popular Musicians Learn by Ear: A Hypothesis-Generating Study of Human-Recording Interactions in YouTube Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Popular musicians often learn music by ear. It is unclear what role technology plays for those with experience at this task. In search of opportunities for the development of novel human-recording interactions, we analyze 18 YouTube videos depicting real-world examples of by-ear learning, and discuss why, during this preliminary phase of research, online videos are appropriate data. From our observations we generate hypotheses that can inform future work. For example, a musician's scope of learning may influence what technological interactions would help them, they could benefit from tools that accommodate their working memory, and transcription does not appear to play a key role in ear learning. Based on these findings, we pose a number of research questions, and discuss their methodological considerations to guide future study.</description>

      <title>UltraPINK -- New possibilities to explore Self-Organizing Kohonen Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised learning algorithms like self-organizing Kohonen maps are a promising approach to gain an overview among massive datasets. With UltraPINK, researchers can train, inspect, and explore self-organizing maps, whereby the toolbox of interaction possibilities grows continually. Key feature of UltraPINK is the consideration of versality in astronomical data. By keeping the operations as abstract as possible and using design patterns meant for abstract usage, we ensure that data is compatible with UltraPINK, regardless of its type, formatting, or origin. Future work on the application will keep extending the catalogue of exploration tools and the interfaces towards other established applications to process astronomical data. Ultimatively, we aim towards a solid infrastructure for data analysis in astronomy.</description>

      <title>The 3D-PC: a benchmark for visual perspective taking in humans and machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual perspective taking (VPT) is the ability to perceive and reason about the perspectives of others. It is an essential feature of human intelligence, which develops over the first decade of life and requires an ability to process the 3D structure of visual scenes. A growing number of reports have indicated that deep neural networks (DNNs) become capable of analyzing 3D scenes after training on large image datasets. We investigated if this emergent ability for 3D analysis in DNNs is sufficient for VPT with the 3D perception challenge (3D-PC): a novel benchmark for 3D perception in humans and DNNs. The 3D-PC is comprised of three 3D-analysis tasks posed within natural scene images: 1. a simple test of object depth order, 2. a basic VPT task (VPT-basic), and 3. another version of VPT (VPT-Strategy) designed to limit the effectiveness of "shortcut" visual strategies. We tested human participants (N=33) and linearly probed or text-prompted over 300 DNNs on the challenge and found that nearly all of the DNNs approached or exceeded human accuracy in analyzing object depth order. Surprisingly, DNN accuracy on this task correlated with their object recognition performance. In contrast, there was an extraordinary gap between DNNs and humans on VPT-basic. Humans were nearly perfect, whereas most DNNs were near chance. Fine-tuning DNNs on VPT-basic brought them close to human performance, but they, unlike humans, dropped back to chance when tested on VPT-perturb. Our challenge demonstrates that the training routines and architectures of today's DNNs are well-suited for learning basic 3D properties of scenes and objects but are ill-suited for reasoning about these properties like humans do. We release our 3D-PC datasets and code to help bridge this gap in 3D perception between humans and machines.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Similarities and Divergences in Conversational Tones in Humans and LLMs by Sampling with People</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conversational tones -- the manners and attitudes in which speakers communicate -- are essential to effective communication. Amidst the increasing popularization of Large Language Models (LLMs) over recent years, it becomes necessary to characterize the divergences in their conversational tones relative to humans. However, existing investigations of conversational modalities rely on pre-existing taxonomies or text corpora, which suffer from experimenter bias and may not be representative of real-world distributions for the studies' psycholinguistic domains. Inspired by methods from cognitive science, we propose an iterative method for simultaneously eliciting conversational tones and sentences, where participants alternate between two tasks: (1) one participant identifies the tone of a given sentence and (2) a different participant generates a sentence based on that tone. We run 100 iterations of this process with human participants and GPT-4, then obtain a dataset of sentences and frequent conversational tones. In an additional experiment, humans and GPT-4 annotated all sentences with all tones. With data from 1,339 human participants, 33,370 human judgments, and 29,900 GPT-4 queries, we show how our approach can be used to create an interpretable geometric representation of relations between conversational tones in humans and GPT-4. This work demonstrates how combining ideas from machine learning and cognitive science can address challenges in human-computer interactions.</description>

      <title>Characterising the Creative Process in Humans and Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models appear quite creative, often performing on par with the average human on creative tasks. However, research on LLM creativity has focused solely on \textit{products}, with little attention on the creative \textit{process}. Process analyses of human creativity often require hand-coded categories or exploit response times, which do not apply to LLMs. We provide an automated method to characterise how humans and LLMs explore semantic spaces on the Alternate Uses Task, and contrast with behaviour in a Verbal Fluency Task. We use sentence embeddings to identify response categories and compute semantic similarities, which we use to generate jump profiles. Our results corroborate earlier work in humans reporting both persistent (deep search in few semantic spaces) and flexible (broad search across multiple semantic spaces) pathways to creativity, where both pathways lead to similar creativity scores. LLMs were found to be biased towards either persistent or flexible paths, that varied across tasks. Though LLMs as a population match human profiles, their relationship with creativity is different, where the more flexible models score higher on creativity. Our dataset and scripts are available on \href{https://github.com/surabhisnath/Creative_Process}{GitHub}.</description>

      <title>Past, Present, and Future of Citation Practices in HCI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Science is a complex system comprised of many scientists who individually make collective decisions that, due to the size and nature of the academic system, largely do not affect the system as a whole. However, certain decisions at the meso-level of research communities, such as the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) community, may result in deep and long-lasting behavioral changes in scientists. In this article, we provide evidence on how a change in editorial policies introduced at the ACM CHI Conference in 2016 launched the CHI community on an expansive path, denoted by a year-by-year increase in the mean number of references included in CHI articles. If this near-linear trend continues undisrupted, an article in CHI 2030 will include on average almost 130 references. Our meta-research provides insights into how the nature and meaning of citation practices in HCI have changed, influenced by factors such as digital accessibility of resources and academic pressures. The observed trend towards more citations reflects a citation culture where quantity is prioritized over quality, contributing to both author and peer reviewer fatigue. This article underscores the value of meta-research for research communities and the profound impact that meso-level policy adjustments have on the evolution of scientific fields and disciplines, urging stakeholders to carefully consider the broader implications of such changes.</description>

      <title>ArtWhisperer: A Dataset for Characterizing Human-AI Interactions in Artistic Creations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08141v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As generative AI becomes more prevalent, it is important to study how human users interact with such models. In this work, we investigate how people use text-to-image models to generate desired target images. To study this interaction, we created ArtWhisperer, an online game where users are given a target image and are tasked with iteratively finding a prompt that creates a similar-looking image as the target. Through this game, we recorded over 50,000 human-AI interactions; each interaction corresponds to one text prompt created by a user and the corresponding generated image. The majority of these are repeated interactions where a user iterates to find the best prompt for their target image, making this a unique sequential dataset for studying human-AI collaborations. In an initial analysis of this dataset, we identify several characteristics of prompt interactions and user strategies. People submit diverse prompts and are able to discover a variety of text descriptions that generate similar images. Interestingly, prompt diversity does not decrease as users find better prompts. We further propose a new metric to quantify the steerability of AI using our dataset. We define steerability as the expected number of interactions required to adequately complete a task. We estimate this value by fitting a Markov chain for each target task and calculating the expected time to reach an adequate score in the Markov chain. We quantify and compare AI steerability across different types of target images and two different models, finding that images of cities and natural world images are more steerable than artistic and fantasy images. These findings provide insights into human-AI interaction behavior, present a concrete method of assessing AI steerability, and demonstrate the general utility of the ArtWhisperer dataset.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Large Language Models for Health-related Queries with Presuppositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As corporations rush to integrate large language models (LLMs) to their search offerings, it is critical that they provide factually accurate information that is robust to any presuppositions that a user may express. In this work, we introduce UPHILL, a dataset consisting of health-related queries with varying degrees of presuppositions. Using UPHILL, we evaluate the factual accuracy and consistency of InstructGPT, ChatGPT, and BingChat models. We find that while model responses rarely disagree with true health claims (posed as questions), they often fail to challenge false claims: responses from InstructGPT agree with 32% of the false claims, ChatGPT 26% and BingChat 23%. As we increase the extent of presupposition in input queries, the responses from InstructGPT and ChatGPT agree with the claim considerably more often, regardless of its veracity. Responses from BingChat, which rely on retrieved webpages, are not as susceptible. Given the moderate factual accuracy, and the inability of models to consistently correct false assumptions, our work calls for a careful assessment of current LLMs for use in high-stakes scenarios.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we present ThermoHands, a new benchmark for thermal image-based egocentric 3D hand pose estimation, aimed at overcoming challenges like varying lighting conditions and obstructions (e.g., handwear). The benchmark includes a multi-view and multi-spectral dataset collected from 28 subjects performing hand-object and hand-virtual interactions under diverse scenarios, accurately annotated with 3D hand poses through an automated process. We introduce a new baseline method, TherFormer, utilizing dual transformer modules for effective egocentric 3D hand pose estimation in thermal imagery. Our experimental results highlight TherFormer's leading performance and affirm thermal imaging's effectiveness in enabling robust 3D hand pose estimation in adverse conditions.</description>

      <title>Human Stress Response and Perceived Safety during Encounters with Quadruped Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the rise of mobile robot deployments in home and work settings, perceived safety of users and bystanders is understudied in the human-robot interaction (HRI) literature. To address this, we present a study designed to identify elements of a human-robot encounter that correlate with observed stress response. Stress is a key component of perceived safety and is strongly associated with human physiological response. In this study a Boston Dynamics Spot and a Unitree Go1 navigate autonomously through a shared environment occupied by human participants wearing multimodal physiological sensors to track their electrocardiography (ECG) and electrodermal activity (EDA). The encounters are varied through several trials and participants self-rate their stress levels after each encounter. The study resulted in a multidimensional dataset archiving various objective and subjective aspects of a human-robot encounter, containing insights for understanding perceived safety in such encounters. To this end, acute stress responses were decoded from the human participants' ECG and EDA and compared across different human-robot encounter conditions. Statistical analysis of data indicate that on average (1) participants feel more stress during encounters compared to baselines, (2) participants feel more stress encountering multiple robots compared to a single robot and (3) participants stress increases during navigation behavior compared with search behavior.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Workflow for Multimodal Fine-Grained Training Assistants Towards Mixed Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) agents have emerged as promising protocols for automatically understanding the language-based environment, particularly with the exponential development of large language models (LLMs). However, a fine-grained, comprehensive understanding of multimodal environments remains under-explored. This work designs an autonomous workflow tailored for integrating AI agents seamlessly into extended reality (XR) applications for fine-grained training. We present a demonstration of a multimodal fine-grained training assistant for LEGO brick assembly in a pilot XR environment. Specifically, we design a cerebral language agent that integrates LLM with memory, planning, and interaction with XR tools and a vision-language agent, enabling agents to decide their actions based on past experiences. Furthermore, we introduce LEGO-MRTA, a multimodal fine-grained assembly dialogue dataset synthesized automatically in the workflow served by a commercial LLM. This dataset comprises multimodal instruction manuals, conversations, XR responses, and vision question answering. Last, we present several prevailing open-resource LLMs as benchmarks, assessing their performance with and without fine-tuning on the proposed dataset. We anticipate that the broader impact of this workflow will advance the development of smarter assistants for seamless user interaction in XR environments, fostering research in both AI and HCI communities.</description>

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models are increasingly used in various applications, from recommendation systems in e-commerce to diagnosis prediction in healthcare. In this paper, we present a novel dynamic framework for thinking about the deployment of ML models in a performative, human-ML collaborative system. In our framework, the introduction of ML recommendations changes the data generating process of human decisions, which are only a proxy to the ground truth and which are then used to train future versions of the model. We show that this dynamic process in principle can converge to different stable points, i.e. where the ML model and the Human+ML system have the same performance. Some of these stable points are suboptimal with respect to the actual ground truth. We conduct an empirical user study with 1,408 participants to showcase this process. In the study, humans solve instances of the knapsack problem with the help of machine learning predictions. This is an ideal setting because we can see how ML models learn to imitate human decisions and how this learning process converges to a stable point. We find that for many levels of ML performance, humans can improve the ML predictions to dynamically reach an equilibrium performance that is around 92% of the maximum knapsack value. We also find that the equilibrium performance could be even higher if humans rationally followed the ML recommendations. Finally, we test whether monetary incentives can increase the quality of human decisions, but we fail to find any positive effect. Our results have practical implications for the deployment of ML models in contexts where human decisions may deviate from the indisputable ground truth.</description>
