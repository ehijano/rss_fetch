      <title>Coexistence of Topological Anderson Insulator and Multifractal Critical Phase in a Non-Hermitian Quasicrystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay of topology, disorder, and non-Hermiticity gives rise to phenomena beyond the conventional classification of quantum phases. We propose a one-dimensional non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with quasiperiodically modulated nonreciprocal intracell hopping. We show that quasiperiodic modulation can substantially enhance topological robustness and, remarkably, induce a non-Hermitian topological Anderson insulator (TAI) phase. Beyond the topological transition, increasing nonreciprocity drives a cascade of localization transitions in which all bulk eigenstates evolve from extended to multifractal critical and ultimately to localized states. Strikingly, the extended-to-critical transition coincides exactly with a real-complex spectral transition. We establish complete phase diagrams and derive exact analytical boundaries for both topological and localization transitions, uncovering an unanticipated coexistence of TAI and multifractal critical phases. Finally, we propose a feasible implementation in topolectrical circuits. Our results reveal a new paradigm for the cooperative effects of topology, quasiperiodicity, and non-Hermiticity.</description>

      <title>Phonon Echo from Multi-Level Systems and Many-Body Interactions in Low-Temperature Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At low temperatures, glasses exhibit distinctive properties compared to crystalline solids. A notable example is the phonon echo, a phenomenon that motivated the two-level-system (TLS) model. This model has successfully explained many universal anomalies in glasses. Here, we extend the TLS framework to a multi-level system and show that phonon echoes persist when nonlinear energy structures and disorder are included. By incorporating virtual phonon exchange, we introduce many-body interactions between these multi-level systems, leading to nonlinear eigen-energies that enhance the echo signal. Meanwhile, finite-temperature thermal fluctuations cause dephasing, resulting in a decay of echo amplitude over time. The analytical and numerical results are consistent across semi-classical and quantum regimes. Our work validates the multi-level-system model and underscores the role of many-body interactions in low-temperature glassy dynamics.</description>

      <title>Antiferromagnetic Barkhausen noise induced by weak random-field disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study numerically investigates magnetisation reversal processes driven by an external magnetic field in three-dimensional antiferromagnetic spin models with weak random field disorder. Considering an extremely weak disorder and low temperature, we observe a step-wise hysteresis loop and the appearance of short magnetisation bursts of a characteristic triangular shape; the number of bursts increases with disorder, indicative of Barkhausen-type noise. These phenomena are attributed to the simultaneous reversal at a given external field of segments composed of spins with identical neighbourhoods. A local random field orients one or more spin neighbours, resulting in small, ferromagnetic-like clusters distributed throughout the system. As disorder increases, these clusters may merge to form a labyrinthine structure within the antiferromagnetic background, facilitating brief avalanche propagation. The results demonstrate that, compared with familiar random-field ferromagnets, the observed antiferromagnetic Barkhausen noise and the related avalanche sequence have a profoundly different structure, organised into peaks associated with the transition between magnetisation plateaus. They exhibit prominent cyclical trends and disorder-dependent multifractal fluctuations, with the singularity spectrum quantifying the degree of disorder. The activity avalanches exhibit scale invariance resembling that recently found in experiments with disordered ferr\textit{i}magnets and martensites, as well as in quantum Barkhausen noise, which are associated with active geometric regions rather than individual-spin dynamics. The observed scaling behaviour is interpreted in terms of self-organised critical dynamics.</description>

      <title>Drift-Diffusion Matching: Embedding dynamics in latent manifolds of asymmetric neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) provide a theoretical framework for understanding computation in biological neural circuits, yet classical results, such as Hopfield's model of associative memory, rely on symmetric connectivity that restricts network dynamics to gradient-like flows. In contrast, biological networks support rich time-dependent behaviour facilitated by their asymmetry. Here we introduce a general framework, which we term drift-diffusion matching, for training continuous-time RNNs to represent arbitrary stochastic dynamical systems within a low-dimensional latent subspace. Allowing asymmetric connectivity, we show that RNNs can faithfully embed the drift and diffusion of a given stochastic differential equation, including nonlinear and nonequilibrium dynamics such as chaotic attractors. As an application, we construct RNN realisations of stochastic systems that transiently explore various attractors through both input-driven switching and autonomous transitions driven by nonequilibrium currents, which we interpret as models of associative and sequential (episodic) memory. To elucidate how these dynamics are encoded in the network, we introduce decompositions of the RNN based on its asymmetric connectivity and its time-irreversibility. Our results extend attractor neural network theory beyond equilibrium, showing that asymmetric neural populations can implement a broad class of dynamical computations within low-dimensional manifolds, unifying ideas from associative memory, nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, and neural computation.</description>

      <title>From Classical to Quantum: Extending Prometheus for Unsupervised Discovery of Phase Transitions in Three Dimensions and Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the Prometheus framework for unsupervised phase transition discovery from 2D classical systems to 3D classical and quantum many-body systems, addressing scalability in higher dimensions and generalization to quantum fluctuations. For the 3D Ising model ($L \leq 32$), the framework detects the critical temperature within 0.01\% of literature values ($T_c/J = 4.511 \pm 0.005$) and extracts critical exponents with $\geq 70\%$ accuracy ($\beta = 0.328 \pm 0.015$, $\gamma = 1.24 \pm 0.06$, $\nu = 0.632 \pm 0.025$), correctly identifying the 3D Ising universality class via $\chi^2$ comparison ($p = 0.72$) without analytical guidance. For quantum systems, we developed quantum-aware VAE (Q-VAE) architectures using complex-valued wavefunctions and fidelity-based loss. Applied to the transverse field Ising model, we achieve 2\% accuracy in quantum critical point detection ($h_c/J = 1.00 \pm 0.02$) and successfully discover ground state magnetization as the order parameter ($r = 0.97$). Notably, for the disordered transverse field Ising model, we detect exotic infinite-randomness criticality characterized by activated dynamical scaling $\ln \xi \sim |h - h_c|^{-\psi}$, extracting a tunneling exponent $\psi = 0.48 \pm 0.08$ consistent with theoretical predictions ($\psi = 0.5$). This demonstrates that unsupervised learning can identify qualitatively different types of critical behavior, not just locate critical points. Our systematic validation across classical thermal transitions ($T = 0$ to $T &gt; 0$) and quantum phase transitions ($T = 0$, varying $h$) establishes that VAE-based discovery generalizes across fundamentally different physical domains, providing robust tools for exploring phase diagrams where analytical solutions are unavailable.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal noise stabilizes unbounded diversity in strongly-competitive communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical ecological models predict that large, diverse communities should be unstable, presenting a central challenge to explaining the stable biodiversity seen in nature. We revisit this long-standing problem by extending the generalized Lotka-Volterra model to include both spatial structure and environmental fluctuations across space and time. We find that neither space nor environmental noise alone can resolve the tension between diversity and stability, but that their combined effects permit arbitrarily many species to stably coexist despite strongly disordered competitive interactions. We analytically characterize the noise-induced transition to coexistence, showing that spatiotemporal noise drives an anomalous scaling of abundance fluctuations, known empirically as Taylor's law. At the community level, this manifests as an effective sublinear self-inhibition that renders the community stable and asymptotically neutral in the high-diversity limit. Spatiotemporal noise thus provides a novel resolution to the diversity-stability paradox and a generic mechanism by which complex communities can persist.</description>

      <title>NISQ-compatible quantum cryptography based on Parrondo dynamics in discrete-time quantum walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compatibility with noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices is crucial for the realistic implementation of quantum cryptographic protocols. We investigate a cryptographic scheme based on discrete-time quantum walks (DTQWs) on cyclic graphs that exploits Parrondo dynamics, wherein periodic evolution emerges from a deterministic sequence of individually chaotic coin operators. We construct an explicit quantum circuit realization tailored to NISQ architectures and analyze its performance through numerical simulations in Qiskit under both ideal and noisy conditions. Protocol performance is quantified using probability distributions, Hellinger fidelity, and total variation distance. To assess security at the circuit level, we model intercept-resend and man-in-the-middle attacks and evaluate the resulting quantum bit error rate. In the absence of adversarial intervention, the protocol enables reliable message recovery, whereas eavesdropping induces characteristic disturbances that disrupt the periodic reconstruction mechanism. We further examine hardware feasibility on contemporary NISQ processors, specifically $ibm\_torino$, incorporating qubit connectivity and state-transfer constraints into the circuit design. Our analysis demonstrates that communication between spatially separated logical modules increases circuit depth via SWAP operations, leading to cumulative noise effects. By exploring hybrid state-transfer strategies, we show that qubit selection and connectivity play a decisive role in determining fidelity and overall protocol performance, highlighting hardware-dependent trade-offs in NISQ implementations.</description>

      <title>Erratic Liouvillian Skin Localization and Subdiffusive Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems with globally reciprocal couplings -- such as the Hatano-Nelson model with stochastic imaginary gauge fields -- avoid the conventional non-Hermitian skin effect, displaying erratic bulk localization while retaining ballistic transport. An open question is whether similar behavior arises when non-reciprocity originates at the Liouvillian level rather than from an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian obtained via post-selection. Here we investigate this scenario in a lattice model with globally reciprocal Liouvillian dynamics and locally asymmetric incoherent hopping, a disordered setting in which Liouvillian-specific effects have remained largely unexplored. While the steady state again shows disorder-dependent, erratic localization without boundary accumulation, we find that global reciprocity in the Liouvillian does not protect transport. Instead, in the regime dominated by incoherent hopping, excitations spread via Sinai-type subdiffusion, dramatically slower than the ordinary diffusion found in symmetric stochastic lattices. Our results reveal a fundamental distinction between globally reciprocal Hamiltonian and Liouvillian dynamics: global reciprocity suppresses the skin effect in both cases, but only in Liouvillian dynamics can it coexist with ultra-slow, disorder-induced subdiffusive transport.</description>

      <title>Thermal Min-Max Games: Unifying Bounded Rationality and Typical-Case Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strategic-form min-max game theory examines the existence, multiplicity, selection of equilibria, and the worst-case computational complexity under perfect rationality. However, in many applications, games are drawn from an ensemble, and players exhibit bounded rationality. We introduce thermal min-max games, a thermodynamic relaxation that unifies bounded and perfect rationality by assigning each player a temperature to regulate their rationality level. To analyze typical behavior in the large-strategy limit, we develop a nested replica framework for this relaxation. This theory provides tractable predictions for typical equilibrium values and mixed-strategy statistics as functions of rationality strength, strategy-count aspect ratio, and payoff randomness. Numerical experiments demonstrate that these asymptotic predictions accurately align with the equilibrium of finite games of moderate size.</description>

      <title>Symmetry in language statistics shapes the geometry of model representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although learned representations underlie neural networks' success, their fundamental properties remain poorly understood. A striking example is the emergence of simple geometric structures in LLM representations: for example, calendar months organize into a circle, years form a smooth one-dimensional manifold, and cities' latitudes and longitudes can be decoded by a linear probe. We show that the statistics of language exhibit a translation symmetry -- e.g., the co-occurrence probability of two months depends only on the time interval between them -- and we prove that the latter governs the aforementioned geometric structures in high-dimensional word embedding models. Moreover, we find that these structures persist even when the co-occurrence statistics are strongly perturbed (for example, by removing all sentences in which two months appear together) and at moderate embedding dimension. We show that this robustness naturally emerges if the co-occurrence statistics are collectively controlled by an underlying continuous latent variable. We empirically validate this theoretical framework in word embedding models, text embedding models, and large language models.</description>

      <title>The fundamental localization phases in quasiperiodic systems: A unified framework and exact results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24380v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The disordered quantum systems host three classes of quantum states, the extended, localized, and critical, which bring up seven distinct fundamental phases in nature: three pure phases and four coexisting ones with mobility edges, yet a unified theory built on universal mechanism and full realization of all these phases has not been developed. Here we propose a unified framework based on a spinful quasiperiodic (QP) system which realizes all the fundamental localization phases, with the exact and universal results being obtained for their characterization. First, we show that the pure phases are obtained when the chiral(-like) symmetry preserves in the proposed spinful QP model, giving a criterion for emergence of the pure phases and otherwise the coexisting ones. Further, we uncover a novel mechanism for the critical states that their emergence is protected by the generalized incommensurate matrix element zeros in the spinful QP model, which considerably broadens rigorous realizations of the exotic critical states. We then show criteria of exact solvability for the present spinful QP system, with which we construct various exactly solvable models for all distinct localization phases. In particular, we propose two novel models, dubbed spin-selective QP lattice model and QP optical Raman lattice model, to achieve all basic types of mobility edges and all the seven fundamental phases of Anderson localization physics, respectively. The experimental scheme is proposed and studied in detail to realize these models with high feasibility. This study establishes a complete and profound theoretical framework which enables an in-depth exploration of the broad classes of all fundamental localization phenomena in QP systems, and offers key insights for constructing their exactly solvable models with experimental feasibility.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Chimeras States in One-dimensional Ising model with Long-Range Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we examine the conditions for the emergence of chimera-like states in Ising systems. We study an Ising chain with periodic boundaries in contact with a thermal bath at temperature T, that induces stochastic changes in spin variables. To capture the non-locality needed for chimera formation, we introduce a model setup with non-local diffusion of spin values through the whole system. More precisely, diffusion is modeled through spin-exchange interactions between units up to a distance R, using Kawasaki dynamics. This setup mimics, e.g., neural media, as the brain, in the presence of electrical (diffusive) interactions. We explored the influence of such non-local dynamics on the emergence of complex spatiotemporal synchronization patterns of activity. Depending on system parameters we report here for the first time chimera-like states in the Ising model, characterized by relatively stable moving domains of spins with different local magnetization. We analyzed the system at T=0, both analytically and via simulations and computed the system's phase diagram, revealing rich behavior: regions with only chimeras, coexistence of chimeras and stable domains, and metastable chimeras that decay into uniform stable domains. This study offers fundamental insights into how coherent and incoherent synchronization patterns can arise in complex networked systems as it is, e.g., the brain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17364v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) using an annealing-based approach involves solving generalized eigenvalue problems. Discretizing a PDE yields a system of linear equations (SLE). Solving an SLE can be formulated as a general eigenvalue problem, which can be transformed into an optimization problem with an objective function given by a generalized Rayleigh quotient. The proposed algorithm requires iterative computations. However, it enables efficient annealing-based computation of eigenvectors to arbitrary precision without increasing the number of variables. Investigations using simulated annealing demonstrate how the number of iterations scales with system size and annealing time. Computational performance depends on system size, annealing time, and problem characteristics.</description>

      <title>Generalized Loschmidt echo and information scrambling in open systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum information scrambling, typically explored in closed quantum systems, describes the spread of initially localized information throughout a system and can be quantified by measures such as the Loschmidt echo (LE) and out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC). In this paper, we explore information scrambling in the presence of dissipation by generalizing the concepts of LE and OTOC to open quantum systems governed by Lindblad dynamics. We investigate the universal dynamics of the generalized LE across regimes of weak and strong dissipation. In the weak dissipation regime, we identify a universal structure, while in the strong dissipation regime, we observe a distinctive two-local-minima structure, which we interpret through an analysis of the Lindblad spectrum. Furthermore, we establish connections between the thermal averages of LE and OTOC and prove a general relation between OTOC and R\'enyi entropy in open systems. Finally, we propose an experimental protocol for measuring OTOC in open systems. These findings provide deeper insights into information scrambling under dissipation and pave the way for experimental studies in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>How to Train Your Resistive Network: Generalized Equilibrium Propagation and Analytical Learning</title>

Abstract: Machine learning is a powerful method of extracting meaning from data; unfortunately, current digital hardware is extremely energy-intensive. There is interest in an alternative analog computing implementation that could match the performance of traditional machine learning while being significantly more energy-efficient. However, it remains unclear how to train such analog computing systems while adhering to locality constraints imposed by the physical (as opposed to digital) nature of these systems. Local learning algorithms such as Equilibrium Propagation and Coupled Learning have been proposed to address this issue. In this paper, we develop an algorithm to exactly calculate gradients using a graph theoretic and analytical framework for Kirchhoff's laws. We also introduce Generalized Equilibrium Propagation, a framework encompassing a broad class of Hebbian learning algorithms, including Coupled Learning and Equilibrium Propagation, and show how our algorithm compares. We demonstrate our algorithm using numerical simulations and show that we can train resistor networks without the need for a replica or readout over all resistors, only at the output layer. We also show that under the analytical gradient approach, it is possible to update only a subset of the resistance values without a strong degradation in performance.</description>

      <title>High-Dimensional Limit of Stochastic Gradient Flow via Dynamical Mean-Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06320</link>

Abstract: Modern machine learning models are typically trained via multi-pass stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with small batch sizes, and understanding their dynamics in high dimensions is of great interest. However, an analytical framework for describing the high-dimensional asymptotic behavior of multi-pass SGD with small batch sizes for nonlinear models is currently missing. In this study, we address this gap by analyzing the high-dimensional dynamics of a stochastic differential equation called a \emph{stochastic gradient flow} (SGF), which approximates multi-pass SGD in this regime. In the limit where the number of data samples $n$ and the dimension $d$ grow proportionally, we derive a closed system of low-dimensional and continuous-time equations and prove that it characterizes the asymptotic distribution of the SGF parameters. Our theory is based on the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) and is applicable to a wide range of models encompassing generalized linear models and two-layer neural networks. We further show that the resulting DMFT equations recover several existing high-dimensional descriptions of SGD dynamics as special cases, thereby providing a unifying perspective on prior frameworks such as online SGD and high-dimensional linear regression. Our proof builds on the existing DMFT technique for gradient flow and extends it to handle the stochasticity in SGF using tools from stochastic calculus.</description>
