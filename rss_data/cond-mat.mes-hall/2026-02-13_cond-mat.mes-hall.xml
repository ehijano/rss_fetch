      <title>Jamming-controlled stochasticity in metal-insulator switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and controlling phase transitions is a fundamental part of physics and has been central to many technological revolutions, from steam engines to field-effect transistors. At present, there is strong interest in materials with strongly coupled structural and electronic phase transitions, which hold promise for energy-efficient technologies. Utilizing a structural phase transition and controlling its plasticity naturally leads to built-in memory, a key feature for emulating neurons and synapses in neuromorphic technologies. Here, $\textit{operando}$ Bragg X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy is used to study the evolution of the nano-domain distribution at the micron-scale in neuromorphic devices made from the archetypal Mott insulator vanadium dioxide. It is found that after electrical switching, slow nano-domain reconfiguration occurs on timescales of thousands of seconds and that the domains undergo a jamming transition, offering control over switching stochasticity at the micron scale. More precisely, repetitive above-threshold currents plastically drive the system into a jammed/glassy state where switching becomes deterministic, while sub-threshold currents erase the short-term memory contained in the nano-domain distribution, recovering stochastic switching, thus offering a path for in-device learning. The results illustrate the importance of studying the nanoscale physics associated with phase transitions in strongly correlated materials, even for macroscopic devices, and offer guidance for future device operation schemes.</description>

      <title>When Blinking Helps: Suppressed Biexciton Emission in Lead Halide Perovskite Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blinking and multiphoton emission in metal halide perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) limit their use as single-photon quantum emitters. Conventional models distinguish between trion-related A-type blinking and defect-assisted BC-type blinking, both expected to degrade single-photon purity in a dark state. Here, time-resolved spectroscopy on individual PQDs reveals a qualitatively different regime in which low emitting dark states exhibit higher single-photon purity than bright states. For those PQDs state-resolved $g^{(2)}(\tau)$ analysis shows that the exciton photoluminescence quantum yield decreases by a factor of $\sim 8$, while the biexciton one is suppressed by a factor of $\sim 10$. This leads to a moderate improvement of single-photon purity with $g^{(2)}_0$ decreased from 0.155 to 0.120. In contrast, PQDs with fluorescence lifetime--intensity distribution patterns characteristic for A-type blinking, display the expected increase of $g^{(2)}_0$ in charged, trion-dominated states. To explain the observed improvement of single-photon purity of low-emitting dark states, we propose a self-trapped-exciton (STE) mechanism that selectively blocks biexciton formation by diverting hot excitons into long-lived, weakly emissive STE configurations. This STE-mediated blinking channel explains why certain low-emitting states improve, rather than degrade, single-photon purity and suggests a lattice-driven route to perovskite quantum emitters with intrinsically suppressed multiphoton events.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Expansion Method for few-body states in two-dimensional materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of trions in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) monolayers using the Gaussian Expansion Method (GEM) adapted to two-dimensional systems. Excitons and trions in monolayer TMDCs with the chemical composition MX$_2$ in the 2H phase are studied systematically. We computed the associated exciton and trion binding energies. We find in addition to the known $J = 0$ trion the existence of a bound state with orbital angular momentum $J = 1$. The results for $J = 0$ are benchmarked against existing calculations from the Stochastic Variational Method (SVM) and Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC). Furthermore, we analyze the trion internal structure and geometry through their probability density distributions, accounting for the effects of different material shows that GEM -- widely used in studies of strongly interacting few-body systems -- is well adapted to allow comprehensive and computationally efficient investigations of trions and potentially other weakly bound few-body states in layered materials. In addition, we systematically exploit the effect of strain and dieletric environment in the $J = 1$ trion predictions, illustrated for the MoS$_2$ monolayer example.</description>

      <title>Optical gain in colloidal quantum dots is limited by biexciton absorption, not biexciton recombination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite three decades of experimental study, optical gain in colloidal quantum dots still lacks a microscopic theory capable of explaining gain thresholds approaching one exciton per dot, their size dependence, or the anomalously small effective stimulated-emission cross sections observed across materials. Existing descriptions treat quantum dots as effective two-level systems comprised of an exciton and a biexciton, attributing gain thresholds to biexciton Auger recombination. This assumption is inconsistent with state-resolved optical pumping experiments and basic spectroscopic constraints. Here we present a microscopic theory of optical gain explicitly anchored in the Einstein relations governing absorption and stimulated emission. Within this framework, gain is determined by a spectral balance between stimulated emission from single excitons and excited-state absorption into biexcitonic manifolds, rather than by biexciton lifetimes. Using a spin-boson description of excitons coupled to a lattice bath, we show that gain thresholds and effective gain cross sections are controlled by the interplay of biexciton stabilization and exciton-lattice dressing. The theory unifies disparate materials by quantitatively explaining all longstanding gain phenomenology in CdSe quantum dots and predicts a continuous crossover to effective four-level, near-thresholdless gain in dynamically disordered lattices such as perovskite quantum dots.</description>

      <title>Quantization Mapping on Dirac Dynamics via Voltage-Driven Charge Density in Monolayer Graphene: A Klein Paradox and Entropy-Ruled Wavevector Mechanics Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermodynamics coupled with quantum features on electron and hole dynamics in Dirac materials is quite interesting and crucial for real device applications. The correlation between the formation of electron-hole puddles in nearer to the charge neutrality point (CNP), and the role of disorder is fundamentally important for Dirac transport in graphene systems. Numerous studies on graphene further urge the necessity to find a better descriptor for disorder-charge puddles relation, which directly influences electrical conductivity. In principle, the external bias-driven energy level shift and its relevant density of states (DOS) provide information about the effect of total interactive potential on linear energy dispersion in terms of wavevector, but yet to be well-explored. With this ground, here we map the energy quantization for Dirac materials through the empirical relation of voltage-driven charge density in monolayer graphene, using the differential entropy (h)-ruled wavevector (k) mechanics. For this work, we propose the four postulates which are the key observable descriptions of earlier research reports, to study the precise electronic transport via an entropy-guided wavevector propagation approach, along with the Klein paradox, which pertains to the ultrafast dynamics in the Dirac or quasi-Dirac systems. The introduced h-ruled k and h-ruled N relations generalize the electron dynamics in both the unbounded and potentially bounded Dirac systems. Through the quantization mapping procedure under different voltage-driven potential (U=eV) boundary conditions, the observed energy shift from lower to excited quantum state obeys the relation of N(k)=N(U)^3; here, N(U) is the voltage-driven potential energy contribution factor for the quantum state existence. This study reveals information about the interaction potential-DOS relationship in the Dirac materials.</description>

      <title>Ordered states of undoped AB bilayer graphene: bias induced cascade of transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using mean-field theory, we determine the electronic phase diagram of undoped AB-stacked bilayer graphene in the presence of a transverse electric field. In addition to multiple competing electronic instabilities characterized by excitonic order parameters, our framework incorporates the long-range Coulomb energy associated with interlayer polarization. This long-range interaction plays a crucial role, as it significantly influences both the structure and the relative energies of the competing ordered states. We derive a set of self-consistency equations and solve them both numerically and analytically. Our findings reveal that, as the bias field is varied, the bilayer undergoes a cascade of first-order transitions between several ordered insulating phases for which order-parameter structures are explicitly identified. Some of these phases are characterized by two inequivalent single-particle gaps, whose magnitudes depend on the valley and spin quantum numbers. Field-driven transitions are accompanied by discontinuous and non-monotonic variations of the single-electron gap. We relate our results to Hartree-Fock numerical calculations and to experimental research, including observations of fractional metallic phases that emerge upon doping the bilayer system.</description>

      <title>Phase-Space Topology and Spectral Flow in Screened Magnetized Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological wave phenomena in continuous media are fundamentally challenged by unbounded spectra and the absence of a compact Brillouin zone, which obstruct conventional bulk--interface formulations. We develop a unified phase-space framework for screened magnetized plasma based on a pseudo-Hermitian formulation with a positive-definite metric, enabling a generalized Schr\"odinger description and a Weyl-symbol analysis of the bulk generator. We show that the bulk symbol hosts isolated band degeneracies acting as Berry--Chern monopoles, including a higher-order spin-1 degeneracy with topological charge $+2$ that generically splits into two spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ Weyl points under symmetry breaking. To characterize topology in this noncompact setting, we introduce a strip-gap Chern number associated with finite real-frequency strips of the bulk spectrum, extending band Chern topology to continuum systems. This invariant governs the spectral flow of interface modes induced by spatial variations of the magnetic field and establishes a bulk--interface correspondence at the level of phase-space symbols. By solving the interface eigenvalue problem, we demonstrate that the net spectral flow across the strip gap is determined by the enclosed monopole charge. We further show that this correspondence persists under collisional damping, provided that a finite strip gap remains and no exceptional points enter it. Our results provide a systematic phase-space framework for topological wave transport in continuous media beyond compact-band and idealized Hermitian settings.</description>

      <title>Emergence of charge and spin current in non-Hermitian quantum ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the charge and spin transport in a non-Hermitian ring of electrons subject to an external Zeeman field. By introducing non-Hermiticity through anti-Hermitian hopping in the nearest neighbour bonds, we demonstrate that anti-Hermiticity, along with the applied Zeeman field significantly modify the energy spectrum and strongly influence transport properties. As a result, we obtain that when antiferromagnetic Zeeman field is considered, a finite charge current emerges in both the real and imaginary parts of the current, which are in contrast to the ferromagnetic case where only the imaginary current exist. On the other hand, in both cases, the spin current vanishes. Interestingly, we reveal an emergence and strong enhancement of spin currents under balanced spin population upon introducing quasiperiodicity in the presence of antiferromagnetic ordering. At the same time, the charge current also exhibits substantial enhancement due to quasiperiodic modulation. These results highlight non-Hermitian quantum rings as versatile platforms for unconventional spin-charge transport.</description>

      <title>Emergence of a Helical Metal in Rippled Ultrathin Topological Insulator Sb\textsubscript{2}Te\textsubscript{3} on Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of topological insulators (TIs) with graphene offers a pathway to engineer hybrid quantum states, yet the impact of strain at the 2D limit remains a critical open question. Here, we investigate the structural properties of ultrathin (1 quintuple layer) Sb$_2$Te$_3$ grown on single-layer graphene and, motivated by the structural modulations observed at the TI surface, explore theoretically how such nanoscale corrugations may influence the electronic behavior of the system. Using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (LT-STM), we observe a periodic rippling of the heterostructure with a wavelength of ~$\sim8.7$ nm. Energetic analysis reveals that these ripples are not intrinsic but are driven by strain from the substrate during cooling. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that while the ideal flat heterostructure exhibits a hybridization gap of $\sim40$ meV, the ripple-induced structural modulation closes this gap, restoring a metallic state. This gapless phase is not a trivial metal. By combining an effective moir\'e ladder model with spin-resolved DFT, we find that the proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling is redistributed across a dense manifold of minibands. The resulting ``Helical Metal'' has a complex spin-texture beyond a simple Rashba splitting. Remarkably, while the flat system is effectively spinless in this ultrathin limit due to hybridization, the ripples actively restore the spin polarization. Our findings suggest that rippled TI/graphene heterostructures provide an interesting platform to develop spintronics, where geometric modulation unlocks dense helical states that are inaccessible in the pristine flat limit.</description>

      <title>Melting of quantum Hall Wigner and bubble crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A two-dimensional crystal melts via the proliferation and unbinding of topological defects, yet quantitatively predicting the melting temperature $T_m$ in real systems is challenging. Here we resolve this discrepancy in quantum Hall electron bubble phases by combining Corbino-geometry transport experiment in an ultraclean GaAs/AlGaAs quantum well for Landau levels 2 to 5 with Hartree--Fock elasticity and the full Kosterlitz--Thouless--Halperin--Nelson--Young melting criterion including the finite-temperature renormalization-group calculation. The theoretically obtained $T_m$ quantitatively captures the measured solid-liquid phase transition boundaries across all probed ranges, validating the bubble-crystal interpretation and establishing defect--mediated melting as a predictive framework for strongly interacting electronic solids. This agreement further supports using bulk transport to probe the energetics of topological defects and screening in quantum Hall physics, and the approach is readily extendable to other electronic crystals, including the generalized Wigner crystal in moir\'e Chern bands.</description>

      <title>RING: Rabi oscillations induced by nonresonant geometric drive</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.11979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent control of two-level quantum systems is typically achieved using resonant driving fields, forming the basis for qubit operations. Here, we report a mechanism for inducing complete Rabi oscillations in monochromatically driven two-level quantum systems, when the drive frequency is much larger than the Larmor frequency of the qubit. This effect$\unicode{x2015}$Rabi oscillations induced by nonresonant geometric drive (RING)$\unicode{x2015}$requires that the control field is elliptical, enclosing a nonzero area per cycle. We illustrate the effect with numerical simulations, and provide an analytical understanding via a simple effective Hamiltonian obtained from Floquet theory and perturbation theory. We show that RING enables coherent oscillations without relying on resonant energy exchange, allows for high-pass noise filtering, provides access to non-Abelian phases in finite magnetic fields. We detail a realization in electrically driven spin-orbit qubits and argue that the RING mechanism enables amplification of the Rabi frequency using the same gate voltage amplitudes at higher drive frequencies. Our results broaden the landscape of quantum control techniques, by highlighting a pathway to achieving coherent oscillations under off-resonant driving conditions.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian topology of quantum spin-Hall systems to detect edge-state polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the non-Hermitian topology of multi-terminal transport in a quantum spin-Hall device described by the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model. We show that breaking time-reversal symmetry alone does not imply non-reciprocal transport or a non-Hermitian conductance matrix. Instead, non-Hermitian topology arises only when transport becomes directionally imbalanced. We identify two distinct mechanisms that generate such a response: spin-selective coupling at the contacts and an out-of-plane Zeeman field that unbalances the counter-propagating helical edge modes. We show, for unpolarized leads, that the spin polarization-dependent response to Zeeman fields, provides a transport-based probe of the intrinsic spin polarization of the helical edge states. Moreover, we demonstrate that non-Hermitian skin effect is more sensitive than conductance elements to detect the spin polarization of the edge states. Our results clarify the conditions required for non-Hermitian topology in quantum spin-Hall transport and establish non-Hermitian skin effect as a diagnostic tool for spin-selective coupling and edge-state polarization.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous High-Fidelity Readout and Strong Coupling for a Donor-Based Spin Qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting resonators coupled to solid-state qubits offer a scalable architecture for long-range entangling operations and fast, high-fidelity readout. Realizing this requires low photon-loss rates and qubits with tunable electric dipole moments that couple strongly to the resonator's electric field while maintaining long coherence times. For spin qubits, spin-photon coupling is typically achieved via spin-charge hybridization. However, this introduces a fundamental trade-off: a large spin-charge admixture enhances the coupling strength, which boosts readout and resonator-mediated gate speeds, but exposes the qubit to increased decoherence, thereby increasing the threshold required for strong coupling and limiting the time available for accurate state measurement. This makes it essential to identify optimal operating points for each qubit platform. We address this for the donor-based flip-flop qubit, whose microwave-controllable electron-nuclear spin states make it suitable for coupling to microwave resonators. We demonstrate that, by choosing intermediate tunnel couplings that balance strong interaction with long qubit lifetimes, high-fidelity readout and strong coupling are simultaneously achievable. We also map out the respective charge-photon couplings and photon-loss rates required. Furthermore, we show that experimental constraints on charge-photon coupling and photon loss can be mitigated using squeezed input fields. As similar trade-offs appear in quantum-dot-based qubits, our methods and insights extend naturally to these platforms, offering a potential route toward scalable architectures.</description>

Abstract: Odd-parity magnetism has attracted significant interest for its unconventional spin splitting. However, a concrete microscopic route for its realization remains elusive. In this work, we propose van der Waals heterostructures of stripe antiferromagnets (sAFMs) as an ideal platform for electrically controllable $p$-wave magnetism. In the sAFM/metal/sAFM structure, the leading RKKY-type exchange interaction is canceled due to the symmetry of the stacking pattern. This exposes a higher-order biquadratic interaction as a dominant contribution that drives a filling-controlled transition from a collinear phase to an orthogonal $p$-wave configuration. The resulting $p$-wave phase exhibits a gate-tunable Edelstein response, which originates from magnetic symmetry breaking rather than conventional relativistic spin-momentum locking and remains robust even under substantial spin-orbit coupling. Finally, we propose material candidates for the realization of our theory. Our results establish van der Waals heterostructures as a practical platform for non-relativistic spintronics with electric control of odd-parity spin textures.</description>

      <title>Sondheimer magneto-oscillations as a probe of Fermi surface reconstruction in underdoped cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining the Fermi surface (FS) volume in underdoped cuprates is crucial for understanding the nature of the strongly correlated pseudogap phase. Conventional quantum oscillation techniques, typically used for this purpose, are inapplicable in this high-temperature regime due to thermal and disorder-induced smearing of Landau levels. We propose Sondheimer oscillations (SO), semiclassical oscillations of in-plane magnetoresistivity in thin films, as a robust alternative probe of FS reconstruction. SO arise from the commensuration between the cyclotron radius and film thickness, do not rely on Landau quantization, and remain observable at moderate fields and elevated temperatures where quantum oscillations are suppressed. Their frequencies depend solely on the FS parameters (e.g., curvature), and not on specific details of scattering mechanisms. SO are also sensitive to the coherence of inter-layer tunneling, allow contributions from individual FS pockets to be distinguished in the frequency domain, and naturally include the Yamaji angle effect (if present in the system) as a prominent feature in the frequency spectrum. We compute SO spectra as a function of the magnetic field orientation for three representative scenarios: (i) an unreconstructed large FS, (ii) a spin density wave reconstructed FS with volume $p/4$, and (iii) a fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL$^*$) with pocket volume $p/8$ (here $p$ is the hole doping). We show that the SO spectrum offers a wealth of universal features that could be used to differentiate between these scenarios. In particular, we highlight a FS geometry-dependent phase shift between oscillations in longitudinal and transverse conductivities, characterize how the FS curvature can be extracted from SO if the film orientation is perpendicular to the crystallographic $c$-axis, and analyze the evolution of the SO spectrum with doping.</description>

Abstract: Integrated photonics provides a powerful approach for developing compact, stable and scalable architectures for the generation, manipulation and detection of quantum states of light. To this end, several material platforms are being developed in parallel, each providing its specific assets, and hybridization techniques to combine their strengths are now possible. This review focuses on AlGaAs, a III-V semiconductor platform combining a mature fabrication technology, direct band-gap compliant with electrical injection, low-loss operation, large electro-optic effect, and compatibility with superconducting detectors for on-chip detection. We detail recent implementations of room-temperature sources of quantum light based on the high second- and third-order optical nonlinearities of the material, as well as photonic circuits embedding various functionalities ranging from polarizing beamsplitters to Mach-Zehnder interferometers, modulators and tunable filters. We then present several realizations of quantum state engineering enabled by these recent advances and discuss open perspectives and remaining challenges in the field of integrated quantum photonics with AlGaAs.</description>

      <title>Structural control of two-level defect density revealed by high-throughput correlative measurements of Josephson junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.11469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Materials defects in Josephson junctions (JJs), often referred to as two-level systems (TLS), couple to superconducting qubits and are a critical bottleneck for scalable quantum processors. Despite their importance, understanding the microscopic sources of TLS and how to mitigate them has remained a major challenge. Here, we demonstrate a high-throughput, correlated approach to trace the microstructural origins of strongly-coupled TLS in Josephson circuits. We assembled a massive dataset of TLS across 6,000 Al/AlOx/Al JJs and more than 600 atomic resolution transmission electron microscopy images. We statistically link fabrication, microstructure, and TLS occurrence, revealing a strong correlation between Al electrode thickness, Al grain size, and TLS density. Correspondingly, we find a two-thirds reduction in TLS prompted by a change in electrode fabrication parameters. These results demonstrate a robust, data-driven methodology to understand and control defects in quantum circuits and pave the way for significantly reducing TLS density.</description>

      <title>Nanoscopic Imaging of Acoustic Dynamics in van der Waals Ferroelectric NbOI2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.11504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how low-dimensional ferroelectrics respond to ultrafast excitation at nanoscales is essential for controlling energy flow and mechanical functionality in next-generation polar materials and devices. Here, we report spatiotemporally resolved structural dynamics in the van der Waals ferroelectric NbOI2 using combined ultrafast electron microscopy and diffraction. Above-band-gap photoexcitation rapidly screens the in-plane polarization and heats the lattice, launching three coherent acoustic phonons: two transverse shear modes and one longitudinal breathing mode. The transverse mode that shears the layers perpendicular to the in-plane polar axis dominates over that along the polar axis, reflecting anisotropic coupling between polarization and strain. Spatially resolved measurements further reveal spatially correlated heterogeneity in the mode amplitudes and lifetimes. Regions dominated by a single shear mode exhibit significantly longer lifetime of acoustic oscillations than that of multimode regions, suggesting that acoustic phonon-phonon scattering is a major source of decoherence. Our results provide a microscopic understanding of polarization-strain coupling and spatially heterogeneous energy dissipation in van der Waals ferroelectrics under ultrafast excitation.</description>

      <title>Proposal for realizing unpaired Weyl points in a three-dimensional periodically driven optical Raman lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In static lattice systems, the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem enforces the pairing of Weyl points with opposite chiralities, which precludes the chiral magnetic effect (CME) in equilibrium. Periodic driving provides a viable route to circumvent this no-go constraint. Here, we propose a scheme to realize and control unpaired Weyl points using ultracold atoms in a three-dimensional (3D) optical Raman lattice under continuous periodic driving. By engineering distinct relative symmetries between the lattice and multiple Raman potentials, the configuration generates an effective 3D spin-orbit coupling and yields a tunable topological-insulator phase. Through adiabatic periodic modulation of this system, we show that eight Weyl points emerge in the quasienergy spectrum of the low-energy sector, whose net chirality can be precisely tuned. A nonzero total chirality directly corresponds to the formation of unpaired Weyl points. Furthermore, by implementing a synthetic magnetic field via laser-assisted tunneling in this setup, we demonstrate that the chirality imbalance drives a quantized charge current in the weak-field regime, providing a direct signature of the CME. We verify that the adiabatic condition of the driving protocol, as well as the proposed experimental preparation and detection techniques, are within reach of current ultracold-atom experiments. This work establishes a realistic and controllable platform for exploring chiral-anomaly physics and nonequilibrium topological phenomena linked to Weyl fermions.</description>

      <title>Theoretical description of a photonic topological insulator based on a cubic lattice of bianisotropic resonators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present paper, we construct a theoretical description of a three-dimensional photonic topological insulator in the form of a simple cubic lattice of bianisotropic resonators that is based on a dyadic Green's function approach. By considering electric and magnetic dipole modes and the interactions between different numbers of the nearest resonators, we obtain the Bloch Hamiltonians and the corresponding tight-binding models and analyze the band diagrams, spatial structure of the eigenmodes, and their localization, revealing quadratic degeneracies in the vicinity of high-symmetry points in the absence of bianisotropy and the emergence of in-gap states localized at a domain wall upon the introduction of bianisotropy. Finally, we visualize the Berry curvature distributions to study the topological properties of the considered models.</description>

      <title>Kagome edge states under lattice termination, spin-orbit coupling, and magnetic order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the edge state properties of a two-dimensional kagome lattice using a tight-binding approach, focusing on the role of lattice termination, spin-orbit coupling, and magnetic order. In the pristine limit, we show that the existence of localized edge states is highly sensitive to boundary geometry, with certain terminations completely suppressing edge modes. Kane-Mele spin-orbit coupling opens a bulk gap and stabilizes topologically protected helical edge states, yielding a robust $\mathbb{Z}_2$ insulating phase that is insensitive to termination details. In contrast, the combined effect of a Zeeman field and Rashba spin-orbit coupling drives the system into Chern insulating phases, with Chern numbers consistent with the number of chiral edge modes. We further demonstrate that non-coplanar magnetic textures generate multiple Chern phases through finite scalar spin chirality, with Kane-Mele coupling strongly tuning the topological gaps. Our results provide important insights into the tunability of edge states in the kagome lattice, which can be key to designing materials with novel electronic properties and topological phases.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the influence of a time-periodic driving (for example, by shining circularly polarized light) on three-dimensional Weyl and multi-Weyl semimetals, in the planar Hall and planar thermal Hall set-ups. We incorporate the effects of the drive by using the Floquet formalism in the large frequency limit. We evaluate the longitudinal magneto conductivity, planar Hall conductivity, longitudinal thermo-electric coefficient, and transverse thermo-electric coefficient, using the semi-classical Boltzmann transport equations. We demonstrate the explicit expressions of these transport coefficients in certain limits of the parameters, where it is possible to perform the integrals analytically. We cross-check our analytical approximations by comparing the physical values with the numerical results, obtained directly from the numerical integration of the integrals. The answers obtained show that the topological charges of the corresponding semimetals have profound signatures in these transport properties, which can be observed in experiments.</description>

Abstract: We report Dirac Landau polaritons observed by terahertz (THz) magnetoreflectivity spectroscopy, demonstrating strong coupling between cyclotron transitions of two-dimensional (2D) Dirac fermions in HgTe quantum wells and optical cavity modes. Under pulsed electrical injection we observe efficient nonlinear electroluminescence, with a strongly out-of-equilibrium polariton distribution dominated by emission from the upper polariton branches. Model analysis of the bias-dependent emission intensity and spectral narrowing indicates a polariton occupancy per mode approaching unity, with a possible contribution from stimulated polariton emission in the spectral region of the upper anticrossing. These results open prospects toward Dirac Landau polariton condensates and low-threshold, tunable THz polariton lasers based on cyclotron emission.</description>

      <title>Excitation and tunneling spectra of a fractional quantum Hall system in the thin cylinder limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The excitations of fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) states have been largely inaccessible to experimental probes until recently. New electron scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) results from Hu et.al. (arXiv:2308.05789) show promise in detecting and identifying these excited states via the local density of states (LDOS) spectrum. On a torus, there exists a mapping {from the lowest Landau level states} to a 1D lattice {with a Hamiltonian that features} dipole moment conservation. In this work, we apply perturbation theory starting from the thin cylinder limit ($L_x \rightarrow \infty, L_y &lt;l_B$ for torus dimensions $L_x$ and $L_y$ {and magnetic length $l_B$}) to obtain an analytical approach to the low-lying neutral and charged excitations of the $\nu =1/3$ FQHE state. Notably, in the thin cylinder we can systematically enumerate all the low-lying excitations by the patterns of 'dipoles' formed by the electron occupation pattern on the 1D lattice. We find that the thin-cylinder limit predicts a significant dispersion of the low-lying neutral excitations but sharpness of the LDOS spectra, which measure charged excitations. We also discuss connections between our work and several different approaches to the FQHE STM spectra, including those using the composite fermion theory. Numerical exact diagonalization beyond the thin-cylinder limit suggests that the energies of charged excitations remain largely confined to a narrow range of energies, which in experiments might appear as a single peak.</description>

      <title>Zero and Nonzero Energy Majorana Modes in an Extended Kitaev Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies an extended Kitaev chain with three sublattices per unit cell. This extended version is obtained by hybridizing a modified Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model featuring trimerized unit cells with the standard Kitaev chain, resulting in a hexamer structure on the Majorana basis. Due to the interplay between the sublattice configuration and the $p$-wave superconducting pairing, a rich structure of edge modes beyond the expected Majorana zero modes is obtained. The various Majorana edge modes are further found to demonstrate considerable robustness against some generic perturbations and disorder. The presence of the non-zero Majorana edge modes in our system has the potential advantage that they could, in principle, be more unambiguously detected as compared to their zero energy counterparts, the detection of which remains an open problem. Therefore, while our system does not directly solve this open problem, it potentially offers a route to an intermediate solution that involves unambiguously detecting non-zero energy Majorana edge modes instead.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Andreev-mediated transport and current fluctuations in interacting normal-superconducting quantum-dot systems. Using a generalized master equation based on real-time diagrammatics and full counting statistics, we compute the steady-state current, zero-frequency noise, and rate of entropy production in the large superconducting-gap limit. We show how Coulomb interactions modify Andreev-mediated transport by renormalizing resonant conditions and suppressing superconducting coherence, leading to a pronounced reduction of current precision even when average currents are only weakly affected. These effects are particularly evident at high temperatures, where conventional Coulomb-blockade features are thermally smeared while fluctuation properties remain highly sensitive. By analyzing thermodynamic uncertainty relations, we demonstrate that violations of the quantum bound present in the noninteracting regime are progressively reduced and eventually suppressed as interactions increase, whereas the recently proposed hybrid bound remains satisfied. Our results clarify how Coulomb interactions, and nonequilibrium fluctuations jointly determine transport properties in hybrid superconducting devices, and establish current precision as a robust benchmark for interacting Andreev transport beyond the noninteracting limit.</description>

Abstract: Superconducting quantum devices, from qubits and magnetometers to dark matter detectors, are influenced by magnetic flux noise originating from paramagnetic surface defects and impurities. These spin systems can feature complex dynamics, including a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition, that depend on the lattice, interactions, external fields, and disorder. However, the disorder included in typical models is not materials-specific, diminishing the ability to accurately capture measured flux noise phenomena. We present a first principles-based simulation of a spin lattice consisting of paramagnetic O$_2$ molecules on an Al$_2$O$_3$ surface, a likely flux noise source in superconducting qubits, to elucidate opportunities to mitigate flux noise. We simulate an ensemble of surface adsorbates with disordered orientations and calculate the orientation-dependent exchange couplings using density functional theory. Thus, our spin simulation has no free parameters or assumed functional form of the disorder, and captures correlation in the defect landscape that would appear in real systems. We calculate a range of exchange interactions between electron pairs, with the smallest values, 0.016 meV and -0.023 meV, being in the range required to act as a two-level system and couple to GHz resonators. We calculate the flux noise frequency, temperature, and applied external magnetic field dependence, as well as the susceptibility-flux noise cross-correlation. Calculated trends agree with experiment, demonstrating that a surface harboring paramagnetic adsorbates arranged with materials-specific disorder and interactions captures the various properties of magnetic flux noise observed in superconducting circuits. In addition, we find that an external electric field can tune the spin-spin interaction strength and reduce magnetic flux noise.</description>

      <title>High-Harmonic Spin and Charge Pumping in Altermagnets</title>

Abstract: We report the emergence of highly nonlinear spin and charge pumping in an altermagnetic system driven by magnetic dynamics. The nonrelativistic spin-momentum coupling inherent to altermagnets generates a giant momentum dependent spin splitting, leading to strong spin-flip scattering in the presence of a precessing magnetic order driving the altermagnetic system out of equilibrium. Our simulations reveal the emission of hundreds of harmonics under realistic conditions, with amplitudes far exceeding those obtained in light-driven schemes. Notably, in contrast to ferromagnetic and conventional antiferromagnetic systems, where nonlinear emission typically requires additional spin-orbit coupling, altermagnets intrinsically support high-harmonic spin and charge pumping. These results identify altermagnetic systems as a promising platform for efficient THz emitters and highly nonlinear spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Transition Metal Dichalcogenide MoS${}_2$: oxygen and fluorine functionalization for selective plasma processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-temperature plasma processing is a promising technique for tailoring the properties of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) because it allows for precise control of radical and ion energies and fluxes. For chalcogen substitution, a key challenge is to identify the ion energy window that enables selective chalcogen removal while preserving the metal lattice. Using ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD), we demonstrate that oxygen and fluorine functionalization through thermal chemisorption significantly lowers the sputtering energy threshold ($E_{sputt}$) of MoS${}_2$ from $\sim 35$ eV to $\sim 10$ eV. In addition, we find that a non-orthogonal impact angle $\sim 30{}^{\circ}$ reduces the sputtering energy threshold, while cryogenic-range TMD temperatures may increase. To explain the observed trends, a multi-step sputtering mechanism is proposed. Our results show that oxygen/fluorine functionalization, impact angle, and material temperature are key control parameters for selective, damage-free chalcogen removal in TMD processing.</description>

      <title>Gradually opening Schr\"odinger's box reveals a cascade of sharp dynamical transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics predicts that unobserved systems may exist in a superposition of states, yet measurement produces definite outcomes, a tension at the heart of the quantum-to-classical boundary. How the transformation between these opposing regimes unfolds as observation strength increases has remained experimentally unexplored. Here, by continuously tuning the measurement strength on a superconducting qubit, we reveal that measurement-dominated dynamics emerge not gradually but through three distinct transitions: coherent oscillations abruptly halt; the system then freezes near a stable quantum state; and finally enters the quantum Zeno regime, where stronger observation paradoxically slows relaxation. Decoherence, rather than washing out this structure, reorganizes it, inverting the order in which transitions appear and decoupling signatures that coincide in idealized models. These results establish that the route from quantum dynamics to measurement-dominated behavior unfolds in sharp transitions governed by the interplay between observation and environment.</description>
