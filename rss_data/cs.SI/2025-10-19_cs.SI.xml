      <title>A Generalizable Rhetorical Strategy Annotation Model Using LLM-based Debate Simulation and Labelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rhetorical strategies are central to persuasive communication, from political discourse and marketing to legal argumentation. However, analysis of rhetorical strategies has been limited by reliance on human annotation, which is costly, inconsistent, difficult to scale. Their associated datasets are often limited to specific topics and strategies, posing challenges for robust model development. We propose a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate and label synthetic debate data based on a four-part rhetorical typology (causal, empirical, emotional, moral). We fine-tune transformer-based classifiers on this LLM-labeled dataset and validate its performance against human-labeled data on this dataset and on multiple external corpora. Our model achieves high performance and strong generalization across topical domains. We illustrate two applications with the fine-tuned model: (1) the improvement in persuasiveness prediction from incorporating rhetorical strategy labels, and (2) analyzing temporal and partisan shifts in rhetorical strategies in U.S. Presidential debates (1960-2020), revealing increased use of affective over cognitive argument in U.S. Presidential debates.</description>

      <title>Latent Topic Synthesis: Leveraging LLMs for Electoral Ad Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social media platforms play a pivotal role in shaping political discourse, but analyzing their vast and rapidly evolving content remains a major challenge. We introduce an end-to-end framework for automatically generating an interpretable topic taxonomy from an unlabeled corpus. By combining unsupervised clustering with prompt-based labeling, our method leverages large language models (LLMs) to iteratively construct a taxonomy without requiring seed sets or domain expertise. We apply this framework to a large corpus of Meta (previously known as Facebook) political ads from the month ahead of the 2024 U.S. Presidential election. Our approach uncovers latent discourse structures, synthesizes semantically rich topic labels, and annotates topics with moral framing dimensions. We show quantitative and qualitative analyses to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Our findings reveal that voting and immigration ads dominate overall spending and impressions, while abortion and election-integrity achieve disproportionate reach. Funding patterns are equally polarized: economic appeals are driven mainly by conservative PACs, abortion messaging splits between pro- and anti-rights coalitions, and crime-and-justice campaigns are fragmented across local committees. The framing of these appeals also diverges--abortion ads emphasize liberty/oppression rhetoric, while economic messaging blends care/harm, fairness/cheating, and liberty/oppression narratives. Topic salience further reveals strong correlations between moral foundations and issues. Demographic targeting also emerges. This work supports scalable, interpretable analysis of political messaging on social media, enabling researchers, policymakers, and the public to better understand emerging narratives, polarization dynamics, and the moral underpinnings of digital political communication.</description>

      <title>From Murals to Memes: A Theory of Aesthetic Asymmetry in Political Mobilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Why have left-wing movements historically integrated participatory art forms (such as murals and protest songs) into their praxis, while right-wing movements have prioritized strategic communication and, more recently, the digital culture of memes? This article introduces the concept of aesthetic asymmetry to explain this divergence in political action. We argue that the asymmetry is not coincidental but the result of four interconnected structural factors: the organizational ecosystem, the moral and emotional framework, the material supports, and the historical tradition of each political spectrum. While the left tends to use art in a constitutive manner to forge community, solidarity, and hope, the contemporary right tends to use it instrumentally to mobilize polarizing affects such as humor and resentment. Drawing on comparative literature from the Theatre of the Oppressed to analyses of alt-right meme wars, we nuance this distinction and show how the aesthetic logic of each pole aligns with its strategic objectives. The article culminates in a prescriptive model for artistic action, synthesizing keys to effective mobilization into emotional, narrative, and formatting strategies. Understanding this asymmetry is crucial for analyzing political communication and for designing cultural interventions capable of generating profound social change.</description>

      <title>VERA-MH Concept Paper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce VERA-MH (Validation of Ethical and Responsible AI in Mental Health), an automated evaluation of the safety of AI chatbots used in mental health contexts, with an initial focus on suicide risk.
  Practicing clinicians and academic experts developed a rubric informed by best practices for suicide risk management for the evaluation. To fully automate the process, we used two ancillary AI agents. A user-agent model simulates users engaging in a mental health-based conversation with the chatbot under evaluation. The user-agent role-plays specific personas with pre-defined risk levels and other features. Simulated conversations are then passed to a judge-agent who scores them based on the rubric. The final evaluation of the chatbot being tested is obtained by aggregating the scoring of each conversation.
  VERA-MH is actively under development and undergoing rigorous validation by mental health clinicians to ensure user-agents realistically act as patients and that the judge-agent accurately scores the AI chatbot. To date we have conducted preliminary evaluation of GPT-5, Claude Opus and Claude Sonnet using initial versions of the VERA-MH rubric and used the findings for further design development. Next steps will include more robust clinical validation and iteration, as well as refining actionable scoring. We are seeking feedback from the community on both the technical and clinical aspects of our evaluation.</description>

      <title>Towards Proactive Defense Against Cyber Cognitive Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cyber cognitive attacks leverage disruptive innovations (DIs) to exploit psychological biases and manipulate decision-making processes. Emerging technologies, such as AI-driven disinformation and synthetic media, have accelerated the scale and sophistication of these threats. Prior studies primarily categorize current cognitive attack tactics, lacking predictive mechanisms to anticipate future DIs and their malicious use in cognitive attacks. This paper addresses these gaps by introducing a novel predictive methodology for forecasting the emergence of DIs and their malicious uses in cognitive attacks. We identify trends in adversarial tactics and propose proactive defense strategies.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Engagement Effectiveness of Cyber Cognitive Attacks: A Behavioral Metric for Disinformation Campaigns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As disinformation-driven cognitive attacks become increasingly sophisticated, the ability to quantify their impact is essential for advancing cybersecurity defense strategies. This paper presents a novel framework for measuring the engagement effectiveness of cognitive attacks by introducing a weighted interaction metric that accounts for both the type and volume of user engagement relative to the number of attacker-generated transmissions. Applying this model to real-world disinformation campaigns across social media platforms, we demonstrate how the metric captures not just reach but the behavioral depth of user engagement. Our findings provide new insights into the behavioral dynamics of cognitive warfare and offer actionable tools for researchers and practitioners seeking to assess and counter the spread of malicious influence online.</description>
