      <title>Birds breathe and sing at resonances of the biomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolution has shaped animal bodies, yet to what extent biomechanical devices provide constraints and opportunities across different behaviors remains unclear. In birds, quiet breathing operates at a resonance of the respiratory biomechanics, but song, a behavior thought to be shaped by strong sexual selection, requires much higher breathing rates. Combining physiological recordings with a nonlinear biomechanical model, we show in canaries (Serinus canaria) that song production drives the system into a nonlinear regime that broadens the frequency range of amplified responses. This enhancement encompasses all syllabic rates, with an average magnification of ~94% of the theoretical maximum. Our results show that birds breathe and sing at a resonance, revealing that optimization strategies can be shared across behavioral states and extend to sexually selected displays.</description>

      <title>Modes of Mechanical Guidance of Adhesion-Independent Cell Migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adhesion-independent migration is a prominent mode of cell motility in confined environments, yet the physical principles that guide such movement remain incompletely understood. We present a phase-field model for simulating the motility of deformable, non-adherent cells driven by contractile surface instabilities of the cell cortex. This model couples surface and bulk hydrodynamics, accommodates large shape deformations and incorporates a diffusible contraction-generating molecule (myosin) that drives cortical flows. These capabilities enable a systematic exploration of how mechanical cues direct cell polarization and migration. We first demonstrate that spontaneous symmetry breaking of cortical activity can lead to persistent and directed movement in channels. We then investigate how various physical cues - including gradients in friction, viscosity, and channel width as well as external flows and hydrodynamic interactions between cells - steer migration. Our results show that active surface dynamics can generate stimulus-specific cell behaviors, such as migration up friction gradients or escape from narrow regions. Beyond cell migration, the model offers a versatile platform for exploring the mechanics of active surfaces in biological systems.</description>

      <title>Metastable phase separation and information retrieval in multicomponent mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Liquid mixtures can separate into phases with distinct composition. This phenomenon has recently come back to prominence due to its role in complex biological liquids, such as the cytoplasm, which contain thousands of components. For simple two-component mixtures phase-separated states are global free energy minima. However, local free energy minima, i.e. metastable states, are known to play a dominant role in complex systems with many components. For example, Hopfield neural networks can retrieve information from partial cues via relaxation to metastable states. Under what conditions can phase separated states be metastable, and what are the implications for information processing in multicomponent liquids? In this work we develop the general thermodynamic formalism of metastable phase separation. We then apply this formalism to an illustrative toy example inspired by recent experiments, binary mixtures with high-order interactions. Finally, as core application of the formalism, we study metastability in Hopfield liquids, a class of multicomponent mixtures capable of storing information on the composition of phases. We show that these phases can be retrieved from partial cues via metastable phase separation. Spatial simulations of liquids with a large number of components match our analytical solution. Our work suggests that complex biological mixtures can perform information retrieval through metastable phase separation.</description>

      <title>Patterning programmable spin arrays on DNA origami for quantum technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The controlled assembly of solid-state spins with nanoscale spatial precision is an outstanding challenge for quantum technology. Here, we combine DNA-based patterning with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) ensemble quantum sensors in diamond to form and sense programmable 2D arrays of spins. We use DNA origami to control the spacing of chelated Gd$^{3+}$ spins, as verified by the observed linear relationship between proximal NVs' relaxation rate, $1/T_1$, and the engineered number of Gd$^{3+}$ spins per origami unit. We further show that DNA origami provides a robust way of functionalizing the diamond surface with spins as it preserves the charge state and spin coherence of proximal, shallow NV centers. Our work enables the formation and interrogation of ordered, strongly interacting spin networks with applications in quantum sensing and quantum simulation. We quantitatively discuss the prospects of entanglement-enhanced metrology and high-throughput proteomics.</description>

      <title>Predictive Free Energy Simulations Through Hierarchical Distillation of Quantum Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Obtaining the free energies of condensed phase chemical reactions remains computationally prohibitive for high-level quantum mechanical methods. We introduce a hierarchical machine learning framework that bridges this gap by distilling knowledge from a small number of high-fidelity quantum calculations into increasingly coarse-grained, machine-learned quantum Hamiltonians. By retaining explicit electronic degrees of freedom, our approach further enables a faithful embedding of quantum and classical degrees of freedom that captures long-range electrostatics and the quantum response to a classical environment to infinite order. As validation, we compute the proton dissociation constants of weak acids and the kinetic rate of an enzymatic reaction entirely from first principles, reproducing experimental measurements within chemical accuracy or their uncertainties. Our work demonstrates a path to condensed phase simulations of reaction free energies at the highest levels of accuracy with converged statistics.</description>

      <title>Entropic active particle transport in pulsating 3D geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the transport of active Brownian particles (ABPs) in three-dimensional (3D) oscillatory geometries, which are spatially periodic. We establish a generalized Fick-Jacobs approach, which reduces a 3D system to an effective 1D system based on the assumption that a fast equilibration of particles along the transversal directions of the geometry. The transport characteristics of ABPs are computed semi-analytically and corroborated by numerical simulations. At the optimal frequency of the geometry oscillation, particles exhibit higher average velocity $\langle v \rangle$ and effective diffusion coefficient $D_{\text{eff}}$, resembling the phenomena of stochastic resonance. This effect is further enhanced by the self-propelled velocity of ABPs and the amplitude of geometry oscillations. These findings have significant implications for the development of micro- and nanofluidic devices with enhanced control over particle transport and precise manipulation of small-scale biomedical devices.</description>

      <title>Volumetric ultrasound imaging with a sparse matrix array and integrated fiber-optic sensing for robust needle tracking in interventional procedures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate visualization of interventional devices, such as medical needles, is essential for the safe and effective guidance of minimally invasive procedures. Ultrasound (US) imaging is widely used for needle guidance, but the two-dimensional nature of most clinical probes limits accurate three-dimensional (3D) localization, particularly of the needle tip. We present a novel system that integrates volumetric US imaging with 3D needle tracking by combining a fiber-optic hydrophone embedded in the needle and a sparse spiral US array. Real-time volumetric imaging was achieved using plane-wave techniques, while precise needle tip tracking was enabled through communication between the probe and hydrophone. The feasibility of the approach was demonstrated using a nerve block training phantom. This proof-of-concept system enables simultaneous volumetric anatomical imaging and 3D needle tip tracking, with strong potential to enhance the efficacy and safety of image-guided interventional procedures.</description>

      <title>Neural networks for learning macroscopic chemotactic sensitivity from microscopic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The macroscopic (population-level) dynamics of chemotactic cell movement -- arising from underlying microscopic (individual-based) models -- are often described by parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) governing the spatio-temporal evolution of cell concentrations. In certain cases, these macroscopic PDEs can be analytically derived from microscopic models, thereby elucidating the dependence of PDE coefficients on the parameters of the underlying individual-based dynamics. However, such analytical derivations are not always feasible, particularly for more complex or nonlinear microscopic models. In these instances, neural networks offer a promising alternative for estimating the coefficients of macroscopic PDEs directly from data generated by microscopic simulations. In this work, three microscopic models of chemotaxis are investigated. The macroscopic chemotaxis sensitivity is estimated using neural networks, thereby bridging the gap between individual-level behaviours and population-level descriptions. The results are compared with macroscopic PDEs, which can be derived for each model in certain parameter regimes.</description>

      <title>Cockroaches use diverse strategies to self-right on the ground</title>

      <description>arXiv:1911.00421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Terrestrial animals often must self-right from an upside-down orientation on the ground to survive. Here, we compared self-righting strategies of the Madagascar hissing, American, and discoid cockroaches on a challenging flat, rigid, low-friction surface to quantify the mechanical principles. All three species almost always self-righted (97% probability) when given time (30 seconds), frequently self-righted (63%) on the first attempt, and on that attempt did so in one second or less. When successful, two of the three species gained and used pitch and/or roll rotational kinetic energy to overcome potential energy barriers (American 63% of all attempts and discoid 78%). By contrast, the largest, heaviest, wingless cockroach (Madagascar hissing) relied far less on the energy of motion and was the slowest to self-right. Two of the three species used rolling strategies to overcome low potential energy barriers. Successful righting attempts had greater rolling rotation than failed attempts as the center of mass rose to the highest position. Madagascar hissing cockroaches rolled using body deformation (98% of all trials) and the American cockroach relied on leg forces (93%). By contrast, the discoid cockroach overcame higher and a wider range of potential energy barriers with simultaneous pitching and rolling using wings (46% of all trials) and legs (49%) equally to self-right. Our quantification revealed the performance advantages of using rotational kinetic energy to overcome the potential energy barrier and rolling more to lower it, while maintaining diverse strategies for ground-based self-righting.</description>

      <title>Snakes partition their body to traverse large steps stably</title>

      <description>arXiv:1911.01240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many snakes live in deserts, forests, and river valleys and traverse challenging 3-D terrain like rocks, felled trees, and rubble, with obstacles as large as themselves and variable surface properties. By contrast, apart from branch cantilevering, burrowing, swimming, and gliding, laboratory studies of snake locomotion focused on that on simple flat surfaces. Here, to begin to understand snake locomotion in complex 3-D terrain, we study how the variable kingsnake, a terrestrial generalist, traversed a large step of variable surface friction and step height (up to 30% snout-vent length). The snake traversed by partitioning its body into three sections with distinct functions. Body sections below and above the step oscillated laterally on horizontal surfaces for propulsion, while the body section in between cantilevered in a vertical plane to bridge the large height increase. As the animal progressed, these three sections traveled down its body, conforming overall body shape to the step. In addition, the snake adjusted the partitioned gait in response to increase in step height and decrease in surface friction, at the cost of reduced speed. As surface friction decreased, body movement below and above the step changed from a continuous lateral undulation with little slip to an intermittent oscillatory movement with much slip, and initial head lift-off became closer to the step. Given these adjustments, body partitioning allowed the snake to be always stable, even when initially cantilevering but before reaching the surface above. Such a partitioned gait may be generally useful for diverse, complex 3-D terrain.</description>

      <title>Terradynamically streamlined shapes in animals and robots enhances traversability through densely cluttered terrain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01797</link>
      <description>arXiv:1911.01797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many animals, modern aircraft, and underwater vehicles use streamlined body shapes that reduce fluid dynamic drag to achieve fast and effective locomotion in air and water. Similarly, numerous small terrestrial animals move through cluttered terrain where 3-D, multi-component obstacles like grass, shrubs, vines, and leaf litter resist motion, but it is unknown whether their body shape plays a major role in traversal. Few ground vehicles or terrestrial robots have used body shape to effectively traverse cluttered terrain. Here, we challenged forest-floor-dwelling discoid cockroaches possessing a thin, rounded body to traverse tall, narrowly spaced, vertical, grass-like compliant beams. Animals displayed high traversal performance (79 +/- 12% probability and 3.4 +/- 0.7 s time). Although we observed diverse traversal strategies, cockroaches primarily (48 +/- 9 % probability) used a novel roll maneuver, allowing them to rapidly traverse obstacle gaps narrower than half body width (2.0 +/- 0.5 s traversal time). Reduction of body roundness by addition of artificial shells nearly inhibited roll maneuvers and decreased traversal performance. Inspired by this discovery, we added a thin, rounded exoskeletal shell to a legged robot with a nearly cuboidal body, common to many existing terrestrial robots. Without adding sensory feedback or changing the open-loop control, the rounded shell enabled the robot to traverse beam obstacles with gaps narrower than shell width via body roll. Terradynamically streamlined shapes can reduce terrain resistance and enhance traversability by assisting effective body reorientation via distributed mechanical feedback. Our findings highlight the need to consider body shape to improve robot mobility in real-world terrain often filled with clutter, and to develop better locomotor-ground contact models to understand interaction with complex terrain.</description>

      <title>Analog of the Carnot engine for fluctuating diffusivity in living cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, a formal analogy between the fluctuating diffusivity and thermodynamics has been proposed based on phenomena of heterogeneous diffusion observed in living cells. This not only offers the analogs of the quantity of heat and work as well as the internal energy but also achieves that of the Clausius inequality for the entropy concerning diffusivity fluctuations. Here, a discussion is developed about constructing a heat-like engine in terms of the fluctuating diffusivity. The engine constitutes two kinds of processes with the average diffusivity or the average local temperature being kept fixed, along which the fluctuation distribution obeys an exponential law. The efficiency of the engine in a cycle, which quantifies how much the diffusivity change as the analog of work can be extracted, is found to formally coincide with that of Carnot's. During the cycle, the total change of the entropy is also shown to vanish.</description>

Abstract: Finding process pathways in molecular simulations such as the unbinding paths of small molecule ligands from their binding sites at protein targets in a set of trajectories via unsupervised learning approaches requires the definition of a suitable similarity measure between trajectories. We here evaluate the performance of four such measures with varying degree of sophistication, i.e., Euclidean and Wasserstein distances, Procrustes analysis and dynamical time warping, when analyzing trajectory data from two different biased simulation driving protocols in the form of constant velocity constraint targeted MD and steered MD. In a streptavidin-biotin benchmark system with known ground truth clusters, Wasserstein distances yielded the best clustering performance, closely followed by Euclidean distances, both being the most computationally efficient similarity measures. In a more complex A2a receptor-inhibitor system, however, the simplest measure, i.e., Euclidean distances, was sufficient to reveal meaningful and interpretable clusters.</description>
