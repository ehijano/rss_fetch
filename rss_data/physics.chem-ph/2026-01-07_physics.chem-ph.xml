      <title>Ultrafast cation-dication dynamics in ammonia borane: H-migration to roaming H2 and reduced H3+ formation under strong-field ionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a femtosecond time-resolved strong-field study of ammonia borane (AB, BH3NH3) following both single and double ionization, revealing ultrafast fragmentation dynamics and hydrogen release. Mass spectrometry, combined with fragment correlation analysis and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, is used to identify the molecular origin of the neutral and ionic products. Singly ionized AB produces neutral H and H2, while doubly ionized AB produces neutral H and H2 along with H+, H2+, and H3+, all within 1 ps. Electronic-structure calculations show that H, H+, H2, H2+, and H3+ originate predominantly from hydrogen atoms bound to the boron center and that their formation proceeds through hydrogen migration and, in some channels, neutral H2 roaming. The calculations further indicate that the dication meets the structural and energetic requirements for neutral H2 release, a prerequisite for forming astrochemically relevant H3+. However, the large adiabatic relaxation energy causes most roaming H2 to dissociate before proton abstraction, suppressing H3+ formation. These results provide new insight into dissociative ionization pathways in hydrogen-rich molecules, extend mechanistic principles developed for halogenated alkanes to ammonia borane, and suggest implications for hydrogen-release chemistry in ammonia-borane-based storage materials.</description>

      <title>Musical Molecules: Sonifying the IR Spectra and Modeling Intramolecular Vibrational Energy Redistribution of Small Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores how small molecules sound. Infrared (IR) spectra of HCl, H2O, NH3, and acetone are mapped into the audible range using a simple anharmonic oscillator model and NIST vibrational data. Comparing harmonic and anharmonic sonifications reveals systematic pitch flattening, beating, and the emergence of combination bands, which are analyzed with spectrograms and autocorrelation functions. A time-dependent model of intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution (IVR) in acetone, implemented by "plucking" a single mode, produces evolving sound textures that mirror energy flow through the molecule. These results suggest that sonified IR spectra can provide an intuitive, pedagogical window into anharmonicity, mode coupling, and IVR.</description>

      <title>Charged excitations made neutral: N-centered ensemble density functional theory of Fukui functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an in-principle exact working equation to compute Fukui functions within $N$-centered ensemble DFT. It avoids the kernel derivative discontinuity problem of DFT for fractional number of electrons, whose contribution is recovered through weight-derivatives of the ensemble density functional potential. We explore practical strategies to compute its contribution by recycling ground-state density-functional approximations dressed with a weight-dependent scaling function. We also show interpolating between known limits of the ensemble functional and learning from uniform density profiles is a very effective strategy.</description>

      <title>Effective Hamiltonian based DNP Sequence Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) enhances the intensity of NMR signals by transferring polarization from electron spins to nuclei via microwave irradiation. Pulsed DNP methods offer more control on the spin dynamics than conventional continuous-wave approaches. Here, we report on-resonance and off-resonance DNP sequences optimized using effective Hamiltonians derived from continuous Floquet theory. Experiments at 80 K and 0.35 T using a sample of 5 mM Trityl OX063 in a glycerol-d8/D2O/H2O matrix (60:30:10, v/v/v) demonstrate that the optimized on-resonance sequence achieves 100 MHz electron offset bandwidth, while the offresonance sequence cantered at an electron offset of 50 MHz can cover 20 MHz, with 25 MHz and 20 MHz of microwave power, respectively. These results demonstrate that continuous Floquet theory is a useful framework for the optimization of pulsed DNP sequences.</description>

      <title>Deep learning parameter estimation and quantum control of single molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent control, a central concept in physics and chemistry, has sparked significant interest due to its ability to fine-tune interference effects in atoms and individual molecules for applications ranging from light-harvesting complexes to molecular qubits. However, precise characterization of the system's dissipative dynamics is required for its implementation, especially at high temperature. In a quantum control experiment, this means learning system-bath parameters and driving coupling strengths. Here, we demonstrate how to infer key physical parameters of a single molecule driven by spectrally modulated pulses at room temperature. We develop and compare two computational approaches based on two-photon absorption photoluminescence signals: an optimization-based minimization scheme and a feed-forward neural network. The robustness of our approach highlights the importance of reliable parameter estimation in designing effective coherent control protocols. Our results have direct applications in ultrafast spectroscopy, quantum materials and technology.</description>

      <title>Fluids at an electrostatically active surface: Optimum in interfacial friction and electrohydrodynamic drag</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While fluids near a solid surface are at the core of applications in energy storage/conversion, electrochemistry/electrowetting and adsorption/catalysis, their nanoscale behavior remains only partially deciphered. Beyond conventional effects (e.g. adsorption/reaction, interfacial transport, phase transition shifts), recent experimental and theoretical studies on metallic surfaces have unraveled exotic peculiarities such as complex electrostatic screening, unexpected wetting transition, and interfacial quantum friction. These novel features require developing and embarking new tools to tackle the coupling between charge relaxation in the metal and molecular behavior in the vicinal fluid. Here, using the concept of Virtual Thomas-Fermi fluids, we employ a molecular simulation approach to investigate interfacial transport of fluid molecules and metal charge carriers at their interface--including the underlying electrostatically-driven dynamic friction and the coupling between charge current/hydrodynamic flow (the so-called electrohydrodynamic drag). While conventional numerical techniques consider either insulating materials or metallic materials described as polarizable, non-conducting media, our atom-scale strategy provides an effective yet realistic description of the solid excitation spectrum--including charge relaxation modes and conductivity. By applying this approach to water near metallic surfaces of various electrostatic screening lengths, we unveil a non-monotonous dependence of the fluid/solid friction on the metallicity with a maximum occurring as the charge dynamic structure factors of the solid and fluid strongly overlap. Moreover, we report a direct observation of the electrohydrodynamic drag which arises from the momentum transfer between the solid and liquid through dynamic electrostatic interactions and the underlying interfacial friction.</description>

      <title>High-throughput, high-brightness, ultrashort 90 keV electrons at 40 kHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiofrequency-compressed keV electron sources for ultrafast electron diffraction (UED) face competing demands: short pulses require low charge, yet weak scatterers demand high flux; high repetition rates enable signal averaging, yet most systems operate $\lesssim$1 kHz with low detection efficiency. Here, we demonstrate a 90 keV DC-RF source operating at 40 kHz with direct electron detection that address these challenges simultaneously. THz streaking retrieves compressed pulse durations of 97 $\pm$ 3 fs (FWHM) at 370 aC and 114 $\pm$ 47 fs (FWHM) at 2.8 fC. Long-term $t_0$ timing drifts, characterized independently both by convolution analysis of compression data and direct THz streaking measurements, lie between 65 - 95 fs (FWHM), among the lowest reported for RF-based systems. At low charge (17 aC), we report an intrinsic pulse duration of 56 fs (FWHM) from comparison of simulations to measured compression data, among the shortest for keV UED at $&gt;$16 aC. Moreover, 2.8 fC bunches, combined with 40 kHz repetition rate and direct detection, produce a detectable normalized throughput that is one (three-to-four) orders of magnitude higher than existing keV (MeV) sources. This enables practical UED studies of weakly scattering samples and processes previously impractical due to low cross-sections and long acquisition times.</description>

      <title>Interplay of Structure and Dynamics in Solid Polymer Electrolytes: a Molecular Dynamics Study of LiPF6/polypropylene carbonate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solid-state batteries (SSB) are emerging as next-generation electrochemical energy storage devices. Achieving high energy density in SSB relies on solid polymer electrolytes (SPE) that are electrochemically stable against both lithium metal and high-potential positive electrodes, two conditions that are difficult to satisfy without chemical degradation. In this work, molecular dynamics simulations are employed to investigate the relationship between structure and dynamics in carbonate-based SPE composed of polypropylene carbonate and lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF$_6$), at salt concentrations ranging from 0.32 to 1.21 mol$/$kg. Structural properties are analyzed under ambient pressure at the experimentally relevant temperature $T = 353$ K. Since the slow dynamical processes governing ion transport in these systems are inaccessible to direct molecular dynamics, transport properties are simulated at elevated temperatures up to 900 K and extrapolated to $T = 353$ K using Arrhenius behavior. The results reveal strong ionic correlations, a limited fraction of free ions, and a predominance of negatively charged clusters, especially at high salt concentration. At high temperature, the self-diffusion coefficient of Li$^+$ exceeds that of PF$_6^-$ due to weaker Li$^+$-carbonate and ion-ion interactions. However, at $T = 353$ K, Li$^+$ mobility becomes lower than that of the anion, consistent with typical experimental observations in SPE. As expected, the ionic conductivity $\sigma$ increases with temperature, while at $T = 353$ K it exhibits a maximum for salt concentrations between 1.0 and 1.1 mol$/$kg. Overall, the estimated physico-chemical parameters highlight the key role of ion correlations in SPE and suggest strategies to optimize electrolyte performance. The Arrhenius extrapolation approach used here provides valuable insight into ion transport mechanisms in solid polymer electrolytes.</description>

      <title>DeepH-pack: A general-purpose neural network package for deep-learning electronic structure calculations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In computational physics and materials science, first-principles methods, particularly density functional theory, have become central tools for electronic structure prediction and materials design. Recently, rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have begun to reshape the research landscape, giving rise to the emerging field of deep-learning electronic structure calculations. Despite numerous pioneering studies, the field remains in its early stages; existing software implementations are often fragmented, lacking unified frameworks and standardized interfaces required for broad community adoption. Here we present DeepH-pack, a comprehensive and unified software package that integrates first-principles calculations with deep learning. By incorporating fundamental physical principles into neural-network design, such as the nearsightedness principle and the equivariance principle, DeepH-pack achieves robust cross-scale and cross-material generalizability. This allows models trained on small-scale structures to generalize to large-scale and previously unseen materials. The toolkit preserves first-principles accuracy while accelerating electronic structure calculations by several orders of magnitude, establishing an efficient and intelligent computational paradigm for large-scale materials simulation, high-throughput materials database construction, and AI-driven materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Nonclassical Nucleation Pathways in Liquid Condensation Revealed by Simulation and Theory</title>

Abstract: Using state-of-the-art rare-event sampling simulations, we precisely characterize the nucleation of liquid droplets from a supersaturated Lennard-Jones gas and uncover a key physical feature: critical clusters nucleate with a density that differs substantially from that of the macroscopic equilibrium liquid. Our atomistic simulations also reveal a nonclassical nucleation pathway showing simultaneous growth and densification in liquid condensation. We then exploit these insights to develop a two-variable nucleation theory, in which the cluster density is allowed to vary. Our accessible model based on the capillary approximation is able to quantitatively retrieve the numerical results in nucleation rate and critical cluster properties over a large range of supersaturation. Remarkably, the two-variable model successfully captures the observed nucleation pathway. The effectiveness of this integrated numerical and theoretical framework demonstrates that the cluster density is a decisive variable in nucleation, highlighting the limitations of the single-variable description while offering a robust foundation for its refinement.</description>

      <title>Transforming Acidic Corrosion and Embrittlement into a Hydrogen-Trapping Cage</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05481v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The vision of a hydrogen economy demands efficient platforms to close the gap between sustainable proton sources and solid-state hydrogen carriers. Metal hydrides serve as key carriers, yet their synthesis remains constrained by the energy-intensive use of high-pressure H2, which fragments the hydrogen chain. Here, we overturn this paradigm by transforming two classic degradation mechanisms, acidic corrosion and hydrogen embrittlement, into a constructive materials-design strategy. We demonstrate that synergistic control of these processes in acid enables the in-situ engineering of a "hydrogen-trapping cage" (HTC) microstructure within metals. Composed of a dense defect network, this cage directly captures and stabilizes protons as hydrides under mild conditions, guided by the universal criterion |DeltaPeq| &gt; DeltaPph. Using this platform, we synthesize over 20 hydrides, including challenging targets such as LiH and NaH, and showcase its functional power with a cage-rich titanium hydride electrocatalyst. This catalyst achieves an exceptional current density of 1.07 A cm-2 for nitrate-to-ammonia conversion, attributed to rapid H- transport within the engineered cage. This work establishes a transformative "failure-to-function" paradigm, delivering an integrated platform that unifies hydrogen capture, stabilization, and conversion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a coherent optical population transfer of weakly bound field-linked (FL) tetratomic molecules (tetramers) to deeper FL bound states using stimulated Raman adiabatic passage. We consider static-electric-field shielded polar alkali-metal diatomic molecules and corresponding FL tetramers in their $\textrm{X}^1\Sigma^+$+$\textrm{X}^1\Sigma^+$ ground electronic state. We show that the excited metastable $\textrm{X}^1\Sigma^+$+$\textrm{b}^3\Pi$ electronic manifold supports FL tetramers in a broader range of electric fields with collisional shielding extended to zero field. We calculate the Franck-Condon factors between the ground and excited FL tetramers and show that they are highly tunable with the electric field. We also predict photoassociation of ground-state shielded molecules to the excited FL states in free-bound optical transitions. We propose proof-of-principle experiments to implement stimulated Raman adiabatic passage and photoassociation using FL tetramers, paving the way for the formation of deeply bound ultracold polyatomic molecules.</description>

      <title>High-Fidelity Simulations of Two Miscible Fluids in Small Scale Turbulent Mixers Using a Variational Multiscale Finite Element Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Turbulent mixers have been widely used in industrial settings for chemical production and increasingly for therapeutic nanoparticle formulation by antisolvent precipitation. The quality of the product is closely related to the fluid and mixing dynamics inside the mixers. Due to the rapid time scales and small sizes of many turbulent mixing geometries, computational fluid dynamics simulations have been the primary tool used to predict and understand fluid behavior within these mixers. In this study, we used the residual-based variational multiscale finite element method to perform high-fidelity turbulent simulations on two commonly used turbulent mixers: the multi-inlet vortex mixer (MIVM) and the confined impinging jets mixer (CIJM). We simulated two geometric variations, two-inlets and four-inlets, of the MIVM and two different inflow ratios of the CIJM. Through detailed turbulence results, we identify differences in turbulence onset, total energy, and mixing performance of the two MIVM configurations. With the CIJM results, we demonstrate the effect of the flow rate ratio on the impingement behavior, and as a result, on the mixing performance and turbulence. The cross-comparison between the two mixers shows key differences in turbulence and mixing behaviors, such as the turbulence onset, the energy decay, and the output mixing index. This study demonstrates the importance of a high-accuracy numerical scheme in simulating the turbulent mixers and understanding the similarities and differences among mixers. Furthermore, the results show potential for optimizing the operating conditions to achieve the best mixing performance.</description>

Abstract: Electron accumulation in interatomic regions is a fundamental quantum phenomenon dictating chemical bonding and material properties, yet its origin remains elusive across disciplines. Here, we report a counterintuitive quantum effect -- potential-barrier affinity (PBA) -- revealed by solving the Schr\"odinger equation for a crystalline potential. PBA effect drives significant interatomic electron accumulation when electron energy exceeds the barrier maximum. This effect essentially determines interatomic electron density patterns, governing microstructures and properties of condensed matters. Our theory overturns the traditional wisdom that the interstitial electron localization in electride requires potential-well constraints or hybrid orbitals, and it serves the fundamental mechanism underlying the formation of conventional chemical bonds. This work delivers a paradigm shift in understanding electron distribution and establishes a theoretical foundation for the microscopic design of material properties.</description>

      <title>Addressing intramolecular vibrational redistribution in a single molecule through pump and probe surface-enhanced vibrational spectroscopy</title>

Abstract: The development of accurate tools to characterize Intramolecular Vibrational Redistribution (IVR) is of major interest in chemistry. In this context, surface-enhanced vibrational spectroscopies stand up as well-established techniques to study molecular vibrational lines and populations with a sensitivity that can reach the singe-molecule level. However, to date, this possibility has not been fully developed to address IVR. Here, we establish a quantum mechanical framework based on molecular optomechanics that accounts for IVR, and adopt it to analyze strategies to optimize IVR characterization by vibrational spectroscopy. In particular, we model two different pump-and-probe configurations where the vibrational pumping is provided either by infrared laser illumination or by Stokes SERS. We show for the two pumping configurations the existence of clear signatures on the anti-Stokes SERS spectra of population transfer between coupled vibrational modes in a molecule. Our calculations adopt realistic molecular and SERS parameters, suggesting that these signatures of IVR are accessible at the single-molecule level with current experimental platforms.</description>
