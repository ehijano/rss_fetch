      <title>VLTI/GRAVITY Observations of AF Lep b: Preference for Circular Orbits, Cloudy Atmospheres, and a Moderately Enhanced Metallicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct imaging observations are biased towards wide-separation, massive companions that have degenerate formation histories. Although the majority of exoplanets are expected to form via core accretion, most directly imaged exoplanets have not been convincingly demonstrated to follow this formation pathway. We obtained new interferometric observations of the directly imaged giant planet AF Lep b with the VLTI/GRAVITY instrument. We present three epochs of 50$\mu$as relative astrometry and the K-band spectrum of the planet for the first time at a resolution of R=500. Using only these measurements, spanning less than two months, and the Hipparcos-Gaia Catalogue of Accelerations, we are able to significantly constrain the planet's orbit; this bodes well for interferometric observations of planets discovered by Gaia DR4. Including all available measurements of the planet, we infer an effectively circular orbit ($e&lt;0.02, 0.07, 0.13$ at $1, 2, 3 \sigma$) in spin-orbit alignment with the host, and a measure a dynamical mass of $M_\mathrm{p}=3.75\pm0.5\,M_\mathrm{Jup}$. Models of the spectrum of the planet show that it is metal rich ([M/H]$=0.75\pm0.25$), with a C/O ratio encompassing the solar value. This ensemble of results show that the planet is consistent with core accretion formation.</description>

      <title>Migration of bodies in the Proxima Centauri and Trappist 1 planetary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The motion of planetesimals was studied in the Proxima Centauri and TRAPPIST 1 exoplanetary systems. The size of the feeding zone of planet Proxima Centauri c is discussed. It was noted that after hundreds of Myrs, some planetesimals could still move in elliptical resonant orbits inside the feeding zone of this planet that had been mainly cleared from planetesimals. The probability of a collision of a planetesimal initially located in the feeding zone of planet c with inner planet b was obtained to be about 0.0002 and 0.001 at initial eccentricity of orbits of planetesimals equal to 0.02 or 0.15, respectively. A lot of icy material and volatiles could be delivered from the icy zone near the orbit of planet c to inner planets b and d. The inclinations of orbits of 80% of the planetesimals that moved between 500 or 1200 AU from the star did not exceed 10o. It was obtained that several planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system accumulated planetesimals initially located at the same distance. Outer layers of neighbouring TRAPPIST-1 planets can include similar material.</description>

      <title>Migration of bodies ejected from the Earth and the Moon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study analyzes the motion of bodies ejected from the Earth or the Moon. We studied the ejection of bodies from several points on the Earth's surface, as well as from the most far point of the Moon from the Sun. Different velocities and angles of ejection of bodies were considered. The dynamical lifetimes of bodies reached a few hundred million years. Over the entire considered time interval, the values of the probability of a collision of a body ejected from the Earth with the Earth were approximately 0.3, 0.2, and 0.15-0.2 at an ejection velocity vej equaled to 11.5, 12, and 14 km/s, respectively. At vej&lt;11.3 km/s, most of the ejected bodies fell back onto the Earth. The total number of bodies delivered to the Earth and Venus probably did not differ much. The probabilities of collisions of bodies with Mercury and Mars usually did not exceed 0.1 and 0.02, respectively. At vej&gt;11.5 km/s, the probability of a collision of a body ejected from the Earth with the Moon was about 15-35 times less than that with the Earth, and it was about 0.01. The probability of a collision with the Earth for a body ejected from the Moon moving in its present orbit was about 0.3-0.32, 0.2-0.22, and 0.1-0.14 at vej=2.5 km/s, vej=5 km/s, and at 12&lt;vej&lt;16.4 km/s, respectively.</description>

      <title>The COBREX archival survey: improved constraints on the occurrence rate of wide-orbit substellar companions. I. A uniform re-analysis of 400 stars from the GPIES survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct imaging (DI) campaigns are uniquely suited to probing the outer regions around young stars and looking for giant exoplanet and brown dwarf companions, hence providing key complementary information to radial velocity (RV) and transit searches for the purpose of demographic studies. However, the critical 5-20 au region, where most giant planets are thought to form, remains poorly explored, lying in-between RV and DI capabilities. Significant gains in detection performances can be attained at no instrumental cost by means of advanced post-processing techniques. In the context of the COBREX project, we have assembled the largest collection of archival DI observations to date in order to undertake a large and uniform re-analysis. In particular, this paper details the re-analysis of 400 stars from the GPIES survey operated at GPI@Gemini South. Following the pre-reduction of raw frames, GPI data cubes were processed by means of the PACO algorithm. Candidates were identified and vetted based on multi-epoch proper motion analysis -- whenever possible -- and by means of a suitable color-magnitude diagram. The conversion of detection limits into detectability maps allowed for an estimate of unbiased occurrence frequencies of giant planets and brown dwarfs. Deeper detection limits were derived compared to the literature, with up to a twofold gain in minimum detectable mass compared to previous GPI-based publications. Although no new substellar companion was confirmed, we identified two interesting planet candidates awaiting follow-up observations. We derive an occurrence rate of $1.7_{-0.7}^{+0.9}\%$ for $5$~\mjup$ &lt; m &lt; 13$~\mjup planets in $10~\text{au}&lt; a &lt; 100~\text{au}$, that raises to $2.2_{-0.8}^{+1.0}\%$ when including substellar objects up to 80 \mjup.(abridged)</description>

      <title>Detecting Secular Perturbations in Kepler Planetary Systems Using Simultaneous Impact Parameter Variation Analysis (SIPVA)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recovering impact parameter variations in multi-planet systems is an effective approach for detecting non-transiting planets and refining planetary mass estimates. Traditionally, two methodologies have been employed: the Individual Fit, which fits each transit independently to analyze impact parameter changes, and the Dynamical Fit, which simulates planetary dynamics to match transit light curves. We introduce a new fitting method, Simultaneous Impact Parameter Variation Analysis (SIPVA), which outperforms the Individual Fit and is computationally more efficient than the Dynamical Fit. SIPVA directly integrates a linear time-dependent model for impact parameters into the Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) algorithm by fitting all transits simultaneously. We evaluate SIPVA and the Individual Fit on artificial systems with varying LLRs and find that SIPVA consistently outperforms the Individual Fit in recovery rates and accuracy. When applied to selected Kepler planetary candidates exhibiting significant transit duration variations (TDVs), SIPVA identifies significant impact parameter trends in 10 out of 16 planets. In contrast, the Individual Fit does so in only 4. We also employ probabilistic modeling to calculate the theoretical distribution of planets with significant impact parameter variations across all observed Kepler systems and compare the distribution of recovered candidates by the Individual Fit and Dynamical Fit from previous work with our theoretical distribution. Our findings offer an alternative framework for analyzing planetary transits, relying solely on Bayesian inference without requiring prior assumptions about the planetary system's dynamical architecture.</description>

      <title>Detection and Characterisation of Giant Planets with Gaia Astrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrometric observations with Gaia are expected to play a valuable role in future exoplanet surveys. With current data from Gaia's third data release (DR3), we are sensitive to periods from less than 1 year to more than 4 years but, unlike radial velocity are not as restricted by the orbital inclination of a potential planet. The presence and potential properties of a companion affect the primary's renormalised unit weight error (RUWE) making this a valuable quantity in the search for exoplanets. Using this value and the fitted astrometric tracks from Gaia, we use Bayesian inference to constrain the mass and orbital parameters of companions in known systems. Combining this with radial velocity measurements, we show it is possible to independently measure mass and inclination and suggest HD 66141 b is a possible brown dwarf with maximum mass 23.9$^{+7.2}_{-6.4}$ M$_{\mathrm{J}}$. We show how this method may be applied to directly imaged planets in the future, using $\beta$-Pictoris c as an example but note that the host star is bright and active, making it difficult to draw clear conclusions. We show how the next Gaia data release, which will include epoch astrometry, will allow us to accurately constrain orbital parameters from astrometric data alone, revolutionising future searches for exoplanets. Combining predicted observational limits on planet mass with theoretical distributions, we estimate the probability that a star with a given RUWE will host a detectable planet, which will be highly valuable in planning future surveys.</description>

      <title>Migration of Bodies to the Earth from Different Distances from the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Migration of bodies under the gravitational influence of almost formed planets was studied, and probabilities of their collisions with the Earth and other terrestrial planets were calculated. Based on the probabilities, several conclusions on the accumulation of the terrestrial planets have been made. The outer layers of the Earth and Venus could accumulate similar planetesimals from different regions of the feeding zone of the terrestrial planets. The probabilities of collisions of bodies during their dynamical lifetimes with the Earth could be up to 0.001-0.01 for some initial semi-major axes between 3.2 and 3.6 AU, whereas such probabilities did not exceed 10^-5 at initial semi-major axes between 12 and 40 AU. The total mass of water delivered to the Earth from beyond Jupiter's orbit could exceed the mass of the Earth's oceans. The zone of the outer asteroid belt could be one of the sources of the late-heavy bombardment. The bodies that came from the zone of Jupiter and Saturn typically collided with the Earth and the Moon with velocities from 23 to 26 km/s and from 20 to 23 km/s, respectively.</description>

      <title>Behaviors of Martian CO2-driven dry climate system and conditions for atmospheric collapses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present Martian climate is characterized by a cold and dry environment with a thin atmosphere of carbon dioxides (CO2). In such conditions, the planetary climate and habitability are determined by the distribution of CO2 between exchangeable reservoirs, that is the atmosphere, ice caps, and regolith. This produces unique responses of the Martian CO2-driven climate system to variations of astronomical forcings. Specifically, it has been shown that the phenomenon called an atmospheric collapse occurs when the axial obliquity is low, affecting the Martian climatic evolution. However, the behavior of the Martian climate system and the accompanying changes in climate and habitability of such planets remain ambiguous. Here we employed a latitudinally-resolved Martian energy balance model and assessed the possible climate on Mars for wider ranges of orbital parameters, solar irradiance, and total exchangeable CO2 mass. We show that the atmospheric collapse occurs when the obliquity is below ~10 degrees when other parameters are kept at the present Mars condition. We also show that the climate solutions on Mars depend on orbital parameters, solar luminosity, and the total exchangeable CO2 mass. We found that the atmospheric collapse would have occurred repeatedly in the history of Mars following the variation of the axial obliquity, while the long-term evolution of atmospheric pCO2 is also affected by the changes in the total exchangeable CO2 mass in Martian history. Even considering the broad ranges of these parameters, the habitable conditions in the Martian CO2-driven dry climate system would be limited to high-latitude summers.</description>

      <title>ASTERIA -- Thermal Inertia Evaluation of asteroid Didymos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asteroid Didymos, recently targeted by the NASA DART mission, is also planned to be visited by the ESA Hera mission. The main goal of the DART mission was to impact Dimorphos, the small satellite of Didymos, which was accomplished in September 2022. This collision altered the Didymos-Dimorphos system, generating a notable quantity of ejecta that turned Dimorphos into an active asteroid, with some ejecta potentially settling on the surfaces of both components. This prompts the investigation into the extent of post-impact surface alterations on these bodies compared to their original states.
  The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pre-impact thermal inertia of Didymos independently. We employed ASTERIA, an alternative to conventional thermophysical modeling, to estimate the surface thermal inertia of Didymos. The approach is based on a model-to-measurement comparison of the Yarkovsky effect-induced drift on the orbital semi-major axis. These results, alongside existing literature, enable an evaluation of the impact-induced alterations in Didymos's thermal inertia.
  Our nominal estimate with a constant thermal inertia model stands at $\Gamma = 211_{-55}^{+81}$ J m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$ s$^{-1/2}$, while assuming it varies with the heliocentric distance with an exponent of $-0.75$ thermal inertia of Didymos is found to be $258_{-63}^{+94}$ J m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$ s$^{-1/2}$. Subsequent verification confirmed that this result is robust against variations in unknown physical parameters. The thermal inertia estimates for Didymos align statistically with values reported in the literature, derived from both pre- and post-impact data. The forthcoming Hera mission will provide an opportunity to corroborate these findings further. Additionally, our results support the hypothesis that the thermal inertia of near-Earth asteroids is generally lower than previously expected.</description>

      <title>Stellar occultations by Trans-Neptunian Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar occultations provide a powerful tool to explore objects of the outer solar system. The Gaia mission now provides milli-arcsec accuracy on the predictions of these events and makes possible observations that were previously unthinkable. Occultations return kilometric accuracies on the three-dimensional shape of bodies irrespective of their geocentric distances, with the potential of detecting topographic features along the limb. From the shape, accurate values of albedo can be derived, and if the mass is known, the bulk density is pinned down, thus constraining the internal structure and equilibrium state of the object. Occultations are also extremely sensitive to tenuous atmospheres, down to the nanobar level. They allowed the monitoring of Pluto's and Triton's atmospheres in the last three decades, constraining their seasonal evolution. They may unveil in the near future atmospheres around other remote bodies of the solar system. Since 2013, occultations have led to the surprising discovery of ring systems around the Centaur object Chariklo, the dwarf planet Haumea and the large trans-Neptunian object Quaoar, while revealing dense material around the Centaur Chiron. This suggests that rings are probably much more common features than previously thought. Meanwhile, they have raised new dynamical questions concerning the confining effect of resonances forced by irregular objects on ring particles. Serendipitous occultations by km-sized trans-Neptunian or Oort objects has the potential to provide the size distribution of a population that suffered few collisions until now, thus constraining the history of primordial planetesimals in the 1-100 km range.</description>

      <title>The emergence of the Md-Macc correlation in the MHD wind scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is still much uncertainty around the mechanism that rules the accretion of proto-planetary disks. In the last years, Magnetohydrondynamic (MHD) wind-driven accretion has been proposed as a valid alternative to the more conventional viscous accretion. In particular, winds have been shown to reproduce the observed correlation between the mass of the disk Md and the mass accretion rate onto the central star Macc, but this has been done only for specific conditions. It is not clear whether this implies fine tuning or if it is a general result. We investigate under which conditions the observed correlation between the mass of the disk Md and the mass accretion rate onto the central star Macc can be obtained. We find that, in the absence of a correlation between the initial mass M0 and the initial accretion timescale tacc,0, the slope of the Md-Macc correlation depends on the value of the spread of the initial conditions of masses and lifetimes of disks. Then, we clarify the conditions under which a disk population can be fitted with a single power-law. Moreover, we derive an analytical expression for the spread of log(Md/Macc) valid when the spread of tacc is taken to be constant. In the presence of a correlation between M0 and tacc,0, we derive an analytical expression for the slope of the Md-Macc correlation in the initial conditions of disks and at late times. We conclude that MHD winds can predict the observed values of the slope and the spread of the Md-Macc correlation under a broad range of initial conditions. This is a fundamental expansion of previous works on the MHD paradigm, exploring the establishment of this fundamental correlation beyond specific initial conditions.</description>

      <title>SCExAO/CHARIS Spectroscopic Characterization of Cloudy L/T Transition Companion Brown Dwarf HIP 93398 B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brown dwarfs with measured dynamical masses and spectra from direct imaging are benchmarks that anchor substellar atmosphere cooling and evolution models. We present Subaru SCExAO/CHARIS infrared spectroscopy of HIP 93398 B, a brown dwarf companion recently discovered by Li et al. 2023 as part of an informed survey using the Hipparcos-Gaia Catalog of Accelerations. This object was previously classified as a T6 dwarf based on its luminosity, with its independently-derived age and dynamical mass in tension with existing models of brown dwarf evolution. Spectral typing via empirical standard spectra, temperatures derived by fitting substellar atmosphere models, and J-H, J-K and H-L' colors all suggest that this object has a substantially higher temperature and luminosity, consistent with classification as a late-L dwarf near the L/T transition (T = 1200$^{+140}_{-119}$ K) with moderate to thick clouds possibly present in its atmosphere. When compared with the latest generation of evolution models that account for clouds with our revised luminosity and temperature for the object, the tension between the model-independent mass/age and model predictions is resolved.</description>

      <title>Magnetic interaction of stellar coronal mass ejections with close-in exoplanets: implication on planetary mass loss and Ly-$\alpha$ transits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06283</link>

Abstract: Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) erupting from the host star are expected to have effects on the atmospheric erosion processes of the orbiting planets. For planets with a magnetosphere, the embedded magnetic field in the CMEs is thought to be the most important parameter to affect planetary mass loss. In this work, we investigate the effect of different magnetic field structures of stellar CMEs on the atmosphere of a hot Jupiter with a dipolar magnetosphere. We use a time-dependent 3D radiative magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) atmospheric escape model that self-consistently models the outflow from hot Jupiters magnetosphere and its interaction with stellar CMEs. For our study, we consider three configurations of magnetic field embedded in stellar CMEs -- (a) northward $B_z$ component, (b) southward $B_z$ component, and (c) radial component. {We find that both the CMEs with northward $B_z$ component and southward $B_z$ component increase the planetary mass-loss rate when the CME arrives from the stellar side, with the mass-loss rate remaining higher for the CME with northward $B_z$ component until it arrives at the opposite side.} The largest magnetopause is found for the CME with a southward $B_z$ component when the dipole and the CME magnetic field have the same direction. We also find that during the passage of a CME, the planetary magnetosphere goes through three distinct changes - (1) compressed magnetosphere, (2) enlarged magnetosphere, and (3) relaxed magnetosphere for all three considered CME configurations. We compute synthetic Ly-$\alpha$ transits at different times during the passage of the CMEs. The synthetic Ly-$\alpha$ transit absorption generally increases when the CME is in interaction with the planet for all three magnetic configurations. The maximum Ly-$\alpha$ absorption is found for the radial CME case when the magnetosphere is the most compressed.</description>

      <title>Simulating Solar Neighborhood Brown Dwarfs I: The Luminosity Function Above and Below the Galactic Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brown dwarfs form the key, yet poorly understood, link between stellar and planetary astrophysics. These objects offer unique tests of Galactic structure, but observational limitations have inhibited the large-scale analysis of these objects to date. Major upcoming sky surveys will reveal unprecedented numbers of brown dwarfs, among even greater numbers of stellar objects, enabling the statistical study of brown dwarfs. To extract the comparatively rare brown dwarfs from these massive datasets, we must understand how they will look in upcoming surveys. In this work, we construct a synthetic population of brown dwarfs in the Solar Neighborhood to explore their evolutionary properties using Gaia-derived star formation histories alongside observational mass, metallicity, and age relationships. We apply the cloudless Sonora Bobcat, hybrid SM08, and gravity-dependent hybrid Sonora Diamondback evolutionary models to the sample. We present the simulated luminosity function and its evolution with distance from the Galactic Plane. Our simulation shows that brown dwarf population statistics are a function of height above/below the Galactic Plane and sample different age distributions. Interpreting the local sample requires combining evolutionary models, the initial mass function, the star formation history, and kinematic heating. Our models are a guide to how well height-dependent samples can test these scenarios. Sub-populations of brown dwarfs farther from the Plane are older and occupy a different region of brown dwarf parameter space than younger sub-populations closer to the Galactic Plane. Therefore, fully exploring population statistics both near and far from the Plane is critical to prepare for upcoming surveys.</description>

      <title>CARMENES input catalogue of M dwarfs VIII. Kinematics in the solar neighbourhood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aims. Our goals are to characterise the kinematic properties and to identify young and old stars among the M dwarfs of the CARMENES input catalogue. Methods. We compiled the spectral types, proper motions, distances, and radial velocities for 2187 M dwarfs. We used the public code SteParKin to derive their galactic space velocities and identify members in the different galactic populations. We also identified candidate members in young stellar kinematic groups, with ages ranging from 1 Ma to 800 Ma with SteParKin, LACEwING, and BANYAN {\Sigma}. We removed known close binaries and perform an analysis of kinematic, rotation, and activity indicators (rotational periods and projected velocities, Halpha, X-rays, and UV emission) for 1546 M dwarfs. We defined five rotation-activity-colour relations satisfied by young ({\tau} &lt;= 800 Ma) stars. Results. We identified 191 young M dwarf candidates (~12%), 113 of which are newly recognised in this work. In this young sample, there are 118 very active stars based on H{\alpha} emission, fast rotation, and X-ray and UV emission excess. Of them, 27 have also strong magnetic fields, 9 of which are likely younger than 50 Ma. Additionally, there are 87 potentially young stars and 99 stars with a dubious youth classification, which may increase the fraction of young stars to an astounding 24%. Only one star out of the 2187 exhibits kinematics typical of the old Galactic halo. Conclusions. A combined analysis of kinematic and rotation-activity properties provides a robust method for identifying young M dwarfs from archival data. However, more observational efforts are needed to ascertain the true nature of numerous young star candidates in the field and, perhaps more importantly, to precisely quantify their age.</description>

      <title>Breaking degeneracies in exoplanetary parameters through self-consistent atmosphere-interior modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04470v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context: A new generation of instruments (e.g., JWST, ELTs, PLATO and Ariel) is providing atmospheric spectra and mass/radius measurements for large exoplanet populations, challenging planetary models used to interpret these findings. Aims: We develop a new model, the Heat Atmosphere Density Evolution Solver (HADES), by coupling an atmosphere and interior model self-consistently and comparing its results to observed data. Methods: Atmospheric calculations are performed under radiative-convective equilibrium, while the interior relies on recent ab initio equations of state. We ensure continuity in the thermal, gravity, and molecular mass profiles between models. Results: The model is applied to the known exoplanet database to characterize intrinsic thermal properties. We find that intrinsic temperatures (T$_{int}$) of 200-400 K, increasing with equilibrium temperature, are needed to explain radius inflation in hot Jupiters. Additionally, we perform atmosphere-interior retrievals using observed spectra and measured parameters for WASP-39 b and 51 Eridani b. For WASP-39 b, spectroscopic data breaks degeneracies in metallicity and Tint, deriving high values: Z = 14.79$^{+1.80}_{-1.91}$ x Solar and T$_{int} = 297.39^{+8.95}_{-16.9}$ K. For 51 Eridani b, we show the importance of using self-consistent models with radius as a constrained parameter, deriving a planet mass M$_{p} = 3.13^{+0.05}_{-0.04}$ M$_{J}$ and a core mass M$_{core} = 31.86^{+0.32}_{-0.18}$ M$_{E}$, suggesting formation via core accretion with a "hot start." Conclusions: Self-consistent atmosphere-interior models can efficiently break degeneracies in the structure of transiting and directly imaged exoplanets, offering new insights into exoplanet formation and evolution.</description>

      <title>HD 119130 b is not an "ultra-dense" sub-Neptune</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a revised mass measurement for HD 119130 b (aka K2-292 b), a transiting planet ($P = 17$ days, $R_\mathrm{p} = 2.63^{+0.11}_{-0.10}$ $R_\mathrm{\oplus}$) orbiting a chromospherically inactive G dwarf, previously thought to be one of the densest sub-Neptunes known. Our follow-up Doppler observations with HARPS, HARPS-N, and HIRES reveal that HD 119130 b is, in fact, nearly one-third as massive as originally suggested by its initial confirmation paper. Our revised analysis finds $M_\mathrm{p} = 8.8 \pm 3.2$ $M_\mathrm{\oplus}$ ($M_\mathrm{p} &lt; 15.4$ $M_\mathrm{\oplus}$ at 98\% confidence) compared to the previously reported $M_\mathrm{p} = 24.5 \pm 4.4$ $M_\mathrm{\oplus}$. While the true cause of the original mass measurement's inaccuracy remains uncertain, we present the plausible explanation that the planet's radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude was inflated due to constructive interference with a second, untreated sinusoidal signal in the data (possibly rotational modulation from the star). HD 119130 b illustrates the complexities of interpreting the RV orbits of small transiting planets. While RV mass measurements of such planets may be precise, they are not necessarily guaranteed to be accurate. This system serves as a cautionary tale as observers and theorists alike look to the exoplanet mass-radius diagram for insights into the physics of small planet formation.</description>

      <title>The impact of observing cadence and undetected companions on the accuracy of planet mass measurements from radial velocity monitoring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conduct experiments on both real and synthetic radial velocity (RV) data to quantify the impact that observing cadence, the number of RV observations, and undetected companions all have on the accuracy of small planet mass measurements. We run resampling experiments on four systems with small transiting planets and substantial public data from HIRES in order to explore how degrading observing cadence and the number of RVs affects the planets' mass measurement relative to a baseline value. From these experiments, we recommend that observers obtain 2--3 RVs per orbit of the inner-most planet and acquire at minimum 40 RVs. Following these guidelines, we then conduct simulations using synthetic RVs to explore the impact of undetected companions and untreated red noise on the masses of planets with known orbits. While undetected companions generally do not bias the masses of known planets, in some cases, when coupled with an inadequate observing baseline, they can cause the mass of an inner transiting planet to be systematically overestimated on average.</description>

      <title>The cold Jupiter eccentricity distribution is consistent with EKL driven by stellar companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The large eccentricities of cold Jupiters and the existence of hot Jupiters have long challenged theories of planet formation. A proposed solution to both of these puzzles is high-eccentricity migration, in which an initially cold Jupiter is excited to high eccentricities before being tidally circularized. Secular perturbations from an inclined stellar companion are a potential source of eccentricity oscillations, a phenomenon known as the Eccentric Kozai-Lidov (EKL) mechanism. Previous studies have found that the cold Jupiter eccentricity distribution produced by EKL is inconsistent with observations. However, these studies assumed all planets start on circular orbits. Here, we revisit this question, considering that an initial period of planet-planet scattering on $\sim$Myr timescales likely places planets on slightly eccentric orbits before being modulated by EKL on $\sim$Myr-Gyr timescales. Small initial eccentricities can have a dramatic effect by enabling EKL to act at lower inclinations. We numerically integrate the secular hierarchical three-body equations of motion, including general relativity and tides, for populations of cold giant planets in stellar binaries with varied initial eccentricity distributions. For populations with modest initial mean eccentricities, the simulated eccentricity distribution produced by EKL is statistically consistent with the observed eccentricities of cold single-planet systems. The lower eccentricities in a multi-planet control sample suggest that planetary companions quench stellar EKL. We show that scattering alone is unlikely to reproduce the present-day eccentricity distribution. We also show that the anisotropic inclination distribution produced by EKL may lead radial velocity measurements to underestimate giant planet masses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.01165v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Herbig Ae/Be stars are young contracting stars on the radiative track in the HR diagram on their way to the main sequence. These stars provide a valuable link between high and low mass stars. Here we review the progress that has been made in our understanding of these fascinating objects and their disks since the last major review on this topic published in 1998. We begin with a general overview of these stars and their properties. We then discuss the accretion of circumstellar material onto these stars. Next we discuss the dust and gas properties of the circumstellar disk before exploring the evidence for planet formation in these disks. We conclude with a brief discussion of future prospects for deepening our understanding of these sources and propose a new working definition of Herbig Ae/Be stars.</description>

      <title>Topology of shallow-water waves on the rotating sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological properties of the spectrum of shallow-water waves on a rotating spherical body are established. Particular attention is paid to its spectral flow, i.e. the modes whose frequencies transit between the Rossby and inertia-gravity wavebands as the zonal wave number is varied. Organising the modes according to the number of zeros of their meridional velocity, we conclude that the net number of modes transiting between the shallow-water wavebands on the sphere is null, in contrast with the Matsuno spectrum. This difference can be explained by a miscount of zeros under the $\beta$-plane approximation. We corroborate this result with the analysis of Delplace et al (2017) by showing that the curved metric discloses a pair of degeneracy points in the Weyl symbol of the wave operator, non-existent under the $\beta$-plane approximation, each of them bearing a Chern number $-1$.</description>

      <title>AstroMLab 1: Who Wins Astronomy Jeopardy!?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of proprietary and open-weights large language models using the first astronomy-specific benchmarking dataset. This dataset comprises 4,425 multiple-choice questions curated from the Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics, covering a broad range of astrophysical topics. Our analysis examines model performance across various astronomical subfields and assesses response calibration, crucial for potential deployment in research environments. Claude-3.5-Sonnet outperforms competitors by up to 4.6 percentage points, achieving 85.0% accuracy. For proprietary models, we observed a universal reduction in cost every 3-to-12 months to achieve similar score in this particular astronomy benchmark. open-weights models have rapidly improved, with LLaMA-3-70b (80.6%) and Qwen-2-72b (77.7%) now competing with some of the best proprietary models. We identify performance variations across topics, with non-English-focused models generally struggling more in exoplanet-related fields, stellar astrophysics, and instrumentation related questions. These challenges likely stem from less abundant training data, limited historical context, and rapid recent developments in these areas. This pattern is observed across both open-weights and proprietary models, with regional dependencies evident, highlighting the impact of training data diversity on model performance in specialized scientific domains. Top-performing models demonstrate well-calibrated confidence, with correlations above 0.9 between confidence and correctness, though they tend to be slightly underconfident. The development for fast, low-cost inference of open-weights models presents new opportunities for affordable deployment in astronomy. The rapid progress observed suggests that LLM-driven research in astronomy may become feasible in the near future.</description>

      <title>Creation of an Fe$_3$P Schreibersite Density Functional Tight Binding Model for Astrobiological Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mineral schreibersite, e.g., Fe$_3$P, is commonly found in iron-rich meteorites and could have served as an abiotic phosphorus source for prebiotic chemistry. However, atomistic calculations of its degradation chemistry generally require quantum simulation approaches, which can be too computationally cumbersome to study sufficient time and length scales for this process. In this regard, we have created a computationally efficient semi-empirical quantum Density Functional Tight Binding (DFTB) model for iron and phosphorus-containing materials by adopting an existing semi-automated workflow that represents many-body interactions by linear combinations of Chebyshev polynomials. We have utilized a relatively small training set to optimize a DFTB model that is accurate for schreibersite physical and chemical properties, including its bulk properties, surface energies, and water absorption. We then show that our model shows strong transferability to several iron phosphide solids as well as multiple allotropes of iron metal. Our resulting DFTB parameterization will allow us to interrogate schreibersite aqueous decomposition at longer time and length scales than standard quantum approaches, allowing for investigations of its role in prebiotic chemistry on early Earth.</description>

      <title>A tell-tale tracer for externally irradiated protoplanetary disks: comparing the [CI] 8727 A line and ALMA observations in proplyds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The evolution of protoplanetary disks in regions with massive OB stars is influenced by externally driven winds that deplete the outer parts of disks. These winds have previously been studied via forbidden oxygen emission lines, which also arise in isolated disks in low-mass star forming-regions (SFRs) with weak external UV fields in photoevaporative or magnetic (internal) disk winds. It is crucial to determine how to disentangle external winds from internal ones. Here, we report a proxy for unambiguously identifying externally driven winds with a forbidden line of neutral atomic carbon, [C i] 8727 A. We compare for the first time the spatial location of the emission in the [O i] 5577 A, [O i] 6300 A, and [C i] 8727 A lines traced by VLT/MUSE-NFM, with the ALMA Band 7 continuum disk emission in a sample of 12 proplyds in the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC). We confirm that the [O i] 5577 A emission is co-spatial with the disk emission, whereas the [O i] 6300 A is emitted both on the disk surface and on the ionization front of the proplyds. We show for the first time that the [C i] 8727 A line is also co-spatial with the disk surface in proplyds, as seen in the MUSE and ALMA data comparison. To verify whether the [C i] 8727 A line is detected in regions where external photoevaporation is not expected, we examine VLT/X-Shooter spectra for young stars in low-mass SFRs. Although the [O i] lines are well detected in all these targets, there is &lt;&lt;10% detection rate in the case of the [C i] 8727 A line. This number increases substantially to a ~40% detection rate in sigma-Orionis, a region with intermediate UV radiation. The spatial location of the [C i] 8727 A line emission and the lack of its detection in isolated disks in low-mass SFRs strongly suggest that this line is a tell-tale tracer of externally driven photoevaporative winds, which agrees with recent excitation models.</description>
