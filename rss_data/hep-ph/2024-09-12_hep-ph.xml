      <title>Searching for Dark Matter Interactions with ACT, SPT and DES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models of a dark radiation sector with a mass threshold (WZDR+) have proved to be an appealing alternative to $\Lambda$CDM. These models provide simple comparison models, grounded in well-understood particle physics and with limited additional parameters. In addition, they have shown relevance in easing existing cosmological tensions, specifically the $H_0$ tension and the $S_8$ tension. Recently, measurements of CMB lensing by the ACT collaboration have provided strong additional information on clustering at late times. Within $\Lambda$CDM, these results yield a high value of $S_8$ at odds with weak-lensing measurements. In this work, we study this in the context of WZDR+, and find a much wider range of allowed values of $S_8$, and in particular much better agreement between data sets and an overall improvement of fit versus $\Lambda$CDM. We expand our analyses to include a wide set of data, including the ACT-DR6 lensing data, as well as primary CMB information from ACT-DR4 and SPT-3G, scale-dependent power spectra from DES and measurements of $H_0$ from SH0ES. We find that there is little to no tension in measurements of structure within the data sets, and the inferred value of $S_8$ is generally lower than that in $\Lambda$CDM. We find that the inclusion of DES generally favors a higher $H_0$, but there is some direct tension between the high-$\ell$ multipole data and this result. Future data should clarify whether this is a statistical artifact, or a true incompatibility of these datasets within this model.</description>

      <title>Faking ZZZ vertices at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Searches for anomalous neutral triple gauge boson couplings (NTGCs) provide important tests for the gauge structure of the standard model. At the LHC, NTGCs are searched for via the process $pp \to ZZ \to 4l$, where the two $Z$-bosons are on-shell. In this paper, we discuss how the same process can occur through tree-level diagrams just adding a vector-like quark (VLQ) to the standard model. Since NTGCs are generated in standard model effective theory (SMEFT) only at 1-loop order, vector like quarks could be an important alternative interpretation to, and background for, NTGC searches. Here, we construct a simple example model, discuss low-energy constraints and estimate current and future sensitivities on the model parameters from $pp \to ZZ \to 4l$ searches.</description>

      <title>Baryon stopping and charge deposition in heavy-ion collisions due to gluon saturation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute baryon and electric charge deposition in high-energy heavy-ion collisions using the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) Effective Field Theory, where at leading order charge is deposited through multiple scatterings of valence quarks with a saturated gluon target. A simplified phenomenological formula is derived to describe charge deposition, from which the parametrical dependence with collisional energy and geometry can be extracted. We present an approximate analytical prediction of the so-called baryon stopping parameter $\alpha_B$, which shows excellent agreement with the state-of-the art extractions of $\alpha_B$ from experimental data. These results are further validated using the McDIPPER framework, by computing charge deposition at midrapidity across a range of collision energies ($\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}= 62.4 - 5020$ GeV).</description>

      <title>Malaphoric $Z'$ models for $b \rightarrow s \ell^+ \ell^-$ anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study some phenomenological effects of kinetic mixing between the hypercharge field and a new $U(1)$ gauge field in specific $Z^\prime$ models that ameliorate the tensions between measurements and Standard Model predictions in $b \rightarrow s\ell^+ \ell^-$ decays. To this end, we rederive the dimension-6 SMEFT coefficients resulting from integrating out the kinetically-mixed (`malaphoric') $Z^\prime$ field. The kinetic mixing provides a family-universal component to the couplings of the $Z^\prime$ field, which can improve fits to lepton flavour universality observables. We show how kinetic mixing improves the best fit of the $B_3-L_2$ model to $b\rightarrow s$ data by 7.3 units of $\chi^2$ while remaining compatible with other relevant data sets such as electroweak precision observables and measurements of $e^+ e^- \rightarrow \ell^+ \ell^-$ at LEP2.</description>

      <title>Azimuthal modulations and extraction of generalized parton distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Azimuthal modulations are crucial for the phenomenological extraction and separation of various generalized parton distributions. We provide a new choice of frame and corresponding formalism to describe the azimuthal distributions, based on the separation of physics occurring at different momentum scales. We demonstrate that this new description is not only well-suited for experimental analysis, but also advantageous in separating contributions from different subprocesses to the same physical cross section.</description>

      <title>Wigner rotations for cascade reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cascade parameterization of hadronic reactions is a central tool in hadron spectroscopy for modeling matrix elements and extracting parameters of hadronic states. Implementing the helicity formalism consistently presents challenges, particularly for particles with spin, due to the need for matching spin states of final-state particles, known as the Wigner rotations. This paper discusses these challenges in detail and offers solutions, including a practical method for implementation. Equipped with a general algorithm for computing Wigner rotations, we extend the studies to alternative amplitude formulations, the minus-phi and canonical conventions.</description>

      <title>Detect anomalous quartic gauge couplings at muon colliders with quantum kernel k-means</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, with the increasing luminosities of colliders, handling the growing amount of data has become a major challenge for future New Physics~(NP) phenomenological research. To improve efficiency, machine learning algorithms have been introduced into the field of high-energy physics. As a machine learning algorithm, kernel k-means has been demonstrated to be useful for searching NP signals. It is well known that the kernel k-means algorithm can be carried out with the help of quantum computing, which suggests that quantum kernel k-means~(QKKM) is also a potential tool for NP phenomenological studies in the future. This paper investigates how to search for NP signals using the k-means anomaly detection event selection strategy with quantum kernels. Taking the $\mu^+\mu^-\to v\bar{v}\gamma\gamma$ process at a muon collider as an example, the dimension-8 operators contributing to anomalous quartic gauge couplings~(aQGCs) are studied. The expected coefficient constraints obtained using the QKKM of three different forms of quantum kernels and k-means algorithm are presented, it can be shown that QKKM can help to find the signal of aQGCs.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic linear waves and breakdown of the momentum expansion in spin magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate spin magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) by including the magnetic-flux and total angular momentum conservation laws in the hydrodynamic framework. To specify the local angular momentum conservation, we choose the totally antisymmetric spin current. The entropy-current analysis allows for ten dissipative first-order transport coefficients including anisotropic spin relaxation rates and the conversion rate between a vorticity (shear) to a symmetric stress (antisymmetric torque). By employing the linear-mode analysis, we solve the first-order spin MHD equations to determine the dispersion relations with the complete information of anisotropy retained. Our analytic solutions indicate that the small-momentum expansion is spoiled by blow up of the higher-order terms when the angle between the momentum and the magnetic field approaches the right angle. This also reveals the existence of another expansion parameter, and, in light of it, we provide solutions in an alternative series expression beyond the critical angle. We confirm that these two series expansions work well in the appropriate angle ranges as compared with numerical results.</description>

      <title>Finite Energy Resolution, Correlations Between Bins and Non-Nested Hypotheses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that whenever independent events are binned, there is no correlation between bins. In particular, neither the uncertainty in the energy resolution nor a systematic error in the energy response of a detector will lead to a correlation between bins. This is in contrast with a result that recently appeared in the literature, where it was claimed that the finite energy resolution could induce correlation between bins, changing the distribution of $\Delta\chi^2$ when attempting to determine the neutrino mass ordering using reactor neutrinos. We will compute the expression for the variance of $\Delta\chi^2$ in the case of non-nested hypotheses if correlations between bins are present, showing that they could indeed affect the distribution. We will also show, however, that the detector response cannot introduce statistical correlations between bins unless these are already present in the original spectrum. Both of these results are valid in general: the absence of correlation is true for any detector response and the distribution of $\Delta\chi^2$ in the presence of (intrinsic) correlations, while obtained having the mass ordering in mind, it is true for any non-nested hypotheses.</description>

      <title>CP violation at finite temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the finite temperature CP-asymmetry factor needed in the semi-classical treatment of leptogenesis originating from Majorana fermion decays into a lepton and a scalar particle. The imaginary part of the relevant one-loop integrals are evaluated using both the real time and the imaginary time formalisms of thermal quantum field theory. In the former we consider the retarded-advanced approach as well as the original thermal cutting method developed by Kobes and Semenoff. Specific care is directed towards showing the consistency between the various approaches. We show that the final physical result of the calculation is linear in the statistical factors and is consistent with what is obtained in the Kadanoff-Baym approach. We also present analytic expressions for the full CP-asymmetry factor in the form of well-behaved triple-integrals, and provide numerical benchmark predictions in a specific particle physics model.</description>

      <title>Muon anomalous magnetic moment and Right handed sterile neutrino</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The muon's magnetic moment is a fundamental quantity in particle physics and the deviation of its value from quantum electrodynamics (QED), motivates research beyond the standard models (SM). In this study, we utilize the effective coupling of right-handed sterile neutrinos with SM gauge bosons to calculate the muon anomalous magnetic moment ($\boldsymbol{\mu}$AMM) at one-loop level. The contribution of the sterile neutrino interactions on the $\boldsymbol{\mu}$AMM is calculated by considering the standard and non-standard neutrino interactions. Our results show that the standard sterile neutrino interactions give a negligible contribution to $\Delta a_{\boldsymbol{\mu}}$ while the non-standard neutrino interactions can play a significant role in explaining the muon $(g-2)$ anomaly. In the context of the non-standard neutrino interaction, our calculation shows that a Dirac mass scale $M_D$ around $100\,\text{GeV}$ could explain the muon anomaly if the right handed sterile neutrino's coupling with SM particles is about $\mathcal{G}_R\approx 10^{-3}$. We have also plotted the allowed region of the model parameters that satisfy the experimental data on $\Delta a_{{\boldsymbol{\mu}}}^{SN}$ and discuss the percentage of the ${\boldsymbol{\mu}}$ anomaly compensation in terms of the coupling constant $\mathcal{G}_R$.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological model for the $\gamma^*\gamma \to \eta \pi^+ \pi^-$ reaction in the $f_1(1285)$ energy region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the ongoing analysis of the BESIII Collaboration on the single-tagged $e^+e^-\to e^+e^- \eta \pi^+\pi^-$ reaction, we present a phenomenological study of the diphoton fusion to $\eta \pi^+ \pi^-$, focusing on the production mechanism of the $f_1(1285)$ resonance. Contributions from the $f_1(1285)\to a_0(980)^\pm\, \pi^\mp$ and $f_1(1285)\to \sigma/f_0(500)\, \eta$ channels are included without introducing free parameters within an effective Lagrangian approach. Assuming the destructive interference between the amplitudes, we predict the invariant mass distributions, angular distributions, and total cross sections of the $\gamma^*\gamma \to \eta\pi^+\pi^-$ process, which will be tested by the forthcoming BESIII measurements.</description>

      <title>From Feynman integrals to quantum algorithms: the Loop-Tree Duality connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of high-energy particle physics, a reliable theory-experiment confrontation requires precise theoretical predictions. This translates into accessing higher-perturbative orders, and when we pursue this objective, we inevitably face the presence of complicated multi-loop Feynman integrals. There are serious bottlenecks to compute them with classical tools: the time to explore novel technologies has arrived. In this work, we study the implementation of quantum algorithms to optimize the integrands of scattering amplitudes. Our approach relies on the manifestly causal Loop-Tree Duality (LTD), which re-casts the loop integrand into phase-space integrals and avoids spurious non-physical singularities. Then, we codify this information in such a way that a quantum computer can understand the problem, and build Hamiltonians whose ground state are directly related to the causal representation. Promising results for generic families of multi-loop topologies are presented.</description>

      <title>Possibility of the experimental study on semi-leptonic and non-leptonic $D^*_{(s)}$ weak decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Just like other heavy flavor mesons, the weak decays of $D^*_{(s)}$ mesons can also provide a platform to check the Standard Model (SM), explore new physics (NP) and understand the mechanisms of weak interactions. At present, the theoretical and experimental researches on $D^*_{(s)}$ mesons are relatively limited. In addition to the dominant electromagnetic decays, the $D^*_{(s)}$ weak decays should also be feasible to explore the $D^*_{(s)}$ mesons. In this paper, we use the covariant light-front quark model (CLFQM) to study the branching ratios of the semi-leptonic decays $D^*_{(s)}\to P\ell^{+}\nu_{\ell}$ and the non-leptonic decays $D^*_{(s)}\to PP, PV$ with $P=\pi, K, \eta^{(\prime)}, V=\rho, K^*, \phi$ and $\ell=e, \mu$, which are within the range $10^{-13}\sim 10^{-6}$. Among these decays, the channels $D_{s}^{*+}\to\eta \ell^{+}\nu_{\ell}$ and $D^{*+}_{s}\to \eta\rho^{+}$ possess the largest branching ratios, which can reach up to $10^{-6}$ order. These decays are most likely to be accessible at the future high-luminosity experiments. One can find that the branching ratios $\mathcal{B}r(D_{s}^{*+}\to\eta \ell^{+}\nu_{\ell})=1.46\times10^{-6}$ and $\mathcal{B}r(D_{s}^{*+}\to\eta \rho^{+})=1.04\times10^{-6}$ correspond to tens of thousands of events in the $e^+e^-$ collider experiments, such as the STCF, CEPC and FCC-ee, and tens of millions of events at the HL-LHC. In a word, it is feasible to study the $D^*_{(s)}$ meson weak decays in the future experiments. Furthermore, we also predict and discuss another two physical observations, that is, the longitudinal polarization fraction $f_{L}$ and the forward-backward asymmetry $A_{FB}$, for our considered decays.</description>

      <title>Measuring the weak mixing angle at SBND</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The weak mixing angle provides a sensitive test of the Standard Model. We study SBND's sensitivity to the weak mixing angle using neutrino-electron scattering events. We perform a detailed simulation, paying particular attention to background rejection and estimating the detector response. We find that SBND can provide a reasonable constraint on the weak mixing angle, achieving 8% precision for $10^{21}$ protons on target, assuming an overall flux normalization uncertainty of 10%. This result is superior to those of current neutrino experiments and is relatively competitive with other low-energy measurements.</description>

      <title>Study of the relativistic charged particle beam propagation in Earth's magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relativistic charged particle beam can be used as destructive beam weapons in space for debris removal tasks. The trajectories of charged particles are affected by both electric and magnetic forces in the Earth's magnetic field. In this paper, we firstly analyzed the correlation parameters of the charged particle beam as a weapon when it propagated in the geomagnetic field. Then the models were constructed based on COMSOL Multiphysics and the IGRF model was adopted in the simulation. The gyro-radius and the related uncertainty were analyzed by simulation of the charged particle transport in the geomagnetic field at different altitudes. The charged beam spot radius divergency was also simulated. The magnetic field pinch effect can be found and can limit the beam spreading.</description>

      <title>Phase Stability in the 3-Dimensional Open-source Code for the Chiral mean-field Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we explore independently for the first time three chemical potentials (baryon $\mu_B$, charged $\mu_Q$, and strange $\mu_S$) in the Chiral mean-field (CMF) model. We designed and implemented \texttt{CMF++}, a new version of the CMF model rewritten in \texttt{C++} that is optimized, modular, and well-documented. \texttt{CMF++} has been integrated into the MUSES Calculation Engine as a free and open source software module. The runtime improved in more than 4 orders of magnitude across all 3 chemical potentials, when compared to the legacy code. Here we focus on the zero temperature case and study stable, as well as metastable and unstable, vacuum, hadronic, and quark phases, showing how phase boundaries vary with the different chemical potentials. Due to the significant numerical improvements in \texttt{CMF++}, we can calculate for the first time high-order susceptibilities within the CMF framework to study the properties of the quark deconfinement phase transition. We found phases of matter that include a light hadronic phase, strangeness-dominated hadronic phase, and quark deconfinement within our $\mu_B$, $\mu_S$, $\mu_Q$ phase space. The phase transitions are of first, second (quantum critical point), and third order between these phases and we even identified a tricritical point.</description>

      <title>Resolution of (Heavy) Primaries in Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurements of Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECR) suggest a complex composition with significant contributions from heavy nuclei at the highest energies. We systematically explore how the selection and number of primary nuclei included in the analysis impact the inferred UHECR mass composition. Introducing a distance measure in the space of $X_{\rm max}$ distribution moments, we demonstrate that limiting the analysis to a few primaries can introduce significant biases, particularly as observational data improves. We provide lists of primaries approximately equidistant in the new measure, which guaranty unbiased results at given statistical confidence. Additionally, we explore consistent inclusion of nuclei heavier than iron and up to plutonium, deriving first observational upper bounds on their contributions to UHECR with the Pierre Auger Open Data.</description>

      <title>Groomed Event Shapes at HERA and the sPHENIX TPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis summarizes the work of the author in two directions, both aimed at the study of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The first topic presented is a measurement of groomed event shapes using archived data collected by the H1 experiment at HERA. The data analysis methods and physics implications of the results are discussed, with the goal of improving the theoretical description of the hadronic final state in electron-hadron collisions before the construction of the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). The second topic concerns the sPHENIX experiment, which is now installed at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The sPHENIX physics program and apparatus will be discussed, along with a description of each of the subdetectors. Special attention will be dedicated to the operating principles, design, and construction of the time projection chamber (TPC).</description>

      <title>Cosmic-ray deuteron excess from a primary component</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent AMS-02 measurements of cosmic-ray (CR) deuteron fluxes suggest the presence of primary deuterons in quantities far exceeding predictions from Big Bang nucleosynthesis. This poses a significant challenge to modern astrophysics, as no known processes can account for such large amounts of deuterons without violating existing constraints~\cite{Epstein:1976hq}. In contrast, it is recently proposed that the AMS-02 measurements can be explained by a purely secondary origin when contributions from heavier nuclei are considered. In this study, we recalculate the secondary deuteron flux using production cross sections updated with the latest collider data. We find that some of the deuteron production cross sections are overestimated in the widely-used calculation tools for CR propagation, and a primary deuteron component is still necessary. We then propose a novel process for generating primary deuterons at CR sources through a fusion mechanism, which is naturally unique to deuterons. This model could explain the observed deuteron excess while maintaining consistency with other CR measurements.</description>

      <title>Multi-particle potentials from light-like Wilson lines in quark-gluon plasmas: a generalized relation of in-medium splitting rates to jet-quenching parameters $\hat q$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.05475</link>
      <description>arXiv:1901.05475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A powerful historical insight about the theory of in-medium showering in QCD backgrounds was that splitting rates can be related to a parameter $\hat q$ that characterizes the rate of transverse-momentum kicks to a high-energy particle from the medium. Another powerful insight was that $\hat q$ can be defined (with caveats) even when the medium is strongly coupled, using long, narrow Wilson loops whose two long edges are light-like Wilson lines. The medium effects for the original calculations of in-medium splitting rates can be formulated in terms of 3-body imaginary-valued `potentials' that are defined with three long, light-like Wilson lines. Corrections due to overlap of two consecutive splittings can be calculated using similarly defined 4-body potentials. I give a simple argument for how such $N$-body potentials can be determined in the appropriate limit just from knowledge of the values of $\hat q$ for different color representations. For $N &gt; 3$, the $N$-body potentials have non-trivial color structure, which will complicate calculations of overlap corrections outside of the large-$N_c$ or soft bremsstrahlung limits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.01885v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semi-visible jets arise in strongly interacting dark sector, resulting in jets overlapping with the missing transverse momentum direction. The implementation of semi-visible jets is done using the Pythia Hidden Valley module to mimic the QCD sector showering in so-called dark shower. In this work, only heavy flavour Standard Model quarks are considered in dark shower, resulting in a much less ambiguous collider signature of semi-visible jets compared to the democratic production of all five quark flavours in dark shower. The constraints from available searches on this signature are presented, and it is shown the signal reconstruction can be improved by using variable-radius jets. Finally a search strategy is suggested.</description>

      <title>The effect of gluon condensate on the entanglement entropy in a holographic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00682v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effect of gluon condensate on the holographic entanglement entropy is investigated in an Einstein-Dilaton model at zero and finite temperature. There is a critical length for the difference of entanglement entropy between the connected and disconnected surfaces in this model, which is often regarded as a signal of phase transition. With the increase of gluon condensate, the critical length becomes small, which means the confinement becomes strong at zero temperature. Moreover, an entropic C-function suddenly jumps to zero at the critical length, where there are expected to be no entangled states. At finite temperatures, results show that the effect of gluon condensate on the critical length is qualitatively consistent with the case of zero temperature. We find that the entropic C-function increases as a function of $l$ at finite temperature, while it has competitive behaviors with large gluon condensate.</description>

      <title>Axion Magnetic Resonance: A Novel Enhancement in Axion-Photon Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify a new resonance, axion magnetic resonance (AMR), that can greatly enhance the conversion rate between axions and photons. A series of axion search experiments rely on converting them into photons inside a constant magnetic field background. A common bottleneck of such experiments is the conversion amplitude being suppressed by the axion mass when $m_a \gtrsim 10^{-4}~$eV. We point out that a spatial or temporal variation in the magnetic field can cancel the difference between the photon dispersion relation and that of the axion, hence greatly enhancing the conversion probability. We demonstrate that the enhancement can be achieved by both a helical magnetic field profile and a harmonic oscillation of the magnitude. Our approach can extend the projected ALPS II reach in the axion-photon coupling ($g_{a\gamma}$) by two orders of magnitude at $m_a = 10^{-3}\;\mathrm{eV}$ with moderate assumptions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use functional methods to match the Two-Higgs Doublet Model with heavy scalars in the nondecoupling regime to the appropriate nonlinear effective field theory, which takes the form of an electroweak chiral Lagrangian (HEFT). The effective Lagrangian is derived to leading order in the chiral counting. This includes the loop induced $h\to\gamma\gamma$ and $h\to Z\gamma$ local terms, which enter at the same chiral order as their counterparts in the Standard Model. An algorithm is presented that allows us to compute the coefficient functions to all orders in $h$. Some of the all-orders results are given in closed form. The parameter regimes for decoupling, nondecoupling and alignment scenarios in the effective field theory context and some phenomenological implications are briefly discussed.</description>

Abstract: With the increasing usage of machine-learning in high-energy physics analyses, the publication of the trained models in a reusable form has become a crucial question for analysis preservation and reuse. The complexity of these models creates practical issues for both reporting them accurately and for ensuring the stability of their behaviours in different environments and over extended timescales. In this note we discuss the current state of affairs, highlighting specific practical issues and focusing on the most promising technical and strategic approaches to ensure trustworthy analysis-preservation. This material originated from discussions in the LHC Reinterpretation Forum and the 2023 PhysTeV workshop at Les Houches.</description>

      <title>Strongly vs. weakly coupled in-medium showers: energy stopping in large-$N_f$ QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inside a medium, showers originating from a very high-energy particle may develop via medium-induced splitting processes such as hard bremsstrahlung or pair production. During shower development, two consecutive splittings sometimes overlap quantum mechanically, so that they cannot be treated independently. Some of these effects can be absorbed into an effective value of a medium parameter known as $\hat q$. Previous calculations (with certain simplifying assumptions) have found that, after adjusting the value of $\hat q$, the leftover effect of overlapping splittings is quite small for purely gluonic large-$N_c$ showers but is very much larger for large-$N_f$ QED showers, at comparable values of $N\alpha$. Those works did not quite make for apples-to-apples comparisons: the gluon shower work investigated energy deposition from a gluon-initiated shower, whereas the QED work investigated charge-deposition from an electron-initiated shower. As a first step to tighten up the comparison, this paper investigates energy deposition in the QED case. Along the way, we develop a framework that should be useful in the future to explore whether the very small effect of overlapping splitting in purely gluonic showers is an artifact of having ignored quarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16037v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the $U(1)_X$SSM, we delve into the flavor violation of $h \rightarrow bs$, where $h$ is identified with the SM-like Higgs boson discovered at the LHC. As the U(1) extension of the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM), the U(1)XSSM has new super fields such as right-handed neutrinos and three Higgs singlets. We conduct a thorough analysis of the underlying mechanisms and parameter dependencies of $h \rightarrow bs$ in the $U(1)_X$SSM. In the $U(1)_X$SSM, we discover that the Br$(h \rightarrow bs)$ for the Higgs decay to $bs$ could significantly differ from the expectation in the standard model (SM), depending on the values of the new parameters introduced in the model. Our research not only contributes to a deeper understanding of Higgs physics within the $U(1)_X$SSM, but also provides valuable guidance for new physics (NP).</description>

Abstract: We calculate helicity amplitudes for $e^-e^+\to W^-W^+$ analytically in the Feynman-diagram (FD) gauge. We show that, unlike in the unitary gauge, there is no energy growth of the individual Feynman amplitudes for the longitudinally polarized W bosons, and the contributions from the associated Goldstone bosons are manifest even without taking the high-energy limit. We also find that the physical distributions can be interpreted by the individual amplitudes in the FD gauge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present analytic techniques for parametric integrations of massive two-loop four-point Feynman integrals at high energies, and their implementation in the toolbox AsyInt. In the high-energy region, the Feynman integrals involving external and internal massive particles, such as the top quark, Higgs and vector bosons, can be asymptotically expanded and directly calculated in the small-mass limit. With this approach, analytic results for higher-order terms in the expansion parameter and the dimensional regulator can be obtained with AsyInt. These results are important ingredients for the two-loop electroweak and QCD corrections for $2 \to 2$ scattering processes in the large transverse momenta region, which is relevant to both precision collider phenomenology and new physics searches at current and future high-energy colliders. In this paper, analytic results of representative planar and non-planar Feynman integrals are presented.</description>

      <title>Renormalization-group consistent treatment of color superconductivity in the NJL model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model and specifically its extension to color superconductivity (CSC) is a popular effective model for investigating dense quark matter. However, the reliability of its results is challenged by cutoff artifacts, which emerge if temperature or chemical potential are of the order of the cutoff energy scales. In this work, we generalize an idea from [Braun et al. SciPost Phys., 6:056, 2019], which is based on the requirement of renormalization-group (RG) consistency and has successfully been applied to the two-flavor Quark-Meson-Diquark model, to the NJL model for electrically and color-neutral three-flavor color-superconducting quark matter. To this end, we analyze the medium divergences of the model and eliminate them by appropriate counterterms, introducing three different schemes. We show that the RG-consistent treatment removes the cutoff artifacts of the conventional regularization and enables the investigation of CSC matter at higher densities by the model. Our studies reveal the emergence of a so-called dSC phase within the melting pattern of the Color-Flavor Locked (CFL) phase at high chemical potentials, consistent with earlier Ginzburg-Landau analyses.</description>

      <title>Processes $\gamma \gamma \rightarrow \phi_i\phi_j$ in Inert Higgs Doublet Models and Two Higgs Doublet Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the results for one-loop induced processes $\gamma \gamma \rightarrow \phi_i\phi_j$ with CP-even Higgses $\phi_{i,j} \equiv h,~H$ at high energy photon-photon collision, within the frameworks of Inert Higgs Doublet Models and Two Higgs Doublet Models. Total cross-sections are shown as functions of center-of-mass energies. We find that the cross-sections for the computed processes in all the models under investigations are enhanced at around the threshold of singly charged Higgs pair ($\sim 2 M_{H^\pm}$). Furthermore, the enhancement factors defined as the ratio of cross-sections of $\gamma \gamma \rightarrow \phi_i\phi_j$ in the investigated models over the corresponding ones for $\gamma \gamma \rightarrow hh$ in the Standard Model, are examined in the model's parameter space. In the Inert Higgs Doublet Models, the factors are studied in the parameter space of $(M_{H^\pm},~\mu^2_2)$ and $(M_{H^\pm},~\lambda_2)$. In the Two Higgs Doublet Models, the factors are examined in the planes of $(M_{H^\pm},~t_{\beta})$ as well as in the space of charged Higgs mass $M_{H^\pm}$ and the soft-breaking $Z_2$ parameter $m_{12}^2$. Two scenarios of $c_{\beta-\alpha} &gt; 0$ and $c_{\beta-\alpha} &lt; 0$ are studied in further detail. The factors give a different behavior from considering these scenarios. As a result, discriminations for the above-mentioned scenarios can be performed at future colliders.</description>

      <title>The Gravitational Form Factors of Hadrons from CFT in Momentum Space and the Dilaton in Perturbative QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the hard scattering amplitude of the gravitational form factors (GFFs) of hadrons at one-loop, in relation to their conformal field theory (CFT) description, within the framework of QCD factorization for hard exclusive processes at large momentum transfers. These form factors play an essential role in studying the quark and gluon angular momentum of the hadrons due to their relation to the Mellin moments of the Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DVCS) invariant amplitudes. Our analysis is performed using a diffeomorphism invariant approach, applying the formalism of the gravitational effective action and conformal symmetry in momentum space for the discussion of the quark and gluon contributions. The interpolating correlator in the hard scattering of any GFF is the non-Abelian $TJJ$ (stress-energy/gluon/gluon) 3-point function at $O(\alpha_s^2)$, revealing an effective dilaton interaction in the $t$-channel due to the trace anomaly, in the form of a massless anomaly pole in the QCD hard scattering, constrained by a sum rule on its spectral density. We investigate the role of quarks, gauge-fixing and ghost contributions in the reconstruction of the hard scattering amplitude mediated by this interaction, performed in terms of its transverse traceless, longitudinal, and trace decomposition, as identified from CFT in momentum space ($CFT_p$). We present a convenient parameterization of the hard scattering amplitude relevant for future experimental investigations of the DVCS/GFF amplitudes at the Electron-Ion Collider at BNL.</description>

      <title>Exploring the nature of $Y(4230)$ and $Y(4360)$ in B decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The vector charmonium states can be directly produced at the $e^+e^{-}$ annihilation process. Among them, $Y(4230)$ and $Y(4360)$ splitting from the previously discovered $Y(4260)$ are not easily arranged into the conventional charmonium spectrum, while the recent studies indicated that they have strong couplings to $D\bar{D}_1$ and $D^*\bar{D}_1$. In this work, we investigate the productions of $Y(4230)$ and $Y(4360)$ as the heavy quark spin symmetry doublet hadronic molecules of $D\bar{D}_1$ and $D^*\bar{D}_1$ in $B$ decays via the triangle diagram mechanism. In particular, we propose that the decay constants of $Y(4230)$ and $Y(4360)$ extracted in $B$ decays are helpful to clarify their nature.</description>

      <title>Probing New Physics with High-Redshift Quasars: Axions and Non-standard Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hubble diagram of quasars, as candidates to ``standardizable" candles, has been used to measure the expansion history of the Universe at late times, up to very high redshifts ($z \sim 7$). It has been shown that this history, as inferred from the quasar dataset, deviates at $\gtrsim 3 \sigma$ level from the concordance ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmology model preferred by the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and other datasets. In this article, we investigate whether new physics beyond $\Lambda$CDM (B$\Lambda$CDM) or beyond the Standard Model (BSM) could make the quasar data consistent with the concordance model. We first show that an effective redshift-dependent relation between the quasar UV and X-ray luminosities, complementing previous phenomenological work in the literature, can potentially remedy the discrepancy. Such a redshift dependence can be realized in a BSM model with axion-photon conversion in the intergalactic medium (IGM), although the preferred parameter space is {in tension with various other astrophysical constraints on axions, at a level} depending on the specific assumptions made regarding the IGM magnetic field. We briefly discuss a variation of the axion model that could evade these astrophysical constraints. On the other hand, we show that models beyond $\Lambda$CDM such as one with a varying dark energy equation of state ($w$CDM) or the phenomenological cosmographic model with a polynomial expansion of the luminosity distance, cannot alleviate the tension. The code for our analysis, based on \texttt{emcee}~\cite{Foreman_Mackey_2013} and \texttt{corner.py}~\cite{corner}, is publicly available at \href{https://github.com/ChenSun-Phys/high\_z\_candles.git}{{\tt github.com/ChenSun-Phys/high\_z\_candles}}.</description>

      <title>Prospects for detection of ultra high frequency gravitational waves from hyperbolic encounters with resonant cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08379v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this brief note, we pursue the systematic investigation of possible gravitational wave sources in the gigahertz band. We focus on hyperbolic encounters of light black holes and evaluate precisely the expected signal when accounting for the detailed characteristics of haloscope experiments. Considering the GraHal setup as a benchmark, we insist on the correct signal-to-noise ratio expression taking into account the appropriate timescales. The associated maximum distance - of the order of a few hundreds of astronomical units - at which an event can be detected is calculated for optimal, sub-optimal, and general trajectories.</description>

      <title>Mixing between flavor singlets in lattice gauge theories coupled to matter fields in multiple representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide the first extensive, numerical study of the non-trivial problem of mixing between flavor-singlet composite states emerging in strongly coupled lattice field theories with matter field content consisting of fermions transforming in different representations of the gauge group. The theory of interest is the minimal candidate for a composite Higgs model that also accommodates a mechanism for top partial compositeness: the $Sp(4)$ gauge theory coupled to two (Dirac) fermions transforming as the fundamental and three as the two-index antisymmetric representation of the gauge group, respectively. We apply an admixture of APE and Wuppertal smearings, as well as the generalized eigenvalue problem approach, to two-point functions involving flavor-singlet mesons, for ensembles having time extent longer than the space extent. We demonstrate that, in the region of lattice parameter space accessible to this study, both masses and mixing angles can be measured effectively, despite the presence of (numerically noisy) contributions from disconnected diagrams.</description>

      <title>Nuclear transparencies with a two-step process of the $A(e,e'\pi^+)$ reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nuclear transparency in pion-induced nuclear reactions has been investigated based on Glauber multiple scattering theory considering a two-step process within the framework of vector meson dominance (VMD). In the present context, the application of the quantum diffusion model (QDM) to the Glauber theory plays a role in explaining the dependence of the transparency on the four-momentum transfer squared $Q^2$. The short-range correlation (SRC) considered further gives the contribution to the magnitude of the transparency by a constant amount independent of the $Q^2$ variation, and the results from the QDM and SRC overestimate the experimental data. The inclusion of the two-step process with the $\rho N$ scattering cross section, $\sigma_{\rho N}=3 $ mb has the effect of reducing the transparency and thus leads to a good agreement with the experimental data on the reaction $A(e,e'\pi^+)$ for $^{12}$C, $^{27}$Al, $^{63}$Cu and $^{197}$Au nuclei.</description>
