      <title>The role of zealots in the spread of linguistic traits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the diffusion of linguistic innovations on a fully connected network in order to understand the emergence of linguistic diversity. We employ an agent-based dynamics based on the Axelrod model, where interactions between agents are driven by homophily and social influence, with the difference that we assume that all agents share a number of common features that ensure a finite probability of pairwise interaction. We start from a homogeneous population and introduce zealots that act like agents spreading linguistic innovations, without being influenced by other agents. We analyze how different factors, such as the degree of cohesion and number of zealots in different linguistic states, determine the linguistic configurations that populations can adopt and contribute to the possible emergence of a multi-linguistic community. The results are compared with those derived within the mean-field approximation.</description>

      <title>Introduction to Focus Issue: Topics in Nonlinear Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear science has evolved significantly over the 35 years since the launch of the journal Chaos. This Focus Issue, dedicated to the 80th Birthday of its founding editor-in-chief, David K. Campbell, brings together a selection of contributions on influential topics, many of which were advanced by Campbell's own research program and leadership role. The topics include new phenomena and method development in the realms of network dynamics, machine learning, quantum and material systems, chaos and fractals, localized states, and living systems, with a good balance of literature review, original contributions, and perspectives for future research.</description>

      <title>Multispin Physics of AI Tipping Points and Hallucinations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Output from generative AI such as ChatGPT, can be repetitive and biased. But more worrying is that this output can mysteriously tip mid-response from good (correct) to bad (misleading or wrong) without the user noticing. In 2024 alone, this reportedly caused $67 billion in losses and several deaths. Establishing a mathematical mapping to a multispin thermal system, we reveal a hidden tipping instability at the scale of the AI's 'atom' (basic Attention head). We derive a simple but essentially exact formula for this tipping point which shows directly the impact of a user's prompt choice and the AI's training bias. We then show how the output tipping can get amplified by the AI's multilayer architecture. As well as helping improve AI transparency, explainability and performance, our results open a path to quantifying users' AI risk and legal liabilities.</description>

      <title>Long-term resilience of online battle over vaccines and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: What has been the impact of the enormous amounts of time, effort and money spent promoting pro-vaccine science from pre-COVID-19 to now? We answer this using a unique mapping of online competition between pro- and anti-vaccination views among ~100M Facebook Page members, tracking 1,356 interconnected communities through platform interventions. Remarkably, the network's fundamental architecture shows no change: the isolation of established expertise and the symbiosis of anti and mainstream neutral communities persist. This means that even if the same time, effort and money continue to be spent, nothing will likely change. The reason for this resilience lies in "glocal" evolution: Communities blend multiple topics while bridging neighborhood-level to international scales, creating redundant pathways that transcend categorical targeting. The solution going forward is to focus on the system's network. We show how network engineering approaches can achieve opinion moderation without content removal, representing a paradigm shift from suppression towards structural interventions.</description>

      <title>Self-organisation -- the underlying principle and a general model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations of coordinated self-organisation (SO) of stress and structure in granular systems provide insight into the fundamental principle underlying this phenomenon. It is first argued here that SO emerges when a minute subset of configurations are significantly more stable than the rest and therefore survive the noise in the system much longer to be observed. This principle goes deeper than recently proposed energy considerations. Guided by this principle, a statistical mechanics model is formulated then for SO in these systems and its extension to three dimensions is outlined. The principle holds beyond granular systems and the model is extended next to describe emergence of SO in more general systems. The application of the model is illustrated for the specific example of laning. Parallels of the modelling approach to traditional statistical mechanics provide useful insight that should assist in modelling SO in other out-of-equilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>Why collective behaviours self-organise to criticality: A primer on information-theoretic and thermodynamic utility measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15668v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collective behaviours are frequently observed to self-organise to criticality. Existing proposals to explain these phenomena are fragmented across disciplines and only partially answer the question. This primer compares the underlying, intrinsic, utilities that may explain the self-organisation of collective behaviours near criticality. We focus on information-driven approaches (predictive information, empowerment, and active inference), as well as an approach incorporating both information theory and thermodynamics (thermodynamic efficiency). By interpreting the Ising model as a perception-action loop, we compare how different intrinsic utilities shape collective behaviour and analyse the distinct characteristics that arise when each is optimised. In particular, we highlight that thermodynamic efficiency -- measuring the ratio of predictability gained by the system to its energy costs -- reaches its maximum at the critical regime. Finally, we propose the Principle of Super-efficiency, suggesting that collective behaviours self-organise to the critical regime where optimal efficiency is achieved with respect to the entropy reduction relative to the thermodynamic costs.</description>

      <title>Enhancing deep neural networks through complex-valued representations and Kuramoto synchronization dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21077v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural synchrony is hypothesized to play a crucial role in how the brain organizes visual scenes into structured representations, enabling the robust encoding of multiple objects within a scene. However, current deep learning models often struggle with object binding, limiting their ability to represent multiple objects effectively. Inspired by neuroscience, we investigate whether synchrony-based mechanisms can enhance object encoding in artificial models trained for visual categorization. Specifically, we combine complex-valued representations with Kuramoto dynamics to promote phase alignment, facilitating the grouping of features belonging to the same object. We evaluate two architectures employing synchrony: a feedforward model and a recurrent model with feedback connections to refine phase synchronization using top-down information. Both models outperform their real-valued counterparts and complex-valued models without Kuramoto synchronization on tasks involving multi-object images, such as overlapping handwritten digits, noisy inputs, and out-of-distribution transformations. Our findings highlight the potential of synchrony-driven mechanisms to enhance deep learning models, improving their performance, robustness, and generalization in complex visual categorization tasks.</description>

      <title>The impact of strong activity disruption on building energetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19921v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evidence shows that biological organisms tend to be more energetically efficient per unit size. These scaling patterns observed in biological organisms have also been observed in the energetic requirements of cities. However, at lower levels of organization where energetic interventions can be more manageable, such as buildings, this analysis has remained more elusive due to the difficulties in collecting fine-grained data. Here, we use the maintenance energy usage in buildings at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) from 2009 to 2024 to analyze energetic trends at the scale of individual buildings and their sensitivity to strong external perturbations. We find that, similar to the baseline metabolism of biological organisms, large buildings are on average $24\%$ more energetically efficient per unit size than smaller buildings. Because it has become debatable how to better measure the efficiency of buildings, this scaling pattern naturally establishes a baseline efficiency for buildings, where deviations from the mean would imply a more or less efficient building than the baseline according to volume. This relative efficiency progressively increased to $34\%$ until 2020. However, the strong activity disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic acted as a major shock, removing this trend and leading to a reversal to the expected $24\%$ baseline level. This suggests that energetic adaptations are contingent on relatively stable conditions.</description>
