      <title>Expanding the Landscape of Exotic Muon Decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We chart new-physics models that produce exotic, high-multiplicity muon decays featuring prompt or displaced $e^+e^-$ pairs and/or photons, with or without missing energy, such as $\mu \to 5e$, $\mu \to 7e$, etc. Starting from an effective-field-theory perspective, we estimate the reach on the ultraviolet scale and identify conditions under which lower-multiplicity modes are suppressed or occur at comparable rates. We then construct explicit realizations in minimal dark-sector models with light, feebly interacting particles, such as flavor-protected scalars, dark photons, inelastic dark matter, and axion-like particles. The predicted novel signatures can be probed at MEG II and Mu3e, as well as during calibration runs of COMET and Mu2e. A future discovery would provide valuable insights into short-distance dynamics and the mechanism of lepton-flavor symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Dark matter Simplified models in the Resonance Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The particle-physics nature of dark matter (DM) remains one of the central open questions in modern physics. A widely used framework to investigate DM properties is provided by simplified models (DMSimps), which extend the Standard Model with a DM particle and a mediator that connects the visible and dark sectors. Much of the DMSimps parameter space is already constrained by direct and indirect detection, collider searches, and the measured DM relic abundance. We show, however, that the resonant regime $m_{\rm DM}\simeq m_{\rm med}/2$ remains viable under current bounds and will be stringently tested by forthcoming experiments. Using a full Boltzmann treatment that allows for departures from kinetic equilibrium near resonance, we demonstrate that this regime can reproduce the observed relic density with couplings compatible with direct-detection limits. We also show that models with s-wave-dominated annihilation can explain the Fermi-LAT Galactic Center Excess with couplings consistent with relic-density and direct-detection constraints. Finally, we propose two minimal constructions that naturally realize $m_{\rm med} \approx 2m_{\rm DM}$, making the resonant scenario generic rather than fine-tuned.</description>

      <title>Revealing signals of higher-order nonlinear showers in particle-laser collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several high power laser facilities are reaching field strengths where leading order strong-field quantum electrodynamical (QED) processes can be measured in the non-perturbative regime for the first time. At very high, as yet unobtainable in the laboratory, field strengths, the contribution of higher-order processes is predicted to dominate, implying a breakdown of current calculational methods. Focusing on nonlinear showers and considering currently available experimental parameters, we find that if the momentum spectrum of the \emph{incident} particles is well known, asymmetries in the \emph{outgoing} particle spectrum may provide a useful signature of higher orders of nonlinear phototrident, trident and Compton scattering. These signatures could be used by experiment to test how accurate the current calculational framework is when applied to strong-field QED at higher orders.</description>

      <title>Two-loop anomalous dimensions for baryon-number-violating operators in SMEFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the two-loop renormalization-group equations for the baryon-number-violating dimension-six operators in the SMEFT. This includes all three gauge interactions, the Yukawa, and Higgs self-interaction contributions. In addition, we present the one-loop matching of the $S_1$ scalar leptoquark on the SMEFT, which can generate the Wilson coefficients of all four gauge-invariant baryon-number-violating SMEFT operators. Using this example, we demonstrate the cancellation of scheme and matching-scale dependences. Together with the known two-loop renormalization-group evolution below the electroweak scale in the LEFT, as well as the one-loop matching of SMEFT onto LEFT, our results enable consistent next-to-leading-log analyses of nucleon decays, provided that the relevant matrix elements are known at next-to-leading-order accuracy.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic models of Reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a causal hydrodynamic model that provides an effective macroscopic description of the field-theoretic dynamics during the early stages of reheating. The inflaton condensate is treated as a homogeneous background coupled to a relativistic fluid that represents its inhomogeneous fluctuations. Within the divergence-type theory framework derived from kinetic considerations, the model captures essential dissipative and non-equilibrium effects while remaining stable and causal. We find that the coupling between the oscillating condensate and the fluid induces a parametric resonance in the tensor sector, leading to the amplification of the viscous stress tensor and the generation of gravitational waves with a characteristic spectral peak. The predicted spectrum agrees with lattice simulations performed with CosmoLattice. This hydrodynamic approach offers an effective bridge between microscopic field dynamics and macroscopic cosmological observables.</description>

      <title>Loop functions of sunset graphs in 2+1 space-time dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In these notes the relativistic $n$-body phase-phase is calculated iteratively in $2+1$ space-time dimensions for all $n$. The obtained result shows a simple power-law behavior $\alpha_n (\mu-M)^{n-2}/\mu$ with a dependence only on the total mass $M=m_1+\dots + m_n$. As a consequence of this feature, the $(n-1)$-loop integrals $J_n(-q^2)$ associated to sunset graphs with $n$ internal lines can be expressed through of elementary (arctangent and logarithmic) functions, modulo polynomial terms in $q^2$ with regularization-dependent coefficients. An outlook to the analogous situation in $4+1$ space-time dimensions is given by computing the $n$-body phase-phases for $n=2,3,4,5$ with their totally symmetric dependence on the involved masses. Moreover, a degression to $1+1$ space-time dimensions reveals that there the three-body phase-space is already proportional to a complete elliptic integral.</description>

      <title>Taming forward scattering singularities in partial waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perturbative partial-wave amplitudes diverge in cases with a massless exchanged particle in the $t$-channel. We argue that the divergence is an artifact of perturbation theory and give a prescription for the all-orders correction factor that renders the partial waves finite. As an example, we apply this to longitudinal $W^+W^-$ elastic scattering, for which there is a photon exchange $t$-channel contribution, and derive improved quasi-perturbative unitarity bounds on the mass of the Higgs. The method is also useful for $t$-channel exchange of very light particles.</description>

      <title>Exclusive photoproduction of light and heavy vector mesons: thresholds to very high energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A reaction model for $\gamma + p \to V + p$, $V=\rho^0, \phi, J/\psi, \Upsilon$, which exposes the quark-antiquark content of the photon in making the transition $\gamma\to {q} \bar{q} + \mathbb P \to V$, where ${q}$ depends on $V$, and couples the intermediate ${q} \bar{q}$ system to the proton's valence quarks via Pomeron ($\mathbb P$) exchange, is used to deliver a unified description of available data -- both differential and total cross sections -- from near threshold to very high energies, $W$, for all the $V$-mesons. For the $\Upsilon$, this means $10\lesssim W/{\rm GeV} \lesssim 2\,000$. Also provided are predictions for the power-law exponents that are empirically used to characterise the large-$W$ behaviour of the total cross sections and slope parameters characterising the near-threshold differential cross sections. Appealing to notions of vector meson dominance, the latter have been interpreted as vector-meson--proton scattering lengths. The body of results indicate that it is premature to link any $\gamma + p \to V + p$ data with, for instance, in-proton gluon distributions, the quantum chromodynamics trace anomaly, or pentaquark production. Further developments in reaction theory and higher precision data are required before the validity of any such links can be assessed.</description>

      <title>Towards Quantum Simulations of Sphaleron Dynamics at Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sphaleron dynamics in the Standard Model at high-energy particle collisions remains experimentally unobserved, with theoretical predictions hindered by its nonperturbative real-time nature. In this work, we investigate a quantum simulation approach to this challenge. Taking the $1+1$D $O(3)$ model as a protocol towards studying dynamics of sphaleron in the electroweak theory, we identify the sphaleron configuration and establish lattice parameters that reproduce continuum sphaleron energies with controlled precision. We then develop quantum algorithms to simulate sphaleron evolutions where quantum effects can be included. This work lays the ground to establish quantum simulations for studying the interaction between classical topological objects and particles in the quantum field theory that are usually inaccessible to classical methods and computations.</description>

      <title>Open heavy-flavor transport and hadronization in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a comprehensive model for heavy-quark evolution in a realistic QGP, from their production in the initial collision to hadronic freeze-out. Heavy-quark transport is described by a Langevin approach including medium-induced radiation, coupled to a 2+1D viscous hydrodynamic bulk evolution. Transport coefficients are obtained from non-perturbative $T$-matrix calculations with resonant correlations near the transition temperature. Hadronization is implemented via two fragmentation+recombination schemes: an improved sudden coalescence model and a resonance recombination model. We present results for key open heavy-flavor observables, i.e., the nuclear modification factor and elliptic flow, and compare to LHC Pb-Pb data at $\sqrt{s_{\NN}}$=5.02\,TeV.}</description>

      <title>Jet Energy-Energy Correlator in Cold QCD Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of medium-induced modifications to the energy-energy correlator (EEC) for jets in cold nuclear matter. For electron-nucleus collisions, at leading order in the QCD coupling and in the jet-medium interaction, we derive an analytic expression for the EEC modification as a function of the opening angle and show that the modification is strongest at large angles within the jet cone. The dependence on jet energy, the transport properties of cold nuclear matter, and the in-medium path length is made explicit. We further extend the analysis to gluon jets in proton-nucleus collisions and compare with preliminary proton-lead data from the LHC. Possible effects of comovers on the EEC in proton-nucleus collisions are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Semihard interactions at TeV energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the high-energy behavior of the total cross section, $\sigma_{\text{tot}}$, and the ratio of the real to imaginary parts of the scattering amplitude, $\rho$, in both proton-proton and antiproton-proton channels. Our analysis is based on a QCD-inspired model in which the rise of the cross sections is predominantly driven by semihard processes involving gluons. We address the tension between measurements from the ATLAS/ALFA and TOTEM Collaborations, showing that independent analyses of their datasets can provide statistically consistent descriptions of the overall data, even though they do not fully reproduce the central values of the $\rho$ parameter at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV. The slight discrepancy between these central values and the model's predicted values, obtained using an asymptotic dominant crossing-even elastic scattering amplitude, points to the potential presence of an odd component in the semihard amplitude at high energies.</description>

      <title>When inverse seesaw meets inverse electroweak phase transition: a novel path to leptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new nonthermal leptogenesis mechanism triggered by the cosmic first-order phase transition. The Standard Model is extended with two generations of TeV-scale vectorlike leptons. The lighter generation gives rise to an inverse electroweak phase transition of the Higgs field at $T\sim200~{\rm GeV}$, restoring the symmetry, and resulting in relativistic bubble expansion in the space. The heavier generation is responsible for neutrino masses via the inverse seesaw mechanism. The interaction between bubble walls and particles in the plasma abundantly produces the vectorlike leptons, and they subsequently undergo CP-violating decay to generate the baryon asymmetry. This mechanism is testable at current and future particle experiments.</description>

Abstract: We present updates to the MSHT approximate N3LO PDFs focusing upon recent developments, examining the impacts of newly determined splitting function and transition matrix element calculations, performed since the public MSHT20aN3LO PDF set was released. We observe only small changes to the output PDFs, at most of similar size to their quoted uncertainties and typically notably less. Finally, we also present the impacts on the PDF luminosities, where changes are generally further reduced.</description>

      <title>Dark matter production from evaporation of regular primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study dark matter (DM) production from evaporation of regular primordial black holes (RPBHs). While there are many available metrics that describe singularity-free RPBHs, we focus on the Hayward metric and the Simpson-Visser metric for illustrative purpose. The framework can be applied straightforwardly to other metrics. RPBHs generally have different Hawking temperature and therefore different lifetime from the standard singular black holes. The resulting modified cosmological constraints for this DM production mechanism and the allowed parameter space to obtain the correct DM abundance are calculated.</description>

      <title>The two-mass contributions to the three-loop massive operator matrix elements $\tilde{A}_{Qg}^{(3)}$ and $\Delta \tilde{A}_{Qg}^{(3)}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the two-mass three-loop contributions to the unpolarized and polarized massive operator matrix elements $\tilde{A}_{Qg}^{(3)}$ and $\Delta \tilde{A}_{Qg}^{(3)}$ in $x$-space for a general mass ratio by using a semi-analytic approach. We also compute Mellin moments up to $N = 2000 (3000)$ by an independent method, to which we compare the results in $x$-space. In the polarized case, we work in the Larin scheme. We present numerical results. The two-mass contributions amount to about $50 \%$ of the full \textcolor{blue}{$O(T_F^2)$} and \textcolor{blue}{$O(T_F^3)$} terms contributing to the operator matrix elements. The present result completes the calculation of all unpolarized and polarized massive three-loop operator matrix elements.</description>

      <title>Manifestations of Dark Matter in processes with three and four Top-Quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores possible manifestations of Dark Matter (DM) in processes involving multiple top quarks at the LHC. We analyze both the associated production of scalar and pseudoscalar DM Mediators with up to four top quarks, as well as their resonant production in top-rich final states, within a simplified model framework. Cross sections were calculated using the CompHEP and MadGraph packages with benchmark parameters recommended by the LHC Dark Matter Working Group. A detailed comparison of differential cross sections for key kinematic observables in three- and four-top-quark production demonstrates pronounced deviations from Standard Model predictions. The results highlight the limited feasibility of associated production channels, while resonant DM Mediator production offers realistic discovery prospects. Overall, the analysis underscores the potential of multi-top-quark final states as sensitive probes of Dark Matter at current and future collider experiments.</description>

      <title>Lie symmetry analysis of the two-Higgs-doublet model field equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply Lie symmetry analysis of partial differential equations (PDEs) to the Euler-Lagrange equations of the two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM), to determine its scalar Lie point symmetries. A Lie point symmetry is a structure-preserving transformation of the spacetime variables and the fields of the model, which is also continuous and connected to the identity. Symmetries of PDEs may in general be divided into strict variational symmetries, divergence symmetries and non-variational symmetries, where the first two are collectively referred to as variational symmetries. Variational symmetries are usually preserved under quantization, and variational Lie symmetries yield conservation laws. We demonstrate that there are no scalar Lie point divergence symmetries or non-variational Lie point symmetries in the 2HDM, and re-derive its well-known strict variational Lie point symmetries, thus confirming the consistency of our implementation of Lie's method. Moreover, we prove three general results which may simplify Lie symmetry calculations for a wide class of particle physics models. Lie symmetry analysis of PDEs is a broadly applicable method for determining Lie symmetries. As demonstrated here by example, it can be applied to models with many variables, parameters and reparametrization freedom, while any missing discrete symmetries may be identified through the automorphism groups of the resulting Lie symmetry algebras.</description>

      <title>A LENS on DUNE-PRISM: Characterizing a Neutrino Beam with Off-Axis Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Upcoming precision long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments will be severely limited by the large systematic uncertainties associated with neutrino flux predictions and neutrino--nucleus cross sections. A promising remedy is the PRISM (Precision Reaction Independent Spectrum Measurement) technique, whereby the near detector measures the neutrino spectrum at different angles with respect to the beam axis. These measurements are then linearly combined into a prediction of the oscillated neutrino flux at the far detector. This prediction is data-driven, but still dependent on some theoretical knowledge about the neutrino flux. In this paper, we study to what extent off-axis measurements themselves can be used to directly constrain neutrino flux models. In particular, we use them to extract separately the fluxes and spectra of different meson species in the beam. We call this measurement LENS (Lateral Extraction of Neutrino Spectra). Second, we demonstrate how the thus improved flux model helps to further constrain the far detector flux prediction, thereby ultimately improving oscillation measurements.</description>

Abstract: The CMS Collaboration recently observed a pseudoscalar excess of top quark-antiquark ($t\bar{t}$) events near the production threshold. One possible interpretation involves the formation of a short-lived quasi-bound state of $t\bar{t}$.

      <description>arXiv:2510.09075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The current status of the experimental investigation of quarkonia in heavy-ion collisions as probes for deconfinement is reviewed. The emphasis is put on the qualitative understanding of charmonia (ccbar bound states) and bottomonia (bbbar) based on the results in the past few years. In particular, the observation of non-primordial J/psi (ccbar) production as signature of deconfinement based on different observables and the sequential suppression patterns of the Upsilon (bbbar) states are discussed. An outlook focusing on the time scale until the next quark matter conference is provided.</description>

      <title>Thermal and magnetic effects on viscosity in Binary Neutron Star mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrophysical scenarios such as binary neutron star mergers, proto-neutron stars and core-collapse supernovae involve finite temperatures and strong magnetic fields. Previous studies on the effect of magnetic fields on flavor-equilibration processes such as direct Urca relied on the Fermi surface approximation, which is not a reliable approximation in the neutrino-transparent regime of matter in supernovae or neutron star mergers. In a recent study, we went beyond the Fermi surface approximation, performing the full phase space integral to obtain direct Urca rates in background magnetic field. In this work, we extend these calculations to include collisional broadening effects by employing the recently developed nucleon width approximation. We demonstrate the impact of magnetic fields on the flavor-equilibrium condition for two finite-temperature equations of state with different direct Urca thresholds. We also study the impact of magnetic fields on the bulk viscous dissipation of density oscillations relevant in postmerger scenarios.</description>

      <title>Emergence of the $\pi(1300)$ Resonance from Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mass of the lightest hadron in nature, the pion, is one seventh of that of the nucleon, and one tenth of the mass of its first excited state, the $\pi(1300)$. This enormous energy difference opens an interesting window into the confinement of quarks and the structure of the lightest hadrons. In this work, we provide the first calculation of resonance parameters of the $\pi(1300)$ from lattice QCD. For this purpose, recently derived state-of-the-art tools are adapted and applied both in the construction of three-hadron operators and for mapping finite-volume spectra to infinite-volume amplitudes, subsequently analytically continuing these to complex energies. For our heavy pion mass ensembles, we find a clear signal of the resonance. Crucial input is provided through Chiral Perturbation Theory, allowing us to robustly extrapolate to the physical point. Applying model averaging, we extract a pole position of $M_{\pi(1300)}=(1169\pm46)-i\,(62_{-62}^{+168})\,\rm MeV$ supporting values from phenomenology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first complete next-to-leading-order analysis of a Yukawa system within the framework of asymptotically safe quantum gravity. Our results are obtained through a systematic resummation of higher-order operators, revealing two distinct resummation mechanisms -- one of which has not been explored previously. In addition, we introduce a novel approach to estimate systematic uncertainties by simulating the impact of neglected higher-order contributions.
  We demonstrate that quantum gravity fluctuations anti-screen Yukawa interactions, thereby resolving previously inconclusive leading-order results. This anti-screening mechanism enables the generation of finite interactions from an asymptotically free Yukawa fixed point. Consequently, our findings provide strong evidence that non-vanishing Yukawa couplings are compatible with asymptotically safe quantum gravity, which is a necessary requirement for the Standard Model to emerge from an asymptotically safe ultraviolet completion.</description>

      <title>Compositeness of hadrons, nuclei, and atomic systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent observations of exotic hadrons have stimulated the theoretical investigation of the internal structure of hadrons. While all hadrons are ultimately composed of quarks and gluons bound by the strong interaction, quark clustering phenomena can generate hadronic molecules -- weakly bound systems of hadrons -- which are expected to emerge near two-hadron thresholds. However, it should be noted that a pure hadronic molecule is not realized, as the strong interaction induces mixing with other possible configurations. The compositeness of hadrons has been developed as a promising concept to quantitatively characterize the fraction of the hadronic molecular component. Here we summarize the modern understanding of the compositeness to study the internal structure of hadrons and review the application of the compositeness to various quantum systems in different energy scales, such as nuclei and atomic systems, in addition to hadrons.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and Bell Nonlocality in $\tau^+ \tau^-$ at the BEPC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04801v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement and Bell nonlocality are two phenomena that occur only in quantum systems. In both cases, these are correlations between two subsystems that are classically absent. Traditionally, these phenomena have been measured in low-energy photon and electron experiments, but more recently they have also been measured in high-energy particle collider environments. In this work, we propose measuring the entanglement and Bell nonlocality in the $\tau^+\tau^-$ state near and above its kinematic threshold at the Beijing Electron Positron Collider (BEPC). We find that in the existing dataset, entanglement is observable if systematic uncertainties are kept to 1%. In the upcoming run between 4.0 and 5.6 GeV, the entanglement is predicted to be measurable with a precision better than 4% and Bell nonlocality can be established at $5\sigma$ as long as systematic uncertainty can be controlled at level of 0.5% - 2.0%, depending on the center-of-mass energy.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from Resonant Transitions of Tidally Perturbed Gravitational Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18121v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light bosons can form a gravitational atom (GA) around a spinning black hole through the superradiance process. Considering the black hole to be part of a binary system, the tidal potential of the companion periodically perturbs the GA such that an ``atomic'' transition occurs between two of its energy eigenstates. The resonant transition is modeled by the Landau-Zener system, where the orbital frequency of the companion determines the relevant transition. In this work, we study a novel quasi-monochromatic gravitational wave signal originating directly from the level transition of the GA in a binary system. We derive the analytical formulae of both the strain waveform and frequency spectrum of the signal. We further investigate the GA-binary systems that can have a large signal-to-noise ratio in the milli-Hz to deci-Hz frequency band. Using the future space-based gravitational wave observatory DECIGO, we find the signal-to-noise ratio is $\mathcal{O}(10-200)$ for the fine-structure constant $\alpha\simeq 0.3$, host black hole mass $M= 150M_\odot$ and boson mass $\mu \simeq 10^{-13} \rm eV$ at a distance within 100 kpc. Given astrophysical uncertainties about the black hole's initial spin, the degeneracy with other monochromatic signals and the small merger rate at those distances, we conclude that the detection of the signal would be challenging.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the impact of two phenomenological Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) scenarios concerning the role of neutrinos in the early universe: non-standard neutrino interactions (NSI) and non-unitary three-neutrino mixing. We evaluate the impact of these frameworks on two key cosmological observables: the effective number of relativistic neutrino species (\Neff), related to neutrino decoupling, and the abundances of light elements produced at Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). For the first time, neutrino CC-NSI with quarks and non-unitary three-neutrino mixing are studied in the context of BBN, and the constraints on such interactions are found to be remarkably restrictive. In particular, the BBN limits are competitive with the ones derived from terrestrial experiments for the non-diagonal CC-NSI parameter $\varepsilon^{udV}_{e \alpha}$, with $\alpha \neq e$ and for the non-unitarity parameter $\alpha_{22}$. In the case of non-unitarity, the combination between neutrino decoupling and BBN imposes stringent constraints that can either mildly favour the existence of New Physics (NP), or reinforce the SM, depending on the choice of the experimental nuclear rates involved in the BBN calculation. These results stress the already noted need for further nuclear rates measurements in order to obtain more robust BBN theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Multiprocess imaging of nuclear modifications on parton distributions in proton-nucleus collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nuclear modifications to collinear parton distribution functions are conventionally quantified by the ratios $ r^{\textrm{A}}_i(x,Q^2) = f^\textrm{A,proton}_i(x,Q^2) / f^\textrm{proton}_i(x,Q^2) $. For a given nucleus $A$, these ratios generally depend on the parton momentum fraction $ x $, the probing scale $ Q^{2} $, and the parton species $ i $. Determining these dependencies relies on a global analysis of diverse experimental data. However, in realistic observables, these dependencies are intricately intertwined, making their extraction challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to effectively image the nuclear modification factors $ r^{\textrm{A}}_i(x,Q^2) $ at the observable level in proton-nucleus collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. Specifically, through a combined study of $ Z $-boson production, $ Z $+jet production, and $ Z+c $-jet production, we separately enhance signals arising from light-quark, gluon, and heavy-flavor (charm) distributions in nuclei. This enables us to effectively image the $ r^{\textrm{A}}_i(x,Q^2) $ for specific parton species. The feasibility of this method is validated through perturbative calculations at next-to-leading order in the strong coupling constant, employing three sets of nuclear PDF parametrizations: EPPS21, nCTEQ15, and TUJU19. Future measurements of these observables are expected to provide more efficient constraints on nuclear PDFs and yield new insights into the detailed partonic structures of nuclei.</description>

      <title>A simple model for nuclear modification of parton distribution functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A model for nuclear medium modification of parton densities is presented. The approach is based on the global analysis of available deep inelastic scattering data for different nuclear targets within the rescaling model combined with taking into account the effects of Fermi motion. The scale dependence is implemented into the DGLAP-evolved quark and gluon densities in a proton derived analytically at the leading order of QCD coupling. By fitting the rescaling parameters to experimental data on the ratio $F_2^A(x,Q^2)/F_2^{A^\prime}(x,Q^2)$ for several nuclear targets $A$ and $A^\prime$, we obtain redictions for nuclear parton distributions, even for unmeasured nuclei. The effects of nuclear modifications are investigated with respect to the mass number $A$. Our results highlight distinct shadowing and antishadowing behaviors for gluons and quarks.</description>

      <title>Mixed WIMP-FIMP scenario in a two-component dark matter model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the mixed WIMP-FIMP scenario in a two-component dark matter model with $Z_2 \times Z_4$ symmetry, where a singlet scalar $S$ and a Majarano fermion $\chi$ are introduced as dark matter candidates. We also introduce another singlet scalar $S_0$ with a non-zero vacuum expectation value to the SM so that the fermion dark matter can obtain mass after spontaneous symmetry breaking. Either $S$ or $\chi$ relic density can be generated via the "Freeze-out" mechanism. In contrast, the other DM candidate relic density is obtained by the "Freeze-in" mechanism, and we therefore have two different cases. In the case of $\chi$ as WIMP and $S$ as FIMP, we perform random scans to estimate the allowed parameter space consistent with the dark matter constraint. The results show that this case is viable over a wide range of dark matter masses with the Yukawa coupling of $S_0$ and $\chi$ should be larger than 1. Instead, for the case of $S$ as WIMP and $\chi$ as FIMP, the viable parameter space is more constrained by the direct detection experiements, and we have two regions with $m_S \approx 62.5$ GeV and $m_S&gt;400$ GeV under the constraints, which is consistent with the singlet scalar DM result but the scalar DM mass can be as low as a few hundred GeV for the heavy mass region in the model.</description>

      <title>Space-time geometry of small and large collision systems at LHC energies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identified-hadron (PID) spectra from 2.76 TeV Pb-Pb and $p$-$p$ collisions are analyzed via a two-component (soft + hard) model (TCM) of hadron production in high-energy nuclear collisions. The Pb-Pb TCM is adopted with minor changes from a recent analysis of PID hadron spectra from 5 TeV $p$-Pb collisions. The object of study is evidence for jet suppression in small and large collision systems as indicating quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formation there. Conventional methods have included Pb-Pb centrality determination via classical Glauber model and evidence for high-$p_t$ suppression sought via spectrum ratio $R_\text{AA}$. In the present study alternative geometry determination via ensemble-mean $\bar p_t$ data reveals that the number of participant nucleons in central Pb-Pb collisions is about 1/3 of the Glauber estimate. Based on certain features of Pb-Pb spectra the validity of the factorization assumption is also questioned. The entire jet contribution is therefore treated without factorization in ratio to a $p$-$p$ spectrum model as reference. The new results indicate that exclusivity and time dilation (experienced by participant partons) play an essential role in jet production not incorporated in Glauber model or hard-component factorization. The combination determines an effective number of N-N collisions per participant nucleon given specific Pb-Pb centrality. The effect on parton fragment (jet) distributions on $p_t$ is similar to projectile-proton fragment distributions on pseudorapidity from fixed-target $p$-A experiments where low-$\eta$ densities scale with A while high-$\eta$ densities are consistent with $p$-$p$ collisions. $p$-Pb and Pb-Pb spectra similarly analyzed reflect the same physics given different geometries. Jet suppression related to QGP formation is not evident.</description>

      <title>Cutkosky rules and 1-loop $\kappa$-deformed amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we show that the Cutkosky cutting rules are still valid term by term in the expansion in powers of $\kappa$ of the $\kappa$-deformed 1-loop correction to the propagator. We first present a general argument which relates each term in the expansion to a non-deformed amplitude containing additional propagators with mass $M&gt;\kappa$. We then show the same thing more pragmatically, by reducing the singularity structure of the coefficients in the expansion of the $\kappa$-deformed amplitude, to the singularity structure of non-deformed loop amplitudes, by using algebraic and analytic identities. We will explicitly show this up to second order in $1/\kappa$, but the technique can be generalized to higher orders in $1/\kappa$. Both the abstract and the more direct approach easily generalize to different deformed theories. We will then compute the full imaginary part of the $\kappa$-deformed 1-loop correction to the propagator in a specific model, up to second order in the expansion in $1/\kappa$, highlighting the usefulness of the approach for the phenomenology of deformed models. This explicitly confirms previous qualitative arguments concerning the behaviour of the decay width of unstable particles in the considered model.</description>

      <title>Model-independent cosmological inference after the DESI DR2 data with improved inverse distance ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) measurements from the DESI survey have suggested hints of dynamical dark energy, challenging the standard $\Lambda $CDM model. In this work, we adopt an improved inverse distance ladder approach based on the latest cosmological data to provide a model-independent perspective, employing a global parametrization based on cosmic age (PAge). Our analysis incorporates DESI DR2 BAO measurements, cosmic chronometer (CC) data, and type Ia supernovae (SNe) observations from either the DESY5 or PantheonPlus datasets. For the DESY5+DESI DR2+CC datasets, we obtain $H_0 = 67.91 \pm 2.33~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$. This value is consistent with the Planck 2018 result, while shows $2.0 \sigma$ tension with the SH0ES measurement. Furthermore, by mapping specific cosmological models into PAge approximation parameter space $(p_{\mathrm{age}}, \eta)$, our model-independent analysis reveals a notable deviation from the $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$ model, as indicated by the DESY5 and DESI DR2 datasets. Finally, DESY5+DESI DR2+CC datasets provide nearly decisive evidence favoring the PAge model over the standard $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$ model. These findings highlight the need for further investigation into the expansion history to better understand the deviations from the $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$ model.</description>

      <title>New Physics Search at the CEPC: a General Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Circular Electron-Positron Collider (CEPC), a proposed next-generation Higgs factory, provides new opportunities to explore physics beyond the Standard Model (SM). With its clean electron-positron collision environment and the ability to collect large samples of Higgs, W, and Z bosons, the CEPC enables precision measurements and searches for new physics. This white paper outlines the CEPC's discovery potential, including studies of exotic decays of the Higgs, Z, and top quarks, dark matter and dark sector phenomena, long-lived particles, supersymmetry, and neutrino-related signatures. Advanced detector technologies and reconstruction techniques, such as one-to-one correspondence reconstruction and jet origin identification, significantly improve sensitivity to rare and weakly interacting processes. The CEPC is particularly well suited to probe the electroweak phase transition and test models of electroweak baryogenesis and dark sector interactions. In addition, global fit analyses highlight the CEPC's complementary role in constraining a wide range of new physics scenarios. These features position the CEPC as a powerful tool for exploring the next frontier in fundamental particle physics in the post-Higgs discovery era.</description>

      <title>Cosmological perturbations for smooth sign-switching dark energy models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18992v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we carry out a comprehensive perturbative analysis of four cosmological models featuring a sign-switching cosmological constant. Among these, we include the well-known $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model, characterised by an abrupt transition from a negative to a positive cosmological constant. We also consider the L$\Lambda$CDM model, which exhibits a generalised ladder-step evolution, as well as the SSCDM and ECDM models, both of which undergo a smooth sign change at comparable redshifts. We solve the linear cosmological perturbation equations from the radiation-dominated era, imposing initial adiabatic conditions for matter and radiation, for modes well outside the Hubble radius in the early Universe. We analyse the behaviour of the matter density contrast, the gravitational potential, the linear growth rate, the matter power spectrum, and the $f\sigma_8$ evolution . These results are contrasted with predictions from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model and are confronted with observational data.</description>
