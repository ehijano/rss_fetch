      <title>Multi-Timescale Quantum Averaging Theory for Driven Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a multi-timescale Quantum Averaging Theory (QAT), a generalized unitarity-preserving analytic framework for modeling periodically and almost-periodically driven quantum systems across multiple timescales. By integrating the Magnus expansion with the method of averaging on multiple scales, QAT captures the effects of both far-detuned and near-resonant interactions on system dynamics. The framework yields an effective Hamiltonian description while retaining fast oscillatory effects within a separate dynamical phase operator, ensuring accuracy across a wide range of driving regimes. We demonstrate the rapid convergence of QAT results toward exact numerical solutions in both detuning regimes for touchstone problems in quantum information science.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Dynamics of a Dicke Model for V-Type Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the nonlinear, semiclassical dynamics of an open spin-1 (three-level) variant of the traditional Dicke model. In particular, we focus on V-type energy-level configurations with varying degrees of energy-level asymmetry. We also allow for unbalanced coupling -- where co-rotating and counter-rotating Hamiltonian terms are independently tunable. We characterise the system with a dynamical systems approach, where different behaviors map to definite dynamical objects, and phase transitions to bifurcations. We find the emergence of both periodic and two-frequency oscillations, as well as multistability and chaotic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Media and responsible AI governance: a game-theoretic and LLM analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the complex interplay between AI developers, regulators, users, and the media in fostering trustworthy AI systems. Using evolutionary game theory and large language models (LLMs), we model the strategic interactions among these actors under different regulatory regimes. The research explores two key mechanisms for achieving responsible governance, safe AI development and adoption of safe AI: incentivising effective regulation through media reporting, and conditioning user trust on commentariats' recommendation. The findings highlight the crucial role of the media in providing information to users, potentially acting as a form of "soft" regulation by investigating developers or regulators, as a substitute to institutional AI regulation (which is still absent in many regions). Both game-theoretic analysis and LLM-based simulations reveal conditions under which effective regulation and trustworthy AI development emerge, emphasising the importance of considering the influence of different regulatory regimes from an evolutionary game-theoretic perspective. The study concludes that effective governance requires managing incentives and costs for high quality commentaries.</description>

      <title>The Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes Framework for Multiphase Fluid Flows: Laminar, Turbulent, and Active</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes (CHNS) partial differential equations (PDEs) provide a powerful framework for the study of the statistical mechanics and fluid dynamics of multiphase fluids. We provide an introduction to the equilibrium and nonequilibrium statistical mechanics of systems in which coexisting phases, distinguished from each other by scalar order parameters, are separated by an interface. We then introduce the coupled Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes (CHNS) PDEs for two immiscible fluids and generalisations for (a) coexisting phases with different viscosities, (b) CHNS with gravity, (c) the three-component fluids (CHNS3), and (d) the CHNS for active fluids. We discuss mathematical issues of the regularity of solutions of the CHNS PDEs. Finally we provide a survey of the rich variety of results that have been obtained by numerical studies of CHNS-type PDEs for diverse systems, including bubbles in turbulent flows, antibubbles, droplet and liquid-lens mergers, turbulence in the active-CHNS model, and its generalisation that can lead to a self-propelled droplet.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Nonlinear Dynamics via Smooth Prototype Equivalences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Characterizing dynamical systems given limited measurements is a common challenge throughout the physical and biological sciences. However, this task is challenging, especially due to transient variability in systems with equivalent long-term dynamics. We address this by introducing smooth prototype equivalences (SPE), a framework that fits a diffeomorphism using normalizing flows to distinct prototypes - simplified dynamical systems that define equivalence classes of behavior. SPE enables classification by comparing the deformation loss of the observed sparse, high-dimensional measurements to the prototype dynamics. Furthermore, our approach enables estimation of the invariant sets of the observed dynamics through the learned mapping from prototype space to data space. Our method outperforms existing techniques in the classification of oscillatory systems and can efficiently identify invariant structures like limit cycles and fixed points in an equation-free manner, even when only a small, noisy subset of the phase space is observed. Finally, we show how our method can be used for the detection of biological processes like the cell cycle trajectory from high-dimensional single-cell gene expression data.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Bifurcations in Stochastic Non-Normal Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01833v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We challenge the prevailing emphasis on bifurcations as the primary mechanism behind many abrupt changes in complex systems and propose an alternative, more universally applicable explanation based on non-normal dynamics. We demonstrate that linear or approximately linear stochastic systems near a dynamical attractor exhibit transient repulsive dynamics - termed pseudo-bifurcations - when interacting components are sufficiently asymmetric and hierarchically organized, i.e., non-normal. These pseudo-bifurcations produce early-warning signals commonly linked to bifurcations, such as dimension reduction, critical slowing down, and increased variance. Furthermore, we show that, as actual bifurcations approach, non-normal transients also emerge, complicating their distinction and potentially creating a bias that suggests the system is much closer to a critical point than it actually is. We support our analytical derivations by empirically demonstrating that the brain exhibits clear signs of such non-normal transients during epileptic seizures. Many systems suspected of approaching critical bifurcation points should be reconsidered, as non-normal dynamics offer a more generic explanation for the observed phenomena across natural, physical, and social systems.</description>
