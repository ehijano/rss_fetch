      <title>Parameter Inference via Differentiable Diffusion Bridge Importance Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a methodology for performing parameter inference in high-dimensional, non-linear diffusion processes. We illustrate its applicability for obtaining insights into the evolution of and relationships between species, including ancestral state reconstruction. Estimation is performed by utilising score matching to approximate diffusion bridges, which are subsequently used in an importance sampler to estimate log-likelihoods. The entire setup is differentiable, allowing gradient ascent on approximated log-likelihoods. This allows both parameter inference and diffusion mean estimation. This novel, numerically stable, score matching-based parameter inference framework is presented and demonstrated on biological two- and three-dimensional morphometry data.</description>

      <title>Microfoundation Inference for Strategic Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Often in prediction tasks, the predictive model itself can influence the distribution of the target variable, a phenomenon termed performative prediction. Generally, this influence stems from strategic actions taken by stakeholders with a vested interest in predictive models. A key challenge that hinders the widespread adaptation of performative prediction in machine learning is that practitioners are generally unaware of the social impacts of their predictions. To address this gap, we propose a methodology for learning the distribution map that encapsulates the long-term impacts of predictive models on the population. Specifically, we model agents' responses as a cost-adjusted utility maximization problem and propose estimates for said cost. Our approach leverages optimal transport to align pre-model exposure (ex ante) and post-model exposure (ex post) distributions. We provide a rate of convergence for this proposed estimate and assess its quality through empirical demonstrations on a credit-scoring dataset.</description>

      <title>Minimax Optimal Two-Sample Testing under Local Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the trade-off between privacy and statistical utility in private two-sample testing under local differential privacy (LDP) for both multinomial and continuous data. We begin by addressing the multinomial case, where we introduce private permutation tests using practical privacy mechanisms such as Laplace, discrete Laplace, and Google's RAPPOR. We then extend our multinomial approach to continuous data via binning and study its uniform separation rates under LDP over H\"older and Besov smoothness classes. The proposed tests for both discrete and continuous cases rigorously control the type I error for any finite sample size, strictly adhere to LDP constraints, and achieve minimax separation rates under LDP. The attained minimax rates reveal inherent privacy-utility trade-offs that are unavoidable in private testing. To address scenarios with unknown smoothness parameters in density testing, we propose an adaptive test based on a Bonferroni-type approach that ensures robust performance without prior knowledge of the smoothness parameters. We validate our theoretical findings with extensive numerical experiments and demonstrate the practical relevance and effectiveness of our proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Hybrid deep additive neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional neural networks (multi-layer perceptrons) have become an important tool in data science due to their success across a wide range of tasks. However, their performance is sometimes unsatisfactory, and they often require a large number of parameters, primarily due to their reliance on the linear combination structure. Meanwhile, additive regression has been a popular alternative to linear regression in statistics. In this work, we introduce novel deep neural networks that incorporate the idea of additive regression. Our neural networks share architectural similarities with Kolmogorov-Arnold networks but are based on simpler yet flexible activation and basis functions. Additionally, we introduce several hybrid neural networks that combine this architecture with that of traditional neural networks. We derive their universal approximation properties and demonstrate their effectiveness through simulation studies and a real-data application. The numerical results indicate that our neural networks generally achieve better performance than traditional neural networks while using fewer parameters.</description>

      <title>Sparse Bayesian Generative Modeling for Compressive Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work addresses the fundamental linear inverse problem in compressive sensing (CS) by introducing a new type of regularizing generative prior. Our proposed method utilizes ideas from classical dictionary-based CS and, in particular, sparse Bayesian learning (SBL), to integrate a strong regularization towards sparse solutions. At the same time, by leveraging the notion of conditional Gaussianity, it also incorporates the adaptability from generative models to training data. However, unlike most state-of-the-art generative models, it is able to learn from a few compressed and noisy data samples and requires no optimization algorithm for solving the inverse problem. Additionally, similar to Dirichlet prior networks, our model parameterizes a conjugate prior enabling its application for uncertainty quantification. We support our approach theoretically through the concept of variational inference and validate it empirically using different types of compressible signals.</description>

      <title>Counterfactual Uncertainty Quantification of Factual Estimand of Efficacy from Before-and-After Treatment Repeated Measures Randomized Controlled Trials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ideal estimand for comparing a new treatment $Rx$ with a control $C$ is the $\textit{counterfactual}$ efficacy $Rx:C$, the expected differential outcome between $Rx$ and $C$ if each patient were given $\textit{both}$. While counterfactual $\textit{point estimation}$ from $\textit{factual}$ Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) has been available, this article shows $\textit{counterfactual}$ uncertainty quantification (CUQ), quantifying uncertainty for factual point estimates but in a counterfactual setting, is surprisingly achievable. We achieve CUQ whose variability is typically smaller than factual UQ, by creating a new statistical modeling principle called ETZ which is applicable to RCTs with $\textit{Before-and-After}$ treatment Repeated Measures, common in many therapeutic areas.
  We urge caution when estimate of the unobservable true condition of a patient before treatment has measurement error, because that violation of standard regression assumption can cause attenuation in estimating treatment effects. Fortunately, we prove that, for traditional medicine in general, and for targeted therapy with efficacy defined as averaged over the population, counterfactual point estimation is unbiased. However, for targeted therapy, both Real Human and Digital Twins approaches should respect this limitation, lest predicted treatment effect in $\textit{subgroups}$ will have bias.</description>

      <title>Conditional regression for the Nonlinear Single-Variable Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several statistical models for regression of a function $F$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$ without the statistical and computational curse of dimensionality exist, for example by imposing and exploiting geometric assumptions on the distribution of the data (e.g. that its support is low-dimensional), or strong smoothness assumptions on $F$, or a special structure $F$. Among the latter, compositional models assume $F=f\circ g$ with $g$ mapping to $\mathbb{R}^r$ with $r\ll d$, have been studied, and include classical single- and multi-index models and recent works on neural networks. While the case where $g$ is linear is rather well-understood, much less is known when $g$ is nonlinear, and in particular for which $g$'s the curse of dimensionality in estimating $F$, or both $f$ and $g$, may be circumvented. In this paper, we consider a model $F(X):=f(\Pi_\gamma X) $ where $\Pi_\gamma:\mathbb{R}^d\to[0,\rm{len}_\gamma]$ is the closest-point projection onto the parameter of a regular curve $\gamma: [0,\rm{len}_\gamma]\to\mathbb{R}^d$ and $f:[0,\rm{len}_\gamma]\to\mathbb{R}^1$. The input data $X$ is not low-dimensional, far from $\gamma$, conditioned on $\Pi_\gamma(X)$ being well-defined. The distribution of the data, $\gamma$ and $f$ are unknown. This model is a natural nonlinear generalization of the single-index model, which corresponds to $\gamma$ being a line. We propose a nonparametric estimator, based on conditional regression, and show that under suitable assumptions, the strongest of which being that $f$ is coarsely monotone, it can achieve the $one$-$dimensional$ optimal min-max rate for non-parametric regression, up to the level of noise in the observations, and be constructed in time $\mathcal{O}(d^2n\log n)$. All the constants in the learning bounds, in the minimal number of samples required for our bounds to hold, and in the computational complexity are at most low-order polynomials in $d$.</description>

      <title>A Message Passing Neural Network Surrogate Model for Bond-Associated Peridynamic Material Correspondence Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Peridynamics is a non-local continuum mechanics theory that offers unique advantages for modeling problems involving discontinuities and complex deformations. Within the peridynamic framework, various formulations exist, among which the material correspondence formulation stands out for its ability to directly incorporate traditional continuum material models, making it highly applicable to a range of engineering challenges. A notable advancement in this area is the bond-associated correspondence model, which not only resolves issues of material instability but also achieves high computational accuracy. However, the bond-associated model typically requires higher computational costs than FEA, which can limit its practical application. To address this computational challenge, we propose a novel surrogate model based on a message-passing neural network (MPNN) specifically designed for the bond-associated peridynamic material correspondence formulation. Leveraging the similarities between graph structure and the neighborhood connectivity inherent to peridynamics, we construct an MPNN that can transfers domain knowledge from peridynamics into a computational graph and shorten the computation time via GPU acceleration. Unlike conventional graph neural networks that focus on node features, our model emphasizes edge-based features, capturing the essential material point interactions in the formulation. A key advantage of this neural network approach is its flexibility: it does not require fixed neighborhood connectivity, making it adaptable across diverse configurations and scalable for complex systems. Furthermore, the model inherently possesses translational and rotational invariance, enabling it to maintain physical objectivity: a critical requirement for accurate mechanical modeling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop algorithms for the optimization of convex objectives that have H\"older continuous $q$-th derivatives with respect to a $p$-norm by using a $q$-th order oracle, for $p, q \geq 1$. We can also optimize other structured functions. We do this by developing a non-Euclidean inexact accelerated proximal point method that makes use of an inexact uniformly convex regularizer. We also provide nearly matching lower bounds for any deterministic algorithm that interacts with the function via a local oracle.</description>

      <title>On the Selection Stability of Stability Selection and Its Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stability selection is a widely adopted resampling-based framework for high-dimensional structure estimation and variable selection. However, the concept of 'stability' is often narrowly addressed, primarily through examining selection frequencies, or 'stability paths'. This paper seeks to broaden the use of an established stability estimator to evaluate the overall stability of the stability selection framework, moving beyond single-variable analysis. We suggest that the stability estimator offers two advantages: it can serve as a reference to reflect the robustness of the outcomes obtained and help identify an optimal regularization value to improve stability. By determining this value, we aim to calibrate key stability selection parameters, namely, the decision threshold and the expected number of falsely selected variables, within established theoretical bounds. Furthermore, we explore a novel selection criterion based on this regularization value. With the asymptotic distribution of the stability estimator previously established, convergence to true stability is ensured, allowing us to observe stability trends over successive sub-samples. This approach sheds light on the required number of sub-samples addressing a notable gap in prior studies. The 'stabplot' package is developed to facilitate the use of the plots featured in this manuscript, supporting their integration into further statistical analysis and research workflows.</description>

      <title>Efficiently learning and sampling multimodal distributions with data-based initialization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of sampling a multimodal distribution with a Markov chain given a small number of samples from the stationary measure. Although mixing can be arbitrarily slow, we show that if the Markov chain has a $k$th order spectral gap, initialization from a set of $\tilde O(k/\varepsilon^2)$ samples from the stationary distribution will, with high probability over the samples, efficiently generate a sample whose conditional law is $\varepsilon$-close in TV distance to the stationary measure. In particular, this applies to mixtures of $k$ distributions satisfying a Poincar\'e inequality, with faster convergence when they satisfy a log-Sobolev inequality. Our bounds are stable to perturbations to the Markov chain, and in particular work for Langevin diffusion over $\mathbb R^d$ with score estimation error, as well as Glauber dynamics combined with approximation error from pseudolikelihood estimation. This justifies the success of data-based initialization for score matching methods despite slow mixing for the data distribution, and improves and generalizes the results of Koehler and Vuong (2023) to have linear, rather than exponential, dependence on $k$ and apply to arbitrary semigroups. As a consequence of our results, we show for the first time that a natural class of low-complexity Ising measures can be efficiently learned from samples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present two sharp empirical Bernstein inequalities for symmetric random matrices with bounded eigenvalues. By sharp, we mean that both inequalities adapt to the unknown variance in a tight manner: the deviation captured by the first-order $1/\sqrt{n}$ term asymptotically matches the matrix Bernstein inequality exactly, including constants, the latter requiring knowledge of the variance. Our first inequality holds for the sample mean of independent matrices, and our second inequality holds for a mean estimator under martingale dependence at stopping times.</description>

      <title>On the Limits of Language Generation: Trade-Offs Between Hallucination and Mode Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Specifying all desirable properties of a language model is challenging, but certain requirements seem essential. Given samples from an unknown language, the trained model should produce valid strings not seen in training and be expressive enough to capture the language's full richness. Otherwise, outputting invalid strings constitutes "hallucination," and failing to capture the full range leads to "mode collapse." We ask if a language model can meet both requirements.
  We investigate this within a statistical language generation setting building on Gold and Angluin. Here, the model receives random samples from a distribution over an unknown language K, which belongs to a possibly infinite collection of languages. The goal is to generate unseen strings from K. We say the model generates from K with consistency and breadth if, as training size increases, its output converges to all unseen strings in K.
  Kleinberg and Mullainathan [KM24] asked if consistency and breadth in language generation are possible. We answer this negatively: for a large class of language models, including next-token prediction models, this is impossible for most collections of candidate languages. This contrasts with [KM24]'s result, showing consistent generation without breadth is possible for any countable collection of languages. Our finding highlights that generation with breadth fundamentally differs from generation without breadth.
  As a byproduct, we establish near-tight bounds on the number of samples needed for generation with or without breadth.
  Finally, our results offer hope: consistent generation with breadth is achievable for any countable collection of languages when negative examples (strings outside K) are available alongside positive ones. This suggests that post-training feedback, which encodes negative examples, can be crucial in reducing hallucinations while limiting mode collapse.</description>

      <title>Statistical Advantages of Perturbing Cosine Router in Mixture of Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cosine router in Mixture of Experts (MoE) has recently emerged as an attractive alternative to the conventional linear router. Indeed, the cosine router demonstrates favorable performance in image and language tasks and exhibits better ability to mitigate the representation collapse issue, which often leads to parameter redundancy and limited representation potentials. Despite its empirical success, a comprehensive analysis of the cosine router in MoE has been lacking. Considering the least square estimation of the cosine routing MoE, we demonstrate that due to the intrinsic interaction of the model parameters in the cosine router via some partial differential equations, regardless of the structures of the experts, the estimation rates of experts and model parameters can be as slow as $\mathcal{O}(1/\log^{\tau}(n))$ where $\tau &gt; 0$ is some constant and $n$ is the sample size. Surprisingly, these pessimistic non-polynomial convergence rates can be circumvented by the widely used technique in practice to stabilize the cosine router -- simply adding noises to the $L^2$ norms in the cosine router, which we refer to as \textit{perturbed cosine router}. Under the strongly identifiable settings of the expert functions, we prove that the estimation rates for both the experts and model parameters under the perturbed cosine routing MoE are significantly improved to polynomial rates. Finally, we conduct extensive simulation studies in both synthetic and real data settings to empirically validate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Safe Sample Elimination under Covariate Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a machine learning setup where one training dataset is used to train multiple models across slightly different data distributions. This occurs when customized models are needed for various deployment environments. To reduce storage and training costs, we propose the DRSSS method, which combines distributionally robust (DR) optimization and safe sample screening (SSS). The key benefit of this method is that models trained on the reduced dataset will perform the same as those trained on the full dataset for all possible different environments. In this paper, we focus on covariate shift as a type of data distribution change and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experiments.</description>

      <title>Recurrent Neural Goodness-of-Fit Test for Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time series data are crucial across diverse domains such as finance and healthcare, where accurate forecasting and decision-making rely on advanced modeling techniques. While generative models have shown great promise in capturing the intricate dynamics inherent in time series, evaluating their performance remains a major challenge. Traditional evaluation metrics fall short due to the temporal dependencies and potential high dimensionality of the features. In this paper, we propose the REcurrent NeurAL (RENAL) Goodness-of-Fit test, a novel and statistically rigorous framework for evaluating generative time series models. By leveraging recurrent neural networks, we transform the time series into conditionally independent data pairs, enabling the application of a chi-square-based goodness-of-fit test to the temporal dependencies within the data. This approach offers a robust, theoretically grounded solution for assessing the quality of generative models, particularly in settings with limited time sequences. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method across both synthetic and real-world datasets, outperforming existing methods in terms of reliability and accuracy. Our method fills a critical gap in the evaluation of time series generative models, offering a tool that is both practical and adaptable to high-stakes applications.</description>

      <title>Comparative Evaluation of Clustered Federated Learning Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over recent years, Federated Learning (FL) has proven to be one of the most promising methods of distributed learning which preserves data privacy. As the method evolved and was confronted to various real-world scenarios, new challenges have emerged. One such challenge is the presence of highly heterogeneous (often referred as non-IID) data distributions among participants of the FL protocol. A popular solution to this hurdle is Clustered Federated Learning (CFL), which aims to partition clients into groups where the distribution are homogeneous. In the literature, state-of-the-art CFL algorithms are often tested using a few cases of data heterogeneities, without systematically justifying the choices. Further, the taxonomy used for differentiating the different heterogeneity scenarios is not always straightforward. In this paper, we explore the performance of two state-of-theart CFL algorithms with respect to a proposed taxonomy of data heterogeneities in federated learning (FL). We work with three image classification datasets and analyze the resulting clusters against the heterogeneity classes using extrinsic clustering metrics. Our objective is to provide a clearer understanding of the relationship between CFL performances and data heterogeneity scenarios.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical mixtures of Unigram models for short text clustering: the role of Beta-Liouville priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a variant of the Multinomial mixture model tailored for the unsupervised classification of short text data. Traditionally, the Multinomial probability vector in this hierarchical model is assigned a Dirichlet prior distribution. Here, however, we explore an alternative prior--the Beta-Liouville distribution--which offers a more flexible correlation structure than the Dirichlet. We examine the theoretical properties of the Beta-Liouville distribution, focusing on its conjugacy with the Multinomial likelihood. This property enables the derivation of update equations for a CAVI (Coordinate Ascent Variational Inference) variational algorithm, facilitating the approximate posterior estimation of model parameters. Additionally, we propose a stochastic variant of the CAVI algorithm that enhances scalability. The paper concludes with data examples that demonstrate effective strategies for setting the Beta-Liouville hyperparameters.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous upper and lower bounds of American-style option prices with hedging via neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.12439v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce two novel methods to solve the American-style option pricing problem and its dual form at the same time using neural networks. Without applying nested Monte Carlo, the first method uses a series of neural networks to simultaneously compute both the lower and upper bounds of the option price, and the second one accomplishes the same goal with one global network. The avoidance of extra simulations and the use of neural networks significantly reduce the computational complexity and allow us to price Bermudan options with frequent exercise opportunities in high dimensions, as illustrated by the provided numerical experiments. As a by-product, these methods also derive a hedging strategy for the option, which can also be used as a control variate for variance reduction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Obtaining continuously updated predictions is a major challenge for personalised medicine. Leveraging combinations of parametric regressions and machine learning approaches, the personalised online super learner (POSL) can achieve such dynamic and personalised predictions. We adapt POSL to predict a repeated continuous outcome dynamically and propose a new way to validate such personalised or dynamic prediction models. We illustrate its performance by predicting the convection volume of patients undergoing hemodiafiltration. POSL outperformed its candidate learners with respect to median absolute error, calibration-in-the-large, discrimination, and net benefit. We finally discuss the choices and challenges underlying the use of POSL.</description>

      <title>Finite-Time Decoupled Convergence in Nonlinear Two-Time-Scale Stochastic Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03893v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In two-time-scale stochastic approximation (SA), two iterates are updated at varying speeds using different step sizes, with each update influencing the other. Previous studies on linear two-time-scale SA have shown that the convergence rates of the mean-square errors for these updates depend solely on their respective step sizes, a phenomenon termed decoupled convergence. However, achieving decoupled convergence in nonlinear SA remains less understood. Our research investigates the potential for finite-time decoupled convergence in nonlinear two-time-scale SA. We demonstrate that, under a nested local linearity assumption, finite-time decoupled convergence rates can be achieved with suitable step size selection. To derive this result, we conduct a convergence analysis of the matrix cross term between the iterates and leverage fourth-order moment convergence rates to control the higher-order error terms induced by local linearity. Additionally, a numerical example is provided to explore the possible necessity of local linearity for decoupled convergence.</description>

      <title>Efficient modeling of sub-kilometer surface wind with Gaussian processes and neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurately representing surface weather at the sub-kilometer scale is crucial for optimal decision-making in a wide range of applications. This motivates the use of statistical techniques to provide accurate and calibrated probabilistic predictions at a lower cost compared to numerical simulations. Wind represents a particularly challenging variable to model due to its high spatial and temporal variability. This paper presents a novel approach that integrates Gaussian processes and neural networks to model surface wind gusts at sub-kilometer resolution, leveraging multiple data sources, including numerical weather prediction models, topographical descriptors, and in-situ measurements. Results demonstrate the added value of modeling the multivariate covariance structure of the variable of interest, as opposed to only applying a univariate probabilistic regression approach. Modeling the covariance enables the optimal integration of observed measurements from ground stations, which is shown to reduce the continuous ranked probability score compared to the baseline. Moreover, it allows the generation of realistic fields that are also marginally calibrated, aided by scalable techniques such as random Fourier features and pathwise conditioning. We discuss the effect of different modeling choices, as well as different degrees of approximation, and present our results for a case study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Determining the form of the Higgs potential is one of the most exciting challenges of modern particle physics. Higgs pair production directly probes the Higgs self-coupling and should be observed in the near future at the High-Luminosity LHC. We explore how to improve the sensitivity to physics beyond the Standard Model through per-event kinematics for di-Higgs events. In particular, we employ machine learning through simulation-based inference to estimate per-event likelihood ratios and gauge potential sensitivity gains from including this kinematic information. In terms of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, we find that adding a limited number of observables can help to remove degeneracies in Wilson coefficient likelihoods and significantly improve the experimental sensitivity.</description>

      <title>The High Line: Exact Risk and Learning Rate Curves of Stochastic Adaptive Learning Rate Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a framework for analyzing the training and learning rate dynamics on a large class of high-dimensional optimization problems, which we call the high line, trained using one-pass stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with adaptive learning rates. We give exact expressions for the risk and learning rate curves in terms of a deterministic solution to a system of ODEs. We then investigate in detail two adaptive learning rates -- an idealized exact line search and AdaGrad-Norm -- on the least squares problem. When the data covariance matrix has strictly positive eigenvalues, this idealized exact line search strategy can exhibit arbitrarily slower convergence when compared to the optimal fixed learning rate with SGD. Moreover we exactly characterize the limiting learning rate (as time goes to infinity) for line search in the setting where the data covariance has only two distinct eigenvalues. For noiseless targets, we further demonstrate that the AdaGrad-Norm learning rate converges to a deterministic constant inversely proportional to the average eigenvalue of the data covariance matrix, and identify a phase transition when the covariance density of eigenvalues follows a power law distribution. We provide our code for evaluation at https://github.com/amackenzie1/highline2024.</description>

      <title>How to Boost Any Loss Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Boosting is a highly successful ML-born optimization setting in which one is required to computationally efficiently learn arbitrarily good models based on the access to a weak learner oracle, providing classifiers performing at least slightly differently from random guessing. A key difference with gradient-based optimization is that boosting's original model does not requires access to first order information about a loss, yet the decades long history of boosting has quickly evolved it into a first order optimization setting -- sometimes even wrongfully defining it as such. Owing to recent progress extending gradient-based optimization to use only a loss' zeroth ($0^{th}$) order information to learn, this begs the question: what loss functions can be efficiently optimized with boosting and what is the information really needed for boosting to meet the original boosting blueprint's requirements?
  We provide a constructive formal answer essentially showing that any loss function can be optimized with boosting and thus boosting can achieve a feat not yet known to be possible in the classical $0^{th}$ order setting, since loss functions are not required to be be convex, nor differentiable or Lipschitz -- and in fact not required to be continuous either. Some tools we use are rooted in quantum calculus, the mathematical field -- not to be confounded with quantum computation -- that studies calculus without passing to the limit, and thus without using first order information.</description>

      <title>A Unified Probabilistic Approach to Traffic Conflict Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10959v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traffic conflict detection is essential for proactive road safety by identifying potential collisions before they occur. Existing methods rely on surrogate safety measures tailored to specific interactions (e.g., car-following, side-swiping, or path-crossing) and require varying thresholds in different traffic conditions. This variation leads to inconsistencies and limited adaptability of conflict detection in evolving traffic environments. Consequently, a need persists for consistent detection of traffic conflicts across interaction contexts. To address this need, this study proposes a unified probabilistic approach. The proposed approach establishes a unified framework of traffic conflict detection, where traffic conflicts are formulated as context-dependent extreme events of road user interactions. The detection of conflicts is then decomposed into a series of statistical learning tasks: representing interaction contexts, inferring proximity distributions, and assessing extreme collision risk. The unified formulation accommodates diverse hypotheses of traffic conflicts and the learning tasks enable data-driven analysis of factors such as motion states of road users, environment conditions, and participant characteristics. Jointly, this approach supports consistent and comprehensive evaluation of the collision risk emerging in road user interactions. Our experiments using real-world trajectory data show that the approach provides effective collision warnings, generalises across distinct datasets and traffic environments, covers a broad range of conflict types, and captures a long-tailed distribution of conflict intensity. The findings highlight its potential to enhance the safety assessment of traffic infrastructures and policies, improve collision warning systems for autonomous driving, and deepen the understanding of road user behaviour in safety-critical interactions.</description>

Abstract: We propose a nonparametric, kernel-based joint estimator for conditional mean and covariance matrices in large unbalanced panels. Our estimator, with proven consistency and finite-sample guarantees, is applied to a comprehensive panel of monthly US stock excess returns from 1962 to 2021, conditioned on macroeconomic and firm-specific covariates. The estimator captures time-varying cross-sectional dependencies effectively, demonstrating robust statistical performance. In asset pricing, it generates conditional mean-variance efficient portfolios with out-of-sample Sharpe ratios that substantially exceed those of equal-weighted benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Minibatch Optimal Transport and Perplexity Bound Estimation in Discrete Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Outperforming autoregressive models on categorical data distributions, such as textual data, remains challenging for continuous diffusion and flow models. Discrete flow matching, a recent framework for modeling categorical data, has shown competitive performance with autoregressive models. Despite its similarities with continuous flow matching, the rectification strategy applied in the continuous version does not directly extend to the discrete one due to the inherent stochasticity of discrete paths. This limitation necessitates exploring alternative methods to minimize state transitions during generation. To address this, we propose a dynamic-optimal-transport-like minimization objective for discrete flows with convex interpolants and derive its equivalent Kantorovich formulation. The latter defines transport cost solely in terms of inter-state similarity and is optimized using a minibatch strategy. Another limitation we address in the discrete flow framework is model evaluation. Unlike continuous flows, wherein the instantaneous change of variables enables density estimation, discrete models lack a similar mechanism due to the inherent non-determinism and discontinuity of their paths. To alleviate this issue, we propose an upper bound on the perplexity of discrete flow models, enabling performance evaluation and comparison with other methods.</description>
