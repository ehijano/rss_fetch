      <title>On Layered Area-Proportional Rectangle Contact Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semantic word clouds visualize the semantic relatedness between the words of a text by placing pairs of related words close to each other. Formally, the problem of drawing semantic word clouds corresponds to drawing a rectangle contact representation of a graph whose vertices correlate to the words to be displayed and whose edges indicate that two words are semantically related. The goal is to maximize the number of realized contacts while avoiding any false adjacencies. We consider a variant of this problem that restricts input graphs to be layered and all rectangles to be of equal height, called \textsc{Maximum Layered Contact Representation Of Word Networks} or \textsc{Max-LayeredCrown}, as well as the variant \textsc{Max-IntLayeredCrown}, which restricts the problem to only rectangles of integer width and the placement of those rectangles to integer coordinates.
  We classify the corresponding decision problem $k$-\textsc{IntLayeredCrown} as NP-complete even for triangulated graphs and $k$-\textsc{LayeredCrown} as NP-complete for planar graphs. We introduce three algorithms: a 1/2-approximation for \textsc{Max-LayeredCrown} of triangulated graphs, and a PTAS and an XP algorithm for \textsc{Max-IntLayeredCrown} with rectangle width polynomial in $n$.</description>

      <title>Universal Solvability for Robot Motion Planning on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Universal Solvability of Robot Motion Planning on Graphs (USolR) problem: given an undirected graph G = (V, E) and p robots, determine whether any arbitrary configuration of the robots can be transformed into any other arbitrary configuration via a sequence of valid, collision-free moves. We design a canonical accumulation procedure that maps arbitrary configurations to configurations that occupy a fixed subset of vertices, enabling us to analyze configuration reachability in terms of equivalence classes. We prove that in instances that are not universally solvable, at least half of all configurations are unreachable from a given one, and leverage this to design an efficient randomized algorithm with one-sided error, which can be derandomized with a blow-up in the running time by a factor of p. Further, we optimize our deterministic algorithm by using the structure of the input graph G = (V, E), achieving a running time of O(p * (|V| + |E|)) in sparse graphs and O(|V| + |E|) in dense graphs. Finally, we consider the Graph Edge Augmentation for Universal Solvability (EAUS) problem, where given a connected graph G that is not universally solvable for p robots, the question is to check if for a given budget b, at most b edges can be added to G to make it universally solvable for p robots. We provide an upper bound of p - 2 on b for general graphs. On the other hand, we also provide examples of graphs that require Theta(p) edges to be added. We further study the Graph Vertex and Edge Augmentation for Universal Solvability (VEAUS) problem, where a vertices and b edges can be added, and we provide lower bounds on a and b.</description>
