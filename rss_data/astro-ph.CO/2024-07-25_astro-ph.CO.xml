      <title>Evaluating Cosmological Biases using Photometric Redshifts for Type Ia Supernova Cosmology with the Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological analyses with Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) have traditionally been reliant on spectroscopy for both classifying the type of supernova and obtaining reliable redshifts to measure the distance-redshift relation. While obtaining a host-galaxy spectroscopic redshift for most SNe is feasible for small-area transient surveys, it will be too resource intensive for upcoming large-area surveys such as the Vera Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time, which will observe on the order of millions of SNe. Here we use data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) to address this problem with photometric redshifts (photo-z) inferred directly from the SN light-curve in combination with Gaussian and full p(z) priors from host-galaxy photo-z estimates. Using the DES 5-year photometrically-classified SN sample, we consider several photo-z algorithms as host-galaxy photo-z priors, including the Self-Organizing Map redshifts (SOMPZ), Bayesian Photometric Redshifts (BPZ), and Directional-Neighbourhood Fitting (DNF) redshift estimates employed in the DES 3x2 point analyses. With detailed catalog-level simulations of the DES 5-year sample, we find that the simulated w can be recovered within $\pm$0.02 when using SN+SOMPZ or DNF prior photo-z, smaller than the average statistical uncertainty for these samples of 0.03. With data, we obtain biases in w consistent with simulations within ~1$\sigma$ for three of the five photo-z variants. We further evaluate how photo-z systematics interplay with photometric classification and find classification introduces a subdominant systematic component. This work lays the foundation for next-generation fully photometric SNe Ia cosmological analyses.</description>

      <title>Analytic model for the statistics of ultra-high magnification events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Highly magnified individual stars such as Icarus and Earendel have recently been observed near critical curves of galaxy clusters with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations. These stars are estimated to be magnified with a factor of more than a few thousands. In addition to the smooth mass distribution in the macro-lens model, the distribution of microlenses originating from, for instance, intracluster stars affects the event rate and the peak magnification significantly. We propose an analytic model of the high-magnification tail of the probability distribution function (PDF) in which the probability is assumed to be proportional to the number of independent microlens critical curves. Our model can explain the parameter dependence of the PDF on the mass fraction of the microlenses and the background magnification seen in ray-tracing simulations. The effect of a finite source size is also studied to derive a fitting formula for the suppression factor. For an application of our model, we calculate the event rate of the Icarus-like system and the probability distribution of observed positions of such system, showing good agreement with the HST observations. Our model predicts a complicated dependence of the probability distribution of observed positions of highly magnified events on the magnification threshold.</description>

      <title>Semi-Supervised Rotation Measure Deconvolution and its application to MeerKAT observations of galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Faraday rotation contains information about the magnetic field structure along the line of sight and is an important instrument in the study of cosmic magnetism. Traditional Faraday spectrum deconvolution methods such as RMCLEAN face challenges in resolving complex Faraday dispersion functions and handling large datasets. We develop a deep learning deconvolution model to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of extracting Faraday rotation measures from radio astronomical data, specifically targeting data from the MeerKAT Galaxy Cluster Legacy Survey (MGCLS). We use semi-supervised learning, where the model simultaneously recreates the data and minimizes the difference between the output and the true signal of synthetic data. Performance comparisons with RMCLEAN were conducted on simulated as well as real data for the galaxy cluster Abell 3376. Our semi-supervised model is able to recover the Faraday dispersion with great accuracy, particularly for complex or high-RM signals, maintaining sensitivity across a broad RM range. The computational efficiency of this method is significantly improved over traditional methods. Applied to observations of Abell 3376, we find detailed magnetic field structures in the radio relics, and several AGN. We also apply our model to MeerKAT data of Abell 85, Abell 168, Abell 194, Abell 3186 and Abell 3667.</description>

      <title>The mass effect -- Variations of masses and their impact on cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We summarize and explain the current status of variations of fundamental masses in cosmology, with a particular focus on variations of the electron mass. We show that electron mass variations not only allow for significant easing of the Hubble tension but are also preferred at a decent level of significance using the latest DESI data (between $2\sigma$ and $3.6\sigma$ depending on the model and the data). This extreme success of the model is neither tightly constrained from light element abundances generated during big bang nucleosynthesis nor from post-recombination observations using quasars and atomic clocks, though future data is expected to give strong evidence in favor of or against this model. Models of baryon mass variations, on the other hand, are shown to generally not be cosmologically interesting.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy Dark Matter Constraints from the Hubble Frontier Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In fuzzy dark matter (FDM) cosmologies, the dark matter consists of ultralight bosons ($m\lesssim10^{-20}$ eV). The astrophysically large de Broglie wavelengths of such particles hinder the formation of low-mass dark matter halos. This implies a testable prediction: a corresponding suppression in the faint-end of the ultraviolet luminosity function (UVLF) of galaxies. Notably, recent estimates of the faint-end UVLF at $z\sim5-9$ in the Hubble Frontier Fields, behind foreground lensing clusters, probe up to five magnitudes fainter than typical ("blank-field") regions. These measurements thus far disfavor prominent turnovers in the UVLF at low luminosity, implying bounds on FDM. We fit a semi-empirical model to these and blank-field UVLF data, including the FDM particle mass as a free parameter. This fit excludes cases where the dark matter is entirely a boson of mass $m&lt;1.5\times10^{-21}$ eV (with $2\sigma$ confidence). We also present a less stringent bound deriving solely from the requirement that the total observed abundance of galaxies, integrated over all luminosities, must not exceed the total halo abundance in FDM. This more model-agnostic bound disfavors $m&lt;5\times10^{-22}$ eV ($2\sigma$). We forecast that future UVLF measurements from JWST lensing fields may probe masses several times larger than these bounds, although we demonstrate this is subject to theoretical uncertainties in modeling the FDM halo mass function.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Constraint on the $f(R)$ Theory with the CSST SN Ia and BAO Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $f(R)$ modified gravity theory can explain the accelerating expansion of the late Universe without introducing dark energy. In this study, we predict the constraint strength on the $f(R)$ theory using the mock data generated from the China Space Station Telescope (CSST) Ultra-Deep Field (UDF) Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) survey and wide-field slitless spectroscopic baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) survey. We explore three popular $f(R)$ models, and introduce a parameter $b$ to characterize the deviation of the f(R) theory from the $\Lambda$CDM theory. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is employed to constrain the parameters in the $f(R)$ models, and the nuisance parameters and systematical uncertainties are also considered in the model fitting process. Besides, we also perform model comparisons between the $f(R)$ models and the $\Lambda$CDM model. We find that the constraint accuracy using the CSST SN Ia+BAO dataset alone is comparable to or even better than the result given by the combination of the current relevant observations, and the CSST SN Ia+BAO survey can distinguish the $f(R)$ models from the $\Lambda$CDM model. This indicates that the CSST SN Ia and BAO surveys can effectively constrain and test the $f(R)$ theory.</description>

      <title>Model-agnostic assessment of dark energy after DESI DR1 BAO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Baryon acoustic oscillation measurements by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (Data Release 1) have revealed exciting results that show evidence for dynamical dark energy at $\sim3\sigma$ when combined with cosmic microwave background and type Ia supernova observations. These measurements are based on the $w_0w_a$CDM model of dark energy. The evidence is less in other dark energy models such as the $w$CDM model. To avoid imposing a dark energy model, we reconstruct the distance measures and the equation of the state of dark energy independent of any dark energy model and driven only by observational data. To this end, we use both single-task and multi-task Gaussian Process regression. Our results show that the model-agnostic evidence for dynamical dark energy is much less than the evidence from DESI with the $w_0w_a$CDM model. Our analysis also provides model-independent constraints on cosmological parameters such as the Hubble constant and the matter-energy density parameter at present. We find that the reconstructed values of these parameters are not consistent with the results reported in DESI with the $w_0w_a$CDM model. However, they are almost consistent with DESI for the $w$CDM model.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel approach to the class of cosmic barotropic fluids in which the speed of sound squared is defined as a function of the Equation of State parameter, so called $c_s^2(w)$ models, is examined. For this class of models, a new analytical reconstruction method is introduced for finding their equivalent purely kinetic k-essence formulation. The method is explicitly demonstrated for several $c_s^2(w)$ models. The application of the obtained explicit or closed form solutions in understanding dark sector unification models is discussed.</description>

      <title>Vector Dark Matter Halo: From Polarization Dynamics to Direct Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the characteristic polarization formation and evolution of vector dark matter (VDM) in the outer halo of galaxies. By employing numerical simulations, we analyze the behavior of VDM under different initial conditions -- homogeneous, isotropic, and partially polarized. The simulations solve the Schr\"odinger-Poisson equations, examining the spin density distribution and its evolution during gravitational collapse and halo formation. Our results reveal that VDM forms halos and central Proca stars from homogeneous and isotropic conditions, with the polarization density fluctuation amplitude mirroring VDM matter density. In scenarios with no initial polarization, spin density remains stable in the halo core but fluctuates in outer regions. Partially polarized initial conditions lead to a conservation of total polarization, with increased core polarization resulting in opposite polarization in the periphery. We examine the novel consequences of the partially polarized state for direct detection of dark photons, i.e., VDM kinetically mixed with ordinary photons.</description>

      <title>The HalfDome Multi-Survey Cosmological Simulations: N-body Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Upcoming cosmological surveys have the potential to reach groundbreaking discoveries on multiple fronts, including the neutrino mass, dark energy, and inflation. Most of the key science goals require the joint analysis of datasets from multiple surveys to break parameter degeneracies and calibrate systematics. To realize such analyses, a large set of mock simulations that realistically model correlated observables is required. In this paper we present the N-body component of the HalfDome cosmological simulations, designed for the joint analysis of Stage-IV cosmological surveys, such as Rubin LSST, Euclid, SPHEREx, Roman, DESI, PFS, Simons Observatory, CMB-S4, and LiteBIRD. Our 300TB initial data release includes full-sky lightcones and halo catalogs between $z$=0--4 for 11 fixed cosmology realizations, as well as an additional run with local primordial non-Gaussianity ($f_{\rm NL}$=20). The simulations evolve $6144^3$ particles in a 3.75$\,h^{-1} {\rm Gpc}$ box, reaching a minimum halo mass of $\sim 6 \times 10^{12}\,h^{-1} M_\odot$ and maximum scale of $k \sim 1\,h{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. Instructions to access the data, and plans for future data releases, can be found at https://halfdomesims.github.io.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel realization of leptogenesis from the decays of sterile (right-handed) neutrinos (RHNs) produced from runaway bubble collisions at a first order phase transition. Such configurations can produce heavy RHNs with mass many orders of magnitude above the scale of symmetry breaking as well as the temperature of the plasma, thereby enabling high scale leptogenesis without the need for high reheat temperatures while also naturally suppressing washout effects. This mechanism also extends the window of viability to RHN masses $\gtrsim 10^{14}$ GeV, the natural scale for type-I seesaw with $\mathcal{O}(1)$ couplings, where standard thermal leptogenesis cannot produce the observed baryon asymmetry. The corresponding phase transitions are at scales $\gtrsim\!10^9$ GeV and produce gravitational wave signals that could be detected by future experiments.</description>

      <title>The stellar distribution in ultra-faint dwarf galaxies suggests deviations from the collision-less cold dark matter paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unraveling the nature of dark matter (DM) stands as a primary objective in modern physics. Here we present evidence suggesting deviations from the collisionless Cold DM (CDM) paradigm. It arises from the radial distribution of stars in six Ultra Faint Dwarf (UFD) galaxies measured with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). After a trivial renormalization in size and central density, the six UFDs show the same stellar distribution, which happens to have a central plateau or core. Assuming spherical symmetry and isotropic velocities, the Eddington inversion method proves the observed distribution to be inconsistent with potentials characteristic of CDM particles. Under such assumptions, the observed innermost slope of the stellar profile discards the UFDs to reside in a CDM potential at a &gt; 97% confidence level. The extremely low stellar mass of these galaxies, 10**3-10**4 Msun , prevents stellar feedback from modifying the shape of a CDM potential. Other conceivable explanations for the observed cores, like deviations from spherical symmetry and isotropy, tidal forces, and the exact form of the used CDM potential, are disfavored by simulations and/or observations. Thus, the evidence suggests that collisions among DM particles or other alternatives to CDM are likely shaping these galaxies. Many of these alternatives produce cored gravitational potentials, shown here to be consistent with the observed stellar distribution.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we review in detail different mechanisms of generation of large primordial fluctuations and their implications for the production of primordial black holes (PBHs) and scalar-induced secondary gravity waves (SIGW), with the ultimate aim of understanding the impact of loop correction on quantum correlations and the power spectrum. To accomplish the goal, we provide a concise, comprehensive, but in depth review of conceptual and technical details of the standard model of the universe, namely, causal structure and inflation, quantization of primordial perturbations and field theoretic techniques such as "in-in" formalism needed for the estimation of loop correction to the power spectrum. We discuss at length the severe constraints (no-go) on PBH production in single-field inflation imposed by appropriately renormalized quantum loop corrections, computed while maintaining the validity of the perturbation framework and assuming sufficient inflation to address the causality problem. Thereafter, we discuss in detail the efforts to circumvent the no-go result in Galileon inflation, multiple sharp transition (MST)-induced inflation, and stochastic single field inflation using an effective field theoretic (EFT) framework applicable to a variety of models. We provide a thorough analysis of the Dynamical Renormalization Group (DRG) resummation approach, adiabatic and late-time renormalization schemes, and their use in producing solar and sub-solar mass PBHs. Additionally, we give a summary of how scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) are produced in MST setups and Galileon inflation.Finally, the PBH overproduction issue is thoroughly discussed.</description>

      <title>Evolution of coupled scalar perturbations through smooth reheating. I. Dissipative regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If the inflaton is a heavy scalar field, it may equilibrate slower than some other degrees of freedom, e.g. non-Abelian gauge bosons. In this case, perturbations in the inflaton field and in a thermal plasma coexist from a given moment onwards. We derive a gauge-invariant set of three coupled equations governing the time evolution of such a system. Despite singular coefficients, a reliable numerical solution can be obtained for a long time period, starting from phase oscillations inside the Hubble horizon, and extending until acoustic oscillations in a radiation-dominated universe. Benchmarks are illustrated from a ``weak regime'', where perturbations have a quantum-mechanical origin but get dissipated by interactions with the plasma. Among applications of our formalism could be inhomogeneity-induced nucleations in post-inflationary phase transitions, and the production of scalar-induced gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Population-level Dark Energy Constraints from Strong Gravitational Lensing using Simulation-Based Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a scalable approach for inferring the dark energy equation-of-state parameter ($w$) from a population of strong gravitational lens images using Simulation-Based Inference (SBI). Strong gravitational lensing offers crucial insights into cosmology, but traditional Monte Carlo methods for cosmological inference are computationally prohibitive and inadequate for processing the thousands of lenses anticipated from future cosmic surveys. New tools for inference, such as SBI using Neural Ratio Estimation (NRE), address this challenge effectively. By training a machine learning model on simulated data of strong lenses, we can learn the likelihood-to-evidence ratio for robust inference. Our scalable approach enables more constrained population-level inference of $w$ compared to individual lens analysis, constraining $w$ to within $1\sigma$. Our model can be used to provide cosmological constraints from forthcoming strong lens surveys, such as the 4MOST Strong Lensing Spectroscopic Legacy Survey (4SLSLS), which is expected to observe 10,000 strong lenses.</description>

      <title>Simulated [CII] in high-z galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extended [CII] emission on tens of kpc, also known as a [CII] halo, is being currently reported around z$\sim$4-6 star-forming galaxies, especially thanks to the statistics of the ALPINE survey. The [CII] emission is expected to trace dense cold gas in the inner CGM of these galaxies. The origin of this emission is still debated. In this paper, we present a post-processing model applied to Illustris-TNG50 star-forming galaxies at $z\sim$4-6, and we compare our results with the ALPINE observations. By incorporating C$^{+}$ abundances derived from UV background and young stars as radiation sources, we generate mock observations, from which we extract surface-brightness (SB) profiles. We found that our model predicts similar [CII] emission values on galactic scales as the observations, providing validation for our approach. However, we find that the predicted [CII] emission in the inner circumgalactic medium (CGM) falls below the observed values by a factor of $\sim$10. We discuss several model limitations that may contribute to this discrepancy. We also find discrepancies with observations when comparing SB profiles of low and high-SFR galaxies. Unlike the observations, simulations exhibit no discernible difference in the extended [CII] emission between the two subsamples. This discrepancy may reflect shortcomings in feedback model of the simulation. Finally, our analysis suggests that the extended [CII] emission is likely a result of both gas from satellite galaxies and outflows from central galaxies, with satellites playing a dominant role within 0.6$&lt;$R/R$_{\rm vir}&lt;$1. A firm estimate of the importance of each contribution is beyond the scope of the current simulations.</description>

      <title>Strong Balmer break objects at z ~ 7-10 uncovered with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery of robust spectroscopically confirmed Balmer break (BB) galaxies and candidates, with secure spectroscopic redshifts $7.1 \le z \le 9.6$ from publicly available JWST extra-galactic photometric and spectroscopic surveys. To do so, we used dedicated filters probing the Balmer break and inspected the objects with NIRSpec spectroscopy. We recover the previously known objects with strong Balmer breaks and reveal 10-11 new objects with clear BBs, thus tripling the number of spectroscopically confirmed galaxies with a BB at z &gt;7. Approximately half of them show a pure BB and no signs of recent star formation, whereas the other half shows BB and emission lines, indicating most likely galaxies whose star formation ceased earlier and has restarted recently. Overall we find that ~10-20% of all galaxies from our sample show signatures of an evolved stellar population. Furthermore, we find that the strength of the BB does not strongly depend on the rest-optical brightness of these sources. In short, our work confirms that photometry alone has the potential to measure BB strengths and to identify evolved stellar populations at high redshift and that such objects may be more frequent than previously thought.</description>

      <title>Field-level Lyman-alpha forest modelling in redshift space via augmented non-local Fluctuating Gunn-Peterson Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10428v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an improved analytical model to predict the Lyman-alpha forest at the field level in redshift space from the dark matter field, expanding upon the widely-used Fluctuating Gunn-Peterson approximation (FGPA). In particular, we introduce the dependence on the cosmic web environment (knots, filaments, sheets, voids) in the model, thereby effectively accounting for non-local bias. Furthermore, we include a detailed treatment of velocity bias in the redshift space distortions modelling, allowing the velocity bias to be cosmic-web dependent. We find evidence for a significant difference of the same model parameters in different environments, suggesting that for the investigated setup the simple standard FGPA is not able to adequately predict the Lyman-alpha forest in the different cosmic web regimes. We reproduce the summary statistics of the reference cosmological hydrodynamic simulation we use for comparison, yielding accurate mean transmitted flux, probability distribution function, 3D power spectrum, and bispectrum. In particular, we achieve maximum deviation and average deviations accuracy in the Lyman-alpha forest 3D power spectrum of $\sim 3\%$ and $\sim 0.1\%$ up to $k\sim 0.4 \, h \, {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, $\sim 5\%$ and $\sim 1.8\%$ up to $k \sim 1.4 \, h \, {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. Our new model outperforms previous analytical efforts to predict the Lyman-alpha forest at the field level in all the probed summary statistics, and has the potential to become instrumental in the generation of fast accurate mocks for covariance matrices estimation in the context of current and forthcoming Lyman-alpha forest surveys.</description>

      <title>Footprints of the QCD Crossover on Cosmological Gravitational Waves at Pulsar Timing Arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17136v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) have reported evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background at nHz frequencies, possibly originating in the early Universe. We show that the spectral shape of the low-frequency (causality) tail of GW signals sourced at temperatures around $T\gtrsim 1$ GeV is distinctively affected by confinement of strong interactions (QCD), due to the corresponding sharp decrease in the number of relativistic species. Bayesian analyses in the NANOGrav 15 years and the previous International PTA datasets reveal a significant improvement in the fit with respect to cubic power-law spectra, previously employed for the causality tail. This suggests that the inclusion of Standard Model effects on GWs can have a potentially decisive impact on model selection.</description>

      <title>The two-loop power spectrum in redshift space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.07379v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the matter power spectrum in redshift space including two-loop corrections. We follow a strictly perturbative approach incorporating all non-linearities entering both via the redshift-space mapping and within real space up to the required (fifth) order, complemented by suitable effective field theory (EFT) corrections. This approach can a priori be viable up to scales of order $0.2h~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ beyond which power suppression related to the finger-of-God effect becomes non-perturbatively strong. We extend a simplified treatment of EFT corrections at two-loop order from real to redshift space, making sure that the leading UV-sensitivity of both the single-hard and double-hard limit of the two-loop contributions to the power spectrum is accounted for, and featuring two free parameters for each multipole. Taking also infrared-resummation into account, we calibrate with and compare to Quijote $N$-body simulations for the monopole and quadrupole at redshifts $z=0$ and $z=0.5$. We find agreement within sample variance (at percent-level) up to $0.18h~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ at two-loop order, compared to $0.1h~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ at one-loop. We also investigate the role of higher-derivative corrections.</description>

      <title>Joint inference of multiplicative and additive systematics in galaxy density fluctuations and clustering measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galaxy clustering measurements are a key probe of the matter density field in the Universe. With the era of precision cosmology upon us, surveys rely on precise measurements of the clustering signal for meaningful cosmological analysis. However, the presence of systematic contaminants can bias the observed galaxy number density, and thereby bias the galaxy two-point statistics. As the statistical uncertainties get smaller, correcting for these systematic contaminants becomes increasingly important for unbiased cosmological analysis. We present and validate a new method for understanding and mitigating both additive and multiplicative systematics in galaxy clustering measurements (two-point function) by joint inference of contaminants in the galaxy overdensity field (one-point function) using a maximum-likelihood estimator (MLE). We test this methodology with KiDS-like mock galaxy catalogs and synthetic systematic template maps. We estimate the cosmological impact of such mitigation by quantifying uncertainties and possible biases in the inferred relationship between the observed and the true galaxy clustering signal. Our method robustly corrects the clustering signal to the sub-percent level and reduces numerous additive and multiplicative systematics from $1.5 \sigma$ to less than $0.1\sigma$ for the scenarios we tested. In addition, we provide an empirical approach to identifying the functional form (additive, multiplicative, or other) by which specific systematics contaminate the galaxy number density. Even though this approach is tested and geared towards systematics contaminating the galaxy number density, the methods can be extended to systematics mitigation for other two-point correlation measurements.</description>

      <title>Characterization of contaminants in the Lyman-alpha forest auto-correlation with DESI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03003v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Baryon Acoustic Oscillations can be measured with sub-percent precision above redshift two with the Lyman-alpha forest auto-correlation and its cross-correlation with quasar positions. This is one of the key goals of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) which started its main survey in May 2021. We present in this paper a study of the contaminants to the lyman-alpha forest which are mainly caused by correlated signals introduced by the spectroscopic data processing pipeline as well as astrophysical contaminants due to foreground absorption in the intergalactic medium. Notably, an excess signal caused by the sky background subtraction noise is present in the lyman-alpha auto-correlation in the first line-of-sight separation bin. We use synthetic data to isolate this contribution, we also characterize the effect of spectro-photometric calibration noise, and propose a simple model to account for both effects in the analysis of the lyman-alpha forest. We then measure the auto-correlation of the quasar flux transmission fraction of low redshift quasars, where there is no lyman-alpha forest absorption but only its contaminants. We demonstrate that we can interpret the data with a two-component model: data processing noise and triply ionized Silicon and Carbon auto-correlations. This result can be used to improve the modeling of the lyman-alpha auto-correlation function measured with DESI.</description>

      <title>Prospects for weighing neutrinos in interacting dark energy models using joint observations of gravitational waves and $\gamma$-ray bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmological observations can be used to weigh neutrinos, but this method is model-dependent, with results relying on the cosmological model considered. If we consider interactions between dark energy and dark matter, the neutrino mass constraints differ from those derived under the standard model. On the contrary, gravitational wave (GW) standard siren observations can measure absolute cosmological distances, helping to break parameter degeneracies inherent in traditional cosmological observations, thereby improving constraints on neutrino mass. This paper examines the constraints on neutrino mass within interacting dark energy (IDE) models and explores how future GW standard siren observations could enhance these results. For multi-messenger GW observations, we consider the joint observations of binary neutron star mergers by third-generation ground-based GW detectors and short $\gamma$-ray burst observations by missions similar to the THESEUS satellite project. Using current cosmological observations (CMB+BAO+SN), we obtain an upper limit on the neutrino mass in the IDE models of 0.15 (or 0.16) eV. With the inclusion of GW data, the upper limit on the neutrino mass improves to 0.14 eV. This indicates that in the context of IDE models, the improvement in neutrino mass constraints from GW observations is relatively limited. However, GW observations significantly enhance the constraints on other cosmological parameters, such as matter density parameter, the Hubble constant, and coupling strength between dark energy and dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a cosmological-model-independent method to extract the apparent magnitude and its derivative at different redshifts from the Pantheon+ type Ia supernova sample, and find that the obtained values deviate clearly from the prediction of the $\Lambda$CDM model at the lowest redshift. This deviation can be explained as a result of a transition of the absolute magnitude $M$ in the low redshift region. The observations seem to favor this transition since the minimum values of $\chi^2$ for two ansatzes of a varying $M$ are less than that of a constant $M$. The Hubble constant tension is alleviated from larger than $5\sigma$ to be about $1$ to $2\sigma$ for a varying $M$, and the growth tension can be resolved after attributing the variation of $M$ to a modification of the effective Newton's constant.</description>

      <title>The negative BAO shift in the Ly$\alpha$ forest from cosmological simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03918v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first measurement of the Ly$\alpha$ forest BAO shift parameter from cosmological simulations. In particular, we generate a suite of $1000$ accurate effective field-level bias-based Ly$\alpha$ forest simulations of volume $V=(1 \, h^{-1} \, {\rm Gpc})^3$ at $z=2$, both in real and redshift space, calibrated upon two fixed-and-paired cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. To measure the BAO, we stack the three-dimensional power spectra of the $1000$ different realizations, compute the average, and use a model accounting for a proper smooth-peak component decomposition of the power spectrum, to fit it via an efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo scheme estimating the covariance matrices directly from the simulations. We report the BAO shift parameters to be $\alpha=0.9969^{+0.0014}_{-0.0014}$ and $\alpha=0.9905^{+0.0027}_{-0.0027}$ in real and redshift space, respectively. We also measure the bias $b_{\rm lya}$ and the BAO broadening parameter $\Sigma_{\rm nl}$, finding $b_{\rm lya}=-0.1786^{+0.0001}_{-0.0001}$ and $\Sigma_{\rm nl}=3.87^{+0.20}_{-0.20}$ in real space, and $b_{\rm lya}=-0.073^{+0.005}_{-0.004}$ and $\Sigma_{\rm nl}=6.55^{+0.23}_{-0.22}$ in redshift space. Moreover, we measure the linear Kaiser factor $\beta_{\rm lya}=1.39^{+0.24}_{-0.18}$ from the isotropic redshift space fit. Overall, we find evidence for a negative shift of the BAO peak at the $\sim 2.2\sigma$ and $\sim 3.5\sigma$ level in real and redshift space, respectively. This work sets new important theoretical constraints on the Ly$\alpha$ forest BAO scale and offers a potential solution to the tension emerging from previous observational analysis, in light of ongoing and upcoming Ly$\alpha$ forest spectroscopic surveys, such as DESI, PFS, and WEAVE-QSO.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes and Scalar-induced Gravitational Waves in Sneutrino Hybrid Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility that primordial black holes (PBHs) can be formed from large curvature perturbations generated during the waterfall phase transition in a supersymmetric scenario where sneutrino is the inflaton in a hybrid inflationary framework. We obtain a spectral index ($n_s \simeq 0.966$), and a tensor-to-scalar ratio ($r\simeq 0.0056-10^{-11}$), consistent with the current Planck data satisfying PBH as dark matter (DM) and detectable Gravitational Wave (GW) signal. Our findings show that the mass of PBH and the peak in the GW spectrum is correlated with the right-handed (s)neutrino mass. We identify parameter space where PBHs can be the entire DM candidate of the universe (with mass $10^{-13}\, M_\odot$) or a fraction of it. This could be tested via second-order GW signals in future observatories, for instance, with amplitude $\Omega_{\rm GW}h^2$ $\sim 10^{-9}$ and peak frequency $f\sim 0.1$ Hz in LISA and $\Omega_{\rm GW}h^2 \sim 10^{-11}$ and peak frequency of $\sim 10$ Hz in ET. %. for sneutrino mass $m_{\phi} \sim 2\times 10^{12}$ GeV, $\beta \sim 5.4\times 10^{15}$ GeV. We study two models of sneutrino inflation: Model$-1$ involves canonical sneutrino kinetic term which predicts the sub-Planckian mass parameter $M$, while the coupling between a gauge singlet and the waterfall field, $\beta$, needs to be quite large whereas, for the model$-2$ involving $\alpha-$attractor canonical sneutrino kinetic term, $\beta$ can take a natural value. Estimating explicitly, we show that both models have mild fine-tuning. We also derive an analytical expression for the power spectrum in terms of the microphysics parameters of the model like (s)neutrino mass, etc. that fits well with the numerical results. The typical reheat temperature for both the models is around $10^{7}-10^{8}$~GeV suitable for non-thermal leptogenesis.</description>

Abstract: The fundamental nature of Dark Matter is a central theme of the Snowmass 2021 process, extending across all frontiers. In the last decade, advances in detector technology, analysis techniques and theoretical modeling have enabled a new generation of experiments and searches while broadening the types of candidates we can pursue. Over the next decade, there is great potential for discoveries that would transform our understanding of dark matter. In the following, we outline a road map for discovery developed in collaboration among the frontiers. A strong portfolio of experiments that delves deep, searches wide, and harnesses the complementarity between techniques is key to tackling this complicated problem, requiring expertise, results, and planning from all Frontiers of the Snowmass 2021 process.</description>

      <title>Probing the Blue Axion with Cosmic Optical Background Anisotropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.06560v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A radiative decaying Big Bang relic with a mass $m_a\simeq 5-25 \,\rm eV$, which we dub "blue axion", can be probed with direct and indirect observations of the cosmic optical background (COB). The strongest bounds on blue-axion cold dark matter come from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) measurements of COB anisotropies at $606$~nm. We suggest that new HST measurements at higher frequencies ($336$~nm and $438$~nm) can improve current constraints on the lifetime up to one order of magnitude, and we show that also thermally produced and hot relic blue axions can be competitively probed by COB anisotropies. We exclude the simple interpretation of the excess in the diffuse COB detected by the Long Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI) as photons produced by a decaying hot relic. Finally, we comment on the reach of upcoming line intensity mapping experiments, that could detect blue axions with a lifetime as large as $10^{29}\,\rm s$ or $10^{27}\,\rm s$ for the cold dark matter and the hot relic case, respectively.</description>

      <title>Accretion, Evaporation and Superradiance Phase Diagram of (Primordial) Black Holes and $10^{-21}-10^{21}$ eV Scalar, Vector, Tensor Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.08267v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain the accretion, evaporation and superradiance phase diagram of astrophysical and primordial black holes in the mass range $10^{-33}-10^{11} \, M_\odot $. This black hole mass range corresponds to production of $10^{-21} - 10^{21}$ eV particles for superradiance (bosons) and evaporation (bosons and fermions). Only accretion and superradiance processes are relevant for heavy black holes, on the other hand for light black holes of primordial origin, all three processes can be relevant. We find that superradiance instability can happen even for black hole spin values as low as $10^{-9}-10^{-2}$. Since light black holes are very unstable to these perturbations and sensitive probes of bosonic particles, a single moderately spinning BH can probe 2-9 orders of magnitude of mass parameter space depending on the nature of the perturbations that are scalar (axion), vector (dark photon and/or photon with effective mass) and spin-2. If spinning black holes are observed, namely superradiance is not observed, due to self-interactions, we find limits on the axion decay constant and energy density.</description>

      <title>Little Rip, Pseudo Rip and bounce cosmology with generalized equation of state in non-standard backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of universe's late-time acceleration and dark energy has overseen a great deal of research into cosmological singularities and particularly future singularities. Perhaps the most extreme of such singlarities is the big rip, which has propelled a lot of work into ways of moderating it or seeking out alternatives to it and two such alternatives to the big rip are the Little rip and Pseudo rip. Another possibility to consider the far future of the universe is through bounce cosmologies, which presents its own interesting ideas. So in this work we investigate the Little rip, Pseudo rip and Bounce cosmology in non-standard cosmological backgrounds with a generalized equation of state in the presence of a viscous fluid. In particular we discuss about Chern-Simons cosmology and the RS-II Braneworld and discuss how the exotic and non-conventional nature of gravity in such cosmologies affect universal evolution in these scenarios. We find out that there are very significant differences in the behaviour of such cosmic scenarios in these universes in comparison to how they appear in the simple general relativistic universe.</description>

      <title>pop-cosmos: A comprehensive picture of the galaxy population from COSMOS data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present pop-cosmos: a comprehensive model characterizing the galaxy population, calibrated to $140,938$ ($r&lt;25$ selected) galaxies from the Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) with photometry in $26$ bands from the ultra-violet to the infra-red. We construct a detailed forward model for the COSMOS data, comprising: a population model describing the joint distribution of galaxy characteristics and its evolution (parameterized by a flexible score-based diffusion model); a state-of-the-art stellar population synthesis (SPS) model connecting galaxies' instrinsic properties to their photometry; and a data-model for the observation, calibration and selection processes. By minimizing the optimal transport distance between synthetic and real data we are able to jointly fit the population- and data-models, leading to robustly calibrated population-level inferences that account for parameter degeneracies, photometric noise and calibration, and selection. We present a number of key predictions from our model of interest for cosmology and galaxy evolution, including the mass function and redshift distribution; the mass-metallicity-redshift and fundamental metallicity relations; the star-forming sequence; the relation between dust attenuation and stellar mass, star formation rate and attenuation-law index; and the relation between gas-ionization and star formation. Our model encodes a comprehensive picture of galaxy evolution that faithfully predicts galaxy colors across a broad redshift ($z&lt;4$) and wavelength range.</description>

      <title>Observational tests in scale invariance II: gravitational lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08379v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the path of light rays passing near a massive object, in the context of the scale invariant equation of the geodesics first obtained by Dirac (1973). Using the exterior Schwarzschild solution for the metric, we derive the complete equations of the geodesics in the scale invariant context. We find that scale invariance introduces two additional terms to the Einstein term producing the deflection angle and that can potentially act over cosmological distances. Numerical integration of the scale-invariant geodesics, for the specific case of the z_L=1.94 lens galaxy in the extreme system JWST-ER1 (van Dokkum et al. 2023; Mercier et al. 2024) shows that the two additional terms introduce only negligible effects, typically 1E-06 of the Einstein term. We conclude that the lensing deflection angle derived in Einstein's General Relativity is essentially independent of the scale invariant effects and that the photon's geodesics remain unchanged. We also explore the possible origin of the differences in the mass estimates from lensing and photometry in JWST-ER1 and in the SLACS galaxies, differences which appear larger at higher redshifts. Scale invariance appears to release or even suppress the need for dark matter.</description>

      <title>Radiative symmetry breaking from the on-shell perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Models with classical scale symmetry, which feature radiative symmetry breaking, generically lead to a supercooled first-order phase transition in the early Universe resulting in a strong gravitational-wave signal, potentially observable by LISA. This is thanks to the absence of mass terms in the potential and the resulting logarithmic structure of the zero-temperature effective potential. It is known that imposing a symmetry at classical level does not prohibit breaking it by quantum corrections. In the case of scale symmetry, a mass term can in principle appear through renormalisation. This is not the case in the commonly used $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ or Coleman-Weinberg schemes. In this work, we renormalise a scale-invariant model in the on-shell scheme to check whether parameterising it with the physical masses will introduce mass terms to the potential. We find that indeed mass terms appear for an arbitrary choice of the physical masses. However, we formulate an on-shell condition for radiative symmetry breaking, sufficient and necessary for the cancellation of mass terms in the renormalised potential, yielding a logarithmic potential needed for supercooled phase transitions.</description>
