      <title>Tensor network approaches for plasma dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of plasmas are governed by a set of non-linear differential equations which remain challenging to solve directly for large 2D and 3D problems. Here we investigate how tensor networks could be applied to plasmas described by the Vlasov-Maxwell system of equations and investigate parameter regimes which show promise for efficient simulations. We show for low-dimensional problems that the simplest form of tensor networks known as a Matrix Product State performs sufficiently well, however in regimes with a strong permanent magnetic field or high-dimensional problems one may need to consider alternative tensor network geometries. We conclude the study of the Vlasov-Maxwell system with the application of tensor networks to an industrially relevant test case and validate our results against state of the art plasma solvers based on Particle-In-Cell codes. We also extend the application of tensor networks to the alternative plasma description of Magnetohydrodynamics and outline how this can be encoded using Matrix Product States.</description>

      <title>Toward the Origins of Binding Energy Shifts and Satellites Formation During Plasma-XPS Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In plasma X ray photoelectron spectroscopy emerges as a powerful platform for real time, in situ chemical analysis under conditions relevant to semiconductor processing and other plasma enabled technologies. This study investigates the origins of binding energy shifts and satellite peaks formation observed during plasma XPS measurements across conductive, dielectric, and gas phase systems. Using a standard laboratory based ambient pressure XPS apparatus coupled with an alternating current driven capacitively coupled plasma source, we show that metastable surface species, such as transient Au oxides, can be detected during plasma exposure, revealing chemical states hardly accessible using conventional ultrahigh vacuum XPS. In dielectric samples, we observe pressure- and plasma type dependent BE shifts up to 50 eV, attributed to X ray induced and plasma mediated surface charging. These shifts are mitigated at higher pressures plasmas or in electronegative plasmas, the latter due to enhanced charge compensation mechanisms involving slow negative ions. For gas phase species, AC plasma excitation leads to spectral broadening and the emergence of satellite peaks with a few eV energy separations, linked to oscillating local plasma potentials in the probing volume. These findings highlight the important and complex interplay of plasma parameters, surface charging, and local electric fields in shaping XPS spectra. Overall, plasma XPS emerges as a critical metrological tool for probing transient surface chemistry, with implications for semiconductor processing, material synthesis, and plasma diagnostics.</description>

      <title>SCOPE: Simple Coil Optimization for Plasma and Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing superconducting coils for a tokamak fusion device is a highly coupled, non-linear design problem. The coils have many disparate engineering requirements from structural to power electronics, as well strict limits placed on the system by the high temperature superconducting (HTS) cables. Simultaneously, the coils must be able to contain multiple plasma scenarios from inception, through ramp up, to flat top, and ramp down, all whilst applying a large, controlled, inductive voltage to drive current. In addition, we wish to optimize divertor separatrices to increase the likelihood of designing a suitable divertor strikepoint. Lastly, the physical limits of the entire tokamak must be taken into account and space reserved for support structures, access for maintenance schemes, and installation limits. The method outlined here uses a combined simulated annealing method to find optimal coil sizes and positions with a constrained quadratic or quartic optimization for the coil currents. The method is designed to optimize coils for multiple scenarios simultaneously, including ramp-ups, to avoid over optimization of a single design point. A key enabler is the efficient implementation that allows millions of evaluations to be performed in a few hours with modest computational power. This optimization method is part of a larger, iterative workflow which enables further, detailed design work to feedback on the optimization.</description>

      <title>Disruption Modelling for Engineering and Physics Design of Tokamak Energy ST-E1 Fusion Power Plant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasma disruptions represent a critical challenge for high-performance tokamak operations, as they can compromise machine integrity and reduce operational availability. Although future fusion devices essentially need to incorporate strategies to minimise disruption occurrence, complete avoidance remains unattainable. Consequently, assessing and characterising unmitigated disruption consequences is fundamental for the design and qualification of next-generation fusion power plants. This work supports the pre-conceptual design of ST-E1, a low aspect-ratio Tokamak Fusion Power Plant developed by Tokamak Energy Ltd., by presenting a comprehensive disruption modelling approach applied across different design stages. The methodology integrates both physics and engineering considerations to evaluate the impact of disruptions on machine performance and structural integrity. From an engineering perspective, several ST-E1 layout options were analysed to investigate the electromagnetic response of key components under disruption-induced loads, enabling comparison between alternative design solutions. On the physics side, a broad set of disruption scenarios was explored, scanning operational space parameters, plasma-material interactions, and associated thermal loads. Furthermore, the study examined variations in disruption behaviour arising from different reference equilibria, focusing on a range starting from Double Null to Single Null configurations, reflecting the increasing up-down asymmetry consequences. The results reveal significant contrasts in plasma dynamics and structures electromagnetic behaviour between configurations, highlighting the importance of disruption modelling in guiding design choices. These analyses have proven instrumental in shaping ST-E1 development, offering critical insights for mitigating risks and optimising future fusion reactor designs.</description>

      <title>Photon Accelerator in Magnetized Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong magnetic fields and plasmas are intrinsically linked in both terrestrial laboratory experiments and in space phenomena. One of the most profound consequences of that is the change in relationship between the frequency and the wave number of electromagnetic waves propagating in plasma in the presence of such magnetic fields when compared to the case without these fields. Furthermore, magnetic fields alter electromagnetic wave interaction with relativistic plasma waves, resulting in different outcomes for particle and radiation generation. For a relativistic plasma wave-based photon acceleration this leads to an increased frequency gain, and, thus, potentially to higher efficiency. The influence of a magnetic field leads to quantitative and qualitative change in the properties of photon acceleration, amplifying the increase in the electromagnetic wave frequency.</description>

      <title>CARONTE: a Physics-Informed Extreme Learning Machine-Based Algorithm for Plasma Boundary Reconstruction in Magnetically Confined Fusion Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel physics informed neural network based algorithm for real time plasma boundary reconstruction in tokamak devices. The approach is based on a single Extreme Learning Machine network used to solve the homogeneous Grad Shafranov equation, which is required to identify the plasma boundary. This architecture enables the real time training of the network parameters using the available magnetic sensor data and, consequently, dynamically adapting the network output to the evolving plasma equilibrium. We demonstrate that, the network performs accurate plasma boundary reconstruction for complex configurations, outperforming well established methods, such as the algorithm used for decades at the Joint European Torus, the world's largest tokamak, until it ceased operation in 2023. Indeed, compared to the latter, the proposed solution better generalizes the poloidal flux function, without requiring algorithm retuning across different plasma equilibria. The proposed neural network reconstructor demonstrates also greater robustness with respect to noise on the magnetic measurements. Moreover, this method takes advantage of the generalization power of neural networks but without the need for extensive, time consuming training based on a huge amount of experimental data, making its implementation on existing devices straightforward.</description>

      <title>Self-confinement of relativistic pair beams in magnetized interstellar plasmas: the case of pulsar X-ray filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observation of filamentary X-ray structures near bow-shock pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) -- such as the Guitar, Lighthouse, and PSR J2030$+$4415 nebulae -- and of slow-diffusion regions around pulsars like Geminga, Monogem, and PSR J0622$+$3749, challenges the standard picture of cosmic-ray transport in the interstellar medium, implying a diffusion coefficient two orders of magnitude smaller than the Galactic average. The suppressed diffusion can be attributed to self-generated magnetic turbulence, driven -- via the non-resonant streaming instability -- by electron--positron pairs escaping the PWNe. This instability requires a net current, yet the beam of escaping pairs is expected to be charge-neutral. We show that a charge-neutral pair beam propagating through an electron--proton plasma can spontaneously generate a net current. Using fully kinetic two- and three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations with realistic mass ratio, we find that beam electrons get focused into self-generated magnetic filaments produced by the nonlinear evolution of the Weibel instability, while beam positrons remain unconfined. The resulting net (positron) current drives the non-resonant streaming instability, further amplifying the magnetic field. This mechanism provides a pathway for the onset of charge asymmetries in initially charge-neutral pair beams and for the growth of magnetic fluctuations that efficiently scatter the beam particles, with implications for the formation of X-ray filaments and, more broadly, for particle self-confinement in TeV halos around PWNe.</description>

      <title>Direct calculation of steady-state hydrodynamic solar wind solutions with newtonian viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Steady-state solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations are known to admit solutions that are singular at the sonic point. Consequently, inviscid solar wind models require special treatment of the solution near the sonic points, and this has proven to be a significant impediment to efficient modeling of the solar wind. In this paper we revisit the governing hydrodynamic equations for the expanding solar wind, with the inclusion of the classical (Newtonian) viscous stress , and we show how this inclusion eliminates the singularities that emerge from the inviscid equations. This result has been previously reported and used to generate solar wind profiles from initial conditions in the asymptotic limit; however, those studies did not include realistic treatments of the inner corona, and generally rejected the prospect of extrapolating solutions outward from the Sun into the heliosphere. Here, we expand this method to include external heating and optically thin radiative losses and show that solutions can be computed from initial conditions near the solar surface, thereby capturing the entire range of scales from below the transition region to the outer heliosphere in a single solution. Our approach is to cast the steady-state Navier-Stokes equations as a system of five coupled, ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which we solve using conventional methods, without any special treatment of the governing equations in the vicinity of the sonic point. The representative solutions that we present here demonstrate the utility and efficiency of this extrapolation method, which is considerably more realistic than commonly used analytical or empirical models. This method provides a direct approach to generating accurate solar wind profiles subject to observationally motivated initial conditions near the solar surface, at a fraction of the computational cost of comparable relaxation-based models.</description>

      <title>Electric field diagnostics in a continuous rf plasma using Rydberg-EIT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a non-invasive spectroscopic technique to measure electric fields in plasma, leveraging large polarizabilities and Stark shifts of Rydberg atoms. Rydberg Stark shifts are measured with high precision using narrow-linewidth lasers via Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT) of rubidium vapor seeded into a continuous, inductively coupled radio-frequency (rf) plasma in a few mTorr of argon gas. Without plasma, the Rydberg-EIT spectra exhibit rf modulation sidebands caused by electric- and magnetic-dipole transitions in the rf drive coil. With the plasma present, the rf modulation sidebands vanish due to screening of the rf drive field from the plasma interior. The lineshapes of the EIT spectra in the plasma reflect the plasma's Holtsmark microfield distribution, allowing us to determine plasma density and collisional line broadening over a range of pressures and rf drive powers. The work is expected to have applications in non-invasive spatio-temporal electric-field diagnostics of low-pressure plasma, plasma sheaths, process plasma and dusty plasma.</description>

      <title>Conceptual study on using Doppler backscattering to measure magnetic pitch angle in tokamak plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new approach to measure the magnetic pitch angle profile in tokamak plasmas with Doppler backscattering (DBS), a technique traditionally used for measuring flows and density fluctuations. The DBS signal is maximised when its probe beam's wavevector is perpendicular to the magnetic field at the cutoff location, independent of the density fluctuations. Hence, if one could isolate this effect, DBS would then yield information about the magnetic pitch angle. By varying the toroidal launch angle, the DBS beam reaches cutoff with different angles with respect to the magnetic field, but with other properties remaining similar. Hence, the toroidal launch angle which gives maximum backscattered power is thus that which is matched to the pitch angle at the cutoff location, enabling inference of the magnetic pitch angle. We performed systematic scans of the DBS toroidal launch angle for repeated DIII-D tokamak discharges. Experimental DBS data from this scan were analysed and combined with Gaussian beam-tracing simulations using the Scotty code. The pitch-angle inferred from DBS is consistent with that from magnetics-only and motional-Stark-effect-constrained (MSE) equilibrium reconstruction in the edge. In the core, the pitch angles from DBS and magnetics-only reconstructions differ by one to two degrees, while simultaneous MSE measurements were not available. The uncertainty in these measurements was under a degree; we show that this uncertainty is primarily due to the error in toroidal steering, the number of toroidally separated measurements, and shot-to-shot repeatability. We find that the error of pitch-angle measurements can be reduced by optimising the poloidal launch angle and initial beam properties.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Resolution Limits in Pedestal Profile Measurements with Gaussian Process Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Edge transport barriers (ETBs) in magnetically confined fusion plasmas, commonly known as pedestals, play a crucial role in achieving high confinement plasmas. However, their defining characteristic, a steep rise in plasma pressure over short length scales, makes them challenging to diagnose experimentally. In this work, we use Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to develop first-principles metrics for quantifying the spatiotemporal resolution limits of inferring differentiable profiles of temperature, pressure, or other quantities from experimental measurements. Although we focus on pedestals, the methods are fully general and can be applied to any setting involving the inference of profiles from discrete measurements. First, we establish a correspondence between GPR and low-pass filtering, giving an explicit expression for the effective `cutoff frequency' associated with smoothing incurred by GPR. Second, we introduce a novel information-theoretic metric, \(N_{eff}\), which measures the effective number of data points contributing to the inferred value of a profile or its derivative. These metrics enable a quantitative assessment of the trade-off between `over-fitting' and `over-regularization', providing both practitioners and consumers of GPR with a systematic way to evaluate the credibility of inferred profiles. We apply these tools to develop practical advice for using GPR in both time-independent and time-dependent settings, and demonstrate their usage on inferring pedestal profiles using measurements from the DIII-D tokamak.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the process of creating electron-positron pairs from laser-matter interaction in pre-ionised foam targets using particle-in-cell simulations. A high-intensity laser pulse drives electrons via direct laser acceleration up to a cone-shaped reflector. The high-energy electrons interact with the reflected laser pulse, generating abundant pairs. The effects of the plasma-channel shape on the propagation of the laser pulse and subsequent pair production is studied. The results show that the number of Compton emission and Breit-Wheeler pair creation events is highly sensitive to the diffraction of the laser due to its interaction with the foam.</description>

      <title>The impact of plasma turbulence on atomic reaction rates in detached divertors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical modeling of the edge and scrape-off layer (SOL) must account for atomic processes such as hydrogenic ionization and recombination, charge-exchange, and line radiation. Their reaction rates depend non-linearly on density and temperature and are thus sensitive to turbulent fluctuations, whose inclusion/omission may significantly affect model outcomes. We quantify the impact of fluctuations by studying global turbulence simulations of the edge and SOL of ASDEX-Upgrade in both attached and detached conditions. While the effect of fluctuations is minimal for the attached state, pronounced discrepancies emerge in colder, detached conditions. When accounting for turbulent fluctuations, ionization and radiation rates at the detachment front are reduced by a factor of 2 when compared to mean-field calculations. The effect arises from fluctuations crossing below the ionization temperature threshold, facilitated by low mean temperature and increased fluctuation amplitudes at the detachment front. The rate reduction (rather than rate increase) is explained by the character of divertor fluctuations (negative density-temperature correlation, i.e. cold and dense blobs), notably distinct from characteristic fluctuations found at the outboard-midplane (positive correlation, i.e. hot and dense blobs). Furthermore, the cold and dense fluctuations enable efficient plasma recombination even at average temperatures above the recombination threshold. In detached conditions, the combined plasma particle source from ionization and recombination is therefore effectively reduced by at least 50% when compared to the standard mean-field source.</description>
