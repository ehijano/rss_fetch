      <title>The tensor product of p-adic Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the framework of quantum mechanics over a quadratic extension of the ultrametric field of p-adic numbers, we introduce a notion of tensor product of p-adic Hilbert spaces. To this end, following a standard approach, we first consider the algebraic tensor product of p-adic Hilbert spaces. We next define a suitable norm on this linear space. It turns out that, in the p-adic framework, this norm is the analogue of the projective norm associated with the tensor product of real or complex normed spaces. Eventually, by metrically completing the resulting p-adic normed space, and equipping it with a suitable inner product, we obtain the tensor product of p-adic Hilbert spaces. That this is indeed the correct p-adic counterpart of the tensor product of complex Hilbert spaces is also certified by establishing a natural isomorphism between this p-adic Hilbert space and the corresponding Hilbert-Schmidt class. Since the notion of subspace of a p-adic Hilbert space is highly nontrivial, we finally study the tensor product of subspaces, stressing both the analogies and the significant differences with respect to the standard complex case. These findings should provide us with the mathematical foundations necessary to explore quantum entanglement in the p-adic setting, with potential applications in the emerging field of p-adic quantum information theory.</description>

      <title>Open Hurwitz numbers and the mKP hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a natural definition of open Hurwitz numbers, where the weight of each ramified covering includes an integer parameter $N$ taken to the power that is equal to the number of boundary components of a Riemann surface with boundary mapping to $\mathbb{CP}^1$. We prove that the resulting sequence of partition functions, depending on $N\in\mathbb{Z}$, is a tau-sequence of the mKP hierarchy, or in other words it is a sequence of tau-functions of the KP hierarchy where each tau-function is obtained from the previous one by a B\"acklund-Darboux transformation. Our result is motivated by a previous observation of Alexandrov and the first two authors that the refined intersection numbers on the moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces with boundary give a tau-sequence of the mKP hierarchy.</description>

      <title>From Dirac to Dunkl Operators through Symmetry Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a geometric and analytic derivation of Dirac--Dunkl operators as symmetry reductions of the flat Dirac operator on Euclidean space. Starting from the standard Dirac operator, we restrict to a fundamental Weyl chamber of a finite Coxeter group equipped with the Heckman--Opdam measure, and determine the necessary drift and reflection corrections that ensure formal skew--adjointness under this weighted geometry. This procedure naturally reproduces the Dunkl operators as the unique first--order deformations compatible with reflection symmetry, whose Clifford contraction defines the Dirac--Dunkl operator and whose square yields the Dunkl Laplacian. We then extend the construction to include arbitrary unitary representations of the reflection group, obtaining representation-dependent Dirac--Dunkl operators that act on spinor- or matrix-valued functions. In the scalar and sign representations, these operators recover respectively the bosonic and fermionic Calogero--Moser systems, while higher-dimensional representations give rise to multi-component spin--Calogero models. The resulting framework unifies analytic, geometric, and representation-theoretic aspects of Dirac and Dunkl operators under a single symmetry-reduction principle.</description>

      <title>(Quasi) Hamiltonian Systems and Non-Decomposable Poisson Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we conduct a systematic study of Hamiltonian and quasi-Hamiltonian systems within the framework of nondecomposable generalized Poisson geometry. Our focus lies on the interplay between the algebraic structure of nondecomposable generalized Poisson brackets and the dynamical behavior of systems exhibiting specific symmetry properties. In particular, we demonstrate that if a dynamical system admits suitable invariance conditions -- such as those arising from Lie symmetries or conserved quantities -- it can be formulated as a quasi-Hamiltonian system, or even as a genuinely Hamiltonian system, with respect to a suitably constructed nondecomposable generalized Poisson structure. This result offers a unified geometric framework for analyzing such systems and underscores the capacity of nondecomposable generalized Poisson structures in contexts involving multi-Hamiltonian or higher-order dynamics.</description>

      <title>Quantum variance and fluctuations for Walsh-quantized baker's maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Walsh-quantized baker's maps are models for quantum chaos on the torus. We show that for all baker's map scaling factors $D\ge2$ except for $D=4$, typically (in the sense of Haar measure on the eigenspaces, which are degenerate) the empirical distribution of the scaled matrix element fluctuations $\sqrt{N}\{\langle \varphi^{(j)}|\operatorname{Op}_{k,\ell}(a)|\varphi^{(j)}\rangle-\int_{\mathbb{T}^2}a\}_{j=1}^{N}$ for a random eigenbasis $\{\varphi^{(j)}\}_{j=1}^{N}$ is asymptotically Gaussian in the semiclassical limit $N\to\infty$, with variance given in terms of classical baker's map correlations. This determines the precise rate of convergence in the quantum ergodic theorem for these eigenbases. We obtain a version of the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) for these eigenstates, including a limiting complex Gaussian distribution for the off-diagonal matrix elements, with variances also given in terms of classical correlations. The presence of the classical correlations highlights that these eigenstates, while random, have microscopic correlations that differentiate them from Haar random vectors. For the single value $D=4$, the Gaussianity of the matrix element fluctuations depends on the values of the classical observable on a fractal subset of the torus.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the implications provided by the modified Painlev\'{e}-Gullstrand coordinates in the context of quintessence for the Kiselev black hole. In this regard, we set up a fully static line element in terms of lapse and shift functions, apart from including the deformation parameter signaling deviation from the standard Painlev\'{e}-Gullstrand metric. We address two specific issues pertaining to the problems of radiation and dust furnished by the corresponding barotropic index parameter and study the related consequences by performing a range of analyses to explore the influence imposed by quintessence. We also discuss the thermodynamical consequences by evaluating the expressions of the Hawking temperature and the entropy function in closed forms.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Persistent Tensors and their Hessian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Persistent tensors, introduced in [Quantum 8 (2024), 1238], and inspired by quantum information theory, form a recursively defined class of tensors that remain stable under the substitution method and thereby yield nontrivial lower bounds on tensor rank. In this work, we investigate the symmetric case-namely, symmetric persistent tensors, or equivalently, persistent polynomials. We establish that a symmetric tensor in $\mathrm{Sym}^n \mathbb{C}^d$ is persistent if the determinant of its Hessian equals the $d(n-2)$-th power of a nonzero linear form. The converse is verified for cubic tensors ($n=3$) or for $d \leq 3$, by leveraging classical results of B. Segre. Moreover, we demonstrate that the Hessian of a symmetric persistent tensor factors as the $d$-th power of a form of degree $(n-2)$. Our main results provide an explicit necessary and sufficient criterion for persistence, thereby offering an effective algebraic characterization of this class of tensors. Beyond characterization, we present normal forms in small dimensions, place persistent polynomials within prehomogeneous geometry, and connect them with semi-invariants, homaloidal polynomials, and Legendre transforms. Particularly, we prove that all persistent cubics are homaloidal.</description>

      <title>Quantum Grid Path Planning Using Parallel QAOA Circuits Based on Minimum Energy Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To overcome the bottleneck of classical path planning schemes in solving NP problems and address the predicament faced by current mainstream quantum path planning frameworks in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, this study attempts to construct a quantum path planning solution based on parallel Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) architecture. Specifically, the grid path planning problem is mapped to the problem of finding the minimum quantum energy state. Two parallel QAOA circuits are built to simultaneously execute two solution processes, namely connectivity energy calculation and path energy calculation. A classical algorithm is employed to filter out unreasonable solutions of connectivity energy, and finally, the approximate optimal solution to the path planning problem is obtained by merging the calculation results of the two parallel circuits. The research findings indicate that by setting appropriate filter parameters, quantum states corresponding to position points with extremely low occurrence probabilities can be effectively filtered out, thereby increasing the probability of obtaining the target quantum state. Even when the circuit layer number p is only 1, the theoretical solution of the optimal path coding combination can still be found by leveraging the critical role of the filter. Compared with serial circuits, parallel circuits exhibit a significant advantage, as they can find the optimal feasible path coding combination with the highest probability.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically flat black holes with a singular Cauchy horizon and a spacelike singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our recent work [Van de Moortel, The coexistence of null and spacelike singularities inside spherically symmetric black holes], we analyzed the transition between null and spacelike singularities in spherically symmetric dynamical black holes and demonstrated that the spacelike portion is described by a Kasner metric with positive varying exponents that degenerate to $(1,0,0)$ near the null-spacelike transition. In the present paper, we provide examples of global spacetimes satisfying the assumptions of this previous result and apply its analysis to obtain a large class of asymptotically flat (spherically symmetric) black hole spacetimes that exhibit coexisting null and spacelike singularities. Our main results include:
  _The construction of one-ended asymptotically flat black hole spacetimes solving the Einstein-Maxwell-charged-scalar-field equations. The proof relies on a new spacelike-characteristic gluing method between any uncharged spherically symmetric solution and the event horizon of a charged dynamical black hole.
  _The construction of a large class of two-ended asymptotically flat black hole spacetimes solving the Einstein-Maxwell-(uncharged)-scalar-field equations.
  In both cases, we show that the terminal boundary in the black hole interior only has two distinct components: a weakly singular (null) Cauchy horizon $\mathcal{CH}_{i^+}$ where curvature blows up and a strong singularity $\mathcal{S}=\{r=0\}$.
  Our construction provides the first examples of black holes with coexisting null and spacelike singularities. These examples hold particular significance in the one-ended case as a model of gravitational collapse, where this phenomenon is conjecturally generic for the Einstein-scalar-field model, even beyond spherical symmetry.</description>

      <title>Potent categorical represeentations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and motivate -- based on ongoing joint work with Germ\'an Stefanich -- the notion of potent categorical representations of a complex reductive group $G$, specifically a conjectural Langlands correspondence identifying potent categorical representations of $G$ and its Langlands dual $\check G$. We emphasize the symplectic nature of potent categorical representations in their simultaneous dependence on parameters in maximal tori for $G$ and $\check G$, specifically how their conjectural Langlands correspondence fits within a 2-categorical Fourier transform. Our key tool to make various ideas precise is higher sheaf theory and its microlocalization, specifically a theory of ind-coherent sheaves of categories on stacks. The constructions are inspired by the physics of 3d mirror symmetry and S-duality on the one hand, and the theory of double affine Hecke algebras on the other. We also highlight further conjectures related to ongoing programs in and around geometric representation theory.</description>

      <title>Curve separation in supercritical half-space last passage percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study line ensembles arising naturally in symmetrized/half-space geometric last passage percolation (LPP) on the $N \times N$ square. The weights of the model are geometrically distributed with parameter $q^2$ off the diagonal and $cq$ on the diagonal, where $q \in (0,1)$ and $c \in (0, q^{-1})$. In the supercritical regime $c &gt; 1$, we show that the ensembles undergo a phase transition: the top curve separates from the rest and converges to a Brownian motion under $N^{1/2}$ fluctuations and $N$ spatial scaling, while the remaining curves converge to the Airy line ensemble under $N^{1/3}$ fluctuations and $N^{2/3}$ spatial scaling. Our analysis relies on a distributional identity between half-space LPP and the Pfaffian Schur process. The latter exhibits two key structures: (1) a Pfaffian point process, which we use to establish finite-dimensional convergence of the ensembles, and (2) a Gibbsian line ensemble, which we use to extend convergence uniformly over compact sets.</description>

      <title>Correlation Lengths for Stochastic Matrix Product States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a general model of stochastically generated matrix product states (MPS) in which the local tensors share a common distribution and form a strictly stationary sequence, without requiring spatial independence. Under natural conditions on the associated transfer operators, we prove the existence of thermodynamic limits of expectations of local observables and establish almost-sure exponential decay of two-point correlations. In the homogeneous (random translation-invariant) case, for any error tolerance in probability, the two-point function decays exponentially in the distance between the two sites, with a deterministic rate. In the i.i.d. case, the exponential decay still holds with a deterministic rate, with the probability approaching one exponentially fast in the distance. For strictly stationary ensembles with decaying spatial dependence, the correlation decay quantitatively reflects the mixing profile: ($\rho$)-mixing yields polynomial bounds with high probability, while stretched-exponential (resp. exponential) decay in ($\rho$) (resp. ($\beta$)) yields stretched-exponential (resp. exponential) decay of the two-point function, again with correspondingly strong high-probability guarantees. Altogether, the framework unifies and extends recent progress on stationary ergodic and Gaussian translation-invariant ensembles, providing a transfer-operator route to typical correlation decay in random MPS.</description>

      <title>Entanglement in von Neumann Algebraic Quantum Information Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum systems with infinitely many degrees of freedom, states can be infinitely entangled across a pair of subsystems, but are there different forms of infinite entanglement? To understand entanglement in such systems, we use a framework in which subsystems are described by von Neumann algebras on the full system's Hilbert space. Although this approach has been known for over 50 years, an operational justification has been missing so far. We resolve this by deriving the von Neumann algebraic description of subsystems from operational axioms. This raises the question of how physical properties of the subsystem relate to algebraic properties. Our main result shows a surprisingly strong connection: The type classification of von Neumann algebras (types I, II, III, and their respective subtypes) is in one-to-one correspondence with a family of operational entanglement properties. For instance, Connes' classification of type III factors can be formulated in terms of the smallest achievable error when "embezzling" entanglement from the system. Our findings promote the type classification from algebraic bookkeeping to a classification of infinite quantum systems based on the kind of infinite entanglement that they support.</description>

      <title>Beyond Hoeffding and Chernoff: Trading conclusiveness for advantages in quantum hypothesis testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ultimate limits of quantum state discrimination are often thought to be captured by asymptotic bounds that restrict the achievable error probabilities, notably the quantum Chernoff and Hoeffding bounds. Here we study hypothesis testing protocols that are permitted a probability of producing an inconclusive discrimination outcome, and investigate their performance when this probability is suitably constrained. We show that even by allowing an arbitrarily small probability of inconclusiveness, the limits imposed by the quantum Hoeffding and Chernoff bounds can be significantly exceeded, completely circumventing the conventional trade-offs between error exponents in hypothesis testing. Furthermore, such improvements over standard state discrimination are robust and can be obtained even when an exponentially vanishing probability of inconclusive outcomes is demanded. Relaxing the constraints on the inconclusive probability can enable even larger advantages, but this comes at a price. We show a 'strong converse' property of this setting: targeting error exponents beyond those achievable with vanishing inconclusiveness necessarily forces the probability of inconclusive outcomes to converge to one. By exactly quantifying the rate of this convergence, we give a complete characterisation of the trade-offs between error exponents and rates of conclusive outcome probabilities. Overall, our results provide a comprehensive asymptotic picture of how allowing inconclusive measurement outcomes reshapes optimal quantum hypothesis testing.</description>

      <title>Variational formulae for entropy-like functionals for states in von Neumann algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper presents variational formulae for entropy-like functionals, including Segal and R\'enyi entropies, for normal states on semifinite von Neumann algebras. The considered functionals are of the form $\tau(f(h))$ where $\tau$ is a normal faithful semifinite trace on this algebra, $h$ is a positive selfadjoint operator from $L^1(\M,\tau)$, and $f$ is an appropriate convex or concave function. The results cover both finite and semifinite algebras, and the obtained formulae generalise known results, in particular, those concerning relative entropy. Moreover, the connection between quantum entropies and the structure of abelian subalgebras is highlighted, providing new interpretations in the context of quantum information theory.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Gate Count Bounds for Ancilla-Free Single-Qubit Synthesis with Arithmetic Gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study ancilla-free approximation of single-qubit unitaries $U\in {\rm SU}(2)$ by gate sequences over Clifford+$G$, where $G\in\{T,V\}$ or their generalization. Let $p$ denote the characteristic factor of the gate set (e.g., $p=2$ for $G=T$ and $p=5$ for $G=V$). We prove three asymptotic bounds on the minimum $G$-count required to achieve approximation error at most $\varepsilon$. First, for Haar-almost every $U$, we show that $3\log_{p}(1/\varepsilon)$ $G$-count is both necessary and sufficient; moreover, probabilistic synthesis improves the leading constant to $3/2$. Second, for unitaries whose ratio of matrix elements lies in a specified number field, $4\log_p(1/\varepsilon)$ $G$-count is necessary. Again, the leading constant can be improved to $2$ by probabilistic synthesis. Third, there exist unitaries for which the $G$-count per $\log_{p}(1/\varepsilon)$ fails to converge as $\varepsilon\to 0^+$. These results partially resolve a generalized form of the Ross--Selinger conjecture.</description>

      <title>Quantum channel discrimination against jammers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of quantum channel discrimination between two channels with an adversary input party (a.k.a. a jammer). This setup interpolates between the best-case channel discrimination as studied by (Wang &amp; Wilde, 2019) and the worst-case channel discrimination as studied by (Fang, Fawzi, &amp; Fawzi, 2025), thereby generalizing both frameworks. To address this problem, we introduce the notion of minimax channel divergence and establish several of its key mathematical properties. We prove the Stein's lemma in this new setting, showing that the optimal type-II error exponent in the asymptotic regime under parallel strategies is characterized by the regularized minimax channel divergence.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Quantum Homeopathy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Randomness is a fundamental resource in quantum information, with crucial applications in cryptography, algorithms, and error correction. A central challenge is to construct unitary $k$-designs that closely approximate Haar-random unitaries while minimizing the costly use of non-Clifford operations. In this work, we present a protocol, named Quantum Homeopathy, able to generate unitary $k$-designs on $n$ qubits, secure against any adversarial quantum measurement, with a system-size-independent number of non-Clifford gates. Inspired by the principle of homeopathy, our method applies a $k$-design only to a subsystem of size $\Theta(k)$, independent of $n$. This "seed" design is then "diluted" across the entire $n$-qubit system by sandwiching it between two random Clifford operators. The resulting ensemble forms an $\varepsilon$-approximate unitary $k$-design on $n$ qubits. We prove that this construction achieves full quantum security against adaptive adversaries using only $\tilde{O}(k^2 \log\varepsilon^{-1})$ non-Clifford gates. If one requires security only against polynomial-time adaptive adversaries, the non-Clifford cost decreases to $\tilde{O}(k + \log^{1+c} \varepsilon^{-1})$. This is optimal, since we show that at least $\Omega(k)$ non-Clifford gates are required in this setting. Compared to existing approaches, our method significantly reduces non-Clifford overhead while strengthening security guarantees to adaptive security as well as removing artificial assumptions between $n$ and $k$. These results make high-order unitary designs practically attainable in near-term fault-tolerant quantum architectures.</description>

      <title>Determining a magnetic Schr\"odinger equation by a single far-field measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the inverse scattering problem for the magnetic Schr\"odinger equation. We first establish the well-posedness of the direct problem through a variational approach under physically meaningful assumptions on the magnetic and electric potentials. Our main results demonstrate that a single far-field measurement uniquely determines the support of the potential functions when the scatterer has polyhedral structures.
  A significant theoretical byproduct of our analysis reveals that transmission eigenfunctions must vanish at corners in two dimensions and edge corners in three dimensions, provided the angle is not $\pi$. This geometric property of eigenfunctions extends previous results for the non-magnetic case and provides new insights into the interaction between quantum effects and singular geometries. The proof combines complex geometric optics solutions with careful asymptotic analysis near singular points.
  From an inverse problems perspective, our work shows that minimal measurement data suffices for shape reconstruction in important practical cases, advancing the theoretical understanding of inverse scattering with magnetic potentials. The results have potential applications in quantum imaging, material characterization, and nondestructive testing where magnetic fields play a crucial role.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key result in entanglement theory is that the addition of a catalyst dramatically enlarges the set of possible state transformations via local operations and classical communication (LOCC). However, it remains unclear what is the interplay between classical communication and quantum catalysis. Here our aim is to disentangle the effect of the catalyst from that of classical communication. To do so, we explore a class of state transformations termed catalytic local operations (CLO) and compare it to LOCC and to stochastic LOCC augmented by bounded quantum communication. We show that these classes are incomparable and capture different facets of quantum state transformations.</description>

      <title>Scalar-tensor theories in the Lyra geometry: Invariance under local transformations of length units and the Jordan-Einstein frame conundrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lyra geometry provides an interesting approach to develop purely geometrical scalar-tensor theories due to the natural presence of the Lyra scale function. This paper explores further the scale function source term to construct a theory on Lyra manifolds which contains proper generalizations of both Brans-Dicke gravity and the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet scalar-tensor theory. It is shown that the symmetry group of gravitational theories on the Lyra geometry comprises not only coordinate transformations but also local transformations of length units, so that the Lyra function is the conformal factor which locally fixes the unit of length. By performing a Lyra transformation to a frame in which the unit of length is globally fixed, it is shown that General Relativity is obtained from the Lyra Scalar-Tensor Theory (LyST). Through the same procedure, even in the presence of matter fields, it is found that Brans-Dicke gravity and the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet scalar-tensor theory are obtained from their Lyra counterparts. It is argued that this approach is consistent with the Mach-Dicke principle, since the strength of gravity in Brans-Dicke-Lyra is controlled by the scale function. It might be possible that any known scalar-tensor theory can be naturally geometrized by considering a particular Lyra frame, for which the scalar field is the function which locally controls the unit of length. The Jordan-Einstein frame conundrum is also assessed from the perspective of Lyra transformations, it is shown that the Lyra geometry makes explicit that the two frames are only different representations of the same theory, so that in the Einstein frame the unit of length varies locally. The Lyra formalism is then shown to be better suited for exploring scalar-tensor gravity, since in its well-defined structure the conservation of the energy-momentum tensor and geodesic motion are assured in the Einstein frame.</description>

      <title>Random unitaries from Hamiltonian dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature of randomness and complexity growth in systems governed by unitary dynamics is a fundamental question in quantum many-body physics. This problem has motivated the study of models such as local random circuits and their convergence to Haar-random unitaries in the long-time limit. However, these models do not correspond to any family of physical time-independent Hamiltonians. In this work, we address this gap by studying the indistinguishability of time-independent Hamiltonian dynamics from truly random unitaries. On one hand, we establish a no-go result showing that for any ensemble of constant-local Hamiltonians and any evolution times, the resulting time-evolution unitary can be efficiently distinguished from Haar-random and fails to form a $2$-design or a pseudorandom unitary (PRU). On the other hand, we prove that this limitation can be overcome by increasing the locality slightly: there exist ensembles of random polylog-local Hamiltonians in one-dimension such that under constant evolution time, the resulting time-evolution unitary is indistinguishable from Haar-random, i.e. it forms both a unitary $k$-design and a PRU. Moreover, these Hamiltonians can be efficiently simulated under standard cryptographic assumptions.</description>

Abstract: An important open question about Markov chains for preparing quantum Gibbs states is proving rapid mixing. However, rapid mixing at low temperatures has only been proven for Gibbs states with no thermally stable phases, e.g., the 2D toric code. Inspired by Swendsen-Wang dynamics, in this work we give a simple Markov chain, Code Swendsen-Wang dynamics, for preparing Gibbs states of commuting Hamiltonians. We prove rapid mixing of this chain for classes of quantum and classical Hamiltonians with thermally stable phases, including the 4D toric code, at any temperature. We conjecture its efficiency for all code Hamiltonians away from first-order phase transition points.</description>

      <title>Random unitaries that conserve energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random unitaries sampled from the Haar measure serve as fundamental models for generic quantum many-body dynamics. Under standard cryptographic assumptions, recent works have constructed polynomial-size quantum circuits that are computationally indistinguishable from Haar-random unitaries, establishing the concept of pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs). While PRUs have found broad implications in many-body physics, they fail to capture the energy conservation that governs physical systems. In this work, we investigate the computational complexity of generating PRUs that conserve energy under a fixed and known Hamiltonian $H$. We provide an efficient construction of energy-conserving PRUs when $H$ is local and commuting with random coefficients. Conversely, we prove that for certain translationally invariant one-dimensional $H$, there exists an efficient quantum algorithm that can distinguish truly random energy-conserving unitaries from any polynomial-size quantum circuit. This establishes that energy-conserving PRUs cannot exist for these Hamiltonians. Furthermore, we prove that determining whether energy-conserving PRUs exist for a given family of one-dimensional local Hamiltonians is an undecidable problem. Our results reveal an unexpected computational barrier that fundamentally separates the generation of generic random unitaries from those obeying the basic physical constraint of energy conservation.</description>

      <title>Learning Coulomb Potentials and Beyond with Fermions in Continuous Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a modular algorithm for learning external potentials in continuous-space free-fermion models including Coulomb potentials in any dimension. Compared to the lattice-based approaches, the continuum presents new mathematical challenges: the state space is infinite-dimensional and the Hamiltonian contains the Laplacian, which is unbounded in the continuum and thus produces an unbounded speed of information propagation. Our framework addresses these difficulties through novel optimization methods or information-propagation bounds in combination with a priori regularity assumptions on the external potential. The resulting algorithm provides a unified and robust approach that covers both Coulomb interactions and other classes of physically relevant potentials. One possible application is the characterization of charge and position of nuclei and ions in quantum chemistry. Our results thus lay the foundation for a scalable and generalizable toolkit to explore fermionic systems governed by continuous-space interactions.</description>

      <title>Optimal Distillation of Qubit Clocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study coherence distillation under time-translation-invariant operations: given many copies of a quantum state containing coherence in the energy eigenbasis, the aim is to produce a purer coherent state while respecting the time-translation symmetry. This symmetry ensures that the output remains synchronized with the input and that the process can be realized by energy-conserving unitaries coupling the system to a reservoir initially in an energy eigenstate, thereby modeling thermal operations supplemented by a work reservoir or battery. For qubit systems, we determine the optimal asymptotic fidelity and show that it is governed by the purity of coherence, a measure of asymmetry derived from the right logarithmic derivative (RLD) Fisher information. In particular, we find that the lowest achievable infidelity (one minus fidelity) scales as $1/N$ times the reciprocal of the purity of coherence of each input qubit, where $N$ is the number of copies, giving this quantity a clear operational meaning. We additionally study many other interesting aspects of the coherence distillation problem for qubits, including computing higher-order corrections to the lowest achievable infidelity up to $O(1/N^3)$, and expressing the optimal channel as a boundary value problem that can be solved numerically.</description>

      <title>Hardness of recognizing phases of matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that recognizing the phase of matter of an unknown quantum state is quantum computationally hard. More specifically, we show that the quantum computational time of any phase recognition algorithm must grow exponentially in the range of correlations $\xi$ of the unknown state. This exponential growth renders the problem practically infeasible for even moderate correlation ranges, and leads to super-polynomial quantum computational time in the system size $n$ whenever $\xi = \omega(\log n)$. Our results apply to a substantial portion of all known phases of matter, including symmetry-breaking phases and symmetry-protected topological phases for any discrete on-site symmetry group in any spatial dimension. To establish this hardness, we extend the study of pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) to quantum systems with symmetries. We prove that symmetric PRUs exist under standard cryptographic conjectures, and can be constructed in extremely low circuit depths. We also establish hardness for systems with translation invariance and purely classical phases of matter. A key technical limitation is that the locality of the parent Hamiltonians of the states we consider is linear in $\xi$; the complexity of phase recognition for Hamiltonians with constant locality remains an important open question.</description>

Abstract: Statistical mechanics assumes that a quantum many-body system at low temperature can be effectively described by its Gibbs state. However, many complex quantum systems exist only as metastable states of dissipative open system dynamics, which appear stable and robust yet deviate substantially from true thermal equilibrium. In this work, we model metastable states as approximate stationary states of a quasi-local, (KMS)-detailed-balanced master equation representing Markovian system-bath interaction, and unveil a universal structural theory: all metastable states satisfy an area law of mutual information and a Markov property. The more metastable the states are, the larger the regions to which these structural results apply. Therefore, the hallmark correlation structure and noise resilience of Gibbs states are not exclusive to true equilibrium but emerge dynamically. Behind our structural results lies a systematic framework encompassing sharp equivalences between local minima of free energy, a non-commutative Fisher information, and approximate detailed balance conditions. Our results build towards a comprehensive theory of thermal metastability and, in turn, formulate a well-defined, feasible, and repeatable target for quantum thermal simulation.</description>

      <title>Deformations of the Riemann hierarchy and the geometry of $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}$</title>

Abstract: The Riemann hierarchy is the simplest example of rank one, ($1$+$1$)-dimensional integrable system of nonlinear evolutionary PDEs. It corresponds to the dispersionless limit of the Korteweg-de Vries hierarchy. In the language of formal variational calculus, we address the classification problem for deformations of the Riemann hierarchy satisfying different extra requirements (general deformations, deformations as systems of conservation laws, Hamiltonian deformations, and tau-symmetric deformations), under the natural group of coordinate transformations preserving each of those requirements. We present several results linking previous conjectures of Dubrovin-Liu-Yang-Zhang (for the tau-symmetric case) and of Arsie-Lorenzoni-Moro (for systems of conservation laws) to the double ramification hierarchy construction of integrable hierarchies from partial CohFTs and F-CohFTs. We prove that, if the conjectures are true, DR hierarchies of rank one are universal objects in the space of deformations of the Riemann hierarchy. We also prove a weaker version of the DLYZ conjecture and that the ALM conjecture implies (the main part of) the DLYZ conjecture. Finally we characterize those rank one F-CohFTs which give rise to Hamiltonian deformations of the Riemann hierarchy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01873v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a micromorphic-based approach for finite element stabilization of reaction-convection-diffusion equations, by gradient enhancement of the field of interest via introducing an auxiliary variable. The well-posedness of the coupled-field approach is established, together with an error estimate. Through a set of 1D and 2D numerical examples the high accuracy and enhanced stability of the approach in approximating solutions associated with complex problems is demonstrated, for situations of varying reactivity and convection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop the method for constructing solutions to the nonlocal nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation (NLSE) with an anti-Hermitian term that are semiclassically localized on a one-dimensional manifold (a curve). The evolution of the curve is given by the closed system of integro-differential equations that can be treated as the "classical"\, analog of the open quantum system with the nontrivial geometry. Using our approach, we consider the evolution of vortex states in the open quantum system described by the specific model NLSE. The semiclassical stage of the vortex evolution can be treated as a quasi-steady vortex state. We show that the behaviour of this state is largely determined by the geometry of the localization curve.</description>

      <title>Growth and nodal current of complexified horocycle eigenfunctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.08244v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study horocycle eigenfunctions at Lobachevsky plane. They are functions $u\colon \mathbb H=\mathbb C^+=\{z\in\mathbb C\colon \Im z&gt;0\}\to\mathbb C$ such that $\left(-y^2\left(\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}+\frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2}\right)+ 2i\tau y\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\right)u(x+iy)=s^2 u(x+iy)$, $x+iy\in\mathbb C^+$, with $\tau,s\in\mathbb R$, $\tau$ large and $s/\tau$ small. In other words, we study eigenfunctions of magnetic quantum Hamiltonian on hyperbolic plane. By Bohr semiclassical correspondence principle, the asymptotic behavior of such functions is related to horocycle flow on $T\mathbb H$. Let $u^{\mathbb C}$ be analytic continuation of function $u$ to Grauert tube; the latter is an open neighbourhood of $\mathbb H$ in the complexified Lobachevsky plane $\mathbb H^{\mathbb C}$. If a sequence of horocycle functions possesses microlocal quantum ergodicity at the admissible energy level (with $\hbar=1/\tau$) then we may find asymptotic distribution of divisor of $u^{\mathbb C}$. This is done by establishing the asymptotic estimates on $|u^{\mathbb C}|$ in $\mathbb H^{\mathbb C}$. Under imaginary-time horocycle flow, microlocalization of $u$ in $T^*\mathbb H$ is taken to localization of $u^{\mathbb C}$ on $\mathbb H^{\mathbb C}$. The growth of functions $u^{\mathbb C}$ as $\tau\to\infty$ turns to be governed by the growth of complexified gauge factor occurring in $\tau$-automorphic kernels for functions on $\mathbb H$.</description>

      <title>Deep-Circuit QAOA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.12406v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite its popularity, several empirical and theoretical studies suggest that the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) has persistent issues in providing a substantial practical advantage. Numerical results for few qubits and shallow circuits are, at best, ambiguous, and the well-studied barren plateau phenomenon draws a rather sobering picture for deeper circuits. However, as more and more sophisticated strategies are proposed to circumvent barren plateaus, it stands to reason which issues are actually fundamental and which merely constitute - admittedly difficult - engineering tasks. By shifting the scope from the usually considered parameter landscape to the quantum state space's geometry we can distinguish between problems that are fundamentally difficult to solve, independently of the parameterization, and those for which there could at least exist a favorable parameterization. Here, we find clear evidence for a 'no free lunch'-behavior of QAOA on a general optimization task with no further structure; individual cases have, however, to be analyzed more carefully.
  Based on our analysis, we propose and justify a performance indicator for the deep-circuit QAOA that can be accessed by solely evaluating statistical properties of the classical objective function. We further discuss the various favorable properties a generic QAOA instance has in the asymptotic regime of infinitely many gates, and elaborate on the immanent drawbacks of finite circuits. We provide several numerical examples of a deep-circuit QAOA method based on local search strategies and find that - in alignment with our performance indicator - some special function classes, like QUBOs, indeed admit a favorable optimization landscape.</description>

      <title>On anomalous dissipation induced by transport noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03525v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that suitable transport noises produce anomalous dissipation of both enstrophy of solutions to 2D Navier-Stokes equations and of energy of solutions to diffusion equations in all dimensions. The key ingredients are Meyers' type estimates for SPDEs with transport noise, which are combined with recent scaling limits for such SPDEs. The former enables us to establish, for the first time, uniform-in-time convergence in a space of positive smoothness for such scaling limits. Compared to previous work, one of the main novelties is that anomalous dissipation might take place even in the presence of a transport noise of arbitrarily small intensity. Physical interpretations of our results are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the existence and the properties of normalized ground states of a nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on a quantum hybrid formed by two planes connected at a point. The nonlinearities are of power type and $L^2$-subcritical, while the matching condition between the two planes generates two point interactions of different strengths on each plane, together with a coupling condition between the two planes. We prove that ground states exist for every value of the mass and two different qualitative situations are possible depending on the matching condition: either ground states concentrate on one of the plane only, or ground states distribute on both the planes and are positive, radially symmetric, decreasing and present a logarithmic singularity at the origin of each plane. Moreover, we discuss how the mass distributes on the two planes and compare the strengths of the logarithmic singularities on the two planes when the parameters of the matching condition and the powers of the nonlinear terms vary.</description>

      <title>Transfer Matrix and Lattice Dilatation Operator for High-Quality Fixed Points in Tensor Network Renormalization Group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13012v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tensor network renormalization group maps study critical points of 2d lattice models like the Ising model by finding the fixed point of the RG map. In a prior work arXiv:2408.10312 we showed that by adding a rotation to the RG map, the Newton method could be implemented to find an extremely accurate fixed point. For a particular RG map (Gilt-TNR) we studied the spectrum of the Jacobian of the RG map at the fixed point and found good agreement between the eigenvalues corresponding to relevant and marginal operators and their known exact values. In this companion work we use two further methods to extract many more scaling dimensions from this Newton method fixed point, and compare the numerical results with the predictions of conformal field theory (CFT). The first method is the well-known transfer matrix (TM), while the second method we refer to as the lattice dilatation operator (LDO). We introduce some extensions of these method that provide also spins of the CFT operators, modulo an integer. With comparable computing resources, the TM and LDO methods perform equally well. The agreement for the scaling dimensions and spins is excellent up to the scaling dimesnion 4.125, and reasonably good up to 2 units higher. Some of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian of the RG map can come from perturbations associated with total derivative interactions and so are not universal. In some past studies (arXiv:2102.08136, arXiv:2305.09899) such non-universal eigenvalues did not appear in the Jacobian. We explain this surprising result by showing that their RG map has the unusual property that the Jacobian is equivalent to the LDO operator.</description>

      <title>Optimal trace-distance bounds for free-fermionic states: Testing and improved tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17953v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Free-fermionic states, also known as fermionic Gaussian states, represent an important class of quantum states ubiquitous in physics. They are uniquely and efficiently described by their correlation matrix. However, in practical experiments, the correlation matrix can only be estimated with finite accuracy. This raises the question: how does the error in estimating the correlation matrix affect the trace-distance error of the state? We show that if the correlation matrix is known with an error $\varepsilon$, the trace-distance error also scales as $\varepsilon$ (and vice versa). Specifically, we provide distance bounds between (both pure and mixed) free-fermionic states in relation to their correlation matrix distance. Our analysis also extends to cases where one state may not be free-fermionic. Importantly, we leverage our preceding results to derive significant advancements in property testing and tomography of free-fermionic states. Property testing involves determining whether an unknown state is close to or far from being a free-fermionic state. We first demonstrate that any algorithm capable of testing arbitrary (possibly mixed) free-fermionic states would inevitably be inefficient. Then, we present an efficient algorithm for testing low-rank free-fermionic states. For free-fermionic state tomography, we provide improved bounds on sample complexity in the pure-state scenario, substantially improving over previous literature, and we generalize the efficient algorithm to mixed states, discussing its noise-robustness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07399v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the $K$-theoretic enumerative geometry of cyclic Nakajima quiver varieties, with particular focus on $\text{Hilb}^{m}([\mathbb{C}^{2}/\mathbb{Z}_{l}])$, the equivariant Hilbert scheme of points on $\mathbb{C}^2$. The direct sum over $m$ of the equivariant $K$-theories of these varieties is known to be isomorphic to the ring symmetric functions in $l$ colors, with structure sheaves of torus fixed points identified with wreath Macdonald polynomials. Using properties of wreath Macdonald polynomials and the recent identification of the Maulik-Okounkov quantum affine algebra for cyclic quivers with the quantum toroidal algebras of type $A$, we derive an explicit formula for the generating function of capped vertex functions of $\text{Hilb}^{m}([\mathbb{C}^{2}/\mathbb{Z}_{l}])$ with descendants given by exterior powers of the $0$th tautological bundle. We also sharpen the large framing vanishing results of Okounkov, providing a class of descendants and cyclic quiver varieties for which the capped vertex functions are purely classical. Our results also suggest certain integrality and wall-crossing conjectures for capped vertex functions.</description>

Abstract: If $A \colon D(A) \subset \mathcal{H} \to \mathcal{H}$ is an unbounded Fredholm operator of index $0$ on a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ with a dense domain $D(A)$, then its spectrum is either discrete or the entire complex plane. This spectral dichotomy plays a central role in the study of magic angles in twisted bilayer graphene. This paper proves that if such operators (with certain additional assumptions) are perturbed by certain random trace-class operators, their spectrum is discrete with high probability.</description>

      <title>Quantum umlaut information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum umlaut information, a correlation measure defined for bipartite quantum states $\rho_{AB}$ as a reversed variant of the quantum mutual information: $U(A;B)_\rho = \min_{\sigma_B} D(\rho_A\otimes \sigma_B\|\rho_{AB})$ in terms of the quantum relative entropy $D$. As in the classical case [Girardi et al., arXiv:2503.18910], this definition allows for a closed-form expression and has an operational interpretation as the asymptotic error exponent in the hypothesis testing task of deciding whether a given bipartite state is product or not. We generalise the umlaut information to quantum channels, where it also extends the notion of `oveloh information' [Nuradha et al., arXiv:2404.16101]. We prove that channel umlaut information is additive for classical-quantum channels, while we observe additivity violations for fully quantum channels. Inspired by recent results in entanglement theory, we then show as our main result that the regularised umlaut information constitutes a fundamental measure of the quality of classical information transmission over a quantum channel -- as opposed to the capacity, which quantifies the quantity of information that can be sent. This interpretation applies to coding assisted by activated non-signalling correlations, and the channel umlaut information is in general larger than the corresponding expression for unassisted communication as obtained by Dalai for the classical-quantum case [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 59, 8027 (2013)]. Combined with prior works on non-signalling--assisted zero-error channel capacities, our findings imply a dichotomy between the settings of zero-rate error exponents and zero-error communication. While our results are single-letter only for classical-quantum channels, we also give a single-letter bound for fully quantum channels in terms of the `geometric' version of umlaut information.</description>

      <title>Ryu-Takayanagi Formula for Multi-Boundary Black Holes from 2D Large-$c$ CFT Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12388v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a class of quantum states involving multiple entangled CFTs in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, associated with multi-boundary black hole geometries, and demonstrate that the Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) formula for entanglement entropy can be derived using only boundary CFT data. Approximating the OPE coefficients by their Gaussian moments within the 2D large-$c$ CFT ensemble, we show that both the norm of the states and the entanglement entropies associated with various bipartitions--reproducing the expected bulk dual results--can be computed purely from the CFT. All $\textit{macroscopic geometric}$ structures arising from gravitational saddles emerge entirely from the universal statistical moments of the $\textit{microscopic algebraic}$ CFT data, revealing a statistical-mechanical mechanism underlying semiclassical gravity. We establish a precise correspondence between the CFT norm, the Liouville partition function with ZZ boundary conditions, and the exact gravitational path integral over 3D multi-boundary black hole geometries. For entanglement entropy, each RT phase arises from a distinct leading-order Gaussian contraction, with phase transitions--analogous to replica wormholes--emerging naturally from varying dominant statistical patterns in the CFT ensemble. Our derivation elucidates how the general mechanism behind holographic entropy, namely a boundary replica direction that elongates and becomes contractible in the bulk dual, is encoded explicitly in the statistical structure of the CFT data.</description>

      <title>Cohomology for Linearized Boundary-Value Problems on General Riemannian Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18494v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a framework for casting the solvability and uniqueness conditions of linearized geometric boundary-value problems in cohomological terms. The theory is designed to be applicable without assumptions on the underlying geometric structure and provides tools to study the emergent cohomology explicitly. To achieve this generality, we extend Hodge theory to sequences of Douglas--Nirenberg systems that interact via Green's formulae, overdetermined ellipticity, and a condition we call the order-reduction property, replacing the classical requirement that the sequence form a cochain complex. This property typically arises from linearized symmetries and constraints, as demonstrated in several examples, including exterior covariant derivatives, linearized prescribed Riemann curvature, and linearized Einstein equations with sources.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Formalism Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16480v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the simple system of a point-like particle confined to a straight line, I compile, initially in a concise table, the structural elements of quantum mechanics and contrast them with those of classical (statistical) mechanics. Despite many similarities, there are the well-known fundamental differences, resulting from the algebraic non-commutativity in the quantal structure. The latter was discovered by Werner Heisenberg (1901-1976) in June 1925 on the small island of Helgoland in the North Sea, as a consequence of understanding atomic spectral data within a matrix scheme consistent with energy conservation. I discuss the differences and exemplify their quantifications by the variance and entropic indeterminacy inequalities, by (pseudo-)classical bounds on quantum canonical partition functions, and by the correlation inequalities of John Bell (1928-1990) and others.</description>

      <title>Explicit conserved operators for a class of integrable bosonic networks from the classical Yang-Baxter equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $B$ denote the weighted adjacency matrix of a balanced, symmetric, bipartite graph. We define a class of bosonic networks given by Hamiltonians whose hopping terms are determined by $B$. We show that each quantum Hamiltonian is Yang-Baxter integrable, admitting a set of mutually commuting operators derived through a solution of the classical Yang-Baxter equation. We discuss some applications and consequences of this result.</description>

      <title>Absence of nontrivial local conserved quantities in the Hubbard model on the two or higher dimensional hypercubic lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20106v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By extending the strategy developed by Shiraishi in 2019, we prove that the standard Hubbard model on the $d$-dimensional hypercubic lattice with $d\ge2$ does not admit any nontrivial local conserved quantities. The theorem strongly suggests that the model is non-integrable. To our knowledge, this is the first extension of Shiraishi's proof of the absence of conserved quantities to a fermionic model. Although our proof follows the original strategy of Shiraishi, it is essentially more subtle compared with the proof by Shiraishi and Tasaki of the corresponding theorem for $S=\tfrac12$ quantum spin systems in two or higher dimensions; our proof requires three steps, while that of Shiraishi and Tasaki requires only two steps. It is also necessary to partially determine the conserved quantities of the one-dimensional Hubbard model to accomplish our proof.</description>

      <title>Pauli Stabilizer Models for Gapped Boundaries of Twisted Quantum Doubles and Applications to Composite Dimensional Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19245v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide new algorithms and provide example constructions of stabilizer models for the gapped boundaries, domain walls, and $0D$ defects of Abelian composite dimensional twisted quantum doubles. Using the physically intuitive concept of condensation, our algorithm explicitly describes how to construct the boundary and domain-wall stabilizers starting from the bulk model. This extends the utility of Pauli stabilizer models in describing non-translationally invariant topological orders with gapped boundaries. To highlight this utility, we provide a series of examples including a new family of quantum error-correcting codes where the double of $\mathbb{Z}_4$ is coupled to instances of the double semion (DS) phase. We discuss the codes' utility in the burgeoning area of quantum error correction with an emphasis on the interplay between deconfined anyons, logical operators, error rates and decoding. We also augment our construction, built using algorithmic tools to describe the properties of explicit stabilizer layouts at the microscopic lattice-level, with dimensional counting arguments and macroscopic-level constructions building on pants decompositions. The latter outlines how such codes' representation and design can be automated. Going beyond our worked out examples, we expect our explicit step-by-step algorithms to pave the path for new higher-algebraic-dimensional codes to be discovered and implemented in near-term architectures that take advantage of various hardware's distinct strengths.</description>

      <title>Positive maps and extendibility hierarchies from copositive matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces and systematically studies a new convex cone of PCOP (pairwise copositive). We establish that this cone is dual to the cone of PCP (pairwise completely positive) and, critically, provides a complete characterization for the positivity of the broad class of covariant maps. We provide a way to lift matrices from the cone of COP to PCOP, thereby creating a powerful bridge between the theory of copositive forms and the positive maps. We develop an analogous framework for decomposable maps, introducing the cone PDEC.
  As a primary application of this framework, we define a novel family of linear maps $\Phi_t^G$ parameterized by a graph $G$ and a real parameter $t$. We derive exact thresholds on $t$ that determine when these maps are positive or decomposable, linking these properties to fundamental graph-theoretic parameters. This construction yields vast new families of positive indecomposable maps, for which we provide explicit examples derived from infinite classes of graphs, most notably rank 3 strongly regular graphs such as Paley graphs.
  On the dual side, we investigate the entanglement properties of large classes of (symmetric) states. We prove that the SOS hierarchies used in polynomial optimization to approximate the cone of copositive matrices correspond precisely to dual cones of witnesses for different levels of the PPT bosonic extendibility hierarchy}-. In the setting of the DPS hierarchy for separability, we construct a large family of optimal entanglement witnesses that are not certifiable by any level of the PPT bosonic extendibility hierarchy, answering a long standing open question from [DPS04]. Leveraging the duality, we also provide an explicit construction of (mixture of) bipartite Dicke states that are simultaneously entangled and $K_r$-PPT bosonic extendible for any desired hierarchy level $r \geq 2$ and local dimension $n \geq 5$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the phase transition of the Parisi formula for the free energy in the multi-species Sherrington--Kirkpatrick model with a centered Gaussian external field and a positive-semidefinite variance profile matrix. We show that in terms of the strength of the external field and the variance profile, the de Almeida--Thouless surface delineates the boundary between replica symmetric solutions and replica symmetry breaking solutions.</description>

      <title>Universal constructions in homotopical algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply the effective integration theory of Lie-graph algebras, developed recently by the authors, to the deformation and homotopy theories of types of bialgebras, that is structures controlled by a properad, like associative bialgebras, (involutive) Lie bialgebras, Frobenius bialgebras, double Poisson bialgebras, pre-Calabi--Yau algebras, quantum Airy structures, etc. In these cases, we provide their associated Deligne groupoid with an explicit homotopical description. We settle the Koszul hierarchy and the twisting procedure on the properadic level. We also give a conceptual construction of the homotopy transfer theorem in terms of gauge actions. This work extends the formulas for the deformation theory of operadic algebras.</description>
