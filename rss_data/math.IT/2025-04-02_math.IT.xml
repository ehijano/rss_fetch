      <title>How to Maximize Efficiency in Systems with Exhausted Workers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of assigning tasks efficiently to a set of workers that can exhaust themselves as a result of processing tasks. If a worker is exhausted, it will take a longer time to recover. To model efficiency of workers with exhaustion, we use a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC). By taking samples from the internal states of the workers, the source assigns tasks to the workers when they are found to be in their efficient states. We consider two different settings where (i) the source can assign tasks to the workers only when they are in their most efficient state, and (ii) it can assign tasks to workers when they are also moderately efficient in spite of a potentially reduced success probability. In the former case, we find the optimal policy to be a threshold-based sampling policy where the thresholds depend on the workers' recovery and exhaustion rates. In the latter case, we solve a non-convex sum-of-ratios problem using a branch-and-bound approach which performs well compared with the globally optimal solution.</description>

      <title>LOCO Codes Can Correct as Well: Error-Correction Constrained Coding for DNA Data Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a medium for cold data storage, DNA stands out as it promises significant gains in storage capacity and lifetime. However, it comes with its own data processing challenges to overcome. Constrained codes over the DNA alphabet $\{A,T,G,C\}$ have been used to design DNA sequences that are free of long homopolymers to increase stability, yet effective error detection and error correction are required to achieve reliability in data retrieval. Recently, we introduced lexicographically-ordered constrained (LOCO) codes, namely DNA LOCO (D-LOCO) codes, with error detection. In this paper, we equip our D-LOCO codes with error correction for substitution errors via syndrome-like decoding, designated as residue decoding. We only use D-LOCO codewords of indices divisible by a suitable redundancy metric $R(m) &gt; 0$, where $m$ is the code length, for error correction. We provide the community with a construction of constrained codes forbidding runs of length higher than fixed $\ell \in \{1,2,3\}$ and $GC$-content in $\big [0.5-\frac{1}{2K},0.5+\frac{1}{2K}\big ]$ that correct $K$ segmented substitution errors, one per codeword. We call the proposed codes error-correction (EC) D-LOCO codes. We also give a list-decoding procedure with near-quadratic time-complexity in $m$ to correct double-substitution errors within EC D-LOCO codewords, which has $&gt; 98.20\%$ average success rate. The redundancy metric is projected to require $2\log_2(m)+O(1)$-bit allocation for a length-$m$ codeword. Hence, our EC D-LOCO codes are projected to be capacity-approaching with respect to the error-free constrained system.</description>

      <title>SCNR Maximization for MIMO ISAC Assisted by Fluid Antenna System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technology has been extensively researched to enhance communication rates and radar sensing capabilities. Additionally, a new technology known as fluid antenna system (FAS) has recently been proposed to obtain higher communication rates for future wireless networks by dynamically altering the antenna position to obtain a more favorable channel condition. The application of the FAS technology in ISAC scenarios holds significant research potential. In this paper, we investigate a FAS-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) ISAC system for maximizing the radar sensing signal-clutter-noise ratio (SCNR) under communication signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and antenna position constraints. We devise an iterative algorithm that tackles the optimization problem by maximizing a lower bound of SCNR with respect to the transmit precoding matrix and the antenna position. By addressing the non-convexity of the problem through this iterative approach, our method significantly improves the SCNR. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves a higher SCNR compared to the baselines.</description>

      <title>How to Define the Quality of Data? A Feature-Based Literature Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The digital transformation of our society is a constant challenge, as data is generated in almost every digital interaction. To use data effectively, it must be of high quality. This raises the question: what exactly is data quality? A systematic literature review of the existing literature shows that data quality is a multifaceted concept, characterized by a number of quality dimensions. However, the definitions of data quality vary widely. We used feature-oriented domain analysis to specify a taxonomy of data quality definitions and to classify the existing definitions. This allows us to identify research gaps and future topics.</description>

      <title>Construction of MDS Euclidean Self-Dual Codes via Multiple Subsets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MDS self-dual codes have good algebraic structure, and their parameters are completely determined by the code length. In recent years, the construction of MDS Euclidean self-dual codes with new lengths has become an important issue in coding theory. In this paper, we are committed to constructing new MDS Euclidean self-dual codes via generalized Reed-Solomon (GRS) codes and their extended (EGRS) codes. The main effort of our constructions is to find suitable subsets of finite fields as the evaluation sets, ensuring that the corresponding (extended) GRS codes are Euclidean self-dual. Firstly, we present a method for selecting evaluation sets from multiple intersecting subsets and provide a theorem to guarantee that the chosen evaluation sets meet the desired criteria. Secondly, based on this theorem, we construct six new classes of MDS Euclidean self-dual codes using the norm function, as well as the union of three multiplicity subgroups and their cosets respectively. Finally, in our constructions, the proportion of possible MDS Euclidean self-dual codes exceeds 85\%, which is much higher than previously reported results.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Proximal Inexact Gradient Framework and Its Application to Per-Antenna Constrained Joint Beamforming and Compression Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an adaptive proximal inexact gradient (APIG) framework for solving a class of nonsmooth composite optimization problems involving function and gradient errors. Unlike existing inexact proximal gradient methods, the proposed framework introduces a new line search condition that jointly adapts to function and gradient errors, enabling adaptive stepsize selection while maintaining theoretical guarantees. Specifically, we prove that the proposed framework achieves an $\epsilon$-stationary point within $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ iterations for nonconvex objectives and an $\epsilon$-optimal solution within $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$ iterations for convex cases, matching the best-known complexity in this context. We then custom-apply the APIG framework to an important signal processing problem: the joint beamforming and compression problem (JBCP) with per-antenna power constraints (PAPCs) in cooperative cellular networks. This customized application requires careful exploitation of the problem's special structure such as the tightness of the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and the differentiability of the dual. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our custom-application over state-of-the-art benchmarks for the JBCP.</description>

      <title>Linear Time Iterative Decoders for Hypergraph-Product and Lifted-Product Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes with asymptotically non-zero rates are prominent candidates for achieving fault-tolerant quantum computation, primarily due to their syndrome-measurement circuit's low operational depth. Numerous studies advocate for the necessity of fast decoders to fully harness the capabilities of QLDPC codes, thus driving the focus towards designing low-complexity iterative decoders. However, empirical investigations indicate that such iterative decoders are susceptible to having a high error floor while decoding QLDPC codes. The main objective of this paper is to analyze the decoding failures of the \emph{hypergraph-product} and \emph{lifted-product} codes and to design decoders that mitigate these failures, thus achieving a reduced error floor. The suboptimal performance of these codes can predominantly be ascribed to two structural phenomena: (1) stabilizer-induced trapping sets, which are subgraphs formed by stabilizers, and (2) classical trapping sets, which originate from the classical codes utilized in the construction of hypergraph-product and lifted-product codes. The dynamics of stabilizer-induced trapping sets is examined and a straightforward modification of iterative decoders is proposed to circumvent these trapping sets. Moreover, this work proposes a systematic methodology for designing decoders that can circumvent classical trapping sets in both hypergraph product and lifted product codes, from decoders capable of avoiding their trapping set in the parent classical LDPC code. When decoders that can avoid stabilizer-induced trapping sets are run in parallel with those that can mitigate the effect of classical TS, the logical error rate improves significantly in the error-floor region.</description>

      <title>Optimal shift-invariant spaces from uniform measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $m$ be a positive integer and
  $\mathcal{C}$ be a collection of closed subspaces in $L^2(\mathbb{R})$. Given the measurements $\mathcal{F}_Y=\left\lbrace \left\lbrace y_k^1 \right\rbrace_{k\in \mathbb{Z}},\ldots, \left\lbrace y_k^m \right\rbrace_{k\in \mathbb{Z}} \right\rbrace \subset \ell^2(\mathbb{Z})$ of unknown functions $\mathcal{F}=\left\{f_1, \ldots,f_m \right\} \subset L^2( \mathbb{R})$, in this paper we study the problem of finding an optimal space $S$ in $\mathcal{C}$ that is ``closest" to the measurements $\mathcal{F}_Y$ of $\mathcal{F}$. Since the class of finitely generated shift-invariant spaces (FSISs) is popularly used for modelling signals, we assume $\mathcal{C}$ consists of FSISs. We will be considering three cases. In the first case, $\mathcal{C}$ consists of FSISs without any assumption on extra invariance. In the second case, we assume $\mathcal{C}$ consists of extra invariant FSISs, and in the third case, we assume $\mathcal{C}$ has translation-invariant FSISs. In all three cases, we prove the existence of an optimal space.</description>

      <title>Cram\'er--Rao Inequalities for Several Generalized Fisher Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The de Bruijn identity states that Fisher information is the half of the derivative of Shannon differential entropy along heat flow. In the same spirit, in this paper we introduce a generalized version of Fisher information, named as the R\'enyi--Fisher information, which is the half of the derivative of R\'enyi information along heat flow. Based on this R\'enyi--Fisher information, we establish sharp R\'enyi-entropic isoperimetric inequalities, which generalize the classic entropic isoperimetric inequality to the R\'enyi setting. Utilizing these isoperimetric inequalities, we extend the classical Cram\'er--Rao inequality from Fisher information to R\'enyi--Fisher information. Lastly, we use these generalized Cram\'er--Rao inequalities to determine the signs of derivatives of entropy along heat flow, strengthening existing results on the complete monotonicity of entropy.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the hyperbolic decomposition of the Dirichlet norm and distance between autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models. Beginning with the K\"ahler information geometry of linear systems in the Hardy space and weighted Hardy spaces, we demonstrate that the Dirichlet norm and distance of ARMA models, corresponding to the mutual information between the past and future, are decomposed into functions of the hyperbolic distance between the poles and zeros of the ARMA models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a novel source coding strategy for sampling and monitoring of a Wiener process. For the encoding process, we employ a four level ``quantization'' scheme, which employs monotone function thresholds as opposed to fixed constant thresholds. Leveraging the hitting times of the Wiener process with these thresholds, we devise a sampling and encoding strategy which does not incur any quantization errors. We give analytical expressions for the mean squared error (MSE) and find the optimal source code lengths to minimize the MSE under this monotone function threshold scheme, subject to a sampling rate constraint.</description>

      <title>Over-the-Air Edge Inference via End-to-End Metasurfaces-Integrated Artificial Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the Edge Inference (EI) paradigm, where a Deep Neural Network (DNN) is split across the transceivers to wirelessly communicate goal-defined features in solving a computational task, the wireless medium has been commonly treated as a source of noise. In this paper, motivated by the emerging technologies of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) and Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces (SIM) that offer programmable propagation of wireless signals, either through controllable reflections or diffractions, we optimize the RIS/SIM-enabled smart wireless environment as a means of over-the-air computing, resembling the operations of DNN layers. We propose a framework of Metasurfaces-Integrated Neural Networks (MINNs) for EI, presenting its modeling, training through a backpropagation variation for fading channels, and deployment aspects. The overall end-to-end DNN architecture is general enough to admit RIS and SIM devices, through controllable reconfiguration before each transmission or fixed configurations after training, while both channel-aware and channel-agnostic transceivers are considered. Our numerical evaluation showcases metasurfaces to be instrumental in performing image classification under link budgets that impede conventional communications or metasurface-free systems. It is demonstrated that our MINN framework can significantly simplify EI requirements, achieving near-optimal performance with $50~$dB lower testing signal-to-noise ratio compared to training, even without transceiver channel knowledge.</description>

      <title>Denoising guarantees for optimized sampling schemes in compressed sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compressed sensing with subsampled unitary matrices benefits from \emph{optimized} sampling schemes, which feature improved theoretical guarantees and empirical performance relative to uniform subsampling. We provide, in a first of its kind in compressed sensing, theoretical guarantees showing that the error caused by the measurement noise vanishes with an increasing number of measurements for optimized sampling schemes, assuming that the noise is Gaussian. We moreover provide similar guarantees for measurements sampled with-replacement with arbitrary probability weights. All our results hold on prior sets contained in a union of low-dimensional subspaces. Finally, we demonstrate that this denoising behavior appears in empirical experiments with a rate that closely matches our theoretical guarantees when the prior set is the range of a generative ReLU neural network and when it is the set of sparse vectors.</description>

      <title>Deep Graph Reinforcement Learning for UAV-Enabled Multi-User Secure Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with flexible mobility are envisioned to enhance physical layer security in wireless communications, the efficient security design that adapts to such high network dynamics is rather challenging. The conventional approaches extended from optimization perspectives are usually quite involved, especially when jointly considering factors in different scales such as deployment and transmission in UAV-related scenarios. In this paper, we address the UAV-enabled multi-user secure communications by proposing a deep graph reinforcement learning framework. Specifically, we reinterpret the security beamforming as a graph neural network (GNN) learning task, where mutual interference among users is managed through the message-passing mechanism. Then, the UAV deployment is obtained through soft actor-critic reinforcement learning, where the GNN-based security beamforming is exploited to guide the deployment strategy update. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves near-optimal security performance and significantly enhances the efficiency of strategy determination. Moreover, the deep graph reinforcement learning framework offers a scalable solution, adaptable to various network scenarios and configurations, establishing a robust basis for information security in UAV-enabled communications.</description>

      <title>Semidefinite lower bounds for covering codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $K_q(n,r)$ denote the minimum size of a $q$-ary covering code of word length $n$ and covering radius $r$. In other words, $K_q(n,r)$ is the minimum size of a set of $q$-ary codewords of length $n$ such that the Hamming balls of radius $r$ around the codewords cover the Hamming space $\{0,\ldots,q-1\}^n$. The special case $K_3(n,1)$ is often referred to as the football pool problem, as it is equivalent to finding a set of forecasts on $n$ football matches that is guaranteed to contain a forecast with at most one wrong outcome.
  In this paper, we build and expand upon the work of Gijswijt (2005), who introduced a semidefinite programming lower bound on $K_q(n,r)$ via matrix cuts. We develop techniques that strengthen this bound, by introducing new semidefinite constraints inspired by Lasserre's hierarchy for 0-1 programs and symmetry reduction methods, and a more powerful objective function. The techniques lead to sharper lower bounds, setting new records across a broad range of values of $q$, $n$, and $r$.</description>

      <title>Affine Phase Retrieval via Second-Order Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.11001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the affine phase retrieval problem, which aims to recover signals from the magnitudes of affine measurements. We develop second-order optimization methods based on Newton and Gauss-Newton iterations and establish that, under specific a priori conditions, the problem exhibits strong convexity. Theoretically, we prove that the Newton method with resampling achieves global quadratic convergence in the noiseless setting for both Gaussian measurements and admissible coded diffraction patterns (CDPs). Furthermore, we demonstrate that the same theoretical framework naturally extends to the Gauss-Newton method, implying its quadratic convergence. To validate our theoretical findings, we conduct extensive numerical experiments. The results confirm the quadratic convergence of second-order methods, while their computational efficiency remains comparable to that of first-order methods. Additionally, our experiments demonstrate that second-order methods achieve exact recovery with relatively few measurements, highlighting their practical feasibility and robustness.</description>

      <title>Measuring Discrete Sensing Capability for ISAC via Task Mutual Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09497v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 6G technology offers a broader range of possibilities for communication systems to perform ubiquitous sensing tasks, including health monitoring, object recognition, and autonomous driving. Since even minor environmental changes can significantly degrade system performance, and conducting long-term posterior experimental evaluations in all scenarios is often infeasible, it is crucial to perform a priori performance assessments to design robust and reliable systems. In this paper, we consider a discrete ubiquitous sensing system where the sensing target has \(m\) different states \(W\), which can be characterized by \(n\)-dimensional independent features \(X^n\). This model not only provides the possibility of optimizing the sensing systems at a finer granularity and balancing communication and sensing resources, but also provides theoretical explanations for classical intuitive feelings (like more modalities and more accuracy) in wireless sensing. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed channel model through real-case studies, including person identification, displacement detection, direction estimation, and device recognition. The evaluation results indicate a Pearson correlation coefficient exceeding 0.9 between our task mutual information and conventional experimental metrics (e.g., accuracy).

      <title>Polarization Aware Movable Antenna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a polarization-aware movable antenna (PAMA) framework that integrates polarization effects into the design and optimization of movable antennas (MAs). While MAs have proven effective at boosting wireless communication performance, existing studies primarily focus on phase variations caused by different propagation paths and leverage antenna movements to maximize channel gains. This narrow focus limits the full potential of MAs. In this work, we introduce a polarization-aware channel model rooted in electromagnetic theory, unveiling a defining advantage of MAs over other wireless technologies such as precoding: the ability to optimize polarization matching. This new understanding enables PAMA to extend the applicability of MAs beyond radio-frequency, multipath-rich scenarios to higher-frequency bands, such as mmWave, even with a single line-of-sight (LOS) path. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating polarization considerations into MAs significantly enhances efficiency, link reliability, and data throughput, paving the way for more robust and efficient future wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation for Pinching-Antenna Systems (PASS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13268v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pinching Antennas (PAs) represent a revolutionary flexible antenna technology that leverages dielectric waveguides and electromagnetic coupling to mitigate large-scale path loss. This letter is the first to explore channel estimation for Pinching-Antenna SyStems (PASS), addressing their uniquely ill-conditioned and underdetermined channel characteristics. In particular, two efficient deep learning-based channel estimators are proposed. 1) PAMoE: This estimator incorporates dynamic padding, feature embedding, fusion, and mixture of experts (MoE) modules, which effectively leverage the positional information of PAs and exploit expert diversity. 2) PAformer: This Transformer-style estimator employs the self-attention mechanism to predict channel coefficients in a per-antenna manner, which offers more flexibility to adaptively deal with dynamic numbers of PAs in practical deployment. Numerical results demonstrate that 1) the proposed deep learning-based channel estimators outperform conventional methods and exhibit excellent zero-shot learning capabilities, and 2) PAMoE delivers higher channel estimation accuracy via MoE specialization, while PAformer natively handles an arbitrary number of PAs, trading self-attention complexity for superior scalability.</description>

      <title>Limits to Analog Reservoir Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14474v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reservoir computation is a recurrent framework for learning and predicting time series data, that benefits from extremely simple training and interpretability, often as the the dynamics of a physical system. In this paper, we will study the impact of noise on the learning capabilities of analog reservoir computers. Recent work on reservoir computation has shown that the information processing capacity (IPC) is a useful metric for quantifying the degradation of the performance due to noise. We further this analysis and demonstrate that this degradation of the IPC limits the possible features that can be meaningfully constructed in an analog reservoir computing setting. We borrow a result from quantum complexity theory that relates the circuit model of computation to a continuous time model, and demonstrate an exponential reduction in the accessible volume of reservoir configurations. We conclude by relating this degradation in the IPC to the fat-shattering dimension of a family of functions describing the reservoir dynamics, which allows us to express our result in terms of a classification task. We conclude that any physical, analog reservoir computer that is exposed to noise can only be used to perform a polynomial amount of learning, despite the exponentially large latent space, even with an exponential amount of post-processing.</description>

      <title>Path Assignment in Mesh Networks at the Edge of Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a mesh network at the edge of a wireless network that connects users to the core network via multiple base stations. For this scenario, we present a novel tree-search-based algorithm that strives to identify effective communication path to the core network for each user by maximizing the signal-to-noise-plus-interference ratio (SNIR) along the chosen path. We show that, for three mesh networks of varying sizes, our algorithm selects paths with minimum SNIR values that are 3 dB to 18 dB higher than those obtained through an algorithm that disregards interference within the network, 16 dB to 20 dB higher than those chosen randomly by a random path selection algorithm, and 0.5 dB to 7 dB higher compared to a recently introduced genetic algorithm (GA). Furthermore, we demonstrate that our algorithm has lower computational complexity compared to the GA in networks where its performance is within 2 dB of ours.</description>
