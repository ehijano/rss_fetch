      <title>Global stability of epidemic models with uniform susceptibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transmission dynamics of infectious diseases are often studied using compartmental mathematical models, which are commonly represented as systems of autonomous ordinary differential equations. A key step in the analysis of such models is to identify equilibria and find conditions for their stability. Local stability analysis reduces to a problem in linear algebra, but there is no general algorithm for establishing global stability properties. Substantial progress on global stability of epidemic models has been made in the last 20 years, primarily by successfully applying Lyapunov's method to specific systems. Here, we show that any compartmental epidemic model in which susceptible individuals cannot be distinguished and can be infected only once, has a globally asymptotically stable (GAS) equilibrium. If the basic reproduction number ${R}_0$ satisfies ${R}_0 &gt; 1$, then the GAS fixed point is an endemic equilibrium (i.e., constant, positive disease prevalence). Alternatively, if ${R}_0 \le 1$, then the GAS equilibrium is disease-free. This theorem subsumes a large number of results published over the last century, strengthens most of them by establishing global rather than local stability, avoids the need for any stability analyses of these systems in the future, and settles the question of whether co-existing stable solutions or non-equilibrium attractors are possible in such models: they are not.</description>

      <title>Heuristic model on the origin of the homochirality of life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Life demonstrates remarkable homochirality of its major building blocks: nucleic acids, amino acids, sugars, and phospholipids. We propose a new model that places the root of the life homochirality in the formation of protocellular bilayer vesicles (liposomes). These liposomes are formed at the water/air interface from Langmuir layers and contain ribose, which is known to be delivered by carbonaceous meteorites; hence, the model suggests that impact craters are likely loci of life origin. The ribose delivered by meteorites appeared as racemic, yet life is based on D-ribose and its derivatives. The high membrane permeability to D-ribose implies a strong interaction with the charged phosphate head groups of the bilayer membrane. Such interaction, along with the presence of Fe3+, leads to ribose phosphorylation, forming ribose-5-phosphate, a molecule that cannot cross the membrane. As a result, the D-ribose-5-phosphate formed inside the vesicle becomes trapped and cannot escape. Over time, the phosphorylated D-ribose accumulates inside vesicles, forming a population of D-ribose-5-phosphate vesicles. Following the selective accumulation of phosphorylated D-ribose, D-oxyribose-5-phosphate forms, facilitating the transition of entrapped D-ribose-5-phosphate molecules into complex functional molecules, such as ribozymes/RNA, and over time, into DNA. The proposed model can be tested experimentally.</description>

      <title>Mixed birth-death and death-birth updating in structured populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolutionary graph theory (EGT) studies the effect of population structure on evolutionary dynamics. The vertices of the graph represent the $N$ individuals. The edges denote interactions for competitive replacement. Two standard update rules are death-Birth (dB) and Birth-death (Bd). Under dB, an individual is chosen uniformly at random to die, and its neighbors compete to fill the vacancy proportional to their fitness. Under Bd, an individual is chosen for reproduction proportional to fitness, and its offspring replaces a randomly chosen neighbor. Here we study mixed updating between those two scenarios. In each time step, with probability $\delta$ the update is dB and with remaining probability it is Bd. We study fixation probabilities and times as functions of $\delta$ under constant selection. Despite the fact that fixation probabilities and times can be increasing, decreasing, or non-monotonic in $\delta$, we prove nearly all unweighted undirected graphs have short fixation times and provide an efficient algorithm to estimate their fixation probabilities. We also prove that weighted directed graphs that are uniform circulations have fixation probability $1/N$ for every $\delta$. Finally, we prove exact formulas for fixation probabilities on cycles, stars, and more complex structures and classify their sensitivities to $\delta$.</description>

      <title>Optimal Protected Area Design for Allee Effect Mitigation in Spatial Predator-Prey Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Endangered populations often experience limited growth ability at low densities, a phenomenon described by the Allee effect. In this thesis, we investigate a predator-prey model incorporating the Allee effect within a two-dimensional nonlinear reaction-diffusion framework, with the aim of understanding how local spatial refuges can promote the persistence of low-density populations by enabling them to surpass recovery thresholds. We first simulate an extinction-prone scenario in which initial densities fall below the Allee threshold, demonstrating that most populations tend toward extinction. We then introduce protected areas together with positive growth terms to facilitate survival. To assess the role of diffusion-reaction dynamics, we construct an objective function based on the shape and location of protected areas, and employ a bi-objective optimization approach. Our results reveal that as the weights of the objective function vary, the optimal protectedarea configuration shifts between fragmented and contiguous patterns. We begin with a single-species prey analysis and subsequently extend the model to include predators, where we use mathematical analysis to investigate the steady states of the two-species system.</description>

      <title>Stability and bifurcations of a minimal model for the effect of PrEP-related risk compensation in epidemics of sexually transmitted infections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) drastically reduces the risk of HIV infection if taken as prescribed, providing almost perfect protection even during unprotected sexual intercourse. Although this has been transformative in reducing new HIV infections among high-risk populations, it has also been linked to an increase in risk practices -- a phenomenon known as risk compensation -- thereby favoring the spread of other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) deemed less severe. In this paper, we study a minimal compartmental model describing the effect of risk awareness and risk compensation due to PrEP on the spread of other STIs among a high-infection-risk group of men who have sex with men (MSM). The model integrates three key elements of risk-mediated behavior and PrEP programs: (i) HIV risk awareness drives self-protective behaviors (such as condom use and voluntary STI screening); (ii) individuals on PrEP are subject to risk compensation, but (iii) are required to screen for asymptomatic STIs frequently. We derived the basic reproduction number of the system, $R_0$, and found a transcritical bifurcation at $R_0=1$, where the disease-free equilibrium becomes unstable and an endemic equilibrium emerges. This endemic equilibrium is asymptotically stable wherever it exists. We identified critical thresholds in behavioral and policy parameters that separate these regimes and analyzed typical values for plausible parameter choices. Beyond the specific epidemiological context, the model serves as a general framework for studying nonlinear interactions between behavioral adaptation, preventive interventions, and disease dynamics, providing insights into how feedback mechanisms can lead to non-trivial responses in epidemic systems. Finally, our model can be easily extended to study the effect of interventions and risk compensation in other STIs.</description>

      <title>Optimizing infectious disease mitigation under dynamic conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mitigation measures are essential for controlling the spread of infectious diseases during pandemics and epidemics, but they impose considerable societal, individual, and economic costs. We developed a general optimization framework to balance costs related to infection and to mitigation. Optimizing the trade-off between mitigation and infection cost, we identified three novel, surprising effects: First, assuming a constant reproduction number $R_0$, the optimal response to an infectious disease requires either strict mitigation or none at all, depending on disease severity, but never does one find an intermediate mitigation level to be optimal. Second, under seasonal variations, optimal mitigation is stricter during winter. Interestingly, a single wave of infections still arises in spring with 3 months delay to the seasonal peak of infectivity, replacing the autumn/winter waves known for classical influenza. Third, during steady vaccination campaigns, even optimal mitigation can result in transient infection waves. Finally, we quantify the cost of delayed mitigation onset and show that even short delays can substantially increase total costs -- if the disease is severe. Overall, our framework is easily applicable to general and complex settings and thereby presents a versatile tool to explore optimal mitigation strategies for endemic and pandemic infectious disease.</description>

      <title>Algorithms for Reconstructing B Cell Lineages in the Presence of Context-Dependent Somatic Hypermutation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a method for approximating posterior probabilities of phylogenetic trees and reconstructing ancestral sequences under models of sequence evolution with site-dependence, where standard phylogenetic likelihood computations (pruning) fail. Our approach uses a combined data-augmentation and importance sampling scheme. A key advantage of our approach is the ability to leverage existing highly optimized phylogenetic software. We apply our approach to the reconstruction of B cell receptor affinity maturation lineages from high-throughput repertoire sequencing data and evaluate the impact of incorporating site-dependence on the reconstruction accuracy of both trees and ancestral sequences. We show that accounting for context-dependence during inference always improves the estimates of both ancestral sequences and lineage trees on simulated datasets. We also examine the impact of incorporating priors based on VDJ recombination models, and find that they significantly improve ancestral sequence reconstruction in germline-encoded regions, but increase errors in non-templated nucleotides. We propose a modified, piecewise prior to address this demonstrate that it improves empirical reconstruction accuracy. We apply our approach to the analysis of the HIV broadly neutralizing antibodies DH270 and CH235 which are important targets of current vaccine design efforts.</description>

Abstract: Agave villalobosii sp. nov. (sect. Ditepalae, Agavaceae, Asparagales) from the Mexican central plain in Aguascalientes and southern Zacatecas, Mexico, is described and illustrated. It resembles A. flexispina in terms of color and the general appearance of its rosettes. However, it differs from the latter in having fewer leaves with more widely spaced teeth, more compact and shorter panicles with more inclined lateral branches with respect to the horizontal plane, and subglobose to broadly ellipsoid capsules. A distribution map for both species is provided. The species was preliminary assessed as critically endangered.</description>

Abstract: This paper provides global attractivity results for the interior equilibrium point of a general Lotka-Volterra system with no restriction on the dimension of the system and with no special structure or properties of the interaction matrix. The main result contains as special cases all known general results, including the Volterra-Lyapunov theorem and the recently proposed eigenvector conditions. Moreover, global attractivity of the interior equilibrium point is shown for a three-dimensional example, where none of the existing general results can be applied.</description>

      <title>Approaches to biological species delimitation based on genetic and spatial dissimilarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12126v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The delimitation of biological species, i.e., deciding which individuals belong to the same species and whether and how many different species are represented in a data set, is key to the conservation of biodiversity. Much existing work uses only genetic data for species delimitation, often employing some kind of cluster analysis. This can be misleading, because geographically distant groups of individuals can be genetically quite different even if they belong to the same species. We investigate the problem of testing whether two potentially separated groups of individuals can belong to a single species or not based on genetic and spatial data. Existing methods such as the partial Mantel test and jackknife-based distance-distance regression are considered. New approaches, i.e., an adaptation of a mixed effects model, a bootstrap approach, and a jackknife version of partial Mantel, are proposed. All these methods address the issue that distance data violate the independence assumption for standard inference regarding correlation and regression; a standard linear regression is also considered. The approaches are compared on simulated meta-populations generated with SLiM and GSpace - two software packages that can simulate spatially-explicit genetic data at an individual level. Simulations show that the new jackknife version of the partial Mantel test provides a good compromise between power and respecting the nominal type I error rate. Mixed-effects models have larger power than jackknife-based methods, but tend to display type I error rates slightly above the significance level. An application on brassy ringlets concludes the paper.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of memory B cells and plasmablasts in healthy individuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our adaptive immune system relies on the persistence over long times of a diverse set of antigen-experienced B cells to encode our memories of past infections and to protect us against future ones. While longitudinal repertoire sequencing promises to track the long-term dynamics of many B cell clones simultaneously, sampling and experimental noise make it hard to draw reliable quantitative conclusions. Leveraging statistical inference, we infer the dynamics of memory B cell clonal dynamics and conversion to plasmablasts, which includes clone creation, degradation, abundance fluctuations, and differentiation. We find that memory B cell clones degrade slowly, with a half-life of 10 years. Based on the inferred parameters, we predict that it takes about 50 years to renew 50\% of the repertoire, with most observed clones surviving for a lifetime. We infer that, on average, 1 out of 100 memory B cells differentiates into a plasmablast each year, more than expected from purely antigen-stimulated differentiation, and that plasmablast clones degrade with a half-life of about one year in the absence of memory imports. Our method is general and could be applied to other longitudinal repertoire sequencing B cell subsets.</description>

      <title>A piecewise deterministic model for a prey-predator community</title>

      <description>arXiv:1503.02492v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We are interested in prey-predator communities where the predator population evolves much faster than the prey's (e.g. insect-tree communities). We introduce a piecewise deterministic model for these prey-predator communities that arises as a limit of a microscopic model when the number of predators goes to infinity. We prove that the process has a unique invariant probability measure and that it is exponentially ergodic. Further on, we rescale the predator dynamics in order to model predators of smaller size. This slow-fast system converges to a community process in which the prey dynamics is averaged on the predator equilibria. This averaged process admits an invariant probability measure which can be computed explicitly. We use numerical simulations to study the convergence of the invariant probability measures of the rescaled processes.</description>

      <title>Genetic contribution of advantaged ancestors in the biparental Moran model -- finite selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a population of $N$ individuals evolving according to a biparental Moran model with two types, one being advantaged compared to the other. The advantage is conferred by a Mendelian mutation, that reduces the death probability of individuals carrying it. We assume that a proportion $a$ of individuals initially carry this mutation, which therefore eventually gets fixed with high probability. After a long time, we sample a gene uniformly from the population, at a new locus, independent of the locus under selection, and calculate the probability that this gene originated from one of the initially advantaged individuals, when the population size is large. Our theorem provides quantitative insights, such as the observation that under strong viability selection, if only $1\%$ of the individuals are initially advantaged, up to $19\%$ of the population's genome will originate from them after a long time.</description>

      <title>Towards smart canopies: Algorithmic design of maize canopy architectures that maximize light use efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a computational framework that integrates functional-structural plant modeling (FSPM) with an evolutionary algorithm to optimize three-dimensional maize canopy architecture for enhanced light interception under high-density planting. The optimization revealed an emergent ideotype characterized by two distinct strategies: a vertically stratified leaf profile (steep, narrow upper leaves for penetration; broad, horizontal lower leaves for capture) and a radially tiled azimuthal arrangement that breaks the conventional distichous symmetry of maize to minimize self and mutual shading. Reverse ray-tracing simulations show that this architecture intercepts significantly more photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) than virtual canopies parameterized from high-performing field hybrids, with gains that generalize across multiple U.S. latitudes and planting densities. The optimized trait combinations align with characteristics of modern density-tolerant cultivars, supporting biological plausibility. Because recent gene editing advances enable more independent control of architectural traits, the designs identified here are increasingly feasible. By uncovering effective, non-intuitive trait configurations, our approach provides a scalable, predictive tool to guide breeding targets, improve light-use efficiency, and ultimately support sustainable yield gains.</description>

Abstract: We present an algorithm for computing evolutionarily stable strategies (ESSs) in symmetric perfect-recall extensive-form games of imperfect information. Our main algorithm is for two-player games, and we describe how it can be extended to multiplayer games. The algorithm is sound and computes all ESSs in nondegenerate games and a subset of them in degenerate games which contain an infinite continuum of symmetric Nash equilibria. The algorithm is anytime and can be stopped early to find one or more ESSs. We experiment on an imperfect-information cancer signaling game as well as random games to demonstrate scalability.</description>
