      <title>Flow Annealed Importance Sampling Bootstrap meets Differentiable Particle Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-energy physics requires the generation of large numbers of simulated data samples from complex but analytically tractable distributions called matrix elements. Surrogate models, such as normalizing flows, are gaining popularity for this task due to their computational efficiency. We adopt an approach based on Flow Annealed importance sampling Bootstrap (FAB) that evaluates the differentiable target density during training and helps avoid the costly generation of training data in advance. We show that FAB reaches higher sampling efficiency with fewer target evaluations in high dimensions in comparison to other methods.</description>

      <title>Physics-based linear regression for high-dimensional forward uncertainty quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce linear regression using physics-based basis functions optimized through the geometry of an inner product space. This method addresses the challenge of surrogate modeling with high-dimensional input, as the physics-based basis functions encode problem-specific information. We demonstrate the method using a proof-of-concept nonlinear random vibration example.</description>

      <title>Description length of canonical and microcanonical models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05645v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The (non-)equivalence of canonical and microcanonical ensembles is a central concept in statistical physics. Non-equivalence has recently been established in models with an extensive number of constraints, common, e.g., in network science, via a non-vanishing difference in relative entropy, corresponding to higher microcanonical log-likelihood per node. However, from a model selection perspective, comparing canonical and microcanonical models requires consideration of both log-likelihood and complexity. To compare both terms under the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle, we compute the Normalized Maximum Likelihood (NML) of binary canonical and microcanonical models, finding that (i) microcanonical models, though higher in likelihood, are always more complex, making the choice of model non-trivial. (ii) The optimal model choice depends on the empirical values of the constraints: the canonical model performs best when its fit to observed data exceeds its uniform average fit across all data. (iii) Notably, in the thermodynamic limit the difference in description length per node vanishes for the equivalent models considered but persists otherwise, showing that non-equivalence implies extensive differences between large canonical and microcanonical models. Finally, we compare the NML approach to Bayesian methods, showing that (iv) the choice of priors, while practically uninfluential in equivalent models, becomes crucial when an extensive number of constraints is enforced, possibly leading to very different outcomes.</description>

      <title>Interpretable machine learning approach for electron antineutrino selection in a large liquid scintillator detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12901v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several neutrino detectors, KamLAND, Daya Bay, Double Chooz, RENO, and the forthcoming large-scale JUNO, rely on liquid scintillator to detect reactor antineutrino interactions. In this context, inverse beta decay represents the golden channel for antineutrino detection, providing a pair of correlated events, thus a strong experimental signature to distinguish the signal from a variety of backgrounds. However, given the low cross-section of antineutrino interactions, the development of a powerful event selection algorithm becomes imperative to achieve effective discrimination between signal and backgrounds. In this study, we introduce a machine learning (ML) model to achieve this goal: a fully connected neural network as a powerful signal-background discriminator for a large liquid scintillator detector. We demonstrate, using the JUNO detector as an example, that, despite the already high efficiency of a cut-based approach, the presented ML model can further improve the overall event selection efficiency. Moreover, it allows for the retention of signal events at the detector edges that would otherwise be rejected because of the overwhelming amount of background events in that region. We also present the first interpretable analysis of the ML approach for event selection in reactor neutrino experiments. This method provides insights into the decision-making process of the model and offers valuable information for improving and updating traditional event selection approaches.</description>

      <title>Statistics for Differential Topological Properties between Data Sets with an Application to Reservoir Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is common for researchers to record long, multiple time series from experiments or calculations. But sometimes there are no good models for the systems or no applicable mathematical theorems that can tell us when there are basic relationships between subsets of the time series data such as continuity, differentiability, embeddings, etc. The data is often higher dimensional and simple plotting will not guide us. At that point fitting the data to polynomials, Fourier series, etc. becomes uncertain. Even at the simplest level, having data that shows there is a function between the data subsets is useful and a negative answer means that more particular data fitting or analysis will be suspect and probably fail. We show here statistics that test time series subsets for basic mathematical properties and relations between them that not only indicate when more specific analyses are safe to do, but whether the systems are operating correctly. We apply these statistics to examples from reservoir computing where an important property of reservoir computers is that the reservoir system establishes an embedding of the drive system in order to make any other calculations with the reservoir computer successful.</description>
