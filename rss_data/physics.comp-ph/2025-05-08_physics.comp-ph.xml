      <title>Enabling Multireference Calculations on Multi-Metallic Systems with Graphic Processing Units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling multimetallic systems efficiently enables faster prediction of desirable chemical properties and design of new materials. This work describes an initial implementation for performing multireference wave function method localized active space self-consistent field (LASSCF) calculations through the use of multiple graphics processing units (GPUs) to accelerate time-to-solution. Density fitting is leveraged to reduce memory requirements, and we demonstrate the ability to fully utilize multi-GPU compute nodes. Performance improvements of 5-10x in total application runtime were observed in LASSCF calculations for multimetallic catalyst systems up to 1200 AOs and an active space of (22e,40o) using up to four NVIDIA A100 GPUs. Written with performance portability in mind, comparable performance is also observed in early runs on the Aurora exascale system using Intel Max Series GPUs.</description>

      <title>EXFOR utility codes (ForEXy) and their application to neutron fission cross section evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed a set of EXFOR utility codes (ForEXy) to process the information of the experimental nuclear reaction data stored in the EXFOR library. We designed a new JSON format (J4) for the EXFOR library, and developed a code converting the information in an EXFOR file to a J4 file (X4TOJ4) and another code converting it to an EXFOR file (J4TOX4) as a core part of this new code package. We also developed some other codes for managements of the EXFOR storage, bibliography and dictionary. As an application of the new code package, we constructed covariance matrices for the fast neutron induced fission cross sections of neptunium-237 in the EXFOR library by using the new codes, and applied them to evaluation of the cross section between 100 keV and 200 MeV.</description>

      <title>Multiphysics Modeling of SNAP 10A/2 Space Reactor with Cardinal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The SNAP 10/A nuclear-powered satellite was launched into space in 1965. The present work discusses the development of a coupled neutronic-thermal hydraulics model with the high-fidelity multiphysics code Cardinal for SNAP 10/A. A comparison of neutronic benchmarks between OpenMC and MCNP5 shows a difference of 304+/-70 pcm. The primary source of difference is that MCNP5 uses a combination of cross-section libraries ENDF/B-VI and ENDF/B-V for minor isotopes. At the same time, the present work utilizes ENDF/B-VIII.0. A comparison against experimental results showed a difference of 355 pcm. A coupled model of the SNAP 10/A reactor is then developed in Cardinal. Temperature results show reasonable agreement with reference calculations.</description>

      <title>Linear Analysis of Stochastic Verlet-Type Integrators for Langevin Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an analytical framework for analyzing the quality of stochastic Verlet-type integrators for simulating the Langevin equation. Focusing only on basic objective measures, we consider the ability of an integrator to correctly simulate characteristic configurational quantities of transport, a) diffusion on a flat surface and b) drift velocity on a tilted planar surface, as well as c) statistical sampling of a harmonic potential. For any stochastic Verlet-type integrator expressed in its configurational form, we develop closed form expressions to directly assess these three most basic quantities as a function of the applied time step. The applicability of the analysis is exemplified through twelve representative integrators developed over the past five decades, and algorithm performance is conveniently visualized through the three characteristic measures for each integrator. The GJ set of integrators stands out as the only option for correctly simulating diffusion, drift, and Boltzmann distribution in linear systems, and we therefore suggest that this general method is best suited for high quality thermodynamic simulations of nonlinear and complex systems, including for relatively high time steps compared to simulations with other integrators.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Equilibration of Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic framework for shortening and automating molecular dynamics equilibration through improved position initialization methods and uncertainty quantification analysis, using the Yukawa one-component plasma as an exemplar system. Our comprehensive evaluation of seven initialization approaches (uniform random, uniform random with rejection, Halton and Sobol sequences, perfect and perturbed lattices, and a Monte Carlo pair distribution method) demonstrates that initialization significantly impacts equilibration efficiency, with microfield distribution analysis providing diagnostic insights into thermal behaviors. Our results establish that initialization method selection is relatively inconsequential at low coupling strengths, while physics-informed methods demonstrate superior performance at high coupling strengths, reducing equilibration time. We establish direct relationships between temperature stability and uncertainties in transport properties (diffusion coefficient and viscosity), comparing thermostating protocols including ON-OFF versus OFF-ON duty cycles, Berendsen versus Langevin thermostats, and thermostat coupling strengths. Our findings demonstrate that weaker thermostat coupling generally requires fewer equilibration cycles, and OFF-ON thermostating sequences outperform ON-OFF approaches for most initialization methods. The methodology implements temperature forecasting as a quantitative metric for system thermalization, enabling users to determine equilibration adequacy based on specified uncertainty tolerances in desired output properties, thus transforming equilibration from a heuristic process to a rigorously quantifiable procedure with clear termination criteria.</description>

      <title>Is the end of Insight in Sight ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that the weight matrices of a Physics-informed neural network (PINN)-based deep learning application to a rarefied gas dynamics problem described by the Boltzmann equation bear no evident link to the mathematical structure of the physical problem. Instead, the weights appear close to Gaussian distributed random matrices. Although significantly more work is needed to support a robust assessment in this direction, these results suggest that deep-learning and the numerical solution of the Boltzmann equation represent two equivalent, but largely distinct paths to the same physical knowledge. If so, Explainable AI might be an unrealistic target and possibly even an ill-posed one.</description>

      <title>Space-Time Elastic Metamaterials for Zero-Frequency and Zero-Wavenumber Bandgaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We create wave-matter space-time metamaterials using optical trapping forces to manipulate mass-spring chains and create zero-frequency and zero-wavenumber band gaps: the bosonic nature of phonons, and hence this elastodynamic setting, traditionally prohibits either zero-frequency or zero-wavenumber band gaps. Here, we generate zero-frequency gaps using optomechanical interactions within a 3D mass-spring chain by applying an optical trapping force to hold or manipulate a mass in a contactless manner independent of its elastodynamic excitations. Through careful modification of the geometrical parameters in the trapped monoatomic mass-spring chain, we demonstrate the existence of a zero-frequency gap generated by the optical forces on the masses. The precise control we have over the system allows us to drive another set of masses and springs out of phase with its traveling wave thereby creating a zero-wavenumber band gap.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Infectious Disease Intervention Measures Based on Reinforcement Learning -- Empirical analysis based on UK COVID-19 epidemic data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Globally, the outbreaks of infectious diseases have exerted an extremely profound and severe influence on health security and the economy. During the critical phases of epidemics, devising effective intervention measures poses a significant challenge to both the academic and practical arenas. There is numerous research based on reinforcement learning to optimize intervention measures of infectious diseases. Nevertheless, most of these efforts have been confined within the differential equation based on infectious disease models. Although a limited number of studies have incorporated reinforcement learning methodologies into individual-based infectious disease models, the models employed therein have entailed simplifications and limitations, rendering it incapable of modeling the complexity and dynamics inherent in infectious disease transmission. We establish a decision-making framework based on an individual agent-based transmission model, utilizing reinforcement learning to continuously explore and develop a strategy function. The framework's validity is verified through both experimental and theoretical approaches. Covasim, a detailed and widely used agent-based disease transmission model, was modified to support reinforcement learning research. We conduct an exhaustive exploration of the application efficacy of multiple algorithms across diverse action spaces. Furthermore, we conduct an innovative preliminary theoretical analysis concerning the issue of "time coverage". The results of the experiment robustly validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the methodological framework of this study. The coping strategies gleaned therefrom prove highly efficacious in suppressing the expansion of the epidemic scale and safeguarding the stability of the economic system, thereby providing crucial reference perspectives for the formulation of global public health security strategies.</description>

      <title>Spatial-Wavelength Multiplexing Reliable Photonic Integrated General-Purpose Analog Computing System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the "post-Moore era", the growing challenges in traditional computing have driven renewed interest in analog computing, leading to various proposals for the development of general-purpose analog computing (GPAC) systems. In this work, we present a GPAC prototype featuring a silicon photonic chip designed for fully optical analog computation. This system leverages on-chip multi-channel architectures to enable parallel processing and utilizes wavelength-division multiplexing to significantly enhance computational capacity. In addition, we have developed an error-correction algorithm to monitor processing operations in real time, ensuring the reliability of computational results. Experimentally, we demonstrate the system's capability to solve ordinary differential equations and its applications in communications, microwave photonics, and image processing. The chip's energy efficiency is evaluated to reach up to 227 tera-operations per second per watt. Through this research, we provide a novel hardware framework and innovative directions for analog photonic computing.</description>

      <title>Neural-network-based longitudinal electric field prediction in nonlinear plasma wakefield accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasma wakefield acceleration holds remarkable promise for future advanced accelerators. The design and optimization of plasma-based accelerators typically require particle-in-cell simulations, which can be computationally intensive and time consuming. In this study, we train a neural network model to obtain the on-axis longitudinal electric field distribution directly without conducting particle-in-cell simulations for designing a two-bunch plasma wakefield acceleration stage. By combining the neural network model with an advanced algorithm for achieving the minimal energy spread, the optimal normalized charge per unit length of a trailing beam leading to the optimal beam-loading can be quickly identified. This approach can reduce computation time from around 7.6 minutes in the case of using particle-in-cell simulations to under 0.1 seconds. Moreover, the longitudinal electric field distribution under the optimal beam-loading can be visually observed. Utilizing this model with the beam current profile also enables the direct extraction of design parameters under the optimal beam-loading, including the maximum decelerating electric field within the drive beam, the average accelerating electric field within the trailing beam and the transformer ratio. This model has the potential to significantly improve the efficiency of designing and optimizing the beam-driven plasma wakefield accelerators.</description>

      <title>Critical Behavior Analysis of Pure Dipolar Triangular Lattice via Equilibrium and Non-Equilibrium Monte Carlo Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic thin films and 2D arrays of magnetic nanoparticles exhibit unique physical properties that make them valuable for a wide range of technological applications. In such systems, dipolar interactions play a crucial role in determining their physical behavior. However, due to the anisotropic and long-range nature of dipolar interactions, conventional Monte Carlo (MC) methods face challenges in investigating these systems near criticality. In this study, we examine the critical behavior of a triangular lattice of dipoles using the optimized Tomita MC algorithm tailored for dipolar interactions. We employ two independent computational approaches to estimate the critical temperature and exponents: equilibrium MC simulations with histogram reweighting and the non-equilibrium relaxation method. Notably, both approaches demonstrate that the critical exponents are very close to those of the 2D Ising universality class.</description>

      <title>MuAPBEK: An Improved Analytical Kinetic Energy Density Functional for Quantum Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Orbital-free density functional theory (OFDFT) offers a true realization of the Hohenberg-Kohn theorems, enabling full quantum-mechanical studies of electronic systems based solely on electron densities. However, OFDFT remains limited by the difficulty of formulating accurate kinetic-energy density functionals. In this paper, we substantially enhance the accuracy of OFDFT energies and densities by tuning, during density initialization, the parameter $\mu$ of the APBEK functional, which arises in the second-order gradient expansion of the kinetic energy for semiclassical neutral atoms. We augment this parameterized APBEK functional with two physically-motivated, non-empirical corrections derived from Kato's cusp condition and the virial theorem. The resulting functional, which we call MuAPBEK, is benchmarked against Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KSDFT) on atoms, organic molecules from the QM9 dataset, and the anti-malarial drug artemisinin. MuAPBEK achieves much lower energy errors than standard APBEK and Thomas-Fermi-von-Weizsacker functionals, even when the latter two are evaluated on converged KSDFT densities. Its mean absolute energy errors on atoms and molecules are 161 and 122 kcal/mol, respectively, indicating that MuAPBEK's errors do not scale with system size. MuAPBEK also yields accurate densities, with a mean integrated absolute density error of 1.8 electrons for molecules. Importantly, one step of our density optimization scheme is at least ten times faster than a single KSDFT self-consistent field cycle and exhibits a lower-order computational time complexity of $O(N^{1.96})$ with respect to system size, $N$. Our results indicate that highly-accurate OFDFT for large-scale quantum simulations beyond the practical limits of KSDFT is within reach.</description>

      <title>Self-passivation reduces the Fermi level pinning in the metal-semiconductor contacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The metal-induced gap states (MIGS) are commonly believed to cause the strong Femi level pinning (FLP) in the metal-semiconductors contacts. Here, we unravel unambiguously that the dangling bonds-induced interface states play a crucial role, even comparable with MIGS. The first-principles calculations show that metal-Ge and metal-Si contacts should possess a similar FLP strength if they adopt an identical interface bonding configuration: the reconstructed bonding configuration renders Si and Ge having pinning factors of 0.16 and 0.11, respectively, and the ideal non-reconstructed bonding configuration gives them pinning factors of 0.05 and 0, respectively. We illustrate that Si favors the reconstructed bonding configuration, and Ge favors the ideal non-reconstructed bonding configuration after metal deposition. The self-passivation of the dangling bonds substantially reduces the interface gap states to give a much weaker FLP in the metal-Si contacts than in the metal-Ge contacts. We also demonstrate that the full passivation of the interface dangling bonds can further increase the pinning factor to 0.5 by further reducing the interface gap states. These findings shed new light on alleviating the Femi level pinning to lower the contact resistance for Si and emerging materials towards advanced semiconductor technology.</description>

      <title>N\'eel vector-dependent anomalous transport in altermagnetic metal CrSb</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12882v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets are predicted to exhibit anomalous transport phenomena, such as the anomalous Hall and Nernst effects, as observed in ferromagnets but with a vanishing net magnetic moment, akin to antiferromagnets. Despite their potential, progress has been limited due to the scarcity of metallic altermagnets. Motivated by the recent discovery of the altermagnetic metal CrSb, we conducted a systematic study of its electrical and thermoelectric transport properties, using first-principles calculations. CrSb exhibits low magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy, enabling the manipulation of the N\'eel vector in CrSb films through a suitable ferromagnetic substrate. The anomalous Hall and Nernst conductivities reach their maximum when the N\'eel vector is aligned along $\frac{1}{2}$\textbf{\textit{a}}+\textbf{\textit{b}}. The origins of both conductivities were analyzed in terms of Berry curvature distribution. Our results demonstrate that CrSb provides a good platform for investigating the N\'eel vector-dependent anomalous transport in altermagnetic metals.</description>

Abstract: This paper proposes a probabilistic model of subspaces based on the probabilistic principal component analysis (PCA). Given a sample of vectors in the embedding space -- commonly known as a snapshot matrix -- this method uses quantities derived from the probabilistic PCA to construct distributions of the sample matrix, as well as the principal subspaces. It is applicable to projection-based reduced-order modeling methods, such as proper orthogonal decomposition and related model reduction methods. The stochastic subspace thus constructed can be used, for example, to characterize model-form uncertainty in computational mechanics. The proposed method has multiple desirable properties: (1) it is naturally justified by the probabilistic PCA and has analytic forms for the induced random matrix models; (2) it satisfies linear constraints, such as boundary conditions of all kinds, by default; (3) it has only one hyperparameter, which significantly simplifies training; and (4) its algorithm is very easy to implement. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed method via several numerical examples in computational mechanics and structural dynamics.</description>
