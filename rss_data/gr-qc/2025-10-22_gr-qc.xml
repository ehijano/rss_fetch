      <title>Beyond quasinormal modes: a complete mode decomposition of black hole perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that retarded Green's functions of black hole spacetimes can be expressed as a convergent mode sum everywhere in spacetime. At late times a quasinormal mode sum converges, while at early times a Matsubara (or, Euclidean) mode sum converges. The two regions are separated by a lightcone which scatters from the black hole potential. The Matsubara sum is a Fourier series on the Euclidean thermal circle associated to the early time region. We illustrate our results for P\"oschl-Teller, BTZ, and Schwarzschild. In the case of Schwarzschild, we express the branch cut contribution as a convergent sum of de Sitter quasinormal modes as $\Lambda\to 0^+$, and exploit recent exact solutions to the Heun connection problem. In each case we analytically show convergence by studying the asymptotics of residue sums and also provide numerical demonstrations.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field geometry in rotating wormhole spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If a black hole is immersed in a magnetosphere,its rotational energy can be transferred to the electromagnetic field and escape as a Poynting flux to infinity. This process of extraction of rotational energy is known as the Blandford-Znajek mechanism. It relies on the presence of both a magnetosphere and an ergosphere surrounding the black hole. Previously, we showed that rotating wormholes are also capable of emitting a Poynting flux in the process of accreting magnetized matter. In this work, we re-examine the Blandford-Znajek mechanism in the case of a Kerr-type wormhole. For the first time, we solve the stream equation in a rotating wormhole spacetime and derive analytical expressions for the magnetic field. We then compute the associated Poynting flux. Our results indicate that the electromagnetic flux in the wormhole spacetime is weaker than in the Kerr case, and this difference becomes more pronounced as the geometries of the two spacetimes increasingly deviate.</description>

      <title>Global time-frequency search for stellar-mass binary black holes in LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a complete pipeline for detecting and characterising gravitational waves (GWs) produced by the inspiral of stellar-mass binary black holes in data from the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). The analysis framework relies on an efficient time-frequency implementation of an adaptive semi-coherent detection statistic, which we show to be robust against non-stationary noise and the presence of gaps of varying duration and cadence. The search is able to detect signals down to a coherent signal-to-noise ratio $\approx$ 11 over the full parameter space of black holes with spins aligned to the orbital angular momentum and orbital eccentricity $\leq$ 0.01 when deployed on the 2-year-long LISA Data Challenge Yorsh. The search can be run within a day using $\approx$ 40 GPUs. The techniques presented here have wider applications in GW astronomy, in particular the search for extreme-mass-ratio inspirals in LISA data.</description>

      <title>Probing Binary Black Hole Formation Channels through Cosmic Large-Scale Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing number of binary black hole mergers detected through gravitational waves offers unprecedented insight into their underlying population, yet their astrophysical formation channels remain unresolved. We present a new method to distinguish binary black hole formation channels using their spatial clustering at cosmological scales. Employing the cosmological hydrodynamic simulation Illustris, we trace the distribution of mergers across cosmic time and compare them with the underlying matter distribution associated with three candidate origins: isolated binary stellar evolution, binaries embedded in AGN disks, and primordial black holes within dark matter halos. For mergers at redshift $z \lesssim 0.5$, these channels show distinct clustering signatures that could be accessible with proposed upgrades to current ground-based gravitational-wave detectors. Using mock catalogs for next- generation facilities such as Cosmic Explorer, we find that their sensitivities would enable differentiation of these formation pathways out to redshift $z \sim 5$ within the first decade of observations. This approach provides a new framework to link gravitational-wave populations with the large-scale structure of the Universe. By treating black hole mergers as cosmological tracers, our results demonstrate how cross- correlations between gravitational-wave catalogs and the cosmic matter field can constrain the relative contribution of stellar, AGN, and primordial channels, offering a complementary probe to population- inference studies. These findings underscore the emerging potential of gravitational-wave cosmology to reveal where and how black holes form and merge across cosmic history.</description>

      <title>Imprints of Topological Thermodynamics on Black Hole Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By employing Duan's topological method, we classify critical points by their topological charge Q = +/-1 or 0. Previous work (Wei et al., Phys. Rev. D 105, 104003, 2022) investigated two typical anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes: the Reissner-Nordstroem (RN) case (with only one critical point Q = -1) and the Born-Infeld (BI) case (with two critical points Q = +/-1). In this work, we first find that all three types of critical points appear in quantum anomalous black holes for 4D spacetime. We then compute the quasinormal modes of massless scalar perturbations near these critical points and find that both the oscillation frequency and damping rate increase with the black hole radius at the critical temperature. Besides such common behavior, although the Q = +1 and Q = 0 cases do not show a discernible pattern due to the limited number of samples, the Q = -1 case exhibits very similar dynamical characteristics across all three black hole solutions, implying a nontrivial connection between topological thermodynamics and dynamics.</description>

      <title>A Closeness Function on Coarse Grained Lorentzian Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a family of closeness functions on the space of finite volume Lorentzian geometries using the abundance of discrete intervals in the underlying random causal sets. Although strictly weaker than a Lorentzian Gromov-Hausdorff distance function, it has the advantage of being numerically calculable for large causal sets. It thus provides a concrete and quantitative measure of continuumlike behaviour in causal set theory and can be used to define a weak convergence condition for Lorentzian geometries.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulations of Scalar Dark Matter Around Binary Neutron Star mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary neutron star mergers provide a laboratory for probing fundamental physics through their gravitational- wave emission and electromagnetic counterparts. In particular, they may allow us to explore signatures of physics beyond the Standard Model in strong-gravity regimes, such as those of dark matter. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of light dark matter, modeled as a minimally coupled scalar field, surrounding a binary neutron star system. Our primary focus is to assess whether the scalar field remains bound to the binary over the late inspiral-merger timescales and to determine its potential impact on observable signatures. We find that, in a range of scenarios, the scalar field forms a common cloud around the binary that does not disperse. At sufficiently high densities, this leads to measurable effects, including a dephasing of the binary inspiral, a less compact post-merger remnant, and suppression of the dynamical ejecta. For densities motivated by astrophysical considerations, however, these effects remain small and are unlikely to be detectable with current or next-generation gravitational-wave observatories.</description>

      <title>Implications of $f(R)$ gravity on late-time cosmic structure growth through a complete description of density perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide insight about the full form of the equations for matter density perturbations and the scalar Bardeen metric potentials in general $f(R)$ theories of gravity. When considering viable modifications to the standard $\Lambda$CDM background, the full scale-dependent equations for the metric perturbations are provided and are shown to match the ones obtained with the quasistatic approximation. We investigate the impact of the $n=2$ Hu-Sawicki model on the late-time growth of structures. We find that updated late-time growth of structure data imposes $|f_{R_0}|\lesssim10^{-6}-10^{-5}$ and thus conclude that the Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ model contributes no significant phenomenology at both background and perturbative level beyond the effective cosmological constant encompassed in its definition. This conclusion points to the survival of the present tension between early and late measurements of $\sigma_8$, as the Hu-Sawicki model can only worsen this issue or at best reproduce the results from the current concordance cosmological model. The generalized perturbative method showcased in this work can be applied to more elaborate $f(R)$ models to isolate genuine higher-order signatures beyond the quasistatic approximation.</description>

      <title>Multi-photon ring structure of reflection-asymmetric traversable thin-shell wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the observational signatures of thin accretion disks around a reflection-asymmetric traversable thin-shell wormhole. This wormhole, built in the framework of Palatini $f(R)$ gravity coupled to a Maxwell field using a junction conditions formalism, lacks horizons but features photon spheres on each side of the throat, described by different effective potentials and at different locations. This fact allows a portion of the light rays arriving to the observer's screen on one side of the throat to have explored a part of the space-time on the other side, bringing information about the geometry gathered there. In this setting we simulate the optical appearance of such an asymmetric wormhole when illuminated by thin accretion disks, investigating scenarios with either one or two (on each side of the throat) disks, revealing a rich multi-photon ring structure due to light crossing the throat, and a strong reduction in the size of the central brightness depression region. These new rings are more numerous and far more luminous in the two-disk case than in the single-disk case, and the shadow's size reduction far more acute, making a neat distinction as compared to canonical black hole images. These results highlight the potential of high-resolution imaging in providing smoking guns for the existence of ultra-compact objects distinct from black holes via their multi-ring structure.</description>

      <title>Effects of Dynamical Capture on two equal-mass non-spinning black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical captures of black holes are unique events that provide an exceptional opportunity to probe the strong-field regime of gravitational physics. In this article, we perform numerical relativity simulations to study the events of dynamical capture of two equal-mass non-spinning black holes. We consider a suite of scenarios within a range of initial linear momenta ($p/M=0.095-0.75$) and incidence angles ($\theta=6.36^\circ-2.83^\circ$), and study the emitted Weyl scalar ($\Psi_4$) of each case, as well as the spins and masses of the black holes before and after they merge. We provide a simple analytical model which accurately fits the gravitational-wave emission. We study the dependence of the time-interval between the capture and the merger emissions with respect to the incidence angle, which can be well parametrized by a first-order divergent behavior, allowing to find the angle that separates a scattering event from a dynamical capture. We also find that, in general, the parameters that model the first emission can be well described by linear or exponentially decaying functions in terms of the incidence angle, while others display more complex behaviors that offer valuable insights into the nature of these events.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Stability of Rotating Hairy Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotating hairy black holes (RHBHs) are axisymmetric equilibrium solutions of the Einstein-Klein-Gordon equations, consisting of a spinning black hole surrounded by a toroidal distribution of complex scalar field. Despite their potential astrophysical relevance, the stability of these configurations -naturally expected to form through superradiant growth of light bosonic fields- remains uncertain. In this work, we investigate the stability of RHBHs by performing fully non-linear numerical evolutions of several configurations that differ in the relative mass contribution of the scalar-field torus. We find that configurations in which the scalar field mass is subdominant compared to the black hole mass remain stable throughout the evolution. In contrast, when the scalar-field mass dominates, the system develops an instability akin to the non-axisymmetric instability observed in rotating boson stars. Given the expected limits on the scalar-field mass growth achievable through superradiance, our results suggest that rotating hairy black holes formed predominantly by this process are expected to be stable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct geometric microstates for a class of two-dimensional flow geometries$-$spacetimes that interpolate from an asymptotic AdS$_2$ boundary to a dS$_2$ static patch in the interior$-$by inserting particles behind the horizon. We show that this mechanism produces dS microstates with an Einstein-Rosen bridge of infinite length behind the horizon. The state-counting of these microstates, including wormhole contributions, reproduces the Gibbons-Hawking entropy, $S_{\rm dS}=A^{\rm dS}_{\rm horizon}/4G$. Furthermore, we extend the microstate-counting method to the case of a finite-length Einstein-Rosen bridge. As a result, the Hilbert space of the dS horizon in the flow geometry can be spanned by states with a purely dS Einstein-Rosen bridge, containing no AdS portion on the time-symmetric slice. This provides a concrete realization of dS microstates within a controlled holographic framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known that linearized perturbations of extremal black holes result in growing curvature on the horizon. However, nonlinear perturbations typically do not evolve to extremal black holes and do not have growing curvature at late times. We show that a large class of nonlinear perturbations of an extremal planar anti-de Sitter black hole does have horizon curvature that grows unbounded in time. The late time behavior of the nonlinear evolution is found to be captured by a linearized analysis. We argue that the generic nonlinear perturbation behaves similarly.</description>

Abstract: We describe a new tunneling solution for the decay of a cosmic string into a burst of gravitational waves. We find the relevant instanton and compute the tunneling rate. Locally, our solution is just an analytic continuation of the Kerr metric (but there is no black hole in our solution). An interesting feature of our result is that there is a conical singularity in the initial state but there is no singularity in the final state. This demonstrates that singularities can disappear in quantum gravity in ways that are impossible in classical gravity.</description>

      <title>Geometric Symmetries for the Vanishing of the Black Hole Tidal Love Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a unified geometric perspective on the symmetries underlying the spin 0, 1 and 2 static perturbations around a Schwarzschild black hole. In all cases, the symmetries are exact, each forming an SO(3,1) group. They can be formulated at the level of the action, provided the appropriate field variables are chosen. For spin 1 and 2, the convenient variables are certain combinations of the gauge fields for even perturbations, and dual scalars for odd perturbations. The even and odd sector each has its own SO(3,1) symmetry. In addition, there is an SO(2) symmetry connecting them, furnishing an economical description of Chandrasekhar's duality. When decomposed in spherical harmonics, the perturbations form a non-trivial representation of SO(3,1), giving rise to ladder symmetries which explain the vanishing of the tidal Love numbers. Our work builds on earlier discussions of ladder symmetries, which were formulated in terms of the Newman-Penrose scalar at the level of the Teukolsky equation. Our formulation makes it possible to state the symmetries responsible for the vanishing of the Wilson coefficients characterizing the spin 0, 1 and 2 static tidal response, in the effective point particle description of a black hole.</description>

Abstract: Dark matter may not be perfectly stable, and its decay could generate distinctive gravitational-wave signatures. In this work, we present model-independent predictions for the stochastic gravitational-wave background arising from the decay of ultralight dark matter into gravitons. Within this framework, we forecast the sensitivity reach of current and forthcoming gravitational-wave detectors to such signals.</description>

      <title>One-loop double copy from gravity coupled to a massive vector field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we compute the one-loop four-graviton amplitudes with a massive abelian vector field (Proca) circulating in the loop. Instead of the conventional Einstein-Hilbert formulation, we employ the Landau-Lifshitz metric density approach, coupling gravity to the Proca field. Within this framework, we found that the resulting contact-terms-free $n$-gon numerators exhibit a manifest double-copy structure, provided the external gravitational trees satisfy this property. This structure enables the direct construction of the corresponding amplitudes with a scalar in the loop. We further show that these numerators can be consistently used to evaluate pure gravity amplitudes in the sectors where contact terms vanish, offering a simplified setting to explore double-copy relations at one loop level.</description>

      <title>A resistive MHD module in the GPU-accelerated GRMHD code GRaM-X</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relativistic macroscopic plasma dynamics can be described by general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics. In many high-energy astrophysical settings, such as the interior dynamics of magnetized stars, the ideal GRMHD approximation, in which we assume infinite conductivity, provides an excellent description. However, ideal GRMHD neglects resistive effects that are essential for processes such as magnetic reconnection, dissipation, and magnetospheric dynamics. Incorporating resistivity into astrophysical plasma models accounts for the fact that plasmas in such environments are not perfect conductors. We present a resistive version of the GPU-accelerated GRMHD code GRaM-X, which evolves the full resistive GRMHD equations using the Z4c formalism for Einstein's equations. We implement a second-order implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta scheme to handle stiff source terms, obtain the primitive quantities from the conserved quantities using a one-dimensional recovery method, and employ the HLLE Riemann solver in combination with TVD and WENO reconstruction schemes. We validate the module using a range of standard tests, including 1D shocktubes, current sheets, Alfv\'{e}n waves, 2D cylindrical explosions, and 3D TOV stars. The results of these tests demonstrate accurate recovery of the ideal MHD limit, correct resistive behavior, and stable evolution in dynamical spacetimes. Leveraging the GPU-accelerated resistive version of GRaM-X enables efficient large-scale simulations, paving the way for realistic studies of binary mergers, accretion flows, and relativistic jets within the framework of multi-messenger astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Nearly Monochromatic Primordial Black Holes as total Dark Matter from Bubble Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a two-field model where the inflaton $\chi$ is non-minimally coupled to the instanton $\phi$. By choosing an appropriate coupling function, we realize the scenario where the difference of the values of potential between false vacuum (FV) and true vacuum (TV) is maximized during inflation. Most of the bubbles are created at this time. After inflation ends, the potential value of FV drops below that of TV so that these bubbles collapse to form primordial black holes (PBHs). By tuning the parameters of our model, we analyze the Coleman-de Luccia (CDL) and Hawking-Moss (HM) process, finding that the corresponding mass function of PBHs is sharply peaked, implying that we can realize either PBHs as cold dark matter, sub-solar PBHs, or supermassive PBHs in this scenario without enhancement of primordial curvature perturbations.</description>

      <title>Foundations of Noncommutative Carrollian Geometry via Lie-Rinehart Pairs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carroll manifolds offer an intrinsic geometric framework for the physics in the ultra-relativistic limit. The recently introduced Carrollian Lie algebroids are generalised to the setting of $\rho$-commutative geometry, (also known as almost commutative geometry), where the underlying algebras commute up to a numerical factor. Via $\rho$-Lie-Rinehart pairs, it is shown that the foundational tenets of Carrollian geometry have analogous statements in the almost commutative world. We explicitly build two toy examples: we equip the extended quantum plane and the noncommutative $2$-torus with Carrollian structures. This opens up the rigorous study of noncommutative Carrollian geometry via almost commutative geometry.</description>

      <title>Fermionic fields of higher spin in de Sitter space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider fermionic fields of higher spin on a four-dimensional de Sitter background. A particular emphasis is placed on the Rarita-Schwinger spin-$\tfrac{3}{2}$ case. Both massive fields and gauge fields are considered, and their relation to the representation theory of $SO(4,1)$ is discussed. In Lorentzian signature, we study properties of the Bunch-Davies mode functions, and the late time structure of their two-point functions. For the Rarita-Schwinger gauge field, we consider a quantisation procedure based on the Minkowskian limit of the field operator. In Euclidean signature, the fields are placed on a four-sphere and the Euclidean path integral is computed at one-loop. The resulting Euclidean partition function is expressed in terms of unitary Lorentzian group characters with edge corrections. The unitary nature of the characters contrasts the lack of a conventional real action for the Rarita-Schwinger gauge field in de Sitter space. We speculate on the microscopic properties of a theory comprised of an infinite tower of interacting integer and half-integer gauge fields in de Sitter space. Along the way, we discuss a potentially interesting expression for the higher-spin path integral on the four-sphere.</description>

      <title>Can the Near-Horizon Black Hole Memory be detected through Binary Inspirals?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The memory effect, in the context of gravitational-waves (GWs), manifests itself in the permanent relative displacement of test masses when they encounter the GWs. A number of works have explored the possibility of detecting the memory when the source and detector are separated by large distances. A special type of memory, arising from BMS symmetries, called ``black-hole memory'', has been recently proposed. The black hole memory only manifests itself in the vicinity of its event horizon. Therefore, formally observing it requires placing a GW detector at the horizon of the BH, which prima-facie seems unfeasible. In this work, we describe a toy model that suggests a possible way the black hole memory may be observed, without requiring a human-made detector near the event horizon. The model considers a binary black hole (BBH), emanating GWs observable at cosmological distances, as a proxy for an idealized detector in the vicinity of a supermassive Schwarzschild black hole that is endowed with a supertranslation hair by sending a shock-wave to it. This sudden change affects the geometry near the horizon of the supertranslated black hole and it induces a change in the inspiraling orbital separation (and hence, orbital frequency) of the binary, which in turn imprints itself on the GWs. Using basic GW data analysis tools, we demonstrate that the black hole memory should be observable by a LISA-like space-based detector.</description>

      <title>Inflationary Gravitational Waves as a probe of the unknown post-inflationary primordial Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07956v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the key predictions of the standard inflationary paradigm is the quantum mechanical generation of the transverse and traceless tensor fluctuations due to the rapid accelerated expansion of space, which later constitute a stochastic background of primordial gravitational waves (GWs). The amplitude of the (nearly) scale-invariant inflationary tensor power spectrum at large scales provides us with crucial information about the energy scale of inflation in the case of the minimal inflaton coupling to gravity. Furthermore, the spectral energy density, $\Omega_{_{\rm GW}}(f)$, of the GWs at sufficiently small scales (or, large frequencies $f$) serves as an important observational probe of post-inflationary primordial dynamics. In fact, the small-scale spectral tilt, $n_{_{\rm GW}} = \frac{{\rm d}\log{\Omega_{_{\rm GW}}}}{{\rm d}\log{f}}$, of the spectral energy density of GWs is sensitive to the (unknown) post-inflationary equation of state (EoS), $w$, of the universe; with a softer EoS ($w &lt; 1/3$) leading to a red tilt: $n_{_{\rm GW}} &lt; 0$, while a stiffer EoS ($w &gt; 1/3$) resulting in a blue tilt: $n_{_{\rm GW}} &gt; 0$. The post-inflationary dynamics, however, is generically expected to be quite complex, potentially involving a number of distinct phases. Hence, in this work, we discuss the possibility of multiple sharp transitions, namely $w_1 \to w_2 \to w_3 \to ... \to w_n$, in the EoS of the post-inflationary universe and compute the corresponding spectral energy density of the inflationary GWs. We explicitly determine the region of the parameter space $\lbrace{ w_1, \, w_2, \, w_3, ..., w_n\rbrace}$ which leads to a potentially detectable signal in the upcoming GW detectors, without violating the current constraints.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of gravitational constant at low energies from the connection between spin-2 and spin-0 sectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fact that graviton propagator contains not only one but two tensorial components excludes a unique definition of the running behavior of the gravitational constant, while at low energies gravitation is characterized solely by Newton's constant. How these two facts are reconciled when massive quantum fields are present remains unanswered. In this work, by non-minimally coupling gravity to a one-loop massive scalar, we show that this potential conflict is resolved by the non-trivial equivalence between the residues of the two propagator components. Such equivalence, crucial for the validity of the Appelquist-Carazzone decoupling theorem, is based on a rather subtle connection between the spin-2 and spin-0 sectors of the propagator. It is verified that this connection also makes the two quantum-corrected gravitational potentials be characterized by the same gravitational constant at large distances. In addition, we find that the potentials in our case as well as the quantum-corrected Coulomb potential can be expressed concisely in a unified formulation. By comparing these results with experiments, we establish a new upper bound on the magnitude of the non-minimal coupling parameter $\xi$.</description>

Abstract: We construct gravitational atoms including self-gravity, obtaining solutions of the Einstein-Klein-Gordon equations for a scalar field surrounding a non-rotating black hole in a quasi-stationary approximation. We resolve the region near the horizon as well as the far field region. Our results are relevant in a wide range of masses, from ultralight to MeV scalar fields and for black holes ranging from primordial to supermassive. For instance, a system with a scalar field consistent with ultralight dark matter and a black hole mass comparable to that of Sagittarius A* can be modeled. A density spike near the event horizon, although present, is negligible, contrasting with the prediction in [P. Gondolo and Silk, Phys. Rev. Lett., 83:1719-1722, 1999] for cold dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical Isaacson's procedure for describing back-reaction of the averaged energy-momentum for high frequency gravitational waves is generalized to the $f(R)$ gravity case. From the beginning it is assumed that an initial background could be arbitrary one. Then, we restrict the background to be de Sitter, which is a novelty regarding the study of a back-reaction in $f(R)$ gravity. Consideration of the de Sitter space as a background spacetime allows us to provide the averaging procedure completely. Using the results on the de Sitter space and generalizing the Isaacson procedure, we construct the averaged energy-momentum on an additionally curved (averaged) background. Consistency tests for de Sitter spacetime are performed both at the background and perturbative regimes. Our results generalize previous studies in which the authors consider the flat (Minkowski) spacetime as the initial background.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from eccentric binary neutron star mergers: Systematic biases and inadequacy of quasicircular templates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of quasicircular waveforms in matched-filter analyses of signals from eccentric binary neutron star mergers can lead to biases in the source's parameter estimation. We demonstrate that significant biases can be present already for moderate eccentricities $e_{0} \gtrsim 0.05$ and signals detected by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA with signal-to-noise ratio $\gtrsim 12$. We perform systematic Bayesian mock analyses of unequal-mass nonspinning binary neutron star signals up to eccentricities $e_0 \sim 0.1$ using quasicircular effective-one-body waveforms with spins. We find fractional signal-to-noise ratio losses up to tens of percent and up to 16$\sigma$ deviations in the inference of the chirp mass. The latter effect is sufficiently large to lead to an incorrect (and ambiguous) source identification. The inclusion of spin precession in the quasicircular waveform does not capture eccentricity effects. We conclude that high-precision observations with advanced (and next generation) detectors are likely to require standardized, accurate, and fast eccentric waveforms.</description>

      <title>Constraining scalar-tensor theories from higher harmonics with GW230529</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Advanced LIGO and Virgo collaborations recently detected a gravitational wave event, GW230529\_181500, during the fourth observing run, which is most plausibly attributed to the merger of a neutron star and a black hole. This observation provides an opportunity to test a class of gravitational theories that deviate from general relativity. In such theories, additional terms contribute to the gravitational wave signal only in cases of asymmetric binaries. This study focuses on two scalar-tensor models within this class of theories: the Screened Modified Gravity and Brans-Dicke theory. These models have potential applications in areas such as dark matter, dark energy, cosmic inflation, and primordial nucleosynthesis. With the GW230529\_181500 and Bayesian Markov-chain Monte Carlo analyses, we derive a 90\% credible lower bound as $ \frac{\varphi_{\rm_{VEV}}}{M_{\rm Pl}}&lt;1.7\times10^{-2}$ and $\omega_{\rm BD}&gt;25.12$ by using dominant mode correction. Asymmetric binary systems usually have a significant mass ratio, in such cases, higher harmonic modes cannot be neglected. Our work considers higher harmonic corrections from scalar-tensor theories and provides a tighter constraint of $ \frac{\varphi_{\rm_{VEV}}}{M_{\rm Pl}}&lt;1.5\times10^{-2}$ and $\omega_{\rm BD}&gt;32.68$, with a 13.3\% and 30.1\% improvement respectively. Combining GW230529\_181500, GW200115 and GW190814 and including higher modes, the constraint is improved to $\frac{\varphi_{\rm_{VEV}}}{M_{\rm Pl}}&lt;7.84\times10^{-3}$ and $\omega_{\rm BD}&gt;123.75$. This is currently the strongest constraint from GWs, contingent upon GW190814 being an NSBH event.</description>

Abstract: We determine a four-function generalization of the Plebanski spacetime, depending on three arbitrary functions of the radial coordinate, and one function on the angular coordinate. For the generalized Plebanski spacetime, we analyze the separability of the Hamilton--Jacobi equations, and the trajectories of charged test particles are derived from the motion constants. The Klein-Gordon equation separability is established and the Killing horizons are presented as well. Then we introduce a conformal factor to the Plebanski metric and discuss the conditions that preserve the separability. Finally we show a possible stress--energy tensor that may be the source of some of the generalized metrics.</description>

      <title>Tidal Stretching and Compression in Black Bounce Backgrounds</title>

Abstract: Black bounces are compact objects that combine the structures of regular black holes with those of wormholes. These spacetimes exhibit a rich causal structure and can differ fundamentally from usual black holes. In this work, we study the behavior of the tidal forces by considering different black bounce models. To this end, we start with the geodesic deviation equation and the tidal tensor, from which we compute the radial and angular components of the tidal forces. We find that these components are finite throughout the entire spacetime, including at the wormhole throats. Through the components of the displacement vector, we observe that, unlike the Schwarzschild case, a compression effect on bodies may occur in certain regions.</description>

      <title>Acceleration Radiation from Derivative-Coupled Atoms Falling in Modified Gravity Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interaction of quantum detector models with fields in curved spacetimes provides fundamental insights into phenomena such as Hawking and Unruh radiation. While standard models typically assume a minimal coupling between the detector and the field, physically motivated derivative couplings, which are sensitive to field gradients, have been less explored, particularly in the context of modified gravity theories. In this paper, we develop a general framework to analyze the acceleration radiation from a two-level atomic detector with a derivative coupling undergoing a radial geodesic infall into a generic static, spherically symmetric black hole. We derive a general integral expression for the excitation probability and apply it to two distinct spacetimes. For an extended uncertainty principle (EUP) black hole, we demonstrate that the detector radiates with a perfect thermal spectrum at the precise Hawking temperature, reinforcing the universality of this phenomenon. For a black hole solution in a Ricci-coupled Bumblebee gravity model, the radiation is also thermal. Still, its temperature is modified in direct correspondence with the theory's Lorentz-violating parameters, consistent with the modified Hawking temperature. Furthermore, we demonstrate that derivative coupling results in a significantly enhanced entropy flux compared to minimal coupling models. Our results establish acceleration radiation as a sensitive probe of near-horizon physics and demonstrate that this phenomenon can provide distinct observational signatures to test General Relativity (GR) and alternative theories of gravity in the strong-field regime.</description>

      <title>The non-minimal 3-form cosmology and the rise of the cuscuton</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the 3-form theory with non-minimal coupling to gravity in an expanding Universe. First, we assume that the background is homogeneous and isotropic, and that the three-form is coupled to both the Ricci scalar and the Ricci tensor. We show that in this case, it propagates three degrees of freedom: a scalar mode and two tensor ones. Then, we consider an anisotropic background that corresponds to a Bianchi Type I Universe, and set the coupling with the Ricci tensor to zero. We show that, similarly to the Proca theory with non-minimal coupling to gravity, this case leads to two branches for the background solutions - depending on the values of the 3-form. However, in contrast to the Proca case, we show that no extra modes appear. We explore the no-ghost conditions and speed of propagation for all three modes in both branches. Finally, we show that one of the branches can be written as a theory of a constrained scalar, coupled to a cuscuton field.</description>

      <title>Generalized Holographic and Ricci Dark Energy: Cosmological Diagnostics and Scalar Field Realizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19386v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present two generalized formulations of the Holographic and Ricci dark energy (DE) models, given by $ \rho_{GH} = 3c^2M^{2}_{pl} \left[ 1-\epsilon\left(1-\frac{R}{H^2}\right) \right]H^2$ and $\rho_{GR} = 3c^2M^{2}_{pl}\left[ 1-\eta\left(1-\frac{H^2}{R}\right) \right]R$ where $H$ and $R$ denote the Hubble parameter and the Ricci scalar, while $\epsilon$ and $\eta$ are model parameters related by $\epsilon = 1 - \eta$. We derived explicit analytical expressions for key cosmological quantities, including the Hubble parameter, the DE density $\rho_D$, the DE pressure $p_D$, the equation of state parameter of DE $\omega_D$ and the deceleration parameter $q$. The analysis was carried out for four distinct cases: (i) the standard model in its original formulation; (ii) the inclusion of spatial curvature; (iii) the addition of interactions between the dark sectors; and (iv) the presence of both interaction and curvature. Moreover, we also considered the limiting case of a DE Dominated Universe.
  To further characterize the dynamical features of the models, we investigated several diagnostic tools, namely the Statefinder parameters, the cosmographic approach, the $Om(z)$ diagnostic and the squared speed of the sound $v_s^2$ to assess stability against perturbations. Moreover, we established a correspondence between the DE models we studied and some scalar field theories, including tachyon, k-essence, dilaton, quintessence, Dirac-Born-Infeld, Yang-Mills and Nonlinear Electrodynamics (NLED) fields.</description>

      <title>A Higher-Derivative Hubble Parameter Dark Energy Model: Cosmological Analysis and Scalar Field Correspondence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study a Dark Energy (DE) energy density model which depends on the Hubble parameter squared $H^2$ and on its first, second and third time derivatives $\dot{H}$, $\ddot{H}$ and $\dddot{H}$. Considering a scale factor $a$ with a power-law dependence on the time (with $n$ indicating the power-law index), we obtain some important cosmological quantities as function of the , like the energy densities of Matter $\rho_m$ and of DE $\rho_D$, the fractional energy densities of DM $\Omega_m$ and of DE $\Omega_D$, the Hubble parameter squared $H^2$, the deceleration parameter $q$, the evolutionary form of the fractional energy density of DE $\Omega'_D$, the pressure of DE $p_D$ and the Equation of State (EoS) parameter of DE $\omega_D$, for both non interacting and interacting cases. For the interacting case, we consider 9 different interacting term $Q$, all functions of the Hubble parameter $H$ and/or of $\rho_m$ and $\rho_D$. Finally, we establish a correspondence between the DE model we study and some scalar field theories, including tachyon, k-essence, quintessence, Yang-Mills (YM) and Nonlinear Electrodynamics (NLED) fields.</description>

      <title>Indefinite causal order and quantum coordinates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.15685v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classically the causal order of two timelike separated events A and B is fixed -- either A before B or B before A. This is no longer true in quantum theory, where it is possible to encounter superpositions of causal orders. The quantum switch is one of the most prominent processes with indefinite causal order. Optical realizations of the quantum switch have been successfully implemented in experiments, but, some argue this merely simulates a process with indefinite causal order and that a superposition of spacetime metrics is required for a true realization. Here, we provide a relativistic definition of causal order between operationally defined events that defines a meaningful observable in both the general relativistic and quantum mechanical sense. Importantly, this observable does not distinguish between the indefinite causal order implemented on an optical bench and the gravitational quantum switch, a gedankenexperiment where the indefinite causal order is achieved by a quantum superposition of gravitational fields. Therefore, our results support the thesis that the optical quantum switch is just as much a realization of indefinite causal order as its gravitational counterpart, which makes use of the quantum mechanical behavior of spacetime.</description>

      <title>Gas-induced perturbations on the gravitational wave in-spiral of live post-Newtonian LISA massive black hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17305v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of dynamically coupling gas torques with gravitational wave (GW) emission during the orbital evolution of an equal-mass massive black hole binary (MBHB). We perform hydrodynamical simulations of eccentric MBHBs with total mass $M=10^6~{\rm M}_\odot$ embedded in a prograde locally isothermal circumbinary disk (CBD). We evolve the binary from $55$ to $49$ Schwarzschild radii separations using up to 2.5 post-Newtonian (PN) corrections to the binary dynamics, which allow us to follow the GW-driven in-spiral. For the first time, we report the measurement of gas torques onto a live binary a few years before the merger, with and without concurrent GW radiation. We also report the gas-induced orbital dephasing $\delta \phi_{\rm orb}\sim-0.007$ rad over $278$ orbital cycles that is likely driven mainly by disc-induced precession and LISA should be able to detect it at redshift $z=1$. Our results show how GWs alone can be used to probe the astrophysical properties of CBDs and have important implications for multi-messenger strategies aimed at studying the environments of MBHBs.</description>

      <title>Naturally resonant two-mediator model of self-interacting dark matter with decoupled relic abundance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a minimal, fully thermal mechanism that resolves the long-standing tension between achieving the observed dark-matter relic abundance and explaining the astrophysical signatures of self-interactions. The framework introduces two mediators: a light scalar $\phi$ (MeV scale) that yields the required, velocity-dependent self-interactions, and a heavy scalar resonance $\Phi_h$ (TeV scale) with mass $m_{\Phi_h}\!\approx\!2m_\chi$ that opens an $s$-channel resonant annihilation during freeze-out. This clearly decouples early-universe annihilation from late-time halo dynamics. A detailed numerical analysis identified a narrow predictive island of viability. A representative benchmark with $m_\chi\!=\!600$~GeV, $m_\phi\!=\!15$~MeV, and $m_{\Phi_h}\!\simeq\!1.2$~TeV reproduces the relic density and yields $\sigma_T/m_\chi\sim 0.1$--$1~\mathrm{cm}^2\!/\mathrm{g}$ at dwarf-galaxy velocities while satisfying cluster bounds. The model makes sharp, testable predictions: a narrow $t\bar t$ resonance near $1.2$~TeV within HL-LHC reach, and a spin-independent direct-detection signal $\sigma_{\rm SI}\!\sim\!7\times10^{-48}\,\mathrm{cm}^2$ within next-generation sensitivity. As an optional UV completion, we show that walking $\mathrm{SU}(3)_H$ gauge theory with $N_f=10$ naturally realizes the near-threshold relation $m_{\Phi_h}\!\approx\!2m_\chi$ and can furnish an effective anomalous dimension $\gamma\!\approx\!0.5$ which underlies a density-responsive dark-energy sector, suggesting a unified origin for the dark sector.</description>

      <title>Bimetric gravity improves the fit to DESI BAO and eases the Hubble tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03743v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether the latest combination of DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements, cosmic microwave background (CMB) data (Planck 2018 + ACT), and Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) compilations (Pantheon+, Union3, and DES Y5) favor a dynamical dark energy component, and explore if such a scenario can simultaneously help resolve the Hubble tension. We contrast two frameworks: the widely used phenomenological $w_0 w_a$CDM model, and bimetric gravity, a fundamental modification of general relativity that naturally gives rise to phantom dark energy. The $w_0 w_a$CDM model is moderately preferred over $\Lambda$CDM, at the $2$-$4 \, \sigma$ level, when fitting DESI DR2 + CMB + SNe Ia, but it exacerbates the Hubble tension. By comparison, bimetric gravity provides a modest improvement in fit quality, at the $1 \, \sigma$ level, but, by inferring $H_0 = 69.0 \pm 0.4 \, \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$, it partially eases the Hubble tension, from a $5 \,\sigma$ discrepancy to a $3.7 \, \sigma$ tension. Including locally calibrated SNe Ia brings the overall preference for the bimetric model over $\Lambda$CDM to the $2 \, \sigma$ level, comparable to that of the $w_0 w_a$CDM model when including the local SN Ia calibration.</description>

      <title>Stationary Solution to Charged Hairy Black Hole in AdS4: Kasner Interior, Rotating Shock Waves, and Fast Scrambling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02174v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a stationary solution of a charged black hole with scalar hair in AdS$_4$, where the scalar field is coupled to a $U(1)$ Maxwell gauge field. Near the singularity, the spacetime transitions into a more general Kasner geometry. The black hole is then injected with rotating and charged gravitational shock waves in the Dray-'t Hooft solution. These shock waves lengthen the wormhole connecting the two asymptotic boundaries, thereby disrupting the correlations between them. The correlation, quantified by the quantum mutual information between subregions on the left and right boundaries, vanishes at a characteristic timescale known as the scrambling time, which depends logarithmically on the black hole entropy. The mutual information is computed holographically using the Ryu-Takayanagi prescription for entanglement entropy. We investigate how the rotation and charge of both the black hole and the shock waves affect chaotic properties such as the scrambling time delay and the Lyapunov exponent. The interaction between the charges of the black hole and the shock waves introduces a delay in the scrambling process. We find that as the strength of the boundary deformation increases, both the Lyapunov exponent and the scrambling time delay decrease monotonically. Furthermore, the angular momentum of the shock waves enhances both the Lyapunov exponent and the scrambling time delay.</description>

      <title>Revealing evolution of Dark Energy density from observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12881v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a model--independent reconstruction of the normalized dark energy density function, $X(z) \equiv \rho_{\mathrm{de}}(z)/\rho_{\mathrm{de}}(0)$, derived directly from the DES-SN5YR Type~Ia supernova sample. The analysis employs an inversion formalism that relates the derivative of the distance modulus, $\mu^{\prime}(z)$, to the expansion history, allowing the data to determine the shape of $X(z)$ without assuming a specific equation--of--state or dark energy density parameterization.
  A statistically optimized binning of the supernova sample (using 17 intervals following the Freedman--Diaconis criterion and 34 following Scott's rule) ensures a stable estimation of $\mu^{\prime}(z)$ and a controlled propagation of uncertainties throughout the inversion process.
  The resulting $X(z)$ remains statistically consistent with a constant value within one standard deviation across the entire redshift range, showing no significant evidence for an evolving dark energy component at present. In a direct comparison among $\Lambda$CDM, CPL, and the quadratic $X^2(z)$ parameterization -- where CPL and $X^2(z)$ each introduce two additional free parameters relative to $\Lambda$CDM -- the CPL model attains the best statistical agreement with the data, albeit only marginally and strictly within this restricted model set.
  These outcomes indicate that current observations are compatible with an almost constant dark energy density ($w \simeq -1$), while the inversion framework remains sensitive to subtle departures that forthcoming high--precision surveys could resolve.</description>
