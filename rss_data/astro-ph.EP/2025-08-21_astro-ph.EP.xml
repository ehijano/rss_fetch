      <title>Measuring the Mean Plane of the Distant Kuiper Belt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the absence of any unseen planetary-mass bodies in the outer solar system, the mean plane of the distant Kuiper belt should be the same as the plane orthogonal to the angular momentum vector of the solar system -- the invariable plane. Here, we measure the mean plane of the non-resonant Kuiper belt across semimajor axes 50 - 400 AU. We introduce a new method to measure the mean plane that we demonstrate to be independent of observational bias. In particular, our results are not biased by surveys that look only at limited areas on the celestial sphere. We find a warp relative to the invariable plane at semimajor axes of 80 - 400 AU (98% confidence) and 80 - 200 AU (96% confidence), but not at 50 - 80 AU or 200 - 400 AU. If it is not spurious, a possible explanation for this warp is an unseen planet in the outer solar system. With $n$-body simulations, we find that a planet with mass between that of Mercury and the Earth, semimajor axis in the range 100 - 200 AU, and inclination $\gtrsim 10^{\circ}$ to be the most likely cause of the warp; however, parameters outside of these ranges are still possible. Such a body is distinct in both mass and semimajor axis from the various versions of an unseen planet invoked to explain apsidal clustering in the outer solar system. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) is expected to confirm or deny the existence of the warp reported here, and might detect the planet that may produce it.</description>

      <title>Two warm Earth-sized exoplanets and an Earth-sized candidate in the M5V-M6V binary system TOI-2267</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report two warm Earth-sized exoplanets orbiting the close binary TOI-2267 (M5+M6, separation ~8 au). Data from TESS and ground-based facilities confirm the planets, but we cannot determine which star they orbit. The planets have radii of 1.00+/-0.11 R_Earth (TOI-2267 b, P=2.28 d) and 1.14+/-0.13 R_Earth (TOI-2267 c, P=3.49 d) if around TOI-2267A, or 1.22+/-0.29 R_Earth and 1.36+/-0.33 R_Earth if around TOI-2267B. TESS also shows a candidate signal (TOI-2267.02, P=2.03 d, 0.95+/-0.12 or 1.13+/-0.30 R_Earth). Dynamical analysis shows all three cannot orbit one star; the most stable configuration has planets b and c (near a 3:2 resonance) orbiting one star and the candidate the other. This scenario would make TOI-2267 the most compact binary system known to host planets, with both components harbouring transiting worlds, offering a unique benchmark for studying planet formation and evolution in compact binary.</description>

      <title>Hot Rocks Survey IV: Emission from LTT 3780 b is consistent with a bare rock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is an open question whether small planets around M dwarfs are able to maintain atmospheres. The Hot Rocks Survey aims to address this question by observing 9 rocky exoplanets orbiting M dwarfs with MIRI emission photometry to constrain the onset of atmospheres. In this paper, we present two MIRI F1500W (15$\mu$m) eclipses of LTT 3780 b, an ultra-short period super-Earth ($P=0.768$ d, $R=1.325 \,R_\oplus$, $M = 2.46\,M_\oplus$) that receives 111x Earth's instellation, the highest in the survey. We find a combined eclipse depth of $312\pm38$ ppm, which is consistent between different data reduction and analysis assumptions, bolstering our confidence in the eclipse detection. This eclipse depth is consistent with the thermal emission from a bare rock surface, with a dayside temperature of $T_d=1143^{+104}_{-99}$ K, $98\pm9$ % of the maximum temperature predicted for a zero albedo, zero heat redistribution blackbody. We are able to confidently rule out CO$_2$-based atmospheres down to 0.01 bar surface pressure to greater than 3$\sigma$ (ruling out an approximately Mars-like atmosphere). We are unable to rule out a pure H$_2$O 1 bar atmosphere, though we argue that this composition is unlikely on such a highly irradiated planet, nor O$_2$ atmospheres due to the lack of features in the bandpass, though we can put constraints on CO$_2$-mixture atmospheres. As a potential bare rock, we consider a variety of surface composition models, but are unable to distinguish between them. However, LTT 3780 b is an excellent target for follow-up JWST observations to determine its surface composition and rule out additional atmospheric compositions.</description>

      <title>Peculiar Disk Substructures Associated with the Young Eruptive Star EX Lupi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Young eruptive stars such as EXors undergo dramatic accretion outbursts characterized by sudden optical brightenings, yet the underlying physical mechanism remains uncertain. We present high-resolution ALMA Band 3 and 4 continuum observations of EX Lupi, the prototypical EXor-type variable, reconstructed using super-resolution imaging with sparse modeling. Our images reveal, for the first time, two distinct substructures: a compact, crescent-shaped inner arc within 10 au of the star, and a narrow outer ring at 30 au. The inner arc is strongly elongated and casts a shadow observed in the VLT/SPHERE near-infrared scattered light. The outer ring exhibits a radial width comparable to the local pressure scale height, consistent with moderately efficient dust trapping. Geometric and thermal analysis of the disk surface, based on combined ALMA and SPHERE data, indicates that the disk is moderately flared with an average disk temperature consistent with that of classical T Tauri disks. The observed substructures suggest dynamical perturbations-plausibly induced by a massive companion-that may modulate accretion rates through gravitational interaction with the inner arc. These findings provide morphological evidence linking disk substructure to episodic accretion in the structurally mature disk.</description>

      <title>The Roman Space Telescope as a Planetary Defense Asset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, slated to launch in October 2026, will serve a critical role in the characterization and threat assessment of near-Earth Objects (NEOs), thus contributing to national and international planetary defense objectives. Operating from the Earth-Sun L2 point and observing in the near-infrared, Roman has the high sensitivity and high spatial resolution needed to measure the physical properties, compositions, and orbital trajectories of NEOs in order to understand their physical nature and potential hazards to Earth. Roman's planetary defense capabilities complement those of two wide-field survey missions: the now operational ground-based Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time and the upcoming space-based NEO Surveyor. Rubin, observing in visible light, will discover over 100,000 NEOs. NEO Surveyor, observing in the mid-infrared where NEO thermal emission peaks, will detect 200,000-300,000 NEOs, some as small as ~20 meters in diameter. With investment in developing the pipeline infrastructure required to extract information from moving target streaks, Roman will be able to observe NEOs down to the smallest sizes in order to improve our measurements of NEO orbits by 2-3 orders of magnitude, enable accurate diameter and albedo estimates in conjunction with NEO Surveyor, and reveal the spectral types and bulk compositions of the smallest NEOs. Together, these three US-led facilities will operate across the electromagnetic spectrum to form a comprehensive planetary defense network.</description>

      <title>The Prime Focus Infrared Microlensing Experiment (PRIME): First Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the description of the instruments and the first results of the PRime-focus Infrared Microlensing Experiment (PRIME). PRIME is the first dedicated near-infrared (NIR) microlensing survey telescope located at the South African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO) in Sutherland, South Africa. Among its class, it offers one of the widest fields of view in the NIR regime. PRIME's main goals are (1) To study planetary formation by measuring the frequency and mass function of planets. In particular, we compare results from the central Galactic bulge (GB), accessible only in the NIR by PRIME, with those from the outer GB by optical surveys. (2) To conduct concurrent observations with NASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space telescope. Due to the different lines of sight between the ground and space, we detect slight variations in light curves, known as ``Space-based parallax." This effect allows us to measure the mass of lens systems and their distance from the Earth. It is the only method to measure the mass of the free-floating planets down to Earth-mass. We begin the GB survey in February 2024 and analyzed images through June 1, 2025, identifying 486 microlensing candidates and over a thousand variable stars, including Mira variables, which are useful to study the Galactic structure. We issue real-time alerts for follow-up observations, supporting exoplanet searches, and the chemical evolution studies in the GB. During the off-bulge season, we conduct an all-sky grid survey and Target of Opportunity (ToO) observations of transients, including gravitational wave events, gamma-ray bursts, and other science.</description>

      <title>Machine learning revolution for exoplanet direct imaging detection: transformer architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Directly imaging exoplanets is a formidable challenge due to extreme contrast ratios and quasi-static speckle noise, motivating the exploration of advanced post-processing methods. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown promise, their inherent limitations in capturing long-range dependencies in image sequences hinder their effectiveness. This study introduces a novel hybrid deep learning architecture that combines a CNN feature extractor with a Transformer encoder to leverage temporal information, modeling the signature of a planet's coherent motion across an observation sequence. We first validated the model on a purely synthetic dataset, where it demonstrated excellent performance. While the final metrics varied slightly between training runs, our reported trial achieved 100.0% accuracy, a 100.0% F1-score, and a position accuracy of 0.72 pixels, showing strong results on this specific test case in comparison to traditional methods like median subtraction and PCA-KLIP. To assess its viability on realistic data, we retrained the model on a semi-synthetic dataset created by injecting planet signals into actual high-contrast imaging observations of the TW Hya protoplanetary disk from JWST. The model successfully identified the injected signals with high confidence, confirming its ability to function amidst complex, correlated noise and bright disk features. This work serves as a successful proof-of-concept, demonstrating that a CNN-Transformer architecture holds significant promise as a fast, accurate, and automated method for exoplanet detection in the large datasets expected from current and future high-contrast imaging instruments.</description>

      <title>Revealing Io's Surface using JWST-NIRISS Aperture Masking Interferometry and Neural Network Deconvolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Io is one of Jupiter's largest moons and the most volcanically active body in the Solar System. Its very active surface has hot spots produced by volcanic eruptions popping up at seemingly random locations and times. Characterizing the complex surface of Io requires the highest angular resolution available. This work presents the analysis of Aperture Masking Interferometric observations (at 4.3 um) of Io taken with the Near-Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph instrument on the James Webb Space Telescope. These are the first space-based infrared interferometric observations of a Solar System body ever taken. For complex extended objects like Io, the traditional visibility extraction algorithms from interferograms suffer from limitations. Here, new deconvolution methods based on Neural Networks allowed us to obtain reliable images from which a detailed analysis of the volcanically active surface of this moon was performed. Our study characterizes the loci and brightness of several unresolved volcanoes on the surface of Io, as well as the extended emission observed. We identified the brightest eruption (I_4.3um = 33 +/- 4.3 GW/um), referred to as V1, within an area to the North-East of Seth Patera (129.4 +/- 0.8 deg. W. Longitude, 1.5 +/- 0.7 deg. S. Latitude). Its projected speed (V_T = 86 +/- 34 m/s) is consistent with the rotational speed of Io. Additionally, six fainter volcanoes were identified and characterized. Complementary ground-based images, taken with the Keck II telescope, allowed us to benchmark the deconvolved Aperture Masking Interferometric images, showing consistency. Finally, we highlight the importance of characterizing Io's surface with long-term monitoring at high-angular resolution.</description>

      <title>Modeling tails of escaping gas in exoplanet atmospheres with Harmonica</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exoplanets that reside close to their host stars, and therefore receive substantial amounts of X-ray and ultraviolet radiation, are prone to suffer from strong atmospheric escape. This can lead to the creation of an envelope of escaping gas along the planet's orbital trajectory, often referred to as a tail. When transiting in front of their host star, these tails can not only produce larger depths in the transit light curves, but also introduce significant asymmetries between ingress and egress. Using the publicly available software Harmonica, we present a method to model the light curves of transiting planets surrounded by extended envelopes of escaping gas, and subsequently infer the shape and size of the latter. We apply this method to the JWST NIRISS/SOSS observations of HAT-P-18b, which show pronounced helium tail features in its spectroscopic light curve of the metastable helium triplet at 10830 \r{A}. Our model reveals that, in order to fit the observed light curve of HAT-P-18b, the planet must possess a trailing helium tail of $15.79^{+1.14}_{-1.05}$ planetary radii. We carry out injection-recovery tests to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. We demonstrate that, with sufficient precision, we would be able to fit a multi-layer envelope to the data, which would provide insight into the relative radial variations in the opacity profile.</description>

      <title>Identifying Habitable Exoplanets with Radio Telescopes on the Lunar Farside</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for habitable conditions beyond Earth is a top priority in astrophysics. The discovery of habitable exoplanets beyond our solar system will require a suite of instruments providing long-term monitoring for detection (e.g. with space and ground-based radial velocity observations), spectroscopic characterization of atmospheric and surface properties, and eventually deep chronograph-aided observations from e.g. JWST, Roman Space Telescope, and the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). Detection of exoplanet magnetospheres is necessary to identify the most promising targets for follow-up characterization of biosignatures with these assets, and to provide an ensemble of objects for studies of magnetospheric conditions and atmospheric composition. Only observations of low-frequency radio emission will distinguish exoplanet magnetospheres (Hallinan et al. 2021). In this white paper, we present the two lunar radio array concepts under development that would be suitable to detect these exoplanet radio emissions. In addition, we also discuss the human exploration needed prior to construction of such lunar radio arrays while highlighting preferred candidate sites (Krolikowski &amp; Elvis 2024) for the radio telescope.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Influence from Planets on the Measured Rates of Period Change of Pulsating White Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The measured rates of period change, $\dot{P}$, in the signals of pulsating white dwarf stars are often interpreted as direct detections of structural changes from secular cooling. Due to the intrinsic nature of this quantity, $\dot{P}$ analysis has been used to probe fundamental physics, such as constraining the mass of hypothetical axion particles. However, most white dwarfs are expected to host planets that could induce an external source of period change, caused by the light travel time variations from reflex motion about the system barycenter. Assuming a plausible distribution of planets that could orbit white dwarf stars, we quantify the amount of reflex motion expected from undiscovered planets as an important source of extrinsic error in $\dot{P}$ analyses. While the median error from reflex motion is $\sim10^{-15}$ ss$^{-1}$ (similar to the secular $\dot{P}$ rates expected for cool DAV pulsators), individual close-in planets could cause $\dot{P}$ errors as large as $10^{-11}$ ss$^{-1}$</description>

Abstract: Before discovering the first exoplanets, the Radial Velocity (RV) method had been used for decades to discover binary stars. Despite significant advancements in this technique, it is limited by the intrinsic mass-inclination degeneracy that can be broken when combining RVs with astrometry, which allows us to determine the orbital inclination, or direct imaging, from which we can estimate the true mass of the target. HD 72659 is a solar analog known to host a gas giant on a $\sim 10$-yr orbit and a massive outer companion. This work aims to confirm HD 72659 c, which was recently announced using data from HIRES and HARPS spectrographs in combination with Gaia's astrometric data. We monitored HD 72659 with HARPS-N in the framework of the GAPS project since 2012. We now combined our 91 spectra with literature data and Gaia DR3 high-precision astrometry to constrain the mass and the orbit of this object ($M_{\rm c} \sim 19$ $M_{\rm J}$, $a \sim 21$ au) that falls in the Brown Dwarf desert. Moreover, we analyzed our high-resolution imaging observation taken with SPHERE, but since the target was not detected, we could only derive upper limits on its mass. We characterize the orbital parameters of HD 72659 c, confirming the literature mass of this object but finding a period twice as high as previously reported, and we also refine the parameters of planet b with reduced uncertainties compared to previous works. Finally, we analyze and discuss the dynamic configuration of this system, finding that the Kozai-Lidov mechanism may be at work.</description>

      <title>Hubble Space Telescope Observations of the Interstellar Interloper 3I/ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02934v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present high angular resolution observations of the third known interstellar interloper, 3I/ATLAS, from the Hubble Space Telescope. The object is clearly active at 3.8 au pre-perihelion, showing dust emitted from the hot Sun-facing side of the nucleus and a weak, radiation pressure swept tail away from the Sun. We apply a simple model to estimate the mass loss rate in dust as dM/dt = 12 sqrt(a) kg/s, where a is the mean particle size in microns. With 1 &lt; a &lt; 100, we infer dM/dt = 12 to 120 kg/s. A fit to the surface brightness distribution of the inner coma limits the effective radius of the nucleus to be r &lt; 2.8 km, assuming red geometric albedo 0.04. Conversely, the nucleus cannot be smaller than 0.22 km in radius if its coma is supplied by sublimation of carbon monoxide, and must be larger if a less volatile molecule drives the mass loss.</description>

      <title>Discovery of H$\alpha$ Emission from a Protoplanet Candidate Around the Young Star 2MASS J16120668-3010270 with MagAO-X</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 2MASS J16120668-3010270 (hereafter 2MJ1612) is a young M0 star that hosts a protoplanetary disk in the Upper Scorpious star-forming region. Recent ALMA observations of 2MJ1612 show a mildly inclined disk ($i$=37$^\circ$) with a large dust-depleted gap (R$_\text{cav}\approx$0.4" or 53 au). We present high-contrast H$\alpha$ observations from MagAO-X on the 6.5m Magellan Telescope and new high resolution sub-mm dust continuum observations with ALMA of 2MJ1612. On both 2025 April 13 and 16, we recovered a point source with H$\alpha$ excess with SNR $\gtrsim$5 within the disk gap in our MagAO-X Angular and Spectral Differential (ASDI) images at a separation of 141.96$\pm$2.10 mas (23.45$\pm$0.29 au deprojected) from the star and position angle (PA)= 159.00$\pm$0.55$^\circ$. Furthermore, this H$\alpha$ source is within close proximity to a K band point source in SPHERE/IRDIS observation taken on 2023 July 21 \citep{sphere2025sub}. The astrometric offset between the K band and H$\alpha$ source can be explained by orbital motion of a bound companion. Thus our observations can be best explained by the discovery of an accreting protoplanet, 2MJ1612 b, with an estimated mass of 4$M_\text{Jup}$ and H$\alpha$ line flux ranging from (29.7 $\pm$7.5)$\times$10$^{-16}$ ergs/s/cm$^2$ to (8.2$\pm$3.4)$\times$10$^{-16}$ ergs/s/cm$^2$. 2MJ1612 b is likely the third example of an accreting H$\alpha$ protoplanet responsible for carving the gap in its host disk, joining PDS 70b and c. Further study is necessary to confirm and characterize this protoplanet candidate and to identify any additional protoplanets that may also play a role in shaping the gap.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive spectroscopic reference of the solar system and its application to exoplanet direct imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a calibrated database of reflectance spectra for the solar system planets (i.e., Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune) and for Titan, spanning from the ultraviolet to the near infrared. We considered data collected over 60 years of planetary observations, employing a broad range of geometries and facilities (spacecraft and ground-based observatories). To correct for differences in observational geometries and data quality, we adopted a two-step calibration process that standardized each spectrum to the planet's geometric albedo values and corrected for planetary heterogeneity and calibration effects. The calibrated datasets were then combined across wavelengths, leading to a reference composite reflectance spectrum for each planet. As a test of this spectral library for exoplanetary research, we simulated direct imaging observations of the Proxima Centauri and HD 219134 systems as solar system analogs, as well as the solar system at a distance of 10 parsecs. We also explored the detection limitations of direct imaging instruments imposed by the inner and outer working angles for Earth and Jupiter-like exoplanets as a function of system distance. Additionally, we used the visible light portion of the results to produce realistic color reconstructions of each planet. Standardizing reflectance spectra in this work improves our baseline for interpreting new reflected light observations of exoplanets through comparative planetology. This spectral library can then serve as a calibrated and validated reference in the modeling and preparation for the characterization of exoplanet atmospheres with future direct imaging missions and for astronomical studies of the solar system.</description>
