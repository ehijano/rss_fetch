      <title>X-ray resonance therapy with parametric X-ray radiation (PXR) for sulfur-containing tumor tissues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of usage of the parametric X-ray radiation (PXR) for the selective therapy of superficial sulfur-containing tumor tissues. In these tissues, the concentration of sulfur atoms is significantly higher than in healthy ones. Accordingly, the destruction of cancer cells is caused by the ionization of sulfur atoms. The selective nature of the therapy is determined by the narrow spectral-angular distribution of the PXR photon beam and the resonant absorption of radiation by sulfur atoms. This leads to a significant decrease in the total dose required to achieve the desired effects compared to irradiation with conventional X-ray tubes or electron accelerators.</description>

      <title>Mapping gene expression dynamics to developmental phenotypes with information entropy analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of multicellular organisms entails a deep connection between time-dependent biochemical processes taking place at the subcellular level, and the resulting macroscopic phenotypes that arise in populations of up to trillions of cells. A statistical mechanics of developmental processes would help to understand how microscopic genotypes map onto macroscopic phenotypes, a general goal across biology. Here we follow this approach, hypothesizing that development should be understood as a thermodynamic transition between non-equilibrium states. We test this hypothesis in the context of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, a model organism used widely in genetics and developmental biology for over a century. Applying a variety of information-theoretic measures to public transcriptomics datasets of whole fly embryos during development, we show that the global temporal dynamics of gene expression can be understood as a process that probabilistically guides embryonic dynamics across macroscopic phenotypic stages. In particular, we demonstrate signatures of irreversibility in the information complexity of transcriptomic dynamics, as measured mainly by the permutation entropy of indexed ensembles (PI entropy). Our results show that the dynamics of PI entropy correlate strongly with developmental stages. Overall, this is a test case in applying information complexity analysis to relate the statistical mechanics of biomarkers to macroscopic developmental dynamics.</description>

      <title>Scarce Data, Noisy Inferences, and Overfitting: The Hidden Flaws in Ecological Dynamics Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metagenomic data has significantly advanced microbiome research by employing ecological models, particularly in personalised medicine. The generalised Lotka-Volterra (gLV) model is commonly used to understand microbial interactions and predict ecosystem dynamics. However, gLV models often fail to capture complex interactions, especially when data is limited or noisy. This study critically assesses the effectiveness of gLV and similar models using Bayesian inference and a model reduction method based on information theory. We found that ecological data often leads to non-interpretability and overfitting due to limited information, noisy data, and parameter sloppiness. Our results highlight the need for simpler models that align with the available data and propose a distribution-based approach to better capture ecosystem diversity, stability, and competition. These findings challenge current bottom-up ecological modelling practices and aim to shift the focus toward a Statistical Mechanics view of ecology based on distributions of parameters.</description>

      <title>Simultaneously Determining Regional Heterogeneity and Connection Directionality from Neural Activity and Symmetric Connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spatiotemporal patterns of neural dynamics are jointly shaped by directed structural interactions and heterogeneous intrinsic features of the neural components. Despite well-developed methods for estimating directionality in network connections from network of homogeneous nodes, how local heterogeneity impacts on directionality estimation remains poorly understood. In particular, the role of excitatory-inhibitory interactions in shaping network directionality and how these interactions should be incorporated into reconstruction frameworks remain largely unexplored. Here, we present a novel reconstruction framework that simultaneously estimates effective heterogeneity across network nodes and asymmetric network connections from neural activity and symmetric connection, both are assessible in experimental data, validated using macaque cortical connectivity data and several circuit models. We found that the estimated local heterogeneity remains consistent across various forms of parameterized local circuit heterogeneity. Furthermore, we demonstrated and quantified how hidden local inhibitory populations only modify within-region connection strengths, elucidating the functional equivalence between dynamics of excitatory-inhibitory networks and purely observing excitatory networks when estimating effective heterogeneity and asymmetry. Finally, we demonstrated the sampling interval effect in estimating network interactions with respect to the sampling resolution. Together, our results not only provide a unified framework for evaluating relative functional contributions of local heterogeneity and asymmetry to overall system dynamics but also reveal the fundamental limitations and scaling principles in reconstructing neural circuit connectivity from experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Engineering the uncontrollable: Steering noisy spin-correlated radical-pairs with coherent and incoherent control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum control of spin-correlated radical pairs (SCRPs) holds promise for the targeted manipulation of magnetic field effects, with potential applications ranging from the design of noise-resilient quantum information processors to genetically encodable quantum sensors. However, achieving precise handles over the intricate interplay between coherent electron spin dynamics and incoherent relaxation processes in photoexcited radical-pair reactions requires tractable approaches for numerically obtaining controls for large, complex open quantum systems. Employing techniques relying on full Liouville-space propagators becomes computationally infeasible for large spin systems of realistic complexity. Here, we demonstrate how a control engineering approach based on the Pontryagin Maximum Principle (PMP) can offer a viable alternative by reporting on the successful application of PMP-optimal control to steer the coherent and incoherent spin dynamics of noisy radical pairs. This enables controls for prototypical radical-pair models that exhibit robustness in the face of relevant noise sources and paves the way to incoherent control of radical-pair spin dynamics.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of Darwinian selection in molecular replicators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.02809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.02809v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the relationship between thermodynamics, fitness, and Darwinian selection in autocatalytic molecular replicators. We uncover a thermodynamic bound that relates fitness, replication rate, and thermodynamic affinity of replication. This bound applies to a broad range of systems, including elementary and non-elementary autocatalytic reactions, polymer-based replicators, and certain kinds of autocatalytic sets. In addition, we show that the critical selection coefficient (the minimal fitness difference visible to selection) is bounded by a simple function of the affinity. Our results imply fundamental thermodynamic bounds on selection strength in molecular evolution, complementary to other bounds that arise from finite population sizes and error thresholds. These bounds may be relevant for understanding thermodynamic constraints faced by early replicators at the origin of life. We illustrate our approach on several examples, including a classic model of replicators in a chemostat.</description>

      <title>Attractive and repulsive terms in multi-filament dispersion interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00419v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Filamentary objects such as nano-wires, nanotubes and DNA are of current interest in physics, nanoscience, chemistry, biology and medicine. They can interact via strong, exceptionally long-ranged many-object van der Waals (vdW, dispersion) forces, causing them to cluster into multi-object bundles. We analyse their vdW interactions perturbatively, predicting $N$-object vdW energy contributions that alternate in sign with increasing $N$. Our findings are confirmed here via the first detailed analysis of a 4-cylinder vdW model. We also provide novel insights permitting these tendencies to be understood simply in terms of electronic screening and anti-screening. Our results suggest that a non-perturbative calculation will be required for reliable prediction of dispersion interactions in these ubiquitous systems.</description>

      <title>Enhanced dispersion of active microswimmers in confined flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the presence of a laminar shear flow, the diffusion of passive colloidal particles is enhanced in the direction parallel to the flow. This classical phenomenon is known as Taylor-Aris dispersion. Besides, microorganisms, such as active microswimmers, exhibit an effective diffusive behavior at long times. Combining the two ingredients above, a natural question then emerges on how the effective diffusion of active microswimmers is altered in shear flows -- a widespread situation in natural environments with practical implications, \textit{e.g.} regarding biofilm formation. In this Letter, we investigate the motility and dispersion of \textit{Chlamydomonas reinhardtii} microalgae, within a rectangular microfluidic channel subjected to a sinusoidal Poiseuille flow. Using high-resolution optical microscopy and a particle-tracking algorithm, we reconstruct individual trajectories in various flow conditions and statistically analyze them through moment theory and sliding windowed demodulation. We find that the velocity fluctuations and the dispersion coefficient increase as the flow amplitude is increased, with only weak dependencies on the flow periodicity. Importantly, our results demonstrate that the generalization of Taylor-Aris law to active particles is valid.</description>

      <title>The Limits of Inference in Complex Systems: When Stochastic Models Become Indistinguishable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robust inference for stochastic dynamical systems is often hampered by sparse sampling and the absence of closed-form likelihoods. We introduce a Monte Carlo path-inference framework that leverages full-path statistics and bridge processes to deliver reliable parameter estimation and model selection from coarsely sampled time series, without requiring analytical solutions. Crucially, we couple mechanistic stochastic models with their inference procedures to quantify how experimental design -specifically, sampling frequency and dataset size- governs estimator precision and model distinguishability. This analysis reveals optimal sampling regimes and sharp, resolution-dependent limits beyond which competing models become empirically indistinguishable. We validate the approach across four disparate systems -trajectories of optically trapped particles, human microbiome dynamics, social-media topic mentions, and forest population time series- recovering parameters and identifying when inference is fundamentally constrained by measurement resolution, thereby clarifying ongoing debates about dominant noise sources in these systems. Together, these results establish path-based Monte Carlo as a practical, general tool for inference and model discrimination in complex systems and provide principled guidelines for designing measurements that maximize information under real-world constraints.</description>
