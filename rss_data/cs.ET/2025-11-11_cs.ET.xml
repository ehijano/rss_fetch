      <title>System Modeling of Microfluidic Molecular Communication: A Markov Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a Markov-based system model for microfluidic molecular communication (MC) channels. By discretizing the advection-diffusion dynamics, the proposed model establishes a physically consistent state-space formulation. The transition matrix explicitly captures diffusion, advective flow, reversible binding, and flow-out effects. The resulting discrete-time formulation enables analytical characterization of both transient and equilibrium responses through a linear system representation. Numerical results verify that the proposed framework accurately reproduces channel behaviors across a wide range of flow conditions, providing a tractable basis for the design and analysis of MC systems in microfluidic environments.</description>

      <title>Differential Space-Time Block Coding for Phase-Unsynchronized Cell-Free MIMO Downlink</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the downlink of a cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) system, spectral efficiency gains critically rely on joint coherent transmission, as all access points (APs) must align their transmitted signals in phase at the user equipment (UE). Achieving such phase alignment is technically challenging, as it requires tight synchronization among geographically distributed APs. In this paper, we address this issue by introducing a differential space-time block coding (DSTBC) approach that bypasses the need for AP phase synchronization. We first provide analytic bounds to the achievable spectral efficiency of CF-mMIMO with phase-unsynchronized APs. Then, we propose a DSTBC-based transmission scheme specifically tailored to CF-mMIMO, which operates without channel state information and does not require any form of phase synchronization among the APs. We derive a closed-form expression for the resulting signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), enabling quantitative comparisons among different DSTBC schemes. Numerical simulations confirm that phase misalignments can significantly impair system performance. In contrast, the proposed DSTBC scheme successfully mitigates these effects, achieving performance comparable to that of fully synchronized systems.</description>

      <title>AcousTools: A `Full-Stack', Python-Based, Acoustic Holography Library</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Acoustic Holography is an emerging field where mid-air ultrasound is controlled and manipulated for novel and exciting applications. These range from mid-air haptics, volumetric displays, contactless fabrication, and even chemical and biomedical applications such as drug delivery. To develop these applications, a software framework to predict acoustic behaviour and simulating resulting effects, such as applied forces or scattering patterns is desirable. There have been various software libraries and platforms that attempt to fill this role, but there is yet to be a single piece of software that acts as a 'full-stack' solution. We define this full-stack as the process from abstraction to physicalisation starting with setup, modelling acoustic propagation, transducer phase retrieval, sound field analysis, and control of the acoustic holographic hardware itself. Existing methods fail to fulfil one or more of these categories. To address this, we present AcousTools, a Python-based acoustic holography library, designed to support the full suite of acoustic holographic applications and we show AcousTools's ability to meet each step of the full-stack's requirements. AcousTools has the potential to become the standard code library for acoustic holography, with the uniquely complete suite of features wrapped in a language that is known to be easy to use, AcousTools will increase the ability for researchers to develop novel applications as well as accurately review other's work. The full-stack, aside from software, will also be useful for researchers - providing a way to view and compare methodologies by understanding where they fit into the stack.</description>

      <title>QAGT-MLP: An Attention-Based Graph Transformer for Small and Large-Scale Quantum Error Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Noisy quantum devices demand error-mitigation techniques to be accurate yet simple and efficient in terms of number of shots and processing time. Many established approaches (e.g., extrapolation and quasi-probability cancellation) impose substantial execution or calibration overheads, while existing learning-based methods have difficulty scaling to large and deep circuits. In this research, we introduce QAGT-MLP: an attention-based graph transformer tailored for small- and large-scale quantum error mitigation (QEM). QAGT-MLP encodes each quantum circuit as a graph whose nodes represent gate instances and whose edges capture qubit connectivity and causal adjacency. A dual-path attention module extracts features around measured qubits at two scales or contexts: 1) graph-wide global structural context; and 2) fine-grained local lightcone context. These learned representations are concatenated with circuit-level descriptor features and the circuit noisy expected values, then they are passed to a lightweight MLP to predict the noise-mitigated values. On large-scale 100-qubit Trotterized 1D Transverse-Field Ising Models -- TFIM circuits -- the proposed QAGT-MLP outperformed state-of-the-art learning baselines in terms of mean error and error variability, demonstrating strong validity and applicability in real-world QEM scenarios under matched shot budgets. By using attention to fuse global structures with local lightcone neighborhoods, QAGT-MLP achieves high mitigation quality without the increasing noise scaling or resource demand required by classical QEM pipelines, while still offering a scalable and practical path to QEM in modern and future quantum workloads.</description>

      <title>Disturbance-based Discretization, Differentiable IDS Channel, and an IDS-Correcting Code for DNA-based Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18929v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With recent advancements in next-generation data storage, especially in biological molecule-based storage, insertion, deletion, and substitution (IDS) error-correcting codes have garnered increased attention. However, a universal method for designing tailored IDS-correcting codes across varying channel settings remains underexplored. We present an autoencoder-based approach, THEA-code, aimed at efficiently generating IDS-correcting codes for complex IDS channels. In the work, a disturbance-based discretization is proposed to discretize the features of the autoencoder, and a simulated differentiable IDS channel is developed as a differentiable alternative for IDS operations. These innovations facilitate the successful convergence of the autoencoder, producing channel-customized IDS-correcting codes that demonstrate commendable performance across complex IDS channels, particularly in realistic DNA-based storage channels.</description>

      <title>From GPUs to RRAMs: Distributed In-Memory Primal-Dual Hybrid Gradient Method for Solving Large-Scale Linear Optimization Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21137v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The exponential growth of computational workloads is surpassing the capabilities of conventional architectures, which are constrained by fundamental limits. In-memory computing (IMC) with RRAM provides a promising alternative by providing analog computations with significant gains in latency and energy use. However, existing algorithms developed for conventional architectures do not translate to IMC, particularly for constrained optimization problems where frequent matrix reprogramming remains cost-prohibitive for IMC applications. Here we present a distributed in-memory primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) method, specifically co-designed for arrays of RRAM devices. Our approach minimizes costly write cycles, incorporates robustness against device non-idealities, and leverages a symmetric block-matrix formulation to unify operations across distributed crossbars. We integrate a physics-based simulation framework called MELISO+ to evaluate performance under realistic device conditions. Benchmarking against GPU-accelerated solvers on large-scale linear programs demonstrates that our RRAM-based solver achieves comparable accuracy with up to three orders of magnitude reductions in energy consumption and latency. These results demonstrate the first PDHG-based LP solver implemented on RRAMs, showcasing the transformative potential of algorithm-hardware co-design for solving large-scale optimization through distributed in-memory computing.</description>
