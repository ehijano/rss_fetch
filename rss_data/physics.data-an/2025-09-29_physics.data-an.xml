      <title>Generalizations of Langbein's Formula under Non-Stationarity, Mixed Populations, and Over- or Under-Dispersion in the Number of Exceedances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since its publication in 1949, Langbein's formula has been applied ubiquitously in both research documents and national guidelines concerning frequency analyses (FAs) of hydrologic extremes. Given a time series of independent peak-over-threshold (POT) events and the corresponding annual maxima (AM) series-defined as the subset of extremes representing the largest event in each year-the formula provides a theoretical relationship between the return period T derived from the AM series and the average recurrence interval ARI from the POT series, for any fixed event magnitude. Despite the minimal assumptions required-specifically, that exceedance counts follow a homogeneous Poisson process-there are real-world situations where the validity of the formula may be compromised. Typical cases include non-stationary processes, mixed-event populations, and over- or under-dispersion in exceedance counts. In this work, we extend Langbein's formula to account for these three cases. We demonstrate that, with appropriate adaptations to the definitions of T and ARI, the traditional functional form of Langbein's relationship remains valid for non-stationary processes and mixed populations. However, accounting for dispersion effects in exceedance counts requires a generalization of Langbein's relationship, of which the traditional version represents a limiting case.</description>

      <title>Network Inequality through Preferential Attachment, Triadic Closure, and Homophily</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inequalities in social networks arise from linking mechanisms, such as preferential attachment (connecting to popular nodes), homophily (connecting to similar others), and triadic closure (connecting through mutual contacts). While preferential attachment mainly drives degree inequality and homophily drives segregation, their three-way interaction remains understudied. This gap limits our understanding of how network inequalities emerge. Here, we introduce PATCH, a network growth model combining the three mechanisms to understand how they create disparities among two groups in synthetic networks. Extensive simulations confirm that homophily and preferential attachment increase segregation and degree inequalities, while triadic closure has countervailing effects: conditional on the other mechanisms, it amplifies population-wide degree inequality while reducing segregation and between-group degree disparities. We demonstrate PATCH's explanatory potential on fifty years of Physics and Computer Science collaboration and citation networks exhibiting persistent gender disparities. PATCH accounts for these gender disparities with the joint presence of preferential attachment, moderate gender homophily, and varying levels of triadic closure. By connecting mechanisms to observed inequalities, PATCH shows how their interplay sustains group disparities and provides a framework for designing interventions that promote more equitable social networks.</description>

      <title>Robustness of 'small' networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling how networks change under structural perturbations can yield foundational insights into network robustness, which is critical in many real-world applications. The largest connected component is a popular measure of network performance. Percolation theory provides a theoretical framework to establish statistical properties of the largest connected component of large random graphs. However, this theoretical framework is typically only exact in the large-$\nodes$ limit, failing to capture the statistical properties of largest connected components in small networks, which many real-world networks are. We derive expected values for the largest connected component of small $G(\nodes,p)$ random graphs from which nodes are either removed uniformly at random or targeted by highest degree and compare these values with existing theory. We also visualize the performance of our expected values compared to existing theory for predicting the largest connected component of various real-world, small graphs.</description>

      <title>Event-based complexity in atmospheric turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the studies of Kolmogorov and Oboukhov in 1941, the problem of intermittent large velocity excursions was recognized to be one of the most intriguing and elusive aspects of turbulent flows. While many efforts were devoted since 1960s to the magnitude intermittency, related to the statistics of the large increments in the turbulent signals, the attention towards the so-called clustering intermittency has started to increase only in the last two decades, even if some pioneering studies were carried in previous years. The low attention towards the clustering intermittency is somewhat surprising, as intermittency itself is essentially defined as an alternance of extended quiescent periods/regions and short/small high activity periods/zones. It is then natural to characterize intermittency by means of events marked along the dependent variable axes, whatever time or space. Conversely, the concept of crucial events and of temporal complexity, related to non-trivial clustering properties of these same events, has been proposed as a general interpretative framework for the investigation of complex systems with metastable self-organizing dynamics. Without any claim to being complete, in this chapter we give a review of event-based complexity approaches used in literature for the description of turbulence in the planetary boundary layer. The main goal is to put a first bridge between turbulence studies exploiting event-based complexity approaches, such as clustering exponents and classical Oboukhov intermittency exponents, and studies about intermittent complex systems, where concepts and ideas developed in the fields of non-equilibrium statistical physics, probability theory and dynamical system theory are jointly exploited.</description>

      <title>Graph-based Analysis for Revealing the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background in Pulsar Timing Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) reveals valuable information about its origin and the Universe. The pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) are suitable indicators for detecting SGWB within the nano-Hertz frequency range. In this work, we propose a graph-based method implemented on the pulsar timing residuals (PTRs) for SGWB detection and examining uncertainties of its parameters. We construct a correlation graph with pulsars as its nodes, and analyze the graph-based summary statistics, which include topological and geometrical characteristics, for identifying SGWB in real and synthetic datasets. The effect of the number of pulsars, the observation time span, and the strength of the SGWB on the graph-based feature vector is evaluated. Our results demonstrate that the merit feature vector for common signal detection consists of the average clustering coefficient and the edge weight fluctuation. The SGWB detection conducted after the observation of a common signal and then exclusion of non-Hellings \&amp; Downs templates is performed by the second cumulant of edge weight for angular separation thresholds $\bar{\zeta}\gtrsim 40^{\circ}$. The lowest detectable value of SGWB strain amplitude utilizing our graph-based measures at the current PTAs sensitivity is $A_{\rm SGWB}\gtrsim 1.2\times 10^{-15}$. Fisher forecasts confirmed that the uncertainty levels of $\log_{10} A_{\rm SGWB}$ and spectral index reach $2.2\%$ and $28.3\%$, respectively, at $2\sigma$ confidence interval. Evidence for an SGWB at the $3\sigma$ level is obtained by applying our graph-based method to the NANOGrav 15-year dataset.</description>

      <title>Eigenvector overlaps of sample covariance matrices with intersecting time periods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute exactly the overlap between the eigenvectors of two large empirical covariance ma- trices computed over intersecting time intervals, generalizing the results obtained previously for non-intersecting intervals. Our method relies on a particular form of Girko linearisation and ex- tended local laws. We check our results numerically and apply them to financial data.</description>

      <title>Compact 15-minute cities are greener</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The 15-minute city concept, which advocates for cities where essential services are accessible within a 15-minute walk or bike ride, has gained significant attention in recent years. However, despite being celebrated for promoting sustainability, large-scale empirical evaluations of the effectiveness of the 15-minute concept in reducing emissions are lacking. To address this gap, we investigate whether cities with better walking accessibility, like 15-minute cities, are associated with lower transportation emissions. Comparing 664 cities worldwide, we find that cities with better walking accessibility to services emit less CO$_2$ per capita for transport. Moreover, we observe that among cities with similar average accessibility, those that span larger areas tend to emit more. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of decentralised urban planning, especially the proximity-based 15-minute city, in promoting sustainable mobility. However, they also emphasise the need to integrate local accessibility with urban compactness and efficient public transit, which are vital in large cities.</description>

      <title>Dimensionless learning based on information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03927v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dimensional analysis is one of the most fundamental tools for understanding physical systems. However, the construction of dimensionless variables, as guided by the Buckingham-$\pi$ theorem, is not uniquely determined. Here, we introduce IT-$\pi$, a model-free method that combines dimensionless learning with the principles of information theory. Grounded in the irreducible error theorem, IT-$\pi$ identifies dimensionless variables with the highest predictive power by measuring their shared information content. The approach is able to rank variables by predictability, identify distinct physical regimes, uncover self-similar variables, determine the characteristic scales of the problem, and extract its dimensionless parameters. IT-$\pi$ also provides a bound of the minimum predictive error achievable across all possible models, from simple linear regression to advanced deep learning techniques, naturally enabling a definition of model efficiency. We benchmark IT-$\pi$ across different cases and demonstrate that it offers superior performance and capabilities compared to existing tools. The method is also applied to conduct dimensionless learning for supersonic turbulence, aerodynamic drag on both smooth and irregular surfaces, magnetohydrodynamic power generation, and laser-metal interaction.</description>
