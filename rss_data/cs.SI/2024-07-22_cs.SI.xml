      <title>A Model of Proactive Safety Based on Knowledge Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In contemporary safety management, despite the abundance of safety data gathered from routine operation tasks and safety management activities, actions cannot prevent all accidents effectively due to a lack of effective utilization of these data as safety knowledge. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a hybrid proactive safety model integrating data-driven and knowledge-driven approaches. The model comprises three main steps: proactive safety actions to generate safety data, data-driven approaches to mine safety data, and knowledge-driven approaches to depicting risk knowledge graphs. Application of this model to a continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) scenario demonstrates its efficacy in identifying and addressing safety issues proactively. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed proactive safety model, suggesting its endorsement within both academic and industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Pre-Training and Prompting for Few-Shot Node Classification on Text-Attributed Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The text-attributed graph (TAG) is one kind of important real-world graph-structured data with each node associated with raw texts. For TAGs, traditional few-shot node classification methods directly conduct training on the pre-processed node features and do not consider the raw texts. The performance is highly dependent on the choice of the feature pre-processing method. In this paper, we propose P2TAG, a framework designed for few-shot node classification on TAGs with graph pre-training and prompting. P2TAG first pre-trains the language model (LM) and graph neural network (GNN) on TAGs with self-supervised loss. To fully utilize the ability of language models, we adapt the masked language modeling objective for our framework. The pre-trained model is then used for the few-shot node classification with a mixed prompt method, which simultaneously considers both text and graph information. We conduct experiments on six real-world TAGs, including paper citation networks and product co-purchasing networks. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms existing graph few-shot learning methods on these datasets with +18.98% ~ +35.98% improvements.</description>

      <title>Link Polarity Prediction from Sparse and Noisy Labels via Multiscale Social Balance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Signed Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs) have recently gained attention as an effective tool for several learning tasks on signed networks, i.e., graphs where edges have an associated polarity. One of these tasks is to predict the polarity of the links for which this information is missing, starting from the network structure and the other available polarities. However, when the available polarities are few and potentially noisy, such a task becomes challenging.
  In this work, we devise a semi-supervised learning framework that builds around the novel concept of \emph{multiscale social balance} to improve the prediction of link polarities in settings characterized by limited data quantity and quality. Our model-agnostic approach can seamlessly integrate with any SGNN architecture, dynamically reweighting the importance of each data sample while making strategic use of the structural information from unlabeled edges combined with social balance theory.
  Empirical validation demonstrates that our approach outperforms established baseline models, effectively addressing the limitations imposed by noisy and sparse data. This result underlines the benefits of incorporating multiscale social balance into SGNNs, opening new avenues for robust and accurate predictions in signed network analysis.</description>

      <title>A Large-scale Benchmark Dataset for Commuting Origin-destination Matrix Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The commuting origin-destination~(OD) matrix is a critical input for urban planning and transportation, providing crucial information about the population residing in one region and working in another within an interested area. Despite its importance, obtaining and updating the matrix is challenging due to high costs and privacy concerns. This has spurred research into generating commuting OD matrices for areas lacking historical data, utilizing readily available information via computational models. In this regard, existing research is primarily restricted to only a single or few large cities, preventing these models from being applied effectively in other areas with distinct characteristics, particularly in towns and rural areas where such data is urgently needed. To address this, we propose a large-scale dataset comprising commuting OD matrices for 3,233 diverse areas around the U.S. For each area, we provide the commuting OD matrix, combined with regional attributes including demographics and point-of-interests of each region in that area. We believe this comprehensive dataset will facilitate the development of more generalizable commuting OD matrix generation models, which can capture various patterns of distinct areas. Additionally, we use this dataset to benchmark a set of commuting OD generation models, including physical models, element-wise predictive models, and matrix-wise generative models. Surprisingly, we find a new paradigm, which considers the whole area combined with its commuting OD matrix as an attributed directed weighted graph and generates the weighted edges based on the node attributes, can achieve the optimal. This may inspire a new research direction from graph learning in this field.</description>

      <title>Small but not least changes: The Art of Creating Disruptive Innovations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the ever-evolving landscape of technology, product innovation thrives on replacing outdated technologies with groundbreaking ones or through the ingenious recombination of existing technologies. Our study embarks on a revolutionary journey by genetically representing products, extracting their chromosomal data, and constructing a comprehensive phylogenetic network of automobiles. We delve deep into the technological features that shape innovation, pinpointing the ancestral roots of products and mapping out intricate product-family triangles. By leveraging the similarities within these triangles, we introduce a pioneering "Product Disruption Index"-inspired by the CD index (Funk and Owen-Smith, 2017)-to quantify a product's disruptiveness. Our approach is rigorously validated against the scientifically recognized trend of decreasing disruptiveness over time (Park et al., 2023) and through compelling case studies. Our statistical analysis reveals a fascinating insight: disruptive product innovations often stem from minor, yet crucial, modifications.</description>

      <title>Meta-GPS++: Enhancing Graph Meta-Learning with Contrastive Learning and Self-Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Node classification is an essential problem in graph learning. However, many models typically obtain unsatisfactory performance when applied to few-shot scenarios. Some studies have attempted to combine meta-learning with graph neural networks to solve few-shot node classification on graphs. Despite their promising performance, some limitations remain. First, they employ the node encoding mechanism of homophilic graphs to learn node embeddings, even in heterophilic graphs. Second, existing models based on meta-learning ignore the interference of randomness in the learning process. Third, they are trained using only limited labeled nodes within the specific task, without explicitly utilizing numerous unlabeled nodes. Finally, they treat almost all sampled tasks equally without customizing them for their uniqueness. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework for few-shot node classification called Meta-GPS++. Specifically, we first adopt an efficient method to learn discriminative node representations on homophilic and heterophilic graphs. Then, we leverage a prototype-based approach to initialize parameters and contrastive learning for regularizing the distribution of node embeddings. Moreover, we apply self-training to extract valuable information from unlabeled nodes. Additionally, we adopt S$^2$ (scaling &amp; shifting) transformation to learn transferable knowledge from diverse tasks. The results on real-world datasets show the superiority of Meta-GPS++. Our code is available here.</description>

      <title>Political Leanings in Web3 Betting: Decoding the Interplay of Political and Profitable Motives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Harnessing the transparent blockchain user behavior data, we construct the Political Betting Leaning Score (PBLS) to measure political leanings based on betting within Web3 prediction markets. Focusing on Polymarket and starting from the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election, we synthesize behaviors over 15,000 addresses across 4,500 events and 8,500 markets, capturing the intensity and direction of their political leanings by the PBLS. We validate the PBLS through internal consistency checks and external comparisons. We uncover relationships between our PBLS and betting behaviors through over 800 features capturing various behavioral aspects. A case study of the 2022 U.S. Senate election further demonstrates the ability of our measurement while decoding the dynamic interaction between political and profitable motives. Our findings contribute to understanding decision-making in decentralized markets, enhancing the analysis of behaviors within Web3 prediction environments. The insights of this study reveal the potential of blockchain in enabling innovative, multidisciplinary studies and could inform the development of more effective online prediction markets, improve the accuracy of forecast, and help the design and optimization of platform mechanisms.

      <title>A Community-Centric Perspective for Characterizing and Detecting Anti-Asian Violence-Provoking Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Violence-provoking speech -- speech that implicitly or explicitly promotes violence against the members of the targeted community, contributed to a massive surge in anti-Asian crimes during the pandemic. While previous works have characterized and built tools for detecting other forms of harmful speech, like fear speech and hate speech, our work takes a community-centric approach to studying anti-Asian violence-provoking speech. Using data from ~420k Twitter posts spanning a 3-year duration (January 1, 2020 to February 1, 2023), we develop a codebook to characterize anti-Asian violence-provoking speech and collect a community-crowdsourced dataset to facilitate its large-scale detection using state-of-the-art classifiers. We contrast the capabilities of natural language processing classifiers, ranging from BERT-based to LLM-based classifiers, in detecting violence-provoking speech with their capabilities to detect anti-Asian hateful speech. In contrast to prior work that has demonstrated the effectiveness of such classifiers in detecting hateful speech ($F_1 = 0.89$), our work shows that accurate and reliable detection of violence-provoking speech is a challenging task ($F_1 = 0.69$). We discuss the implications of our findings, particularly the need for proactive interventions to support Asian communities during public health crises.

      <title>GraphScale: A Framework to Enable Machine Learning over Billion-node Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for supervised machine learning over graph-structured data, while sampling-based node representation learning is widely utilized in unsupervised learning. However, scalability remains a major challenge in both supervised and unsupervised learning for large graphs (e.g., those with over 1 billion nodes). The scalability bottleneck largely stems from the mini-batch sampling phase in GNNs and the random walk sampling phase in unsupervised methods. These processes often require storing features or embeddings in memory. In the context of distributed training, they require frequent, inefficient random access to data stored across different workers. Such repeated inter-worker communication for each mini-batch leads to high communication overhead and computational inefficiency.
  We propose GraphScale, a unified framework for both supervised and unsupervised learning to store and process large graph data distributedly. The key insight in our design is the separation of workers who store data and those who perform the training. This separation allows us to decouple computing and storage in graph training, thus effectively building a pipeline where data fetching and data computation can overlap asynchronously. Our experiments show that GraphScale outperforms state-of-the-art methods for distributed training of both GNNs and node embeddings. We evaluate GraphScale both on public and proprietary graph datasets and observe a reduction of at least 40% in end-to-end training times compared to popular distributed frameworks, without any loss in performance. While most existing methods don't support billion-node graphs for training node embeddings, GraphScale is currently deployed in production at TikTok enabling efficient learning over such large graphs.</description>

      <title>Large-scale Time-Varying Portfolio Optimisation using Graph Attention Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Apart from assessing individual asset performance, investors in financial markets also need to consider how a set of firms performs collectively as a portfolio. Whereas traditional Markowitz-based mean-variance portfolios are widespread, network-based optimisation techniques have built upon these developments. However, most studies do not contain firms at risk of default and remove any firms that drop off indices over a certain time. This is the first study to incorporate risky firms and use all the firms in portfolio optimisation. We propose and empirically test a novel method that leverages Graph Attention networks (GATs), a subclass of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). GNNs, as deep learning-based models, can exploit network data to uncover nonlinear relationships. Their ability to handle high-dimensional features and accommodate customised layers for specific purposes makes them particularly appealing for large-scale problems such as mid- and small-cap portfolio optimization. This study utilises 30 years of data on mid-cap firms, creating graphs of firms using distance correlation and the Triangulated Maximally Filtered Graph approach. These graphs are the inputs to a GAT model that we train using custom layers which impose weight and allocation constraints and a loss function derived from the Sharpe ratio, thus directly maximising portfolio risk-adjusted returns. This new model is benchmarked against a network characteristic-based portfolio, a mean variance-based portfolio, and an equal-weighted portfolio. The results show that the portfolio produced by the GAT-based model outperforms all benchmarks and is consistently superior to other strategies over a long period while also being informative of market dynamics.</description>

      <title>BotArtist: Generic approach for bot detection in Twitter via semi-automatic machine learning pipeline</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.00037v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Twitter, as one of the most popular social networks, provides a platform for communication and online discourse. Unfortunately, it has also become a target for bots and fake accounts, resulting in the spread of false information and manipulation. This paper introduces a semi-automatic machine learning pipeline (SAMLP) designed to address the challenges correlated with machine learning model development. Through this pipeline, we develop a comprehensive bot detection model named BotArtist, based on user profile features. SAMLP leverages nine distinct publicly available datasets to train the BotArtist model. To assess BotArtist's performance against current state-of-the-art solutions, we select 35 existing Twitter bot detection methods, each utilizing a diverse range of features. Our comparative evaluation of BotArtist and these existing methods, conducted across nine public datasets under standardized conditions, reveals that the proposed model outperforms existing solutions by almost 10%, in terms of F1-score, achieving an average score of 83.19 and 68.5 over specific and general approaches respectively. As a result of this research, we provide a dataset of the extracted features combined with BotArtist predictions over the 10.929.533 Twitter user profiles, collected via Twitter API during the 2022 Russo-Ukrainian War, over a 16-month period. This dataset was created in collaboration with [Shevtsov et al., 2022a] where the original authors share anonymized tweets on the discussion of the Russo-Ukrainian war with a total amount of 127.275.386 tweets. The combination of the existing text dataset and the provided labeled bot and human profiles will allow for the future development of a more advanced bot detection large language model in the post-Twitter API era.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Ideological Biases of Social Media Users</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humanity for centuries has perfected skills of interpersonal interactions and evolved patterns that enable people to detect lies and deceiving behavior of others in face-to-face settings. Unprecedented growth of people's access to mobile phones and social media raises an important question: How does this new technology influence people's interactions and support the use of traditional patterns? In this article, we answer this question for homophily-driven patterns in social media. In our previous studies, we found that, on a university campus, changes in student opinions were driven by the desire to hold popular opinions. Here, we demonstrate that the evolution of online platform-wide opinion groups is driven by the same desire. We focus on two social media: Twitter and Parler, on which we tracked the political biases of their users. On Parler, an initially stable group of Right-biased users evolved into a permanent Right-leaning echo chamber dominating weaker, transient groups of members with opposing political biases. In contrast, on Twitter, the initial presence of two large opposing bias groups led to the evolution of a bimodal bias distribution, with a high degree of polarization. We capture the movement of users from the initial to final bias groups during the tracking period. We also show that user choices are influenced by side-effects of homophily. Users entering the platform attempt to find a sufficiently large group whose members hold political biases within the range sufficiently close to their own. If successful, they stabilize their biases and become permanent members of the group. Otherwise, they leave the platform. We believe that the dynamics of users' behavior uncovered in this article create a foundation for technical solutions supporting social groups on social media and socially aware networks.</description>

      <title>FCS-HGNN: Flexible Multi-type Community Search in Heterogeneous Information Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08919v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Community search is a personalized community discovery problem designed to identify densely connected subgraphs containing the query node. Recently, community search in heterogeneous information networks (HINs) has received considerable attention. Existing methods typically focus on modeling relationships in HINs through predefined meta-paths or user-specified relational constraints. However, metapath-based methods are primarily designed to identify single-type communities with nodes of the same type rather than multi-type communities involving nodes of different types. Constraint-based methods require users to have a good understanding of community patterns to define a suitable set of relational constraints, which increases the burden on users. In this paper, we propose FCS-HGNN, a novel method for flexibly identifying both single-type and multi-type communities in HINs. Specifically, FCS-HGNN extracts complementary information from different views and dynamically considers the contribution of each relation instead of treating them equally, thereby capturing more fine-grained heterogeneous information. Furthermore, to improve efficiency on large-scale graphs, we further propose LS-FCS-HGNN, which incorporates i) the neighbor sampling strategy to improve training efficiency, and ii) the depth-based heuristic search strategy to improve query efficiency. We conducted extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority of our proposed methods over state-of-the-art methods, achieving average improvements of 14.3% and 11.1% on single-type and multi-type communities, respectively.</description>

      <title>Quantifying metadata-block structure relationships in networks using description length</title>

Abstract: Network analysis is often enriched by including an examination of node metadata. In the context of understanding the mesoscale of networks it is often assumed that node groups based on metadata and node groups based on connectivity patterns are intrinsically linked. Recently, this assumption has been challenged and it has been demonstrated that metadata might be entirely unrelated to structure or, similarly, multiple sets of metadata might be relevant to the structure of a network in different ways. We propose the metablox tool to quantify the relationship between a network's node metadata and its mesoscale structure, measuring the strength of the relationship and the type of structural arrangement exhibited by the metadata. Our tool incorporates a way to distinguish significantly relevant relationships and can be used as part of systematic meta analyses comparing large numbers of networks, which we demonstrate on a number of synthetic and empirical networks.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Use of Abusive Generative AI Models on Civitai</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rise of generative AI is transforming the landscape of digital imagery, and exerting a significant influence on online creative communities. This has led to the emergence of AI-Generated Content (AIGC) social platforms, such as Civitai. These distinctive social platforms allow users to build and share their own generative AI models, thereby enhancing the potential for more diverse artistic expression. Designed in the vein of social networks, they also provide artists with the means to showcase their creations (generated from the models), engage in discussions, and obtain feedback, thus nurturing a sense of community. Yet, this openness also raises concerns about the abuse of such platforms, e.g., using models to disseminate deceptive deepfakes or infringe upon copyrights. To explore this, we conduct the first comprehensive empirical study of an AIGC social platform, focusing on its use for generating abusive content. As an exemplar, we construct a comprehensive dataset covering Civitai, the largest available AIGC social platform. Based on this dataset of 87K models and 2M images, we explore the characteristics of content and discuss strategies for moderation to better govern these platforms.</description>

      <title>Degree distributions in networks: beyond the power law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.03073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.03073v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The power law is useful in describing count phenomena such as network degrees and word frequencies. With a single parameter, it captures the main feature that the frequencies are linear on the log-log scale. Nevertheless, there have been criticisms of the power law, for example that a threshold needs to be pre-selected without its uncertainty quantified, that the power law is simply inadequate, and that subsequent hypothesis tests are required to determine whether the data could have come from the power law. We propose a modelling framework that combines two different generalisations of the power law, namely the generalised Pareto distribution and the Zipf-polylog distribution, to resolve these issues. The proposed mixture distributions are shown to fit the data well and quantify the threshold uncertainty in a natural way. A model selection step embedded in the Bayesian inference algorithm further answers the question whether the power law is adequate.</description>

      <title>Who Shares Fake News? Uncovering Insights from Social Media Users' Post Histories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.10560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.10560v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose that social-media users' own post histories are an underused yet valuable resource for studying fake-news sharing. By extracting textual cues from their prior posts, and contrasting their prevalence against random social-media users and others (e.g., those with similar socio-demographics, political news-sharers, and fact-check sharers), researchers can identify cues that distinguish fake-news sharers, predict those most likely to share fake news, and identify promising constructs to build interventions. Our research includes studies along these lines. In Study 1, we explore the distinctive language patterns of fake-news sharers, highlighting elements such as their higher use of anger and power-related words. In Study 2, we show that adding textual cues into predictive models enhances their accuracy in predicting fake-news sharers. In Study 3, we explore the contrasting role of trait and situational anger, and show trait anger is associated with a greater propensity to share both true and fake news. In Study 4, we introduce a way to authenticate Twitter accounts in surveys, before using it to explore how crafting an ad copy that resonates with users' sense of power encourages the adoption of fact-checking tools. We hope to encourage the use of novel research methods for marketers and misinformation researchers.</description>

      <title>Hyperdimensional Computing for Node Classification and Link Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel method for transductive learning on graphs using hyperdimensional representations. The proposed approach encodes data samples using random projections into a very high-dimensional space (hyperdimensional or HD space for short). It obviates the need for expensive iterative training of the sort required by deep learning methods. Specifically, we propose a Hyperdimensional Graph Learning (HDGL) algorithm. HDGL leverages the \emph{injectivity} property of node representations of a family of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to map node features to the HD space and then uses HD operators such as bundling and binding to aggregate information from the local neighborhood of each node. The resulting latent node representations support both node classification and link prediction tasks, unlike typical deep learning methods, which often require separate models for these tasks.
  We report results of experiments using widely used benchmark datasets which demonstrate that, on the node classification task, HDGL is competitive with the SOTA GNN methods with respect to accuracy, at substantially reduced computational cost. Furthermore, HDGL is well-suited for class incremental learning where the model has to learn to effectively discriminate between a growing number of classes. Our experiments also show that the HD representation constructed by HDGL supports link prediction at accuracies comparable to that of DeepWalk and related methods, although it falls short of SOTA Graph Neural Network (GNN) methods that rely on computationally expensive iterative training. We conclude that HDGL offers a computationally efficient alternative to graph neural networks for node classification, especially in settings that call for class-incremental learning or in applications that demand high accuracy models at significantly lower computational cost and learning time than possible with the SOTA GNNs.</description>

      <title>BrainStorm @ iREL at #SMM4H 2024: Leveraging Translation and Topical Embeddings for Annotation Detection in Tweets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of LLMs in various NLP tasks has sparked debates regarding their reliability, particularly in annotation tasks where biases and hallucinations may arise. In this shared task, we address the challenge of distinguishing annotations made by LLMs from those made by human domain experts in the context of COVID-19 symptom detection from tweets in Latin American Spanish. This paper presents BrainStorm @ iRELs approach to the SMM4H 2024 Shared Task, leveraging the inherent topical information in tweets, we propose a novel approach to identify and classify annotations, aiming to enhance the trustworthiness of annotated data.</description>
