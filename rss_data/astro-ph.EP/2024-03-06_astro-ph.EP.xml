      <title>The Epoch of Giant Planet Migration Planet Search Program. II. A Young Hot Jupiter Candidate around the AB Dor Member HS Psc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a hot Jupiter candidate orbiting HS Psc, a K7 ($\approx$0.7 $M_\odot$) member of the $\approx$130 Myr AB Doradus moving group. Using radial velocities over 4 years from the Habitable-zone Planet Finder spectrograph at the Hobby-Eberly Telescope, we find a periodic signal at $P_b = 3.986_{-0.003}^{+0.044}$ d. A joint Keplerian and Gaussian process stellar activity model fit to the RVs yields a minimum mass of $m_p \sin i = 1.5_{-0.4}^{+0.6}$ $M_\mathrm{Jup}$. The stellar rotation period is well constrained by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite light curve ($P_\mathrm{rot} = 1.086 \pm 0.003$ d) and is not an integer harmonic nor alias of the orbital period, supporting the planetary nature of the observed periodicity. HS Psc b joins a small population of young, close-in giant giant planet candidates with robust age and mass constraints and demonstrates that giant planets can either migrate to their close-in orbital separations by 130 Myr or form $in \; situ$. Given its membership in a young moving group, HS Psc represents an excellent target for follow-up observations to further characterize this young hot Jupiter, refine its orbital properties, and search for additional planets in the system.</description>

      <title>Breaking Giant Chains: Early-Stage Instabilities in Long-Period Giant Planet Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orbital evolution is a critical process that sculpts planetary systems, particularly during their early stages where planet-disk interactions are expected to lead to the formation of resonant chains. Despite the theoretically expected prominence of such configurations, they are scarcely observed among long-period giant exoplanets. This disparity suggests an evolutionary sequence wherein giant planet systems originate in compact multi-resonant configurations, but subsequently become unstable, eventually relaxing to wider orbits--a phenomenon mirrored in our own solar system's early history. In this work, we present a suite of N-body simulations that model the instability-driven evolution of giant planet systems, originating from resonant initial conditions, through phases of disk-dispersal and beyond. By comparing the period ratio and normalized angular momentum deficit distributions of our synthetic aggregate of systems with the observational census of long-period Jovian planets, we derive constraints on the expected rate of orbital migration, efficiency of gas-driven eccentricity damping, and typical initial multiplicity. Our findings reveal a distinct inclination towards densely-packed initial conditions, weak damping, and high giant planet multiplicities. Furthermore, our models indicate that resonant chain origins do not facilitate the formation of Hot Jupiters via the coplanar high-eccentricity pathway at rates high enough to explain their observed prevalence.</description>

      <title>Dimorphos orbit determination from mutual events photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The NASA Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) spacecraft successfully impacted the Didymos-Dimorphos binary asteroid system on 2022 September 26 UTC. We provide an update to its pre-impact mutual orbit and estimate the post-impact physical and orbital parameters, derived using ground-based photometric observations taken from July 2022 to February 2023. We found that the total change of the orbital period was $-33.240 \pm 0.072$ min. (all uncertainties are 3$\sigma$). We obtained the eccentricity of the post-impact orbit to be $0.028 \pm 0.016$ and the apsidal precession rate of $7.3 \pm 2.0$ deg./day from the impact to 2022 December 2. The data taken later in December to February suggest that the eccentricity dropped close to zero or the orbit became chaotic approximately 70 days after the impact. Most of the period change took place immediately after the impact but in a few weeks following the impact it was followed by additional change of $-27^{+19}_{-58}$ seconds or $-19 \pm 18$ seconds (the two values depend on the approach we used to describe the evolution of the orbital period after the impact -- an exponentially decreasing angular acceleration or an assumption of a constant orbital period, which changed abruptly some time after the impact, respectively). We estimate the pre-impact Dimorphos-Didymos size ratio was $0.223 \pm 0.012$ and the post-impact is $0.202 \pm 0.018$, which indicates a marginally significant reduction of Dimorphos' volume by ($9 \pm 9) \%$ as the result of the impact.</description>

      <title>Ices on pebbles in protoplanetary discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of solid macroscopic grains (pebbles) in protoplanetary discs is the first step toward planet formation. We aim to study the distribution of pebbles and the chemical composition of their ice mantles in a young protoplanetary disc. We use the two-dimensional hydrodynamical code FEOSAD in the thin-disc approximation, which is designed to model the global evolution of a self-gravitating viscous protoplanetary disc taking into account dust coagulation and fragmentation, thermal balance, and phase transitions and transport of the main volatiles (H$_2$O, CO$_{2}$, CH$_{4}$ and CO), which can reside in the gas, on small dust ($&lt;1$ $\mu$m), on grown dust ($&gt;1$ $\mu$m) and on pebbles. We model the dynamics of the protoplanetary disc from the cloud collapse to the 500 kyr moment. We determine the spatial distribution of pebbles and composition of their ice mantles and estimate the mass of volatiles on pebbles, grown dust and small dust. We show that pebbles form as early as 50 kyr after the disc formation and exist until the end of simulation (500 kyr), providing prerequisites for planet formation. All pebbles formed in the model are covered by icy mantles. Using a model considering accretion and desorption of volatiles onto dust/pebbles, we find that the ice mantles on pebbles consist mainly of H$_2$O and CO$_{2}$, and are carbon-depleted compared to gas and ices on small and grown dust, which contain more CO and CH$_4$. This suggests a possible dominance of oxygen in the composition of planets formed from pebbles under these conditions.</description>

      <title>Search for giant planets in M67 V: a warm Jupiter orbiting the turn-off star S1429</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planets orbiting members of open or globular clusters offer a great opportunity to study exoplanet populations systematically as stars within clusters provide a mostly homogeneous sample at least in chemical composition and stellar age. However, even though there have been coordinated efforts to search for exoplanets in stellar clusters, only a small number of planets has been detected. One successful example is the seven-year radial velocity (RV) survey "Search for giant planets in M67" of 88 stars in the open cluster M67 which led to the discovery of five giant planets, including three close-in ($P &lt; 10$ days) hot-Jupiters. In this work, we continue and extend the observation of stars in M67 with the aim to search for additional planets. We conducted spectroscopic observations with the HPF, HARPS, HARPS-North, and SOPHIE spectrographs of 11 stars in M67. Six of our targets showed a variation or long-term trends in their RV during the original survey, while the other five were not observed in the original sample bringing the total number of stars to 93. An analysis of the radial velocities revealed one additional planet around the turn-off point star S1429 and gave solutions for the orbits of stellar companions around S2207 and YBP2018. S1429 b is a warm Jupiter on a likely circular orbit with a period of $77.48_{-0.19}^{+0.18}$ days and a minimum mass $\text{M} \sin i = 1.80 \pm 0.2$ M$_\text{J}$. We update the hot-Jupiter occurrence rate in M67 to include the five new stars, deriving $4.2_{-2.3}^{+4.1} \%$ when considering all stars, and $5.4_{-3.0}^{+5.1} \%$ if binary star systems are removed.</description>

      <title>Global N-body Simulation of Gap Edge Structures Created by Perturbations from a Small Satellite Embedded in Saturn's Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations by the Voyager and Cassini spacecrafts have revealed various striking features of the gap structure in Saturn's ring, such as the density waves, sharp edge, and vertical wall structure. In order to explain these features in a single simulation, we perform a high-resolution (N~10^6-10^7) global full N-body simulation of gap formation by an embedded satellite considering gravitational interactions and inelastic collisions among all ring particles and the satellite, while these features have been mostly investigated separately with different theoretical approaches: the streamline models, 1D diffusion models, and local N-body simulation. As a first attempt of a series of papers, we here focus on the gap formation by separating satellite migration with fixing the satellite orbit in a Keplerian circular orbit. We reveal how the striking gap features - the density waves, sharp edge, and vertical wall structure - are simultaneously formed by an interplay of the satellite-ring and ring particle-particle interactions. In particular, we propose a new mechanism to quantitatively explain the creation of the vertical wall structure at the gap edge. Inelastic collisions between ring particles damp their eccentricity excited by the satellite's perturbations to enhance the surface density at the gap edge, making its sharp edges more pronounced. We find the eccentricity damping process inevitably raises the vertical wall structures the most effectively in the second epicycle waves. Particle-particle collisions generally convert their lateral epicyclic motion into vertical motion. Because the excited epicyclic motion is the greatest near the ring edge and the epicycle motions are aligned in the first waves, the conversion is the most efficient in the gap edge of the second waves and the wall height is scaled by the satellite Hill radius, which are consistent with the observations.</description>

      <title>Jovian sodium nebula and Io plasma torus S$^+$ and brightnesses 2017 -- 2023: insights into volcanic vs. sublimation supply</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present first results derived from the largest collection of contemporaneously recorded Jovian sodium nebula and Io plasma torus (IPT) in [S II] 673.1 nm images assembled to date. The data were recorded by the Planetary Science Institute's Io Input/Output observatory (IoIO) and provide important context to Io geologic and atmospheric studies as well as the Juno mission and supporting observations. Enhancements in the observed emission are common, typically lasting 1 -- 3 months, such that the average flux of material from Io is determined by the enhancements, not any quiescent state. The enhancements are not seen at periodicities associated with modulation in solar insolation of Io's surface, thus physical process(es) other than insolation-driven sublimation must ultimately drive the bulk of Io's atmospheric escape. We suggest that geologic activity, likely involving volcanic plumes, drives escape.</description>

      <title>The TESS SPOC FFI Target Sample Explored with Gaia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The TESS mission has provided the community with high-precision times series photometry for $\sim$2.8 million stars across the entire sky via the Full Frame Image (FFI) light curves produced by the TESS Science Processing Operations Centre (SPOC). This set of light curves is an extremely valuable resource for the discovery of transiting exoplanets and other stellar science. However, due to the sample selection, this set of light curves does not constitute a magnitude limited sample. In order to understand the effects of this sample selection, we use Gaia DR2 and DR3 to study the properties of the stars in the TESS-SPOC FFI light curve set, with the aim of providing vital context for further research using the sample. We report on the properties of the TESS-SPOC FFI Targets in Sectors 1 - 55 (covering Cycles 1 - 4). We cross-match the TESS-SPOC FFI Targets with the Gaia DR2 and DR3 catalogues of all targets brighter than Gaia magnitude 14 to understand the effects of sample selection on the overall stellar properties. This includes Gaia magnitude, parallax, radius, temperature, non-single star flags, luminosity, radial velocity and stellar surface gravity. In total, there are $\sim$16.7 million Gaia targets brighter than G=14, which when cross-matched with the TESS-SPOC FFI Targets leaves $\sim$2.75 million. We investigate the binarity of each TESS-SPOC FFI Target and calculate the radius detection limit from two detected TESS transits which could be detected around each target. Finally, we create a comprehensive main sequence TESS-SPOC FFI Target sample which can be utilised in future studies.</description>

      <title>Precise Time-Domain Asteroseismology and a Revised Target List for TESS Solar-Like Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The TESS mission has provided a wealth of asteroseismic data for solar-like oscillators. However, these data are subject to varying cadences, large gaps, and unequal sampling, which complicates analysis in the frequency domain. One solution is to model the oscillations in the time domain by treating them as stochastically damped simple harmonic oscillators through a linear combination of Gaussian Process kernels. We demonstrate this method on the well-studied subgiant star nu Indi and a sample of Kepler red giant stars observed by TESS, finding that the time domain model achieves an almost two-fold increase in accuracy for measuring {\nu}max compared to typical frequency domain methods. To apply the method to new detections, we use stellar parameters from Gaia DR3 and the TESS input catalog to calculate revised asteroseismic detection probabilities for all TESS input catalog targets with T&lt;12 mag and a predicted {\nu}max&gt;240{\mu}Hz. We also provide a software tool to calculate detection probabilities for any target of interest. Using the updated detection probabilities we show that time-domain asteroseismology is sensitive enough to recover marginal detections, which may explain the current small number of frequency-based detections of TESS oscillations compared to pre-flight expectations.</description>

      <title>New theoretical study of potassium perturbed by He and a comparison to laboratory spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on our new calculations of unified line profiles of K perturbed by He using ab initio potential data for the conditions prevailing in cool substellar brown dwarfs and hot dense planetary atmospheres with temperatures from $T_\mathrm{eff}$=500~$\ \mathrm{K}$ to 3000~$\ \mathrm{K}$. For such objects with atmospheres of H$_2$ and He, conventional laboratory absorption spectroscopy can be used to examine the line wings and test the line shape theories and molecular potentials. We find that an analytical Lorentzian profile is useful for a few cm$^{-1}$ from the line center, but not in the line wings, where the radiative transfer is a consequence of the K-He radiative collisions that are sensitive to the interaction potentials.
  Tables of the K--He absorption coefficients of the resonance lines allow accurate model atmospheres and synthetic spectra. For this purpose, we present new opacities from comprehensive line shape theory incorporating accurate ab initio potentials. Use of these new tables for the modeling of emergent spectra will be an improvement over previous line shape approximations based on incomplete or inaccurate potentials. We also present Lorentzian impact parameters obtained in the semi-classical and quantum theory for the K $4s-4p$ resonance line centered at 0.77~$\mu$m specifically for the line core regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1805.00023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exoplanets around different types of stars provide a window into the diverse environments in which planets form. This chapter describes the observed relations between exoplanet populations and stellar properties and how they connect to planet formation in protoplanetary disks. Giant planets occur more frequently around more metal-rich and more massive stars. These findings support the core accretion theory of planet formation, in which the cores of giant planets form more rapidly in more solid-rich and more gas-rich protoplanetary disks. Smaller planets, those with sizes roughly between Earth and Neptune, exhibit different scaling relations with stellar properties. These planets orbit stars with a range of metallicities and occur more frequently around lower mass stars, indicating that planet formation takes place in a wide range of environments. Within M dwarfs, both radial velocity and transit surveys show that planets are smaller and located closer to the star when the stellar mass is lower. Additions to the core accretion model, in particular pebble accretion, have shown success in explaining the enhanced planet formation efficiency around low mass stars.</description>

      <title>Dust release from cold ring particles as a mechanism of spoke formation in Saturn's rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.07008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spokes in Saturn's rings are radially-extended structures consisting of dust grains. Although spacecraft and space telescope observations have revealed various detailed features of the spokes and their time variation, their formation mechanism is still under debate. Previous models examined charging mechanisms to attempt at explaining dust release from cm-sized ring particles; however, the attempt has been unsuccessful, because the electrostatic force caused by such charging mechanisms is much weaker than the cohesive force acting on dust grains at ordinary conditions in the ring environment. Here we propose a novel model for the formation of the spokes, where the temperature dependence of cohesion plays an essential role. Ring particles with a temperature below 60K adsorb an O2 ring atmosphere, which facilitates release of dust grains from them by a reduction in the cohesive force between the grains and the particles on the morning ansa. Then, intense electrostatic forces sufficient to overcome the cohesive force are generated on the surface of ring particles and the released dust grains form the structure of spokes. Our model explains observational features of the spokes including their longitudinal location, lifetime, radial expansion velocity, and seasonality.</description>

      <title>Mercury's chaotic secular evolution as a subdiffusive process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mercury's orbit can destabilize, generally resulting in a collision with either Venus or the Sun. Chaotic evolution can cause g1 to decrease to the approximately constant value of g5 and create a resonance. Previous work has approximated the variation in g1 as stochastic diffusion, which leads to a phenomological model that can reproduce the Mercury instability statistics of secular and N-body models on timescales longer than 10 Gyr. Here we show that the diffusive model underpredicts the Mercury instability probability by a factor of 3-10,000 on timescales less than 5 Gyr, the remaining lifespan of the Solar System. This is because g1 exhibits larger variations on short timescales than the diffusive model would suggest. To better model the variations on short timescales, we build a new subdiffusive phenomological model for g1. Subdiffusion is similar to diffusion but exhibits larger displacements on short timescales and smaller displacements on long timescales. We choose model parameters based on the behavior of the g1 trajectories in the N-body simulations, leading to a tuned model that can reproduce Mercury instability statistics from 1-40 Gyr. This work motivates fundamental questions in Solar System dynamics: Why does subdiffusion better approximate the variation in g1 than standard diffusion? Why is there an upper bound on g1, but not a lower bound that would prevent it from reaching g5?</description>

      <title>The Metallicity Dimension of the Super Earth-Cold Jupiter Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16691</link>

Abstract: The correlation between close-in super Earths and distant cold Jupiters in planetary systems has important implications for their formation and evolution. In contrary to some earlier findings, a recent study conducted by Bonomo et al.\ suggests that the occurrence of cold Jupiter companions is not excessive in super Earth systems. Here we show that this discrepancy can be seen as a Simpson's paradox and is resolved once the metallicity dependence of the super Earth--cold Jupiter relation is taken into account. A common feature is noticed that almost all the cold Jupiter detections with inner super Earth companions are found around metal-rich stars. Focusing on the Sun-like hosts with super-solar metallicities, we show that the frequency of cold Jupiters conditioned on the presence of inner super Earths is $39_{-11}^{+12}\%$, whereas the frequency of cold Jupiters in the same metallicity range is no more than $20\%$. Therefore, the occurrences of close-in super Earths and distant cold Jupiters appear correlated around metal-rich hosts. The relation between the two types of planets remains unclear for stars with metal-poor hosts due to the limited sample size and the much lower occurrence rate of cold Jupiters, but a correlation between the two cannot be ruled out.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Architectures of S-type Transiting Planets in Binaries I: Target Selection using Hipparcos and Gaia proper motion anomalies</title>

Abstract: The effect of stellar multiplicity on planetary architecture and orbital dynamics provides an important context for exoplanet demographics. We present a volume-limited catalog up to 300 pc of 66 stars hosting planets and planet candidates from Kepler, K2 and TESS with significant Hipparcos-Gaia proper motion anomalies, which indicate the presence of companions. We assess the reliability of each transiting planet candidate using ground-based follow-up observations, and find that the TESS Objects of Interest (TOIs) with significant proper motion anomalies show nearly four times more false positives due to Eclipsing Binaries compared to TOIs with marginal proper motion anomalies. In addition, we find tentative evidence that orbital periods of planets orbiting TOIs with significant proper motion anomalies are shorter than those orbiting TOIs without significant proper motion anomalies, consistent with the scenario that stellar companions can truncate planet-forming disks. Furthermore, TOIs with significant proper motion anomalies exhibit lower Gaia differential velocities in comparison to field stars with significant proper motion anomalies, suggesting that planets are more likely to form in binary systems with low-mass substellar companions or stellar companions at wider separation. Finally, we characterize the three-dimensional architecture of LTT 1445 ABC using radial velocities, absolute astrometry from Gaia and Hipparcos, and relative astrometry from imaging. Our analysis reveals that LTT 1445 is a nearly flat system, with a mutual inclination of 2.88 deg between the orbit of BC around A and that of C around B. The coplanarity may explain why multiple planets around LTT 1445 A survive in the dynamically hostile environment of this system.</description>

      <title>The GAPS Programme at TNG LIV. Multiple molecular species in the atmosphere of HAT-P-11 b and review of the HAT-P-11 planetary system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The atmospheric characterisation of hot and warm Neptune-size exoplanets is challenging due to their small radius and atmospheric scale height. The warm-Neptune HAT-P-11b is a remarkable target for such characterisation due to the large brightness of its host star (V=9.46 mag; H=7.13 mag). This work aims at: (i) reviewing the main physical and architectural properties of the HAT-P-11 planetary system; (ii) probing the presence of 8 molecular species in the atmosphere of HAT-P-11b at high spectral resolution in the near-Infrared. The planetary system was reviewed by analysing transits and occultations of HAT-P-11b from the Kepler data set as well as HIRES at Keck archival radial-velocity (RV) data. The latter were modelled with Gaussian-Process regression and a combined quasi-periodic and squared-exponential kernel to account for stellar variations on both (short-term) rotation and (long-term) activity-cycle timescales. To probe the atmospheric composition of HAT-P-11b, 4 transits of this target were observed with GIANO-B at TNG. We find that the long-period ($P\sim9.3$ years) RV signal previously attributed to planet HAT-P-11c is more likely due to the stellar magnetic activity cycle. Nonetheless, the Hipparcos-Gaia difference in proper motion anomaly suggests that an outer-bound companion might still exist. For HAT-P-11b, we measure a radius $R_{\rm p}=0.4466\pm0.0059\,R_{\rm J}$, a mass $M_{\rm p}=0.0787\pm0.0048\,M_{\rm J}$, and an eccentricity $e=0.2577^{+0.0033}_{-0.0025}$, in accordance with values in the literature. Probing its atmosphere, we detect the presence of $NH_3$ (S/N$=5.3$, significance$=5.0\sigma$) and confirm the presence of $H_2O$ (S/N$=5.1$, significance$=3.4\sigma$). We also tentatively detect the signal of $CO_2$ (S/N$=3.0$, significance$=3.2\sigma$) and $CH_4$ (S/N$=4.8$, significance$=2.6\sigma$), whose presence need to be confirmed by further observations.</description>

      <title>JASMINE: Near-Infrared Astrometry and Time Series Photometry Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Japan Astrometry Satellite Mission for INfrared Exploration (JASMINE) is a planned M-class science space mission by the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency. JASMINE has two main science goals. One is the Galactic archaeology with Galactic Center Survey, which aims to reveal the Milky Way's central core structure and formation history from Gaia-level (~25 $\mu$as) astrometry in the Near-Infrared (NIR) Hw-band (1.0-1.6 $\mu$m). The other is the Exoplanet Survey, which aims to discover transiting Earth-like exoplanets in the habitable zone from NIR time-series photometry of M dwarfs when the Galactic center is not accessible. We introduce the mission, review many science objectives, and present the instrument concept. JASMINE will be the first dedicated NIR astrometry space mission and provide precise astrometric information of the stars in the Galactic center, taking advantage of the significantly lower extinction in the NIR. The precise astrometry is obtained by taking many short-exposure images. Hence, the JASMINE Galactic center survey data will be valuable for studies of exoplanet transits, asteroseismology, variable stars and microlensing studies, including discovery of (intermediate mass) black holes. We highlight a swath of such potential science, and also describe synergies with other missions.</description>
