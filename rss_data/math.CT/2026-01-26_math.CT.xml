      <title>Derived equivalences for complexes with support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a Serre subcategory $\mathscr L$ and a resolving subcategory $\mathscr A$ of an abelian category, we show that the derived equivalence $D^b(\overline{\mathscr A} \cap \mathscr L) \simeq D^b_{\mathscr L}(\mathscr A)$ holds under certain conditions. We apply this to obtain derived equivalences in the contexts of chain complexes of graded modules or coherent sheaves, with finite $\mathscr A$-dimension, supported on closed sets having eventually finite $\mathscr A$-dimension.</description>

      <title>Local Antisymmetric Connectedness in Quasi-Uniform and Quasi-Modular Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Directional notions in topology and analysis naturally lead to nonsymmetric structures such as quasi-metrics, quasi-uniformities, and modular spaces. In these settings, classical notions of connectedness and completion based on symmetric uniformities are often inadequate. In this paper, we study \emph{antisymmetric connectedness} and \emph{local antisymmetric connectedness} within the setting of quasi-uniform and quasi-modular pseudometric spaces. We associate to each quasi-modular pseudometric family compatible forward and backward modular topologies and quasi-uniformities, yielding a canonical bitopological structure. Using this setting, we establish characterization and stability results for local antisymmetric connectedness, including invariance under subspaces, uniformly continuous mappings, and bicompletion. We further relate these notions to Smyth completeness and Yoneda-type completions and show how precompactness combined with asymmetric completeness yields compactness in the join topology. Applications to asymmetric normed and modular spaces illustrate the theory.</description>

      <title>A mathematical framework to study organising principles in graphical representations of biochemical processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The complexity of molecular and cellular processes forces experimental studies to focus on subsystems. To study the functioning of biological systems across levels of structural and functional organisation, we require tools to compose and organise networks with different levels of detail and abstraction. Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN) is a standardised notational system that visualises biochemical processes as networks. Despite their widespread adoption, SBGN languages remain purely visual and lack an underlying mathematical framework, limiting their compositional analysis, abstraction, and integration with formal modelling approaches. SBGN comprises three complementary visual languages-Process Description (SBGN-PD), Activity Flow (SBGN-AF), and Entity Relationship (SBGN-ER)-each operating at a different level of abstraction.
  In this manuscript, we introduce a category-theoretic formalism for SBGN-PD, a visual language to describe biochemical processes as biochemical reaction networks. Using the theory of structured cospans, we construct a symmetric monoidal double category whose horizontal 1-morphisms correspond to SBGN-PD diagrams. We also analyse how a designated subnetwork influences the surrounding network and how external entities, in turn, affect the internal reactions of the subnetwork. Our work addresses a key gap between biological visualisation and mathematical structure. It provides precise organising principles for SBGN-PD, including compositionality, enabling the construction of large biochemical reaction networks from smaller ones, and zooming out, allowing the abstraction of detailed biochemical mechanisms while preserving their functional interfaces. Throughout the paper, the proposed framework is illustrated using standard SBGN-PD examples, demonstrating its applicability to large-scale biochemical reaction networks.</description>

      <title>Foundations of $(A_\infty,2)$-categories: from flow to linear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18993v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a blueprint for the construction of a symplectic $(A_\infty,2)$-category, $\mathsf{Symp}$. We develop two ways of encoding the information in $\mathsf{Symp}$ -- one topological, one algebraic. The topological encoding is as an $(A_\infty,2)$-flow category, which we define here. The algebraic encoding is as a linear $(A_\infty,2)$-category, which we extract from the topological encoding. In upcoming work, we plan to use the adiabatic Fredholm theory developed by us to construct $\mathsf{Symp}$ as an $(A_\infty,2)$-flow category, which thus induces a linear $(A_\infty,2)$-category.
  The notion of a linear $(A_\infty,2)$-category developed here goes beyond the proposal of Bottman and Carmeli. The recursive structure of the 2-associahedra identifies faces with fiber products of 2-associahedra over associahedra, which led Bottman and Carmeli to associate operations to singular chains on 2-associahedra. The innovation in our new definition of linear $(A_\infty,2)$-category is to extend the family of 2-associahedra to include all fiber products of 2-associahedra over associahedra. This allows us to associate operations to cellular chains, which in particular enables us to produce a definition that involves only one operation in each arity, governed by a collection of $(A_\infty,2)$-equations.</description>

      <title>Partition Principle without Choice via Symmetric Iterations and Sheaf-Toposes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07675v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the topos $\mathcal{E}=\mathsf{Sh}(H\ltimes 2^{\mathbb{N}})$ arising from a nontrivial finite group $H$ acting freely on Cantor space. Using a local embedding property for the relevant epimorphisms together with effective descent for monomorphisms, we show that the \emph{internal} set universe $V$ obtained from algebraic set theory (AST) inside $\mathcal{E}$ satisfies the Partition Principle. On the other hand, the quotient $q:X\to X/H$ is a small epimorphism in $\mathcal{E}$ with no section, and this yields (via the display interpretation) an internal surjection in $V$ with no internal section; hence $V\models\neg\mathsf{AC}$. In summary, $\mathcal{E}$ contains an internal model of $\mathsf{IZF}+\mathsf{PP}+\neg\mathsf{AC}$ (and if $\mathcal{E}$ is Boolean, equivalently after $\neg\neg$-sheafification, this upgrades to $\mathsf{ZF}+\mathsf{PP}+\neg\mathsf{AC}$).</description>

      <title>Geometric Categories for Continuous Gauging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08254v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified categorical framework for gauging both continuous and finite symmetries in arbitrary spacetime dimensions. Our construction applies to geometric categories i.e. categories internal to stacks. This generalizes the familiar setting of fusion categories, which describe finite group symmetries, to the case of Lie group symmetries. Within this framework, we obtain a functorial Symmetry Topological Field Theory together with its natural boundaries, allowing us to compute associated endomorphism categories and Drinfeld centers in a uniform way. For a given symmetry group $G$, our framework recovers the electric and magnetic higher-form symmetries expected in $G$-gauge theory. Moreover, it naturally encodes electric breaking symmetry in the presence of charged matter, reproducing known physical phenomena in a categorical setting.</description>

      <title>Rewriting Systems on Arbitrary Monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10564v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce monoidal rewriting systems (MRS), an abstraction of string rewriting in which reductions are defined over an arbitrary ambient monoid rather than a free monoid of words. This shift is partly motivated by logic: the class of free monoids is not first-order axiomatizable, so "working in the free setting" cannot be treated internally when applying first-order methods to rewriting presentations.
  To analyze these systems categorically, we define $\mathbf{NCRS_2}$ as the 2-category of Noetherian Confluent MRS. We then prove the existence of a canonical biadjunction between $\mathbf{NCRS_2}$ and $\mathbf{Mon}$.
  Finally, we classify all Noetherian Confluent MRS that present a given fixed monoid. For this, we introduce Generalized Elementary Tietze Transformations (GETTs) and prove that any two presentations of a monoid are connected by a (possibly infinite) sequence of these transformations, yielding a complete characterization of generating systems up to GETT-equivalence.</description>
