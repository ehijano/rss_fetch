      <title>Random Walk Learning and the Pac-Man Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random walk (RW)-based algorithms have long been popular in distributed systems due to low overheads and scalability, with recent growing applications in decentralized learning. However, their reliance on local interactions makes them inherently vulnerable to malicious behavior. In this work, we investigate an adversarial threat that we term the ``Pac-Man'' attack, in which a malicious node probabilistically terminates any RW that visits it. This stealthy behavior gradually eliminates active RWs from the network, effectively halting the learning process without triggering failure alarms. To counter this threat, we propose the Average Crossing (AC) algorithm--a fully decentralized mechanism for duplicating RWs to prevent RW extinction in the presence of Pac-Man. Our theoretical analysis establishes that (i) the RW population remains almost surely bounded under AC and (ii) RW-based stochastic gradient descent remains convergent under AC, even in the presence of Pac-Man, with a quantifiable deviation from the true optimum. Our extensive empirical results on both synthetic and real-world datasets corroborate our theoretical findings. Furthermore, they uncover a phase transition in the extinction probability as a function of the duplication threshold. We offer theoretical insights by analyzing a simplified variant of the AC, which sheds light on the observed phase transition.</description>

      <title>Reduction Techniques for Survival Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we discuss what we refer to as reduction techniques for survival analysis, that is, techniques that "reduce" a survival task to a more common regression or classification task, without ignoring the specifics of survival data. Such techniques particularly facilitate machine learning-based survival analysis, as they allow for applying standard tools from machine and deep learning to many survival tasks without requiring custom learners. We provide an overview of different reduction techniques and discuss their respective strengths and weaknesses. We also provide a principled implementation of some of these reductions, such that they are directly available within standard machine learning workflows. We illustrate each reduction using dedicated examples and perform a benchmark analysis that compares their predictive performance to established machine learning methods for survival analysis.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Trace Optimization of Parameter Dependent Matrices Based on Statistical Learning Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider matrices $\boldsymbol{A}(\boldsymbol\theta)\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times m}$ that depend, possibly nonlinearly, on a parameter $\boldsymbol\theta$ from a compact parameter space $\Theta$. We present a Monte Carlo estimator for minimizing $\text{trace}(\boldsymbol{A}(\boldsymbol\theta))$ over all $\boldsymbol\theta\in\Theta$, and determine the sampling amount so that the backward error of the estimator is bounded with high probability. We derive two types of bounds, based on epsilon nets and on generic chaining. Both types predict a small sampling amount for matrices $\boldsymbol{A}(\boldsymbol\theta)$ with small offdiagonal mass, and parameter spaces $\Theta$ of small ``size.'' Dependence on the matrix dimension~$m$ is only weak or not explicit. The bounds based on epsilon nets are easier to evaluate and come with fully specified constants. In contrast, the bounds based on chaining depend on the Talagrand functionals which are difficult to evaluate, except in very special cases. Comparisons between the two types of bounds are difficult, although the literature suggests that chaining bounds can be superior.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Auto-bidding based on Traffic Prediction in Live Advertising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Internet live streaming is widely used in online entertainment and e-commerce, where live advertising is an important marketing tool for anchors. An advertising campaign hopes to maximize the effect (such as conversions) under constraints (such as budget and cost-per-click). The mainstream control of campaigns is auto-bidding, where the performance depends on the decision of the bidding algorithm in each request. The most widely used auto-bidding algorithms include Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control, linear programming (LP), reinforcement learning (RL), etc. Existing methods either do not consider the entire time traffic, or have too high computational complexity. In this paper, the live advertising has high requirements for real-time bidding (second-level control) and faces the difficulty of unknown future traffic. Therefore, we propose a lightweight bidding algorithm Binary Constrained Bidding (BiCB), which neatly combines the optimal bidding formula given by mathematical analysis and the statistical method of future traffic estimation, and obtains good approximation to the optimal result through a low complexity solution. In addition, we complement the form of upper and lower bound constraints for traditional auto-bidding modeling and give theoretical analysis of BiCB. Sufficient offline and online experiments prove BiCB's good performance and low engineering cost.</description>

      <title>Decorrelated feature importance from local sample weighting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feature importance (FI) statistics provide a prominent and valuable method of insight into the decision process of machine learning (ML) models, but their effectiveness has well-known limitations when correlation is present among the features in the training data. In this case, the FI often tends to be distributed among all features which are in correlation with the response-generating signal features. Even worse, if multiple signal features are in strong correlation with a noise feature, while being only modestly correlated with one another, this can result in a noise feature having a distinctly larger FI score than any signal feature. Here we propose local sample weighting (losaw) which can flexibly be integrated into many ML algorithms to improve FI scores in the presence of feature correlation in the training data. Our approach is motivated from inverse probability weighting in causal inference and locally, within the ML model, uses a sample weighting scheme to decorrelate a target feature from the remaining features. This reduces model bias locally, whenever the effect of a potential signal feature is evaluated and compared to others. Moreover, losaw comes with a natural tuning parameter, the minimum effective sample size of the weighted population, which corresponds to an interpretation-prediction-tradeoff, analog to a bias-variance-tradeoff as for classical ML tuning parameters. We demonstrate how losaw can be integrated within decision tree-based ML methods and within mini-batch training of neural networks. We investigate losaw for random forest and convolutional neural networks in a simulation study on settings showing diverse correlation patterns. We found that losaw improves FI consistently. Moreover, it often improves prediction accuracy for out-of-distribution, while maintaining a similar accuracy for in-distribution test data.</description>

      <title>DP-SPRT: Differentially Private Sequential Probability Ratio Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit Wald's celebrated Sequential Probability Ratio Test for sequential tests of two simple hypotheses, under privacy constraints. We propose DP-SPRT, a wrapper that can be calibrated to achieve desired error probabilities and privacy constraints, addressing a significant gap in previous work. DP-SPRT relies on a private mechanism that processes a sequence of queries and stops after privately determining when the query results fall outside a predefined interval. This OutsideInterval mechanism improves upon naive composition of existing techniques like AboveThreshold, potentially benefiting other sequential algorithms. We prove generic upper bounds on the error and sample complexity of DP-SPRT that can accommodate various noise distributions based on the practitioner's privacy needs. We exemplify them in two settings: Laplace noise (pure Differential Privacy) and Gaussian noise (R\'enyi differential privacy). In the former setting, by providing a lower bound on the sample complexity of any $\epsilon$-DP test with prescribed type I and type II errors, we show that DP-SPRT is near optimal when both errors are small and the two hypotheses are close. Moreover, we conduct an experimental study revealing its good practical performance.</description>

      <title>Diagrams-to-Dynamics (D2D): Exploring Causal Loop Diagram Leverage Points under Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05659v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causal loop diagrams (CLDs) are widely used in health and environmental research to represent hypothesized causal structures underlying complex problems. However, as qualitative and static representations, CLDs are limited in their ability to support dynamic analysis and inform intervention strategies. Additionally, quantitative CLD analysis methods like network centrality analysis often lead to false inference. We propose Diagrams-to-Dynamics (D2D), a method for converting CLDs into exploratory system dynamics models (SDMs) in the absence of empirical data. With minimal user input - following a protocol to label variables as stocks, flows or auxiliaries, and constants - D2D leverages the structural information already encoded in CLDs, namely, link existence and polarity, to simulate hypothetical interventions and explore potential leverage points under uncertainty. Results suggest that D2D helps distinguish between high- and low-ranked leverage points. We compare D2D to a data-driven SDM constructed from the same CLD and variable labels. D2D showed greater consistency with the data-driven model than network centrality analysis, while providing uncertainty estimates and guidance for future data collection. The method is implemented in an open-source Python package and a web-based application to support further testing and lower the barrier to dynamic modeling for researchers working with CLDs. We expect additional validation will further establish the approach's utility across a broad range of cases and domains.</description>

      <title>Identifiability of the minimum-trace directed acyclic graph and hill climbing algorithms without strict local optima under weakly increasing error variances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the true underlying directed acyclic graph (DAG) in Gaussian linear structural equation models is identifiable as the minimum-trace DAG when the error variances are weakly increasing with respect to the true causal ordering. This result bridges two existing frameworks as it extends the identifiable cases within the minimum-trace DAG method and provides a principled interpretation of the algorithmic ordering search approach, revealing that its objective is actually to minimize the total residual sum of squares. On the computational side, we prove that the hill climbing algorithm with a random-to-random (R2R) neighborhood does not admit any strict local optima. Under standard settings, we confirm the result through extensive simulations, observing only a few weak local optima. Interestingly, algorithms using other neighborhoods of equal size exhibit suboptimal behavior, having strict local optima and a substantial number of weak local optima.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Bandits for Crowdsourcing and Multi-Platform Autobidding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by applications in crowdsourcing, where a fixed sum of money is split among $K$ workers, and autobidding, where a fixed budget is used to bid in $K$ simultaneous auctions, we define a stochastic bandit model where arms belong to the $K$-dimensional probability simplex and represent the fraction of budget allocated to each task/auction. The reward in each round is the sum of $K$ stochastic rewards, where each of these rewards is unlocked with a probability that varies with the fraction of the budget allocated to that task/auction. We design an algorithm whose expected regret after $T$ steps is of order $K\sqrt{T}$ (up to log factors) and prove a matching lower bound. Improved bounds of order $K (\log T)^2$ are shown when the function mapping budget to probability of unlocking the reward (i.e., terminating the task or winning the auction) satisfies additional diminishing-returns conditions.</description>

      <title>Estimating the size of a set using cascading exclusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $S$ be a finite set, and $X_1,\ldots,X_n$ an i.i.d. uniform sample from $S$. To estimate the size $|S|$, without further structure, one can wait for repeats and use the birthday problem. This requires a sample size of the order $|S|^\frac{1}{2}$. On the other hand, if $S=\{1,2,\ldots,|S|\}$, the maximum of the sample blown up by $n/(n-1)$ gives an efficient estimator based on any growing sample size. This paper gives refinements that interpolate between these extremes. A general non-asymptotic theory is developed. This includes estimating the volume of a compact convex set, the unseen species problem, and a host of testing problems that follow from the question `Is this new observation a typical pick from a large prespecified population?' We also treat regression style predictors. A general theorem gives non-parametric finite $n$ error bounds in all cases.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Backtracking for Privacy Protection in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The preservation of privacy has emerged as a critical topic in the era of artificial intelligence. However, current work focuses on user-oriented privacy, overlooking severe enterprise data leakage risks exacerbated by the Retrieval-Augmented Generation paradigm. To address this gap, our paper introduces a novel objective: enterprise-oriented privacy concerns. Achieving this objective requires overcoming two fundamental challenges: existing methods such as data sanitization severely degrade model performance, and the field lacks public datasets for evaluation. We address these challenges with several solutions. (1) To prevent performance degradation, we propose ABack, a training-free mechanism that leverages a Hidden State Model to pinpoint the origin of a leakage intention and rewrite the output safely. (2) To solve the lack of datasets, we construct PriGenQA, a new benchmark for enterprise privacy scenarios in healthcare and finance. To ensure a rigorous evaluation, we move beyond simple static attacks by developing a powerful adaptive attacker with Group Relative Policy Optimization. Experiments show that against this superior adversary, ABack improves the overall privacy utility score by up to 15\% over strong baselines, avoiding the performance trade-offs of prior methods.</description>

      <title>IOCC: Aligning Semantic and Cluster Centers for Few-shot Short Text Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In clustering tasks, it is essential to structure the feature space into clear, well-separated distributions. However, because short text representations have limited expressiveness, conventional methods struggle to identify cluster centers that truly capture each category's underlying semantics, causing the representations to be optimized in suboptimal directions. To address this issue, we propose IOCC, a novel few-shot contrastive learning method that achieves alignment between the cluster centers and the semantic centers. IOCC consists of two key modules: Interaction-enhanced Optimal Transport (IEOT) and Center-aware Contrastive Learning (CACL). Specifically, IEOT incorporates semantic interactions between individual samples into the conventional optimal transport problem, and generate pseudo-labels. Based on these pseudo-labels, we aggregate high-confidence samples to construct pseudo-centers that approximate the semantic centers. Next, CACL optimizes text representations toward their corresponding pseudo-centers. As training progresses, the collaboration between the two modules gradually reduces the gap between cluster centers and semantic centers. Therefore, the model will learn a high-quality distribution, improving clustering performance. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets show that IOCC outperforms previous methods, achieving up to 7.34\% improvement on challenging Biomedical dataset and also excelling in clustering stability and efficiency. The code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/IOCC-C438.</description>

      <title>Near-Optimal Regret for Efficient Stochastic Combinatorial Semi-Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) is a cornerstone of sequential decision-making framework, dominated by two algorithmic families: UCB-based and adversarial methods such as follow the regularized leader (FTRL) and online mirror descent (OMD). However, prominent UCB-based approaches like CUCB suffer from additional regret factor $\log T$ that is detrimental over long horizons, while adversarial methods such as EXP3.M and HYBRID impose significant computational overhead. To resolve this trade-off, we introduce the Combinatorial Minimax Optimal Strategy in the Stochastic setting (CMOSS). CMOSS is a computationally efficient algorithm that achieves an instance-independent regret of $O\big( (\log k)^2\sqrt{kmT}\big )$ under semi-bandit feedback, where $m$ is the number of arms and $k$ is the maximum cardinality of a feasible action. Crucially, this result eliminates the dependency on $\log T$ and matches the established $\Omega\big( \sqrt{kmT}\big)$ lower bound up to $O\big((\log k)^2\big)$. We then extend our analysis to show that CMOSS is also applicable to cascading feedback. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets validate that CMOSS consistently outperforms benchmark algorithms in both regret and runtime efficiency.</description>

      <title>A variational approach to dimension-free self-normalized concentration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the self-normalized concentration of vector-valued stochastic processes. We focus on bounds for sub-$\psi$ processes, a tail condition that encompasses a wide variety of well-known distributions (including sub-exponential, sub-Gaussian, sub-gamma, and sub-Poisson distributions). Our results recover and generalize the influential bound of Abbasi-Yadkori et al. (2011) and fill a gap in the literature between determinant-based bounds and those based on condition numbers. As applications we prove a Bernstein inequality for random vectors satisfying a moment condition (which is more general than boundedness), and also provide the first dimension-free, self-normalized empirical Bernstein inequality. Our techniques are based on the variational (PAC-Bayes) approach to concentration.</description>

      <title>Generalization Bound for Diffusion Models using Random Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04417v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models have been successfully used to generate data from noise. However, most diffusion models are computationally expensive and difficult to interpret with a lack of theoretical justification. Random feature models on the other hand have gained popularity due to their interpretability but their application to complex machine learning tasks remains limited. In this work, we present a diffusion model-inspired deep random feature model that is interpretable and gives comparable numerical results to a fully connected neural network having the same number of trainable parameters. Specifically, we extend existing results for random features and derive generalization bounds between the distribution of sampled data and the true distribution using properties of score matching. We validate our findings by generating samples on the fashion MNIST dataset and instrumental audio data.</description>

      <title>Modeling Spatial Extremal Dependence of Precipitation Using Distributional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a simulation-based estimation approach using generative neural networks to determine dependencies of precipitation maxima and their underlying uncertainty in time and space. Within the common framework of max-stable processes for extremes under temporal and spatial dependence, our methodology allows estimating the process parameters and their respective uncertainty, but also delivers an explicit nonparametric estimate of the spatial dependence through the pairwise extremal coefficient function. We illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach in a thorough finite sample study where we obtain good performance in complex settings for which closed-form likelihood estimation becomes intractable. We use the technique for studying monthly rainfall maxima in Western Germany for the period 2021-2023, which is of particular interest since it contains an extreme precipitation and consecutive flooding event in July 2021 that had a massive deadly impact. Beyond the considered setting, the presented methodology and its main generative ideas also have great potential for other applications.</description>

      <title>Optimal sampling for least-squares approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Least-squares approximation is one of the most important methods for recovering an unknown function from data. While in many applications the data is fixed, in many others there is substantial freedom to choose where to sample. In this paper, we review recent progress on near-optimal random sampling strategies for (weighted) least-squares approximation in arbitrary linear spaces. We introduce the Christoffel function as a key quantity in the analysis of (weighted) least-squares approximation from random samples, then show how it can be used to construct a random sampling strategy, termed Christoffel sampling, that possesses near-optimal sample complexity: namely, the number of samples scales log-linearly in the dimension of the approximation space $n$. We discuss a series of variations, extensions and further topics, and throughout highlight connections to approximation theory, machine learning, information-based complexity and numerical linear algebra. Finally, motivated by various contemporary applications, we consider a generalization of the classical setting where the samples need not be pointwise samples of a scalar-valued function, and the approximation space need not be linear. We show that, even in this significantly more general setting, suitable generalizations of Christoffel function still determine the sample complexity. Consequently, these can be used to design enhanced, Christoffel sampling strategies in a unified way for general recovery problems. This article is largely self-contained, and intended to be accessible to nonspecialists.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In functional data analysis, binary classification with one functional covariate has been extensively studied. We aim to fill in the gap of considering multivariate functional covariates in classification. In particular, we propose an $L_1$-regularized functional support vector machine for binary classification. An accompanying algorithm is developed to fit the classifier. By imposing an $L_1$ penalty, the algorithm enables us to identify relevant functional covariates of the binary response. Numerical results from simulations and one real-world application demonstrate that the proposed classifier enjoys good performance in both prediction and feature selection.</description>

      <title>A Markov Random Field model for Hypergraph-based Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14172v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the data-generating process is essential for building machine learning models that generalise well while ensuring robustness and interpretability. This paper addresses the fundamental challenge of modelling the data generation processes on hypergraphs and explores how such models can inform the design of machine learning algorithms for hypergraph data. The key to our approach is the development of a hypergraph Markov random field that models the joint distribution of the node features and hyperedge features in a hypergraph through a multivariate Gaussian distribution whose covariance matrix is uniquely determined by the hypergraph structure. The proposed data-generating process provides a valuable inductive bias for various hypergraph machine learning tasks, thus enhancing the algorithm design. In this paper, we focus on two representative downstream tasks: structure inference and node classification. Accordingly, we introduce two novel frameworks: 1) an original hypergraph structure inference framework named HGSI, and 2) a novel learning framework entitled Hypergraph-MLP for node classification on hypergraphs. Empirical evaluation of the proposed frameworks demonstrates that: 1) HGSI outperforms existing hypergraph structure inference methods on both synthetic and real-world data; and 2) Hypergraph-MLP outperforms baselines in six hypergraph node classification benchmarks, at the same time promoting runtime efficiency and robustness against structural perturbations during inference.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Gaussian Process ODEs via Double Normalizing Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09222v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Gaussian processes have been used to model the vector field of continuous dynamical systems, referred to as GPODEs, which are characterized by a probabilistic ODE equation. Bayesian inference for these models has been extensively studied and applied in tasks such as time series prediction. However, the use of standard GPs with basic kernels like squared exponential kernels has been common in GPODE research, limiting the model's ability to represent complex scenarios. To address this limitation, we introduce normalizing flows to reparameterize the ODE vector field, resulting in a data-driven prior distribution, thereby increasing flexibility and expressive power. We develop a data-driven variational learning algorithm that utilizes analytically tractable probability density functions of normalizing flows, enabling simultaneous learning and inference of unknown continuous dynamics. Additionally, we also apply normalizing flows to the posterior inference of GP ODEs to resolve the issue of strong mean-field assumptions in posterior inference. By applying normalizing flows in both these ways, our model improves accuracy and uncertainty estimates for Bayesian Gaussian Process ODEs. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on simulated dynamical systems and real-world human motion data, including time series prediction and missing data recovery tasks. Experimental results show that our proposed method effectively captures model uncertainty while improving accuracy.</description>

      <title>Non-asymptotic estimates for accelerated high order Langevin Monte Carlo algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose two new algorithms, namely, aHOLA and aHOLLA, to sample from high-dimensional target distributions with possibly super-linearly growing potentials. We establish non-asymptotic convergence bounds for aHOLA in Wasserstein-1 and Wasserstein-2 distances with rates of convergence equal to $1+q/2$ and $1/2+q/4$, respectively, under a local H\"{o}lder condition with exponent $q\in(0,1]$ and a convexity at infinity condition on the potential of the target distribution. Similar results are obtained for aHOLLA under certain global continuity conditions and a dissipativity condition. Crucially, we achieve state-of-the-art rates of convergence of the proposed algorithms in the non-convex setting which are higher than those of the existing algorithms. Examples from high-dimensional sampling and logistic regression are presented, and numerical results support our main findings.</description>

      <title>Rethinking the Bias of Foundation Model under Long-tailed Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15955v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long-tailed learning has garnered increasing attention due to its practical significance. Among the various approaches, the fine-tuning paradigm has gained considerable interest with the advent of foundation models. However, most existing methods primarily focus on leveraging knowledge from these models, overlooking the inherent biases introduced by the imbalanced training data they rely on. In this paper, we examine how such imbalances from pre-training affect long-tailed downstream tasks. Specifically, we find the imbalance biases inherited in foundation models on downstream task as parameter imbalance and data imbalance. During fine-tuning, we observe that parameter imbalance plays a more critical role, while data imbalance can be mitigated using existing re-balancing strategies. Moreover, we find that parameter imbalance cannot be effectively addressed by current re-balancing techniques, such as adjusting the logits, during training, unlike data imbalance. To tackle both imbalances simultaneously, we build our method on causal learning and view the incomplete semantic factor as the confounder, which brings spurious correlations between input samples and labels. To resolve the negative effects of this, we propose a novel backdoor adjustment method that learns the true causal effect between input samples and labels, rather than merely fitting the correlations in the data. Notably, we achieve an average performance increase of about $1.67\%$ on each dataset. Code is available: https://github.com/JiahaoChen1/Pre-train-Imbalance</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03048v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) is a widely used method for data assimilation in high-dimensional systems, with an ensemble update step equivalent to an empirical version of the Matheron update popular in Gaussian process regression -- a connection that links half a century of data-assimilation engineering to modern path-wise GP sampling.
  This paper provides a compact introduction to this simple but under-exploited connection, with necessary definitions accessible to all fields involved.

      <title>Proximal optimal transport divergences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the proximal optimal transport divergence, a novel discrepancy measure that interpolates between information divergences and optimal transport distances via an infimal convolution formulation. This divergence provides a principled foundation for optimal transport proximals and proximal optimization methods frequently used in generative modeling. We explore its mathematical properties, including smoothness, boundedness, and computational tractability, and establish connections to primal-dual formulations and adversarial learning. The proximal operator associated with the proximal optimal transport divergence can be interpreted as a transport map that pushes a reference distribution toward the optimal generative distribution, which approximates the target distribution that is only accessible through data samples. Building on the Benamou-Brenier dynamic formulation of classical optimal transport, we also establish a dynamic formulation for proximal OT divergences. The resulting dynamic formulation is a first order mean-field game whose optimality conditions are governed by a pair of nonlinear partial differential equations: a backward Hamilton-Jacobi equation and a forward continuity equation. Our framework generalizes existing approaches while offering new insights and computational tools for generative modeling, distributionally robust optimization, and gradient-based learning in probability spaces.</description>

      <title>Causal Mechanism Estimation in Multi-Sensor Systems Across Multiple Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17792v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To gain deeper insights into a complex sensor system through the lens of causality, we present common and individual causal mechanism estimation (CICME), a novel three-step approach to inferring causal mechanisms from heterogeneous data collected across multiple domains. By leveraging the principle of Causal Transfer Learning (CTL), CICME is able to reliably detect domain-invariant causal mechanisms when provided with sufficient samples. The identified common causal mechanisms are further used to guide the estimation of the remaining causal mechanisms in each domain individually. The performance of CICME is evaluated on linear Gaussian models under scenarios inspired from a manufacturing process. Building upon existing continuous optimization-based causal discovery methods, we show that CICME leverages the benefits of applying causal discovery on the pooled data and repeatedly on data from individual domains, and it even outperforms both baseline methods under certain scenarios.</description>
