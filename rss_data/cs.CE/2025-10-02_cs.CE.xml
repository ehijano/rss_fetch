      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exponential growth of information presents a significant challenge for researchers and professionals seeking to remain at the forefront of their fields and this paper introduces an innovative framework for automatically generating insightful financial digests using the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically Google's Gemini Pro. By leveraging a combination of data extraction from OpenAlex, strategic prompt engineering, and LLM-driven analysis, we demonstrate the automated example of creating a comprehensive digests that generalize key findings, identify emerging trends. This approach addresses the limitations of traditional analysis methods, enabling the efficient processing of vast amounts of unstructured data and the delivery of actionable insights in an easily digestible format. This paper describes how LLMs work in simple words and how we can use their power to help researchers and scholars save their time and stay informed about current trends. Our study includes step-by-step process, from data acquisition and JSON construction to interaction with Gemini and the automated generation of PDF reports, including a link to the project's GitHub repository for broader accessibility and further development.</description>

      <title>CardioRAG: A Retrieval-Augmented Generation Framework for Multimodal Chagas Disease Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chagas disease affects nearly 6 million people worldwide, with Chagas cardiomyopathy representing its most severe complication. In regions where serological testing capacity is limited, AI-enhanced electrocardiogram (ECG) screening provides a critical diagnostic alternative. However, existing machine learning approaches face challenges such as limited accuracy, reliance on large labeled datasets, and more importantly, weak integration with evidence-based clinical diagnostic indicators. We propose a retrieval-augmented generation framework, CardioRAG, integrating large language models with interpretable ECG-based clinical features, including right bundle branch block, left anterior fascicular block, and heart rate variability metrics. The framework uses variational autoencoder-learned representations for semantic case retrieval, providing contextual cases to guide clinical reasoning. Evaluation demonstrated high recall performance of 89.80%, with a maximum F1 score of 0.68 for effective identification of positive cases requiring prioritized serological testing. CardioRAG provides an interpretable, clinical evidence-based approach particularly valuable for resource-limited settings, demonstrating a pathway for embedding clinical indicators into trustworthy medical AI systems.</description>

      <title>ShapeGen3DCP: A Deep Learning Framework for Layer Shape Prediction in 3D Concrete Printing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces ShapeGen3DCP, a deep learning framework for fast and accurate prediction of filament cross-sectional geometry in 3D Concrete Printing (3DCP). The method is based on a neural network architecture that takes as input both material properties in the fluid state (density, yield stress, plastic viscosity) and process parameters (nozzle diameter, nozzle height, printing and flow velocities) to directly predict extruded layer shapes. To enhance generalization, some inputs are reformulated into dimensionless parameters that capture underlying physical principles. Predicted geometries are compactly represented using Fourier descriptors, which enforce smooth, closed, and symmetric profiles while reducing the prediction task to a small set of coefficients. The training dataset was synthetically generated using a well-established Particle Finite Element (PFEM) model of 3DCP, overcoming the scarcity of experimental data. Validation against diverse numerical and experimental cases shows strong agreement, confirming the framework's accuracy and reliability. This opens the way to practical uses ranging from pre-calibration of print settings, minimizing or even eliminating trial-and-error adjustments, to toolpath optimization for more advanced designs. Looking ahead, coupling the framework with simulations and sensor feedback could enable closed-loop digital twins for 3DCP, driving real-time process optimization, defect detection, and adaptive control of printing parameters.</description>

      <title>A Copula-Based Variational Autoencoder for Uncertainty Quantification in Inverse Problems: Application to Damage Identification in an Offshore Wind Turbine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structural Health Monitoring of Floating Offshore Wind Turbines (FOWTs) is critical for ensuring operational safety and efficiency. However, identifying damage in components like mooring systems from limited sensor data poses a challenging inverse problem, often characterized by multimodal solutions where various damage states could explain the observed response. To overcome it, we propose a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) architecture, where the encoder approximates the inverse operator, while the decoder approximates the forward. The posterior distribution of the latent space variables is probabilistically modeled, describing the uncertainties in the estimates. This work tackles the limitations of conventional Gaussian Mixtures used within VAEs, which can be either too restrictive or computationally prohibitive for high-dimensional spaces. We propose a novel Copula-based VAE architecture that decouples the marginal distribution of the variables from their dependence structure, offering a flexible method for representing complex, correlated posterior distributions. We provide a comprehensive comparison of three different approaches for approximating the posterior: a Gaussian Mixture with a diagonal covariance matrix, a Gaussian Mixture with a full covariance matrix, and a Gaussian Copula. Our analysis, conducted on a high-fidelity synthetic dataset, demonstrates that the Copula VAE offers a promising and tractable solution in high-dimensional spaces. Although the present work remains in the two-dimensional space, the results suggest efficient scalability to higher dimensions. It achieves superior performance with significantly fewer parameters than the Gaussian Mixture alternatives, whose parametrization grows prohibitively with the dimensionality. The results underscore the potential of Copula-based VAEs as a tool for uncertainty-aware damage identification in FOWT mooring systems.</description>

      <title>Fast training of accurate physics-informed neural networks without gradient descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20836v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving time-dependent Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) is one of the most critical problems in computational science. While Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) offer a promising framework for approximating PDE solutions, their accuracy and training speed are limited by two core barriers: gradient-descent-based iterative optimization over complex loss landscapes and non-causal treatment of time as an extra spatial dimension. We present Frozen-PINN, a novel PINN based on the principle of space-time separation that leverages random features instead of training with gradient descent, and incorporates temporal causality by construction. On eight PDE benchmarks, including challenges such as extreme advection speeds, shocks, and high dimensionality, Frozen-PINNs achieve superior training efficiency and accuracy over state-of-the-art PINNs, often by several orders of magnitude. Our work addresses longstanding training and accuracy bottlenecks of PINNs, delivering quickly trainable, highly accurate, and inherently causal PDE solvers, a combination that prior methods could not realize. Our approach challenges the reliance of PINNs on stochastic gradient-descent-based methods and specialized hardware, leading to a paradigm shift in PINN training and providing a challenging benchmark for the community.</description>

      <title>LLM-Enhanced, Data-Driven Personalized and Equitable Clinician Scheduling: A Predict-then-Optimize Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clinician scheduling remains a persistent challenge due to limited clinical resources and fluctuating demands. This complexity is especially acute in large academic anesthesiology departments as physicians balance responsibilities across multiple clinical sites with conflicting priorities. Further, scheduling must account for individual clinical and lifestyle preferences to ensure job satisfaction and well-being. Traditional approaches, often based on statistical or rule-based optimization models, rely on structured data and explicit domain knowledge. However, these methods often overlook unstructured information, e.g., free-text notes from routinely administered clinician well-being surveys and scheduling platforms. These notes may reveal implicit and underutilized clinical resources. Neglecting such information can lead to misaligned schedules, increased burnout, overlooked staffing flexibility, and suboptimal utilization of available resources. To address this gap, we propose a predict-then-optimize framework that integrates classification-based clinician availability predictions with a mixed-integer programming schedule optimization model. Large language models (LLMs) are employed to extract actionable preferences and implicit constraints from unstructured schedule notes, enhancing the reliability of availability predictions. These predictions then inform the schedule optimization considering four objectives: first, ensuring clinical full-time equivalent compliance, second, reducing workload imbalances by enforcing equitable proportions of shift types, third, maximizing clinician availability for assigned shifts, and fourth, schedule consistency. By combining the interpretive power of LLMs with the rigor of mathematical optimization, our framework provides a robust, data-driven solution that enhances operational efficiency while supporting equity and clinician well-being.</description>

      <title>An Overview of Meshfree Collocation Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a comprehensive overview of meshfree collocation methods for numerically approximating differential operators on continuously labeled unstructured point clouds. Meshfree collocation methods do not require a computational grid or mesh. Instead, they approximate smooth functions and their derivatives at potentially irregularly distributed collocation points, often called particles, to a desired order of consistency. We review several meshfree collocation methods from the literature, trace the historical development of key concepts, and propose a classification of methods according to their principle of derivation. Although some of the methods reviewed are similar or identical, there are subtle yet important differences between many, which we highlight and discuss. We present a unifying formulation of meshfree collocation methods that renders these differences apparent and show how each method can be derived from this formulation. Finally, we propose a generalized derivation for meshfree collocation methods going forward.</description>

      <title>GEM: 3D Gaussian Splatting for Efficient and Accurate Cryo-EM Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25075v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has become a central tool for high-resolution structural biology, yet the massive scale of datasets (often exceeding 100k particle images) renders 3D reconstruction both computationally expensive and memory intensive. Traditional Fourier-space methods are efficient but lose fidelity due to repeated transforms, while recent real-space approaches based on neural radiance fields (NeRFs) improve accuracy but incur cubic memory and computation overhead. Therefore, we introduce GEM, a novel cryo-EM reconstruction framework built on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that operates directly in real-space while maintaining high efficiency. Instead of modeling the entire density volume, GEM represents proteins with compact 3D Gaussians, each parameterized by only 11 values. To further improve the training efficiency, we designed a novel gradient computation to 3D Gaussians that contribute to each voxel. This design substantially reduced both memory footprint and training cost. On standard cryo-EM benchmarks, GEM achieves up to 48% faster training and 12% lower memory usage compared to state-of-the-art methods, while improving local resolution by as much as 38.8%. These results establish GEM as a practical and scalable paradigm for cryo-EM reconstruction, unifying speed, efficiency, and high-resolution accuracy. Our code is available at https://github.com/UNITES-Lab/GEM.</description>
