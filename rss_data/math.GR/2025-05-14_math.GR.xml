      <title>Solution to two open problems in geometric group theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a method for analyzing the convex hull of a set in non-positively curved piecewise Euclidean polygonal complexes and we apply this method to prove that with the usual action of Fm x Zn on the metric product of a tree with Rn , every quasiconvex subgroup of Fm x Zn is convex. This answers the question whether a quasiconvex subgroup of a CAT(0) group is a CAT(0) group in the affirmative for the groups F m x Zn. We also prove bounded packing in a special class of polycyclic groups, and we introduce the notion of coset growth and provide a bound for the coset growth of uniform lattices in Sol.</description>

      <title>Profinite properties of Coxeter groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a number of results about profinite completions of Coxeter groups. For example we prove Coxeter groups are good in the sense of Serre and that various splittings of Coxeter groups arising from actions on trees are detected by the profinite completion. As an application we prove a number of families Coxeter groups are profinitely rigid amongst Coxeter groups. We also prove that Gromov-hyperbolic FC type, large type, and odd Coxeter groups are almost profinitely rigid amongst Coxeter groups. In the appendix, Sam Fisher and Sam Hughes show that the Atiyah Conjecture holds for all Coxeter groups, and that $\ell^2$-Betti numbers and their positive characteristic analogues are profinite invariants of Coxeter groups and of virtually compact special groups.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Anosov subgroups of surface bundles over tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that finitely generated, purely pseudo-Anosov subgroups of the fundamental groups of surface bundles over tori are convex cocompact as subgroups of the mapping class group via the Birman exact sequence. This generalizes the fact that similar groups within fibered 3-manifold groups are convex cocompact, which is a combination of results due to Dowdall, Kent, Leininger, Russell, and Schleimer.</description>

      <title>Equivalences of racks, Legendrian racks, and symmetric racks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08090v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Racks and Legendrian racks are nonassociative algebraic structures based on the framed and Legendrian Reidemeister moves, respectively. Motivated by the classification problem for Legendrian knots, we construct an equivalence of categories between racks and Legendrian racks (and, hence, GL-quandles). We deduce equivalences between kink-involutory racks and Legendrian quandles, involutory racks and Legendrian kei, and the respective pairs of full subcategories whose objects are medial.
  As applications, we classify objects in these categories up to order 8 and classify several families of symmetric racks; these results are likely to be of independent interest. In particular, the categories of kei with good involutions, Legendrian kei, and involutory racks are all equivalent.</description>

      <title>On the abstract elementary class of acts with embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the class of acts with embeddings as an abstract elementary class. We show that the class is always stable and show that superstability in the class is characterized algebraically via weakly noetherian monoids.
  The study of these model-theoretic notions and limit models lead us to introduce parametized weakly noetherian monoids and find a characterization of them via parametrized injective acts. Furthermore, we obtain a characterization of weakly noetherian monoids via absolutely pure acts extending a classical result of ring theory.
  The paper is aimed at algebraists and model theorists so an effort was made to provide the background for both.</description>

      <title>Many non-embeddable infinite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17962v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let K be a set of infinite cardinals such that the cardinality of K is the first strong limit greater than uncountably many strong limits. We construct a family F of pairwise non-embeddable groups such that F contains 2^k groups of order k for every cardinal number k in K. (In particular, in the family F small groups are never embeddable in large groups.) Consequently, for every infinite cardinal number k there exist 2^k pairwise non-embeddable groups of order k. (The existence of such groups is well-known for regular k since 1976.)</description>

      <title>The commutator subalgebra of the Lie algebra associated with a right-angled Coxeter group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10305v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the graded Lie algebra $L(RC_K)$ associated with the lower central series of a right-angled Coxeter group $RC_K$. We prove that its commutator subalgebra is a quotient of the polynomial ring over an auxiliary Lie subalgebra $N_K$ of the graph Lie algebra $L_K$, and conjecture that the quotient map is an isomorphism. The epimorphism is defined in terms of a new operation in the associated Lie algebra, which corresponds to the squaring and has an analogue in homotopy theory. We show that the universal enveloping algebra $U(N_K)$ is the mod 2 loop homology algebra of the corresponding moment-angle complex $Z_K$. This allows us to give a presentation of the Lie algebra $N_K$ by generators and relations.</description>
