      <title>Lotka-Volterra-type kinetic equations for competing species</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we examine a kinetic framework for modeling the time evolution of size distribution densities of two populations governed by predator-prey interactions. The model builds upon the classical Boltzmann-type equations, where the dynamics arise from elementary binary interactions between the populations. The model uniquely incorporates a linear redistribution operator to quantify the birth rates in both populations, inspired by wealth redistribution operators. We prove that, under a suitable scaling regime, the Boltzmann formulation transitions to a system of coupled Fokker-Planck-type equations. These equations describe the evolution of the distribution densities and link the macroscopic dynamics of their mean values to a Lotka-Volterra system of ordinary differential equations, with parameters explicitly derived from the microscopic interaction rules. We then determine the local equilibria of the Fokker-Planck system, which are Gamma-type densities, and investigate the problem of relaxation of its solutions toward these kinetic equilibria, in terms of their moments' dynamics. The results establish a bridge between kinetic modeling and classical population dynamics, offering a multiscale perspective on predator-prey systems.</description>

      <title>Experiments with an oscillator based Ising machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interest in non-algorithmic, unconventional computing is rising in recent years due to more and more apparent short comings of classic stored-program digital computers, such as energy efficiency, degree of parallelism in computations, clock frequency limitations, integration density, silicon utilization, etc. One notable such unconventional approach are oscillator based Ising machines, i.e., systems consisting of a number of oscillators which can be coupled in order to create an analogue for some problem to be solved, while the actual information is encoded in the phase relationships of these oscillators with respect to some reference (typically one of these oscillators). It has been shown that machines of this type are capable of solving NP-hard problems such as max-cut, etc. In the following an experimental Ising machine is presented together with experimental results obtained from this machine.</description>
