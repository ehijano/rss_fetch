      <title>The Interpolation Constraint in the RV Analysis of M-Dwarfs Using Empirical Templates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise radial velocity (pRV) measurements of M-dwarfs in the near-infrared (NIR) rely on empirical templates due to the lack of accurate stellar spectral models in this regime. Templates are assumed to approximate the true spectrum when constructed from many observations or in the high signal-to-noise limit. We develop a numerical simulation that generates SPIRou-like pRV observations from PHOENIX spectra, constructs empirical templates, and estimates radial velocities. This simulation solely considers photon noise and evaluates when empirical templates remain reliable for pRV analysis. Our results reveal a previously unrecognized noise source in templates, establishing a fundamental floor for template-based pRV measurements. We find that templates inherently include distortions in stellar line shapes due to imperfect interpolation at the detector's sampling resolution. The magnitude of this interpolation error depends on sampling resolution and RV content. Consequently, while stars with a higher RV content, such as cooler M-dwarfs are expected to yield lower RV uncertainties, their dense spectral features can amplify interpolation errors, potentially biasing RV estimates. For a typical M4V star, SPIRou's spectral and sampling resolution imposes an RV uncertainty floor of 0.5-0.8 m/s, independent of the star's magnitude or the telescope's aperture. These findings reveal a limitation of template-based pRV methods, underscoring the need for improved spectral modeling and better-than-Nyquist detector sampling to reach the next level of RV precision.</description>

      <title>First Results from WINERED: Detection of Emission Lines from Neutral Iron and a Combined Set of Trace Species on the Dayside of WASP-189 b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ground and space-based observations have revealed that Ultra Hot Jupiters (UHJs,~$T_{\rm{eq}} &gt; 2200 \ \rm{K}$) typically have inverted thermal profiles, while cooler hot Jupiters have non-inverted ones. This shift is theorized due to the onset of strong optical absorbers like metal oxides (e.g., TiO, VO), metal hydrides (e.g. FeH), atomic species (e.g., Fe, Ti), and ions (e.g., H$^-$). High-resolution spectroscopy is valuable for characterizing the thermal, chemical, and dynamical atmospheric structures due to its sensitivity to detailed spectral line shapes. The newly commissioned WINERED high-resolution spectrograph ($R\sim68,000$) on the Magellan Clay 6.5 m telescope enhances capabilities with its high throughput in the J-band (1.13-1.35 $\mu$m), capturing strong spectral features from key atmospheric species. In this study, we report detecting the dayside atmosphere of the UHJ WASP-189 b at a $S/N\sim10$, marking the first exoplanet atmosphere detection in emission with WINERED. Individually, we identify strong neutral iron (Fe) emission lines at a $S/N=6.3$, and tentatively detect neutral magnesium (Mg) and silicon (Si) at a $S/N&gt;4$. Although not individually detected, we detect a combined set of trace species at a $S/N=7.2$, which is attributed mostly to neutral chromium (Cr) and aluminum (Al), alongside magnesium and silicon. These results help refine the understanding of key atmospheric species that influence the thermal structure of WASP-189 b and UHJs more broadly.</description>

      <title>Discovery of H$\alpha$ Emission from a Protoplanet Candidate Around the Young Star 2MASS J16120668-3010270 with MagAO-X</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 2MASS J16120668-3010270 (hereafter 2MJ1612) is a young M0 star that hosts a protoplanetary disk in the Upper Scorpious star-forming region. Recent ALMA observations of 2MJ1612 show a mildly inclined disk ($i$=37$^\circ$) with a large dust-depleted gap (R$_\text{cav}\approx$0.4" or 53 au). We present high-contrast H$\alpha$ observations from MagAO-X on the 6.5m Magellan Telescope and new high resolution sub-mm dust continuum observations with ALMA of 2MJ1612. On both 2025 April 13 and 16, we recovered a point source with H$\alpha$ excess with SNR $\gtrsim$5 within the disk gap in our MagAO-X Angular and Spectral Differential (ASDI) images at a separation of 141.96$\pm$2.10 mas (23.45$\pm$0.29 au deprojected) from the star and position angle (PA)= 159.00$\pm$0.55$^\circ$. Furthermore, this H$\alpha$ source is within close proximity to a K band point source in SPHERE/IRDIS observation taken on 2023 July 21 \citep{sphere2025sub}. The astrometric offset between the K band and H$\alpha$ source can be explained by orbital motion of a bound companion. Thus our observations can be best explained by the discovery of an accreting protoplanet, 2MJ1612 b, with an estimated mass of 4$M_\text{Jup}$ and H$\alpha$ line flux ranging from (29.7 $\pm$7.5)$\times$10$^{-16}$ ergs/s/cm$^2$ to (8.2$\pm$3.4)$\times$10$^{-16}$ ergs/s/cm$^2$. 2MJ1612 b is likely the third example of an accreting H$\alpha$ protoplanet responsible for carving the gap in its host disk, joining PDS 70b and c. Further study is necessary to confirm and characterize this protoplanet candidate and to identify any additional protoplanets that may also play a role in shaping the gap.</description>

      <title>Four binary microlenses with directly measured masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated binary lens events from the 2022-2024 microlensing surveys, aiming to identify events suitable for lens mass measurements. We focused on two key light curve features: distinct caustic spikes with resolved crossings for measuring the angular Einstein radius ($\theta_{\rm E}$), and long durations enabling microlens-parallax ($\pi_{\rm E}$) measurements. Four events met these criteria: KMT-2022-BLG-1479, KMT-2023-BLG-0932, OGLE-2024-BLG-0142, and KMT-2024-BLG-1309. We estimated the angular Einstein radius by combining the normalized source radius measured from modeling the resolved caustic spikes with the angular source radius derived from the source color and magnitude. Additionally, we determined the microlens parallax through light curve modeling, considering higher-order effects caused by the orbital motions of Earth and the binary lens. With measurements of the event timescale, angular Einstein radius, and microlens parallax, we uniquely determined the mass and distance of the lens. For the events KMT-2022-BLG-1479, KMT-2023-BLG-0932, and KMT-2024-BLG-1309, both components of the binary lens have masses lower than that of the Sun, consistent with M-type dwarfs, which are the most common type of lenses in Galactic microlensing events. These lenses are relatively nearby, with distances $\lesssim 2.5$ kpc, indicating their location within the Galactic disk. In contrast, for OGLE-2024-BLG-0142, the primary lens component has a mass similar to that of the Sun, while the companion lens component has about half the mass of the primary. This lens system is situated at a greater distance, roughly 4.5 kpc.</description>

      <title>Strong NUV Refractory Absorption and Dissociated Water in the Hubble Transmission Spectrum of the Ultra Hot Jupiter KELT-20 b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultra hot Jupiters (UHJs) present a promising pathway for drawing a link between a planet's composition and formation history. They retain both refractory and volatiles species in gas phase in their atmospheres, which allows us to place unique constraints on their building blocks. Here, we present the 0.2 - 1.7 $\mu$m transmission spectrum of KELT-20 b/MASCARA-2 b taken with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Unlike other UHJs around early-type stars, KELT-20 b's orbit is well aligned with its host star's spin axis and we test whether its distinct dynamical configuration is reflected in its composition. We observe a tremendous rise (&gt;10 scale heights) in the planet's transit depth at the near-UV wavelengths, akin to that observed for WASP-178 b and WASP-121 b, and a muted water absorption feature in the near-IR. Our retrievals indicate that the large NUV depth is driven by Fe II and/or SiO and that the water is mostly thermally dissociated. Assuming equilibrium chemistry, we obtain constraints on Z/H and O/H that indicate accretion of volatile-rich solids and/or gas. Both our low resolution spectrum and the refractory elemental ratios from Gandhi et al. 2023 suggest that nightside condensation and rainout are limited to only the most refractory species in the planet's atmosphere. Within the precision limits of the HST spectra, no strong evidence for limb asymmetry is detected. We contextualize this lack of asymmetry by comparing to predictions from general circulation models with and without the effects of kinematic magnetohydrodynamics. Lastly, we find no major differences in the HST transmission spectra of KELT-20 b, WASP-178, and WASP-121 b despite their different dynamical configurations.</description>

      <title>Metallicities of M Dwarf Planet Host Stars from Kepler, K2, and TESS observed by APOGEE: Trends with Exoplanetary Radii and Orbital Periods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04066v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One important property in studying the exoplanet population is the host star metallicity ([M/H]). In this study, we derived stellar metallicities and oxygen abundances for 48 M dwarf stars using the near-infrared high-resolution spectra from the SDSS APOGEE survey and synthetic spectra computed in LTE. We also derived and investigated the exoplanetary radii distribution for a larger sample of 246 exoplanets orbiting 188 M dwarf stars. The [M/H] versus [O/M] distribution obtained indicates that our sample is composed mainly of thin disk stars, which follow the behavior of the low-alpha sequence in the Milky Way thin disk. Small planets with radii smaller than 3R$_{\oplus}$ were found around stars with a range of metallicities (-0.6$&lt;$[M/H]$&lt;$+0.3), while larger planets of the sample orbit only stars with [M/H]$\geq0.0$. These results indicate that while small planets can form in different environments, larger planets preferentially form in metal-rich protoplanetary disks. Exoplanets with P$_{\rm orb}&lt;$4.3 days orbit on average more metal-rich stars than planets with longer periods. This threshold is smaller than that found for FGK stars (8--10 days) and might be related to M dwarfs having a smaller dust sublimation radius. The distribution of exoplanets with R$_{\rm p}&gt;$4R$_{\oplus}$ shows a concentration at orbital periods between 2 and 5 days, which may result from inward orbital migration. There is also a different behavior between single-detected exoplanets and planets from multiplanetary systems, with the latter being found on average around more metal-poor stars, and with planetary radii roughly up to 3 R$_{\oplus}$.</description>
