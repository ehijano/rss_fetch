      <title>Visualization of The Content of Surah al Fiil using Marker-Based Augmented Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17895v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents the development of a marker-based augmented reality (AR) application designed to visualize the content of Surah al-Fil as an interactive and context-rich medium for Islamic education. Using a research and development approach, the system was developed through structured stages including data collection, user requirement analysis, interface design, 3D asset creation using Blender, and integration of Unity 3D with the Vuforia SDK. The application features key visual elements such as the elephant army, the Kaaba, and the Ababil birds, which were modeled in detail and linked to high-contrast image markers to ensure accurate and stable AR tracking. Functional testing demonstrated strong technical performance, achieving a 95 percent marker detection accuracy at an optimal distance of 30-40 cm with consistent real-time rendering across multiple Android devices. User evaluations involving students and Islamic education teachers indicated high acceptance, with an overall satisfaction score of 4.7 out of 5 in terms of usability, visual appeal, interactivity, and learning effectiveness. These findings indicate that AR-based learning media can enhance learner engagement, deepen understanding of Quranic narratives, and provide immersive insights into historical and spiritual contexts. Overall, this study demonstrates that marker-based AR technology has significant potential to support innovation in digital Islamic education by enriching traditional learning with interactive and visually intuitive experiences.</description>

      <title>Implementation of Augmented Reality as an Educational Tool for Practice in Early Childhood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning Wudhu for young children requires engaging and interactive media to foster a deep understanding of the worship procedures. This study aims to develop a Wudhu learning application based on Augmented Reality (AR) as an interactive and fun educational medium. The development method used includes the stages of needs analysis, system design, implementation, and testing using Black Box Testing. The system utilizes marker-based tracking to display 3D animations of Wudhu movements in real-time when the camera detects a marker on the printed media. The test results indicate that all main functions run well, and a limited trial on children aged 5-7 years showed an increase in learning interest and a better understanding of the Wudhu sequence. Thus, the application of AR technology is proven effective in improving the quality of basic worship instruction for young children.</description>

      <title>Towards Causal Market Simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04469v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Market generators using deep generative models have shown promise for synthetic financial data generation, but existing approaches lack causal reasoning capabilities essential for counterfactual analysis and risk assessment. We propose a Time-series Neural Causal Model VAE (TNCM-VAE) that combines variational autoencoders with structural causal models to generate counterfactual financial time series while preserving both temporal dependencies and causal relationships. Our approach enforces causal constraints through directed acyclic graphs in the decoder architecture and employs the causal Wasserstein distance for training. We validate our method on synthetic autoregressive models inspired by the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, demonstrating superior performance in counterfactual probability estimation with L1 distances as low as 0.03-0.10 compared to ground truth. The model enables financial stress testing, scenario analysis, and enhanced backtesting by generating plausible counterfactual market trajectories that respect underlying causal mechanisms.</description>
