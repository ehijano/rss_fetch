      <title>Spectral evolution of GX 17+2 using AstroSat and NICER observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the spectral evolution of the Z-track source GX 17+2 using AstroSat and NICER observations taken between 2016 and 2020. The AstroSat observations cover the period when the source is in the normal branch (NB) and the flaring branch (FB), while for the NICER ones the variability can be associated with the FB branch. The source spectra at different regions of the branches are well described by accretion disk emission, blackbody surface emission and a thermal Comptonization component. In the NB, the total bolometric unabsorbed flux remains constant and the variation is due to changes in the Comptonization, disk fluxes. In particular, the inferred luminosity ($L_{\rm T}$) and accretion rate ($\dot M$) remain constant, while there is significant variation in the inner disk radii and fraction of disk photons entering the corona, indicating changes in the geometry of the system. On the other hand, in the FB, there is significant variation in luminosity from $\sim 4.0$ to $\sim 7.0 \times 10^{38}$ ergs s$^{-1}$. Despite this significant variation in luminosity and in the inner disk radii, the accretion efficiency defined as $\eta = L_{\rm T}/{\dot M} c^2$, remains nearly constant at $\sim 0.20$ throughout the evolution of the source, as expected for a neutron star system.</description>

      <title>Impact of magnetic field-driven anisotropies on the equation of state probed in neutron star mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary neutron star mergers can produce extreme magnetic fields, some of which can lead to strong magnetar-like remnants. While strong magnetic fields have been shown to affect the dynamics of outflows and angular momentum transport in the remnant, they can also crucially alter the properties of nuclear matter probed in the merger. In this work, we provide a first assessment of the latter, determining the strength of the pressure anisotropy caused by Landau level quantization and the anomalous magnetic moment. To this end, we perform the first numerical relativity simulation with a magnetic polarization tensor and a magnetic-field-dependent equation of state using a new algorithm we present here, which also incorporates a mean-field dynamo model to control the magnetic field strength present in the merger remnant. Our results show that -- in the most optimistic case -- corrections to the anisotropy can be in excess of $10\%$, and are potentially largest in the outer layers of the remnant. This work paves the way for a systematic investigation of these effects.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Faint-End Slope of the FRB Energy Function Using CHIME/FRB Catalog-1 and Local Volume Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite hundreds of detected fast radio bursts (FRBs), the faint-end slope ($\gamma$) of their energy distribution remains poorly constrained, hindering understanding of whether bright, cosmological FRBs and faint, Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154-like bursts share a common origin. In this study, we constrain this faint-end slope, modeled with a Schechter-like distribution, by searching for potential associations between bursts from the CHIME/FRB Catalog-1 and galaxies in the local volume. We cross-matched Catalog-1 FRBs with 495 local volume galaxies within 21 Mpc, identified from the HECATE catalog, and found no associations. Assuming the FRB energy function extends to $\sim 3 \times 10^{34}$ erg-the energy of the Galactic magnetar burst from SGR 1935+2154-this null result constrains $\gamma$ to be $&lt;$ 2.3 (95% confidence upper limit), representing the first empirical estimate for extragalactic FRBs at such low energies. This finding supports the hypothesis that the FRB population is dominated by bright, likely cosmological bursts with a relatively flat energy distribution ($\gamma &lt; 2.5$). However, the constraint weakens if higher energy thresholds are assumed. A flatter energy function is consistent with the observed anti-correlation between FRB dispersion measure and fluence, as seen across various observational bands. While the contribution of low-energy bursts, such as those from the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154, appears minimal, our results suggest that normal magnetars like SGR 1935+2154 could dominate the FRB population if their burst rates and energies scale with age and magnetic field. Upcoming CHIME/FRB Catalog-2 data and targeted nearby galaxy surveys will further refine these constraints, offering critical insight into whether FRBs arise from a single population or diverse origins.</description>

      <title>Probing the peak of star formation with the stochastic background of binary black hole mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration detects many individually resolvable gravitational-wave events from binary black hole mergers, those that are too weak to be identified individually contribute to a stochastic gravitational-wave background. Unlike the standard cross-correlation search for excess correlated power, a Bayesian search method that models the background as a superposition of an unknown number of mergers enables simultaneous inference of the properties of high-redshift binary black hole populations and accelerated detection of the background. In this work, we apply this templated background search method to one day of simulated data at current LIGO Hanford-Livingston detector network sensitivity to determine whether the weakest mergers contribute information to the detection of the background and to the constraint on the merger redshift distribution at high redshifts. We find that the dominant source of information for the detection of the stochastic background comes from mergers with signal-to-noise ratios just below the individual detection threshold. However, we demonstrate that the weakest mergers do contribute to the constraint on the shape of the redshift distribution not only beyond the peak of star formation, but also beyond the redshifts accessible with individually detectable sources.</description>

      <title>Jet precession in gamma-ray bursts: The roles of fallback accretion and disk dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The precession phenomenon of the jet in a gamma-ray burst (GRB) is a key probe of the physics of the central engine. Previous studies generally assumed a fixed precession period when analysing the temporal profiles in GRBs; however, the dynamic evolution of the fallback process and accretion disk can significantly affect the precession behaviour. In this work we present a jet precession model that incorporates the co-evolution of fallback accretion and the central black hole (BH). Our model demonstrates that the jet precession period initially decreases rapidly during the early fallback phase and subsequently increases nearly linearly as the disk evolves. We find that a higher accretion disk viscosity and a slower BH spin lead to longer precession periods and faster precession period growth rates, and that the geometric structure of the precession system modulates the pulse amplitude of the light curve. By fitting the model to observational data of GRBs with multi-pulse structures, we show that jet precession can naturally explain the increasing pulse intervals and broadened pulse widths observed in both long and short GRBs.</description>

      <title>Spins of SMBHs in distant low luminosity AGNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We estimated radiative efficiency, spin and SMBH mass values for sample of 33 distant low luminosity AGNs. The distribution of the estimated spin values (majority of objects have a spin greater than 0.8) is fairly typical for many types of AGNs. The dependence of the estimated spin values on the estimated SMBH masses shows strong correlation between them, which suggests a rapid increase in spin with mass, i.e. that the main mechanism of mass growth in this case is disk accretion. We did not find any significant qualitative differences in the spin characteristics between our objects and objects of other types considered in the paper.</description>

      <title>A pipeline to search for signatures of line-of-sight acceleration in gravitational wave signals produced by compact binary coalescences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compact binary coalescences (CBCs), such as merging binary black holes (BBHs), binary neutron stars (BNSs), or neutron star black holes (NSBHs), hosted by dense stellar environments, could produce gravitational waves (GWs) that contain signatures of line-of-sight acceleration (LOSA) imparted by the environment's gravitational potential. We calculate the Post-Newtonian (PN) corrections to the $(2,\,2)$ mode GW phase due to a finite LOSA, starting from the leading order at -4 PN below the quadrupole order, up to 3.5 PN above the quadrupole order. We do so for binaries whose component spins are aligned with the orbital angular momentum, as well as for binaries with non-zero tidal deformation. We implement these corrections into the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra (LVK) collaboration's flagship parameter estimation (PE) software \textsc{Bilby\_tgr}. We study the systematics associated with recovering LOSAs. We find that, when the injection and recovery waveform models are identical, LOSAs are recovered as expected. We test the robustness of the pipeline against waveforms with strong higher-mode signatures or signatures of beyond-general-relativistic (beyond-GR) effects, to delimit the range of applicability of our GR-consistent quasi-circular LOSA-corrected waveforms.</description>

      <title>Revision of conservative lower bound on intergalactic magnetic field from Fermi and Cherenkov telescope observations of extreme blazars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Joint observations of extreme blazars with Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) and Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACT) have been previously used to derive lower bounds on intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF). We update these previous bounds using a set of extreme blazars that are detected in the Very-High-Energy (VHE, photon energies above 100 GeV) band by both Fermi/LAT and IACTs. We measure IGMF-dependent suppression of secondary delayed gamma-ray flux from electron-positron pairs deposited in the intergalactic medium by VHE gamma-rays interacting with Extragalactic Background Light. From overall 22 extreme blazars detected by Fermi/LAT and IACTs in the VHE band, seven have their spectral characteristics inconsistent with the possibility of zero magnetic field along their lines of sight, even under the most restrictive assumption that the sources have only switched on at the start of VHE band observations. Adopting this assumption, we derive a "conservative" lower bound on the IGMF strength at the level of 2e-17 G. The tightest bound is imposed by the signal of 1ES 0502+675, a source that has not been considered in the IGMF analysis before. Our bound is comparable to the bound derived by MAGIC collaboration, but is weaker than that previously derived from analysis of Fermi/LAT and HESS telescope data, even though our dataset includes that data. We clarify the origin of this discrepancy.</description>

      <title>NuSTAR and XMM-Newton Observations of PSR J1930+1852 and Its Pulsar Wind Nebula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synchrotron X-ray emission from a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) is a sensitive probe of its magnetic field and high-energy particle population. Here we analyze contemporaneous NuSTAR and XMM-Newton observations of the PWN G54.1+0.3, powered by pulsar PSR J1930+1852. We also present a preliminary timing analysis of the central pulsar PSR J1930+1852 and analyze its X-ray pulse profiles in different energy bands. We detect X-ray emission from the combined pulsar and PWN system up to $\approx70$ keV, while emission from the PWN itself has been detected up to $\approx30$ keV, with a photon index $\Gamma$ increasing from $\sim 1.9$ to $\sim 2.4$ with photon energy between 3 and 30 keV. PWN G54.1+0.3's X-ray spectrum is consistent with a broken power law, with break energy $E_{\rm break} \approx 5$ keV, consistent with synchrotron cooling of a single power-law particle spectrum. The best-fit broadband spectral energy distribution model after the inclusion of this new spectral data indicates a maximum particle $E_{\rm max} \sim 400$ TeV. We discuss PSR J1930+1852 and PWN G54.1+0.3 in the context of other PWNe powered by young energetic pulsars.</description>

      <title>Resupplying planetary debris to old white dwarfs with supernova blast waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One challenge with explaining how high levels of planetary debris can enrich, or "pollute", old ($\sim$3 Gyr) and very old ($\sim$10 Gyr) white dwarfs is that debris reservoirs deplete on shorter timescales, akin to the solar system's already eviscerated Main Belt and Kuiper Belt. Here, I explore how these extrasolar reservoirs can be resupplied through supernovae that propel distant ($\gtrsim 10^4$ au) dust, sand and pebbles, and potentially boulders and comets, into the inner ($\lesssim 10^2$ au) planetary system. I analytically constrain the geometry of these blast waves, and derive expressions for the probability of apt blast configurations occurring. I then derive the minimum kick magnitudes needed to generate stable, leaky and broken post-blast orbits, and prove that within this formalism, at most 23 per cent of true anomalies along an eccentric orbit could allow for resupplied planetary debris to experience repeated pericentre passages. By linking these kick magnitudes with debris sizes and relating these quantities to the local neighbourhood supernova rate, I conclude that the probabilities for ejection or resupply per supernova blast are $\approx$100 per cent for micron-sized dust and millimetre-sized pebbles and sand, and $\approx$0 per cent for asteroids larger than $\sim$10 km. In between these extremes, I expect metre-sized boulders to be resupplied at least once to very old white dwarfs over their cooling ages. The efficacy of this debris delivery mechanism is dependent on the time-varying sources and sinks in an exo-Oort cloud and how its parent white dwarf has, throughout its cooling age, traversed the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Decoding AGN Feedback with X-arithmetic: From Morphology to Physical Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Feedback from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is a key process in the evolution of massive halos in the Universe. New observational information on feedback is crucial for improving the implementation of the physics in numerical models. In this work, we apply a novel image-manipulation technique, termed 'X-arithmetic', to a sample of 15 galaxy clusters and groups deeply observed with Chandra. This technique decomposes perturbations in feedback-dominated regions into images excluding either (1) weak shocks and sound waves, (2) bubbles inflated by jets, or (3) cooling and slow gas motions (isobaric perturbations), enabling efficient spatial identification of these features without involving spectroscopic analysis. We confirm the nature of previously (spectroscopically-)identified features and newly establish the origin of other structures. We find that feedback produces multiple shocks in groups and massive galaxies, but only one to two shocks in clusters. Prominent isobaric structures are abundant around inner cavities in clusters, compared to almost no such structures in groups. These differences suggest that feedback effects are stronger in smaller-mass systems, possibly due to the shallower gravitational potential of groups or more violent feedback. Follow-up spectroscopy, guided by the X-arithmetic results, suggests that earlier-identified "isothermal shocks" could be a mix of isobaric and adiabatic structures. We applied X-arithmetic to galaxy cluster simulations, demonstrating its straightforward application and future potential for testing the feedback physics details in simulations. Our feasibility study shows that imaging data from future X-ray observatories like AXIS will be ideal for expanding X-arithmetic application to a larger sample of objects.</description>

Abstract: With its first All-Sky Survey (eRASS1), the extended ROentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA) on board the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) mission has offered an unprecedented, comprehensive view of the variable X-ray sky. Featuring enhanced sensitivity, broader energy coverage, and improved resolution compared to prior surveys, the eRASS1 Data Release 1 (DR1) catalogue underwent a variability analysis, and in this paper, we performed an advanced variability analysis focusing on a substantial subset of 128,669 sources, all exhibiting a net count exceeding ten. We performed multiple variability tests, utilising conventional normalised excess variance (NEV), maximum amplitude variability (AMP), and Bayesian excess variance methods (bexvar). Within the 128,669 DR1 sources with light curves, our research pinpointed 808 light curves that show hints of variability according to the AMP test, and 298 according to the NEV test. However, after applying suitable thresholds, 90 (123) sources were found to be significantly variable according to the AMP (NEV) tests. In addition, 1342 sources are considered variable according to the Bayesian test bexvar. The total number of unique sources is 1709, and they form the catalogue of variable sources released with this paper. We cross-matched with existing X-ray catalogues and identified 258, 318, 598, and 120 sources in 4XMM DR13, 2SXPS, 2RXS, and CSC2.1, respectively. In this paper, we analyse the variability of eRASS1 sources on a timescale of only a few days. To study the physics of variable sources, we need more deeply pointed observations with other X-ray missions or at least the final depth of the eRASS:8 observations. A substantial 52 % of the eRASS1 variable sources were first discovered with eROSITA. The DR1 variability catalogue is excellent for follow-up observations with telescopes such as XMM-Newton, Chandra, or Swift.</description>

      <title>Structural response of neutron stars to rapid rotation and its impact on the braking index</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pulsars are rotating neutron stars that are observed to be slowing down, implying a loss of their rotational energy. There can be several different physical mechanisms involved in their spin-down process. The properties of fast-rotating pulsars depend on the nature of the neutron star matter, which can also affect the spin-down mechanisms. In this work, we examine three different physical phenomena contributing to the spin-down: magnetic dipole radiation, gravitational mass quadrupole radiation due to the ``mountain" formation, gravitational mass current quadrupole radiation or the r-modes, and calculate the expressions for the braking indices due to all of them. We have also considered the implications of the uncertainties of the equation of the state of neutron star matter and rapid rotation on the braking indices corresponding to the aforementioned processes and their combinations. In all cases, the rapid rotation results in a departure of the braking index from the standard values when the rotational effects are ignored. If generated with a saturation amplitude within the range of $10^{-4} - 10^{-1}$, the r-mode oscillations dominate the spin-down of millisecond pulsars. Moreover, we explore the braking index in the context of millisecond magnetars. We also study the effects of different choices of baryon mass on the braking indices.</description>

      <title>Phase Space of Binary Black Holes from Gravitational Wave Observations to Unveil its Formation History</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational Wave (GW) sources offer a valuable window to the physical processes that govern the formation of binary compact objects (BCOs). However, deciphering such information from GW data is substantially challenging due to the difficulty in mapping from the space of observation to the space of numerous theoretical models. We introduce the concept of BCO Phase-Space that connects the observable space to the evolution trajectories of the BCO formation channels with cosmic time and apply it to the third GW transient catalog (GWTC-3) that brings new insights into probable astrophysical formation scenarios of nearly $90$ events. Our study reveals that two events, GW190425 and GW230529, show an overlap with a \texttt{BCO Phase Space} trajectory of the same formation channel arising from a sub-solar mass black hole scenario that has grown into a higher mass by accretion, hinting towards the common primordial origin of both these sources. Though the actual formation channel is yet to be confirmed, with the availability of more GW events, the \texttt{BCO Phase Space} can delve into distinguishing features of different formation channels for both astrophysical and primordial origin and opens the possibility of bringing new and deeper insights on the formation and evolution of BCOs across all observable masses over most of the cosmic time.</description>

      <title>Multiwavelength Analysis of GRB 250101A: From Gamma-ray Prompt Emission to Optical Afterglow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interaction between the relativistic jet and the circumburst medium produces a multiwavelength afterglow of a gamma-ray burst (GRBs). In this work, we present multiwavelength properties of GRB~250101A based on the observations of Swift, Fermi and Mephisto. The spectral analysis of Swift/BAT and Fermi/GBM reveals a soft prompt spectrum with a low-energy photon index of $-1.18$ and a peak energy of 33 keV, and the isotropic energy is $1.4\times10^{52}~{\rm erg}$. The prompt emission of GRB 250101A aligns with Type II GRBs in the Amati relation. Meanwhile, our analysis indicates that GRB 250101A is an X-ray-rich or X-ray-dominated GRB, with intrinsic properties suggesting that it is relatively softer than most classical GRBs. Optical observation with Mephisto, beginning 197 s post-trigger, shows a single power-law decay in $uvgriz$ bands, with $F_{\nu,\mathrm{obs}} \propto t^{-0.76} \nu^{-1.21}$. The observed spectral index significantly exceeds theoretical predictions under standard afterglow models, suggesting a color excess of $\sim0.216$ mag. However, combining X-ray and optical afterglow, we find that GRB 250101A is more likely a ``normal burst'' rather than an ``optical-dark burst'', and the dust extinction effect plays an important role in the optical blue bands. Furthermore, there is a structural change at $T_0+2924$ s in the optical light curve, indicating a density drop of $\sim50$ \% in the interstellar medium at a distance of $\sim0.13~{\rm pc}$. Our analysis shows that this GRB clearly shows some unique characteristics in its observed X-ray rich prompt emission as well as the circumburst environment, implying a special progenitor.</description>

      <title>Millimeter emission from supermassive black hole coronae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) host accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs). The accretion can lead to the formation of a hot, X-ray emitting corona close to the SMBH capable of accelerating relativistic electrons. Observations in the millimetre (mm) band can probe its synchrotron emission. We provide a framework to derive physical information of SMBH coronae by modelling their spectral energy distribution (SED) from radio to far infrared frequencies. We also explore the possibilities of deriving additional information from mm observations, such as the SMBH mass, and studying high-redshift lensed sources. We introduce a corona emission model based on a one-zone spherical region with a hybrid thermal and non-thermal plasma. We investigate in detail how the corona SED depends on different parameters such as size, opacity, and magnetic field strength. Other galactic emission components from dust, ionised gas and diffuse relativistic electrons are also included in the SED fitting scheme. We apply our code consistently to a sample of radio-quiet AGN with strong indications of a coronal component in the mm. The detected mm emission from SMBH coronae is consistent with having a non-thermal relativistic particle population with an energy density that is ~0.5-10% of that in the thermal plasma. This requires magnetic energy densities close to equipartition with the thermal gas, and corona sizes of 60-250 gravitational radii. The model can also reproduce the observed correlation between mm emission and SMBH mass when accounting for uncertainties in the corona size. The mm band offers a unique window into the physics of SMBH coronae, enabling the study of highly dust-obscured sources and high-redshift lensed quasars. Gaining a deeper understanding of the relativistic particle population in SMBH coronae can provide key insights into their potential multiwavelength and neutrino emission.</description>

      <title>The Vela pulsar and its pulsar wind nebula Vela-X using 13 years of Fermi-LAT Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16687v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present results of more than 13 years of Fermi-LAT data analysis for the Vela pulsar from 60 MeV to 100 GeV and its pulsar wind nebula (PWN), Vela-X, for E &gt; 1 GeV in the off-pulse phases. We find the Vela-X PWN can be best characterized using two extended components: a large radial Gaussian accompanied by an off-set, compact radial disk, both with a similar spectral index, \Gamma \sim 2.3. The common spectral properties support a common PWN origin, but a supernova remnant component is plausible for the compact radial disk. With an updated Vela-X model, the phase resolved spectral properties of the Vela pulsar are explored through a phase-resolved analysis. The phase-resolved spectral properties of the pulsar are presented, such as the SED peak energy E$_p$, the width of the SED at its peak, d$_p$, and the asymptotic (low-energy) spectral index, $\Gamma_0$, are presented. The best-fit spectral models for each LAT pulse peak (Peak 1 and Peak 2) are extrapolated to UV energies and compared to archival, phase-resolved spectra at UV, X-ray, soft \gamma-ray and TeV energies. We also discuss the physical implications of our modeling and the data comparisons.</description>

      <title>Deterministic and Stochastic Study of the X-ray Emission from the TeV Blazar Mrk~421</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive timing analysis of X-ray data from the {\it XMM-Newton} satellite, examining 50 light curves covering 17 years of observations of the blazar Mrk~421. This work uses classical deterministic and stochastic methods in a novel way, enabling the distinction of temporal scales and offering essential insights through correlations among parameters. Deterministic behaviors are primarily explored through recurrence quantification analysis (RQA), used innovatively by varying the threshold input parameter to examine variability at multiple temporal scales. To investigate behavior across various scales from a stochastic perspective, we apply both autoregressive moving average (ARMA) and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models, with results from ARIMA more tightly related to short scales. Our findings reveal that Mrk~421's X-ray emission is a multifaceted process, driven by both deterministic and stochastic patterns, indicating a complex interplay of physical phenomena. Our study demonstrates that deterministic patterns are more pronounced at small temporal scales, which are disconnected from large scales. On the other hand, stochastic processes with memory propagate from large to small time scales, while noise affects both scales, as indicated by the correlation analysis. These results underscore the importance of advanced methodologies for interpreting astrophysical data, contributing to ongoing discussions in blazar physics by exploring connections between our calculated parameters and established models. The same approach can potentially be applied to other sources, enhancing our general understanding of variability and emission mechanisms in blazars.</description>

      <title>Rapid follow-up observations of infant supernovae with the Gran Telescopio Canarias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first few hours of a supernova (SN) contain significant information about the progenitor system. The most modern wide-field surveys that scan the sky repeatedly every few days can discover all kinds of transients in those early epochs. At such times, some progenitor footprints may be visible, elucidating critical explosion parameters and helping to distinguish between leading explosion models. A dedicated spectroscopic classification programme using the optical spectrograph OSIRIS mounted on the Gran Telescopio Canarias was set up to try to obtain observations of supernovae (SNe) at those early epochs. With the time awarded, we obtained spectra of 10 SN candidates, which we present here. Half of them were thermonuclear SNe, while the other half were core-collapse SNe. Most (70\%) were observed within the first six days of the estimated explosion, with two being captured within the first 48\,hr. We present a characterization of the spectra, together with other public ancillary photometry from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS). This project shows the need for an accompanying rapid-response spectroscopic programme for existing and future deep photometric wide-field surveys located at the right longitude to be able to trigger observations in a few hours after the discovery of the SN candidate.</description>

      <title>To detect strong nugget with an acoustic array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article discusses strong nuggets (SNs) which means strong interaction condensed matter with a mass of about $10^6\,$g. They may originate from the early universe, supernova, pulsar merger event, and so on. Depending on the equation of state, the SNs could be stable and even be one of the candidates for dark matter. In order to detect SNs which hitting the Earth or the Moon at a non-relativistic velocity, a new messenger, the acoustic array, is analysed. The results of the calculations show that the impact signal of an SN can be detected at a distance of about 30 kilometers from the nugget's trajectory. By using microphone boxes, hydrophones or seismographs to construct an array in the bedrock, ocean or on the Moon, it is possible to reconstruct the velocity, mass, and interacting cross section of SNs, and then constrain also the nature of supra-nuclear matter. The acoustic array can also be used for distributed acoustic sensing of meteorites or earthquakes. The sonar localisation system on the proposed High-energy Underwater Neutrino Telescope (HUNT) is suggested as a pathfinder for acoustic array detection.</description>

      <title>Rapid inference and comparison of gravitational-wave population models with neural variational posteriors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07197v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA catalog has been analyzed with an abundance of different population models due to theoretical uncertainty in the formation of gravitational-wave sources. To expedite model exploration, we introduce an efficient and accurate variational Bayesian approach that learns the population posterior with a normalizing flow and serves as a drop-in replacement for existing samplers. With hardware acceleration, inference takes just seconds for the current set of black-hole mergers and readily scales to larger catalogs. The trained posteriors provide an arbitrary number of independent samples with exact probability densities, unlike established stochastic sampling algorithms, while requiring up to three orders of magnitude fewer likelihood evaluations and as few as $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$. Provided the posterior support is covered, discrepancies can be addressed with smoothed importance sampling, which quantifies a goodness-of-fit metric for the variational approximation while also estimating the evidence for Bayesian model selection. Neural variational inference thus enables interactive development, analysis, and comparison of population models, making it a useful tool for astrophysical interpretation of current and future gravitational-wave observations.</description>
