      <title>Mapping of discrete range modulated proton radiograph to water-equivalent path length using machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective. Proton beams enable localized dose delivery. Accurate range estimation is essential, but planning still relies on X-ray CT, which introduces uncertainty in stopping power and range. Proton CT measures water equivalent thickness directly but suffers resolution loss from multiple Coulomb scattering. We develop a data driven method that reconstructs water equivalent path length (WEPL) maps from energy resolved proton radiographs, bypassing intermediate reconstructions. Approach. We present a machine learning pipeline for WEPL from high dimensional radiographs. Data were generated with the TOPAS Monte Carlo toolkit, modeling a clinical nozzle and a patient CT. Proton energies spanned 70-230 MeV across 72 projection angles. Principal component analysis reduced input dimensionality while preserving signal. A conditional GAN with gradient penalty was trained for WEPL prediction using a composite loss (adversarial, MSE, SSIM, perceptual) to balance sharpness, accuracy, and stability. Main results. The model reached a mean relative WEPL deviation of 2.5 percent, an SSIM of 0.97, and a proton radiography gamma index passing rate of 97.1 percent (2 percent delta WEPL, 3 mm distance-to-agreement) on a simulated head phantom. Results indicate high spatial fidelity and strong structural agreement. Significance. WEPL can be mapped directly from proton radiographs with deep learning while avoiding intermediate steps. The method mitigates limits of analytic techniques and may improve treatment planning. Future work will tune the number of PCA components, include detector response, explore low dose settings, and extend multi angle data toward full proton CT reconstruction; it is compatible with clinical workflows.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium nonlinear response theory of amplitude-dependent dissipative conductivity in disordered superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates amplitude-dependent nonlinear corrections to the dissipative conductivity in superconductors, using the Keldysh-Usadel theory of nonequilibrium superconductivity, which captures the nonequilibrium dynamics of both quasiparticles and the pair potential. Our rigorous formulation naturally incorporates both the direct nonlinear action of the photon field and indirect contributions mediated by nonequilibrium variations in the pair potential, namely the Eliashberg effect and the Higgs mode. The third-harmonic current, often regarded as a hallmark of the Higgs mode, arises from both the direct photon action and the Higgs mode. Our numerical results are in excellent agreement with previous studies. In contrast, the first-harmonic current, and consequently the dissipative conductivity, receives contributions from all three mechanisms: the direct photon action, the Higgs mode, and the Eliashberg effect. It is shown that that the nonlinear correction to dissipative conductivity can serve as a fingerprint of the Higgs mode, appearing as a resonance peak at a frequency near the superconducting gap \( \Delta \). In addition, our results provide microscopic insight into amplitude-dependent dissipation at frequencies well below \( \Delta \), which is particularly relevant for applied superconducting devices. In particular, the long-standing issue concerning the frequency dependence of the amplitude-dependent quality factor is explained as originating from the direct nonlinear action of the photon field, rather than from contributions by the Higgs mode and the Eliashberg effect. Our practical and explicit expression for the nonlinear conductivity formula makes our results accessible to a broad range of researchers.</description>

      <title>First operation of the FAMU experiment at the RIKEN-RAL high intensity muon beam facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The FAMU experiment, supported and funded by the Italian Institute of Nuclear Physics (INFN) and by the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC), aims to perform the first measurement of the ground-state hyperfine splitting (1S-hfs) of muonic hydrogen ($\mu H$). This quantity is highly sensitive to the proton's Zemach radius $R_Z$. An experimental determination of $R_Z$ provides significant constraints on the parametrization of the proton form factors as well as on theoretical models describing the proton's electromagnetic structure. Following years of technological and methodological development, the FAMU experiment began operations in 2023 at Port 1 of the RIKEN-RAL muon beam line at the ISIS Neutron and Muon Source facility (Didcot, UK). In this paper, we first describe the unique detection technique employed by FAMU to determine the 1S-hfs of muonic hydrogen, followed by a detailed presentation of the final experimental layout. Finally, we report the first outcome from the 2023 commissioning run and from the initial physics runs performed in 2023 and 2024.</description>

      <title>Viewing heat through ice: an infrared camera monitors hydrogel freezing and thawing during cryoapplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cryosurgery employs a safe and relatively simple technique of exposure and is an advantageous and highly rated method. For its effective application, it is necessary to control both the volume of the expanding freezing zone and volumetric thermal field dynamics. The aim of this study was to perform a thermal imaging study of freezing and thawing in a model system (gel phantom) to predict the dynamics of the freezing zone during cryodestruction of biological tissues in vivo. Here, the thermal imager is an effective tool for demonstrating the surface temperature distribution. We have studied how the observed infrared image relates to the distribution and change of the thermal field in depth. For this purpose, we created test measuring equipment for simultaneous analysis of the dynamics of thermal fields on the surface, video recording of freezing and thawing on the surface as well as in the depth of the gel phantom, measuring the temperature at any given point in the depth and modeling in the zone of low-temperature exposure of vessels with different blood flow parameters. It was revealed that with a modeled vessel in the low-temperature exposure zone, the surface thermal fields deformed and they gained the shape of butterfly wings. Our experimental study in a gel phantom is supported by numerical calculations, demonstrating how the freezing zone and thermal isotherms on the surface and in depth evolve under real conditions, thereby providing a basis for assessing the cryoeffect time and intensity in practice. Key words: cryoapplication; freezing; thawing; temperature field dynamics; infrared thermography; gel phantom; testing measuring equipment; vessel simulation.</description>

      <title>ML-based muon identification using a FNAL-NICADD scintillator chamber for the MID subsystem of ALICE 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02817</link>

Abstract: The ALICE Collaboration is planning to construct a new detector (ALICE 3) aiming at exploiting the potential of the high-luminosity Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The new detector will allow ALICE to participate in LHC Run 5 scheduled from 2036 to 2041. The muon-identifier subsystem (MID) is part of the ALICE 3 reference detector layout. The MID will consist of a standard magnetic iron absorber ($\approx4$ nuclear interaction lengths) followed by muon chambers. The baseline option for the MID chambers considers plastic scintillation bars equipped with wave-length shifting fibers and readout with silicon photomultipliers. This paper reports on the performance of a MID chamber prototype using 3 GeV/$c$ pion- and muon-enriched beams delivered by the CERN Proton Synchrotron (PS). The prototype was built using extruded plastic scintillator produced by FNAL-NICADD (Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory - Northern Illinois Center for Accelerator and Detector Development). The prototype was experimentally evaluated using varying absorber thicknesses (60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 cm) to assess its performance. The analysis was performed using Machine Learning techniques and the performance was validated with GEANT 4 simulations. Potential improvements in both hardware and data analysis are discussed.</description>

      <title>New results from fast timing iLGAD sensor on Timepix4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) the number of collisions per bunch crossing increases. To cope with these high rates in the pixel trackers, per-pixel time measurements are required, which implies the need for fast sensors. The inverse Low-Gain Avalanche Detector (iLGAD) is one of the fast sensor options that is being investigated. This paper will show the results of an inverse Low-Gain Avalanche Detector (iLGAD) with a pitch of 55 $\mu$m, a thickness of 250~$\mu$m and a large-area (2~cm$^2$), bump bonded to a Timepix4 ASIC. Timepix4 has 195~ps time binning on each pixel and therefore an excellent ASIC to test the sensor. The sensor is characterised with radio-active source measurements in the lab, and during beam test at the CERN SPS North Area H8 beamline, where the Timepix4 telescope was used. The telescope has a time reference of 12~ps and a pointing resolution of 2.4 $\pm$ 0.1~$\mu$m. The iLGAD shows an almost uniform gain of approximately 4 and an efficiency of 99.6 $\pm$ 0.1\%. Without any corrections the obtained time resolution is about 750~ps. After timewalk and clock corrections the time resolution becomes 377 $\pm$ 7~ps. Grazing angle measurements have been done, which allow to measure the time resolution as function of depth of the charge deposition in the sensor. This provides more insight for the perpendicular time resolution.</description>

      <title>Direct Measurement of the $^{39}$Ar Half-life from 3.4 Years of Data with the DEAP-3600 Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13196v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The half-life of $^{39}$Ar is measured using the DEAP-3600 detector located 2 km underground at SNOLAB. Between 2016 and 2020, DEAP-3600 used a target mass of (3269 $\pm$ 24) kg of liquid argon distilled from the atmosphere in a direct-detection dark matter search. Such an argon mass also enables direct measurements of argon isotope properties. The decay of $^{39}$Ar in DEAP-3600 is the dominant source of triggers by two orders of magnitude, ensuring high statistics and making DEAP-3600 well-suited for measuring this isotope's half-life. Use of the pulse-shape discrimination technique in DEAP-3600 allows powerful discrimination between nuclear recoils and electron recoils, resulting in the selection of a clean sample of $^{39}$Ar decays. Observing over a period of 3.4 years, the $^{39}$Ar half-life is measured to be $(302 \pm 8_{\rm stat} \pm 6_{\rm sys})$ years. This new direct measurement suggests that the half-life of $^{39}$Ar is significantly longer than the accepted value, with potential implications for measurements using this isotope's half-life as input.</description>
