      <title>A consistent description of the kinetic processes of electrolyte ion transport in a dynamic porous medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The consistent description of kinetic and hydrodynamic processes is applied to the study of ion transport processes in the ionic solution-porous medium system. A system of equations is obtained for the nonequilibrium single-ion distribution function, the nonequilibrium average value of the energy density of the interaction of solution ions, and the nonequilibrium average value of the number density of particles in a porous medium. Using the fractional calculus technique, a generalized diffusion equation of the Cattaneo type in fractional derivatives is obtained to describe the processes of subdiffusion of particles in a porous medium.</description>

      <title>Discrete-space and -time analogue of a super-diffusive fractional Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss how to construct reliably well "a lattice and an integer time" version of a super-diffusive continuous-space and -time fractional Brownian motion (fBm) -- an experimentally-relevant non-Markovian Gaussian stochastic process with an everlasting power-law memory on the time-evolution of thermal noises extending over the entire past. We propose two algorithms, which are both validated by extensive numerical simulations showing that the ensuing lattice random walks have not only the same power-law covariance function as the standard fBm, but also individual trajectories follow those of the super-diffusive fBm. Finding a lattice and an integer time analogue of a sub-diffusion fBm, which is an anti-persistent process, remains a challenging open problem. Our results also clarify the relevant difference between sub-diffusive and super-diffusive fBm, that are frequently seen as two very analogous realizations of processes with memory. They are indeed substantially different.</description>

      <title>Classical algorithm inspired by the feedback-based algorithm for quantum optimization and local counterdiabatic driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a quantum-inspired classical algorithm for combinatorial optimization problems, named the counterdiabaticity-assisted classical algorithm for optimization (CACAO). In this algorithm, a solution of a given combinatorial optimization problem is heuristically searched with classical spin dynamics based on quantum Lyapunov control of local counterdiabatic driving. We compare the performance of CACAO with that of quantum time-evolution algorithms, i.e., quantum annealing, the feedback-based algorithm for quantum optimization (known as FALQON), and the counterdiabatic feedback-based quantum algorithm (known as CD-FQA). We also study the performance of CACAO applied to large systems up to $10,000$ spins.</description>

      <title>Quench dynamics of negativity Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the quench dynamics of the negativity and fermionic negativity Hamiltonians in free fermionic systems. We do this by generalizing a recently developed quasiparticle picture for the entanglement Hamiltonians to tripartite geometries. We obtain analytic expressions for these quantities which are then extensively checked against previous results and numerics. In particular, we find that the standard negativity Hamiltonian contains both non-local hopping terms and four fermion interactions, whereas the fermionic version is purely quadratic. However, despite their marked difference, we show that the logarithmic negativity obtained from either are identical in the ballistic scaling limit, as are their symmetry resolution.</description>

      <title>Scaling the glassy dynamics of active particles: Tunable fragility and reentrance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the influence of activity on dense amorphous assemblies is crucial for biological processes such as wound healing, embryogenesis, or cancer progression. Here, we study the effect of self-propulsion forces of amplitude $f_0$ and persistence time $\tau_p$ in dense assemblies of soft repulsive particles, a model system that interpolates between particulate active matter and biological tissues. We identify the fluid and glass phases of the three-dimensional phase diagram obtained by varying $f_0$, $\tau_p$, and the packing fraction $\phi$. The morphology of the phase diagram directly accounts for a non-monotonic evolution of the relaxation time with $\tau_p$, which is a direct consequence of the crossover in the dominant relaxation mechanism, from glassy to jamming. A second major consequence is the evolution of the glassy dynamics from sub-Arrhenius to super-Arrhenius. We show that this tunable glass fragility extends to active systems analogous observations reported for passive particles. This allows us to apply a dynamic scaling analysis proposed for the passive case, in order to account for our results for active systems. Finally, we discuss similarities between our results and recent findings in the context of computational models of biological tissues.</description>

      <title>Binary Mixtures of Intelligent Active Brownian Particles with Visual Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The collective properties of a binary mixture of A- and B-type self-steering particles endowed with visual perception are studied by computer simulations. Active Brownian particles are employed with an additional steering mechanism, which enables them to adjust their propulsion direction relative to the instantaneous positions of neighboring particles, depending on the species, either steering toward or away from them. Steering can be nonreciprocal between the A- and B-type particles. The underlying dynamical and structural properties of the system are governed by the strength and polarity of the maneuverabilities associated with the vision-induced steering. The model predicts the emergence of a large variety of nonequilibrium behaviors, which we systematically characterize for all nine principal sign combinations of AA, BB, AB and BA maneuverabilites. In particular, we observe the formation of multimers, encapsulated aggregates, honeycomb lattices, and predator-prey pursuit. Notably, for a predator-prey system, the maneuverability and vision angle employed by a predator significantly impacts the spatial distribution of the surrounding prey particles. For systems with electric-charge-like interactions and non-stochiometric composition, we obtain at intermediate activity levels an enhanced diffusion compared to non-steering active Brownian particles.</description>

      <title>Surface Induced Frustration of Inherent Dipolar Order in Nanoconfined Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface effects could play a dominant role in modifying the natural liquid order. In some cases, the effects of the surface interactions can propagate inwards, and even can interfere with a similar propagation from opposite surfaces. This can be particularly evident in liquid water under nano-confinement. The large dipolar cross-correlations among distinct molecules that give rise to the unusually large dielectric constant of water (and in turn owe their origin to the extended hydrogen bond (HB) network) can get perturbed by surfaces. The perturbation can propagate inwards and then interfere with the one from the opposite surface if confinement is only a few layers wide. This can give rise to short-to-intermediate range solvent-mediated interaction between two surfaces. Here we study the effects of such interactions on the dielectric constant of nano-confined liquids, not just water but also ordering at protein surfaces. The surfaces work at two levels: (i) induce orientational realignment, and (ii) alter the cross-correlations between water molecules. Molecular dynamics simulations and statistical analyses are used to address these aspects in confinement of slit pores, nano tube/cylinder, and nano sphere. In addition, we consider the hydration layers of multiple proteins with vastly different structural features. These studies give us a measure of the extent or the length scale of cross-correlations between dipole moments of water molecules. We find an interesting orientational arrangement in the protein hydration layers, giving rise to long-range molecular cross-correlations. To decouple the effect of HB from the effect of geometry, we additionally study acetonitrile under nanoconfinement. Importantly, while a protein's interior is characterized by a small dielectric constant, the dipole moment of a peptide bond is large, and thus susceptible to fluctuations in water.</description>

      <title>Detecting (emergent) continuous symmetry of criticality via subsystem's entanglement spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The (emergent) symmetry of a critical point is one of the most important information to identify the universality class and effective field theory, which is fundamental for various critical theories. However, the underlying symmetry so far can only be conjectured indirectly from the dimension of the order parameters in symmetry-breaking phases, and its correctness requires further verifications to avoid overlooking hidden order parameters, which by itself is also a difficult task. In this work, we propose an unbiased way to numerically identify the underlying (emergent) symmetry of a critical point in quantum many-body systems, without prior knowledge about its low-energy effective field theory. Through calculating the reduced density matrix in a very small subsystem of the total system numerically, the Anderson tower of states in the entanglement spectrum clearly reflects the underlying (emergent) symmetry of the criticality. It is attributed to the fact that the entanglement spectrum can observe the broken symmetry of the entanglement ground-state after cooling from the critical point along an extra temperature axis.</description>

Abstract: We describe a proposal for increasing the effective clock speed of a thermodynamic computer, by altering the interaction scale of the units within the computer and introducing to the computer an additional source of noise. The resulting thermodynamic computer program is equivalent to the original computer program, but runs at a higher clock speed. This approach offers a way of increasing the speed of thermodynamic computing while preserving the fidelity of computation.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations of driven probes reveal nonequilibrium transitions in complex fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex fluids subjected to localized microscopic energy inputs, typical of active microrheology setups, exhibit poorly understood nonequilibrium behaviors because of the intricate self-organization of their mesoscopic constituents. In this work we show how to identify changes in the microstructural conformation of the fluid by monitoring the variance of the probe position, based on a general method grounded in the breakdown of the equipartition theorem. To illustrate our method, we perform large-scale Brownian dynamics simulations of an effective model of micellar solution, and we link the different scaling regimes in the variance of the probe's position to the transitions from diffusive to jump dynamics, where the fluid intermittently relaxes the accumulated stress. This suggests stored elastic stress may be the physical mechanism behind the nonlinear friction curves recently measured in micellar solutions, pointing at a mechanism for the observed multi-step rheology. Our approach overcomes the limitations of continuum macroscopic descriptions and introduces an empirical method, applicable in experiments, to detect nonequilibrium transitions in the structure of complex fluids.</description>

Abstract: Time-integrated state observables, which quantify the fraction of time spent by the system in a specific pool of states, are important in many fields, such as chemical sensing or the theory of fluorescence spectroscopy. We derive exact identities, called Fluctuation-Response Relations (FRRs), that connect the fluctuations of such observables to their response to external perturbations in nonequilibrium steady state of Markov jump processes. Using these results, we derive novel upper and lower bounds for fluctuations. We further demonstrate their applicability for simplifying calculations of fluctuations in large Markov networks, use them to explain the physical origin of positive and negative correlations of occupation times in a double quantum dot device, and discuss their relevance for model inference.</description>

      <title>Dynamical thermalization, Rayleigh-Jeans condensate, vortexes and wave collapse in quantum chaos fibers and fluid of light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study analytically and numerically the time evolution of a nonlinear field described by the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation in a chaotic $D$-shape billiard. In absence of nonlinearity the system has standard properties of quantum chaos. This model describes a longitudinal light propagation in a multimode D-shape optical fiber and also those in a Kerr nonlinear medium of atomic vapor. We show that, above a certain chaos border of nonlinearity, chaos leads to dynamical thermalization with the Rayleigh-Jeans thermal distribution and the formation of the Rayleigh-Jeans condensate in a vicinity of the ground state accumulating in it about 80-90\% of total probability. Certain similarities of this phenomenon with the Fr\"ohlich condensate are discussed. Below the chaos border the dynamics is quasi-integrable corresponding to the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser integrability. The evolution to the thermal state is characterized by an unusual entropy time dependence with an increase on short times and later significant decrease when approaching to the steady-state. This behavior is opposite to the Boltzmann H-theorem and is attributed to the formation of Rayleigh-Jeans condensate and presence of two integrals of motion, energy and norm. At a strong focusing nonlinearity we show that the wave collapse can take place even at sufficiently high positive energy being very different from the open space case. Finally for the defocusing case we establish the superfluid regime for vortex dynamics at strong nonlinearity.
  System parameters for optical fiber experimental studies of these effects are also discussed.</description>

Abstract: Stochastic transport due to a velocity field modeled by the superposition of small-scale divergence free vector fields activated by Fractional Gaussian Noises (FGN) is numerically investigated. We present two non-trivial contributions: the first one is the definition of a model where different space-time structures can be compared on the same ground: this is achieved by imposing the same average kinetic energy to a standard Ornstein-Uhlenbeck approximation, then taking the limit to the idealized white noise structure. The second contribution, based on the previous one, is the discover that a mixing spatial structure with persistent FGN in the Fourier components induces a classical Brownian diffusion of passive particles, with suitable diffusion coefficient; namely, the memory of FGN is lost in the space complexity of the velocity field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, novel exact identities known as Fluctuation-Response Relations (FRRs) have been derived for nonequilibrium steady states of Markov jump processes. These identities link the fluctuations of state or current observables to a combination of responses of these observables to perturbations of transition rates. Here, we complement these results by deriving analogous FRRs applicable to mixed covariances of one state and one current observable. We further derive novel Inverse FRRs expressing individual state or current response in terms of a combination of covariances rather than vice versa. Using these relations, we demonstrate that the breaking of the Onsager symmetry can occur only in the presence of state-current correlations. On the practical side, we demonstrate the applicability of FRRs for simplifying calculations of fluctuations in large Markov networks, we use them to explain the behavior of fluctuations in quantum dot devices or enzymatic reaction schemes, and discuss their potential relevance for model inference.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09872v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art quantum simulators permit local temporal control of interactions and midcircuit readout. These capabilities open the way towards the exploration of intriguing nonequilibrium phenomena. We illustrate this with a kinetically constrained many-body quantum system that has a natural implementation on Rydberg quantum simulators. The evolution proceeds in discrete time and is generated by repeatedly entangling the system with an auxiliary environment that is monitored and reset after each time-step. Despite featuring an uncorrelated infinite-temperature average stationary state, the dynamics displays coexistence of fast and slow space-time regions in stochastic realizations of the system state. The time-record of measurement outcomes on the environment serves as natural probe for such dynamical heterogeneity, which we characterize using tools from large deviation theory. Our work establishes the large deviation framework for discrete-time open quantum many-body systems as a means to characterize complex dynamics and collective phenomena in quantum processors and simulators.</description>

Abstract: When a quantum phase transition is crossed within a finite time, critical slowing down disrupts adiabatic dynamics, resulting in the formation of topological defects. The average density of these defects scales with the quench rate, adhering to a universal power law as predicted by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM). In this study, we aim to investigate the counting statistics of kink density in the 1D transverse-field quantum Ising model. We demonstrate on multiple quantum processing units up to 100 qubits, that higher-order cumulants follow a universal power law scaling as a function of the quench time. We also show the breakdown of the KZM for short quenches for finite-size systems. Tensor network simulations corroborate our quantum simulation results for bigger systems not in the asymptotic limit.</description>

      <title>Multiparameter optimal control of F1-ATPase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24122</link>

Abstract: Biological molecular machines convert free energy between different forms in cells, often at high efficiency. Optimal control theory provides a framework to elucidate design principles governing energetically efficient driving. Here, we use linear-response theory to design efficient protocols exercising dynamic control of trap center and stiffness in a model of driven F1-ATPase. We find that the key design principles of an efficient protocol can be satisfied either by dynamic control of both parameters or by dynamic control of a single parameter and a good static choice for the second. These results illustrate that accessing a new degree of dynamic control provides varying performance improvements in different systems.</description>

      <title>Stress-stress correlations in two-dimensional amorphous and crystalline solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stress-stress correlations in crystalline solids with long-range order can be straightforwardly derived using elasticity theory. In contrast, the `emergent elasticity' of amorphous solids, rigid materials characterized by an underlying disordered structure, defies direct explanation within traditional theoretical frameworks. To address this challenge, tensor gauge theories have been recently proposed as a promising approach to describe the emergent elasticity of disordered solids and predict their stress-stress correlations. In this work, we revisit this problem in two-dimensional amorphous and crystalline solids by employing a canonical elasticity theory approach, supported by experimental and simulation data. We demonstrate that, with respect to static stress-stress correlations, the response of a 2D disordered solid is indistinguishable from that of a 2D isotropic crystalline solid and it is well predicted by vanilla elasticity theory. Moreover, we show that the presence of pinch-point singularities in the stress response is not an exclusive feature of amorphous solids. Our results confirm previous observations about the universal character of static stress-stress correlations in crystalline and amorphous packings.</description>
