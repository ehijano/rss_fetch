      <title>Quantum embedding for molecules using auxiliary particles -- The ghost Gutzwiller Ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong/static electronic correlation mediates the emergence of remarkable phases of matter, and underlies the exceptional reactivity properties in transition metal-based catalysts. Modeling strongly correlated molecules and solids calls for multi-reference Ans\"atze, which explicitly capture the competition of energy scales characteristic of such systems. With the efficient computational screening of correlated solids in mind, the ghost Gutzwiller (gGut) Ansatz has been recently developed. This is a variational Ansatz which can be formulated as a self-consistent embedding approach, describing the system within a non-interacting, quasiparticle model, yet providing with accurate spectra in both low and high energy regimes. Crucially, small fragments of the system are identified as responsible for the strong correlation, and are therefore enhanced by adding a set of auxiliary orbitals, the ghosts. These capture many-body correlations through one-body fluctuations and subsequent out-projection when computing physical observables. gGut has been shown to accurately describe multi-orbital lattice models at modest computational cost. In this work, we extend the gGut framework to strongly correlated molecules. To adapt the gGut Ansatz for molecular calculations, we address the fact that, unlike in the lattice model previously considered, electronic interactions in molecules are not local. Hence, we explore a hierarchy of approximations of increasing accuracy capturing interactions between fragments and environment, and within the environment, and discuss how these affect the embedding description of correlations in the whole molecule. We will compare the accuracy of the gGut model with established methods to capture strong correlation within active space formulations, and assess the realistic use of this novel approximation to the theoretical description of correlated molecular clusters.</description>

      <title>Experimental Evidence of Direct Exchange Interaction Mediating Intramolecular Singlet Fission in Weakly-Coupled Dimers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electronic interaction between an optically active singlet state ($S_1S_0$) and a dark state of singlet multiplicity, known as correlated triplet pair ($^1[TT]$), plays a crucial role in the effective transformation from $S_1S_0$ to $^1[TT]$ during intramolecular singlet fission (iSF). This process is understood through mechanisms such as direct exchange coupling and incoherent processes that involve super-exchange coupling through charge-transfer states. However, most insights into these mechanisms are derived from theoretical studies due to the difficulties in obtaining experimental evidence. In this study, we investigate the excited-state interactions between $S_1S_0$ and $^1[TT]$ in spiro-conjugated iSF sensitizers by employing transient two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy. This approach allows us to focus on the early stages of the conversion from $S_1S_0$ to $^1[TT]$. Upon optical excitation, a superposition of $S_1S_0$ and $^1[TT]$ is created, which gradually transitions to favor $^1[TT]$ within the characteristic time frames of iSF. The observed high-order signals indicate circular repopulation dynamic that effectively reinitiates the iSF process from higher energy electronic states. Our findings, supported by semi-quantum-mechanical simulations of the experimental data, suggest the presence of a direct iSF mechanism in the dimers, facilitated by weak non-adiabatic coupling between $S_1S_0$ and $^1[TT]$. This experiment provides new insights into the equilibrium between the two electronic states, a phenomenon previously understood primarily through theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Quantum tomography of molecules using ultrafast electron diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a quantum tomography (QT) approach to retrieve the temporally evolving reduced density matrix in elecotronic state basis, where the populations and coherence between ground state and excited state are reconstructed from the ultrafast electron diffraction signal. In order to showcase the capability of the proposed QT approach, we simulate the nuclear wavepacket dynamics and ultrafast electron diffraction of photoexcited pyrrole molecules using ab initio quantum chemical CASSCF method. From simulated time-resolved diffraction data, we retrieve the evolving density matrix in a crude diabatic representation basis and reveal the symmetry of the excited pyrrole wavepacket. Our QT approach opens the route to make quantum version of "molecular movie" that covers the electronic degree of freedom, and equips ultrafast electron diffraction with the power to reveal the coherence between electronic states, relaxation and dynamics of population transfer.</description>

      <title>Multi-reference coupled cluster theory using the normal ordered exponential ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Properly spin-adapted coupled-cluster theory for general open-shell configurations remains an elusive goal in electronic structure theory. In this contribution we examine Lindgren's normal-ordered exponential ansatz using spin-free excitation operators, with the aid of automatic equation generation software. We present a size-extensive reformulation of the unlinked working equations, and analyse the performance of the method with single and double excitations for simple molecular systems in terms of accuracy and size consistency.</description>

      <title>Modelling Triatomic Biosignatures: Ozone and Isotopomers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we present a new approach to produce spectroscopic constants and model first-principles synthetic spectra for all molecules of astrophysical interest. We have generalized our previous diatomic molecule simulation framework, employing Transition-Optimised Shifted Hermite (TOSH) theory, thereby enabling the modelling of polyatomic rotational constants for molecules with three or more atoms. These capabilities, are now provided by our new code Epimetheus.
  As a first validation of our approach, we confront our predictions and assess their accuracy against the well-studied triatomic molecule, ozone 666 ($^{16}$O$_3$), in addition to eight of its potential isotopomers: ozone 668 ($^{16}$O$^{16}$O$^{18}$O), 686 ($^{16}$O$^{18}$O$^{16}$O), 667 ($^{16}$O$^{16}$O$^{17}$O), 676 ($^{16}$O$^{17}$O$^{16}$O), 688 ($^{16}$O$^{18}$O$^{18}$O), 868 ($^{18}$O$^{16}$O$^{18}$O), 888 ($^{18}$O$_3$), and 777 ($^{17}$O$_3$). We then assess the accuracy of these rotational constants using the Epimetheus data in our code Pandora, and generate synthetic molecular spectra.
  The ozone spectra presented here are purely infrared and not Raman. Epimetheus builds upon the work from our previous code Prometheus, which used the TOSH theory to account for anharmonicity for the fundamental $\nu=0 \rightarrow \nu=1$ band, going further to now account for triatomic molecules. This is combined with thermal profile modeling for the rotational transitions. We have found that this extended method performs promisingly, typically approximating the spectroscopic constants and spectra well. Some issues do arise depending on the symmetry group of the ozone isotopomer. In general, we show that Epimetheus can provide the data to produce appreciable molecular spectra, to help drive future high-resolution studies.</description>

      <title>Electric field of DNA in solution: who is in charge?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In solution, DNA is a highly charged macromolecule which bears a unit of negative charge on each phosphate of its sugar-phosphate backbone. Although partially compensated by counterions adsorbed at or condensed near it, DNA still produces a substantial electric field in its vicinity, which is screened by buffer electrolyte at longer distances from the DNA. Such field has been explored so far predominantly within the scope of a primitive model of the electrolytic solution, not considering more complicated structural effects of the water solvent. In this paper we investigate the distribution of electric field around DNA using linear response nonlocal electrostatic theory, applied here for helix-specific charge distributions, and compare the predictions of such theory with specially performed fully atomistic large scale molecular dynamics simulations. The main finding of this study is that oscillations in the electrostatic potential distribution are present around DNA, caused by the overscreening effect of structured water. Surprisingly, electrolyte ions at physiological concentrations do not strongly disrupt these oscillations, and rather distribute according to these oscillating patterns, indicating that water structural effects dominate the short-range electrostatics. We also show that (i) structured water adsorbed in the grooves of DNA lead to a positive electrostatic potential core, (ii) the Debye length some 10 {\AA} away from the DNA is reduced, effectively renormalised by the helical pitch of the DNA, and (iii) Lorentzian contributions to the nonlocal dielectric function of water, effectively reducing the dielectric constant close to the DNA, enhances the overall electric field. The impressive agreement between the atomistic simulations and the developed theory substantiates the use of nonlocal electrostatics when considering solvent effects in molecular processes in biology.</description>

      <title>On Representing Electronic Wave Functions with Sign Equivariant Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent neural networks demonstrated impressively accurate approximations of electronic ground-state wave functions. Such neural networks typically consist of a permutation-equivariant neural network followed by a permutation-antisymmetric operation to enforce the electronic exchange symmetry. While accurate, such neural networks are computationally expensive. In this work, we explore the flipped approach, where we first compute antisymmetric quantities based on the electronic coordinates and then apply sign equivariant neural networks to preserve the antisymmetry. While this approach promises acceleration thanks to the lower-dimensional representation, we demonstrate that it reduces to a Jastrow factor, a commonly used permutation-invariant multiplicative factor in the wave function. Our empirical results support this further, finding little to no improvements over baselines. We conclude with neither theoretical nor empirical advantages of sign equivariant functions for representing electronic wave functions within the evaluation of this work.</description>

      <title>The Michaelis--Menten reaction at low substrate concentrations: Pseudo-first-order kinetics and conditions for timescale separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the Michaelis-Menten reaction mechanism can be accurately approximated by a linear system when the initial substrate concentration is low. This leads to pseudo-first-order kinetics, simplifying mathematical calculations and experimental analysis. Our proof utilizes a monotonicity property of the system and Kamke's comparison theorem. This linear approximation yields a closed-form solution, enabling accurate modeling and estimation of reaction rate constants even without timescale separation. Building on prior work, we establish that the sufficient condition for the validity of this approximation is $s_0 \ll K$, where $K=k_2/k_1$ is the Van Slyke-Cullen constant. This condition is independent of the initial enzyme concentration. Further, we investigate timescale separation within the linear system, identifying necessary and sufficient conditions and deriving the corresponding reduced one-dimensional equations.</description>

      <title>State-Specific Coupled-Cluster Methods for Excited States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reexamine $\Delta$CCSD, a state-specific coupled-cluster (CC) with single and double excitations (CCSD) approach that targets excited states through the utilization of non-Aufbau determinants. This methodology is particularly efficient when dealing with doubly excited states, a domain where the standard equation-of-motion CCSD (EOM-CCSD) formalism falls short. Our goal here is to evaluate the effectiveness of $\Delta$CCSD when applied to other types of excited states, comparing its consistency and accuracy with EOM-CCSD. To this end, we report a benchmark on excitation energies computed with the $\Delta$CCSD and EOM-CCSD methods, for a set of molecular excited-state energies that encompasses not only doubly excited states but also doublet-doublet transitions and (singlet and triplet) singly-excited states of closed-shell systems. In the latter case, we rely on a minimalist version of multireference CC known as the two-determinant CCSD method to compute the excited states. Our dataset, consisting of 276 excited states stemming from the \textsc{quest} database [V\'eril \textit{et al.}, \textit{WIREs Comput. Mol. Sci.} \textbf{2021}, 11, e1517], provides a significant base to draw general conclusions concerning the accuracy of $\Delta$CCSD. Except for the doubly-excited states, we found that $\Delta$CCSD underperforms EOM-CCSD. For doublet-doublet transitions, the difference between the mean absolute errors (MAEs) of the two methodologies (of \SI{0.10}{\eV} and \SI{0.07}{\eV}) is less pronounced than that obtained for singly-excited states of closed-shell systems (MAEs of \SI{0.15}{\eV} and \SI{0.08}{\eV}). This discrepancy is largely attributed to a greater number of excited states in the latter set exhibiting multiconfigurational characters, which are more challenging for $\Delta$CCSD.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The photoexcitation dynamics of molecular materials on the 10-100 nm length scale depend on complex interactions between the electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom, rendering exact calculations difficult or intractable. The adaptive Hierarchy of Pure States (adHOPS) is a formally exact method that leverages the locality imposed by interactions between thermal environments and electronic excitations to achieve size-invariant scaling calculations for single-excitation processes in systems described by a Frenkel-Holstein Hamiltonian. Here, we extend adHOPS to account for arbitrary couplings between the thermal environments and vertical excitation energies, enabling formally exact, size-invariant calculations that involve multiple excitations or states with shared thermal environments. In addition, we introduce a low-temperature correction and effective integration of the noise to reduce the computational expense of including ultrafast vibrational relaxation in HOPS simulations. We present these advances in the latest version of the open-source MesoHOPS library and use MesoHOPS to characterize charge separation at a one-dimensional organic heterojunction when both the electron and hole are mobile.</description>

      <title>Prediction challenge: First principles simulation of the ultrafast electron diffraction spectrum of cyclobutanone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computer simulation has long been an essential partner of ultrafast experiments, allowing the assignment of microscopic mechanistic detail to low-dimensional spectroscopic data. However, the ability of theory to make a priori predictions of ultrafast experimental results is relatively untested. Herein, as a part of a community challenge, we attempt to predict the signal of an upcoming ultrafast photochemical experiment using state-of-the-art theory in the context of preexisting experimental data. Specifically, we employ ab initio Ehrenfest with collapse to a block (TAB) mixed quantum-classic simulations to describe the real-time evolution of the electrons and nuclei of cyclobutanone following excitation to the 3s Rydberg state. The gas-phase ultrafast electron diffraction (GUED) signal is simulated for direct comparison to an upcoming experiment at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Laboratory. Following initial ring-opening, dissociation via two distinct channels is observed: the C3 dissociation channel, producing cyclopropane and CO, and the C2 channel, producing CH$_2$CO and C$_2$H$_4$. Direct calculations of the GUED signal indicate how the ring-opened intermediate, the C2 products, and the C3 products can be discriminated in the GUED signal. We also report an a priori analysis of anticipated errors in our predictions: without knowledge of the experimental result, which features of the spectrum do we feel confident we have predicted correctly, and which might we have wrong?</description>

Abstract: Double-core-hole (DCH) states in isolated water and heavy water molecules, resulting from the sequential absorption of two x-ray photons, have been investigated. A comparison of the subsequent Auger emission spectra from the two isotopes provides direct evidence of ultrafast nuclear motion during the 1.5 fs lifetime of these DCH states. Our numerical results align well with the experimental data, providing for various DCH states an in-depth study of the dynamics responsible of the observed isotope effect.</description>

      <title>Coupled cluster theory for nonadiabatic dynamics: nuclear gradients and nonadiabatic couplings in similarity constrained coupled cluster theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coupled cluster theory is one of the most accurate electronic structure methods for predicting ground and excited state chemistry. However, the presence of numerical artifacts at electronic degeneracies, such as complex energies, has made it difficult to apply it in nonadiabatic dynamics simulations. While it has already been shown that such numerical artifacts can be fully removed by using similarity constrained coupled cluster (SCC) theory [J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2017, 8, 19, 4801-4807], simulating dynamics requires efficient implementations of gradients and nonadiabatic couplings. Here, we present an implementation of nuclear gradients and nonadiabatic derivative couplings at the similarity constrained coupled cluster singles and doubles (SCCSD) level of theory. We present a few numerical examples that show good agreement with literature values and discuss some limitations of the method. In a separate paper, we show that this implementation can be used in nonadiabatic dynamics, thereby establishing coupled cluster theory as a viable electronic structure method for simulating excited state photochemistry.</description>

      <title>Unexpected hydrogen dissociation in thymine: predictions from a novel coupled cluster theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fate of thymine upon excitation by ultraviolet radiation has been the subject of intense debate over the past three decades. Today, it is widely believed that its ultrafast excited state decay stems from a radiationless transition from the bright ${\pi}{\pi}^*$ state to a dark $n{\pi}^*$ state. However, conflicting theoretical predictions have made the experimental data difficult to interpret. Here we simulate the ultrafast dynamics in thymine at the highest level of theory to date, performing wavepacket dynamics with a new coupled cluster method. Our simulation confirms an ultrafast ${\pi}{\pi}^*$ to $n{\pi}^*$ transition (${\tau} = 41 \pm 14$ fs). Furthermore, the predicted oxygen-edge X-ray absorption spectra agree quantitatively with the experimental results. Our simulation also predicts an as-yet uncharacterized photochemical pathway: a ${\pi}{\sigma}^*$ channel that leads to hydrogen dissociation at one of the two N-H bonds in thymine. Similar behavior has been identified in other heteroaromatic compounds, including adenine, and several authors have speculated that a similar pathway may exist in thymine. However, this was never confirmed theoretically or experimentally. This prediction calls for renewed efforts to experimentally identify or exclude the presence of this channel.</description>

      <title>Continuous Gated First-Passage Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09164</link>

Abstract: Gated first-passage processes, where completion depends on both hitting a target and satisfying additional constraints, are prevalent across various fields. Despite their significance, analytical solutions to basic problems remain unknown, e.g. the detection time of a diffusing particle by a gated interval, disk, or sphere. In this paper, we elucidate the challenges posed by continuous gated first-passage processes and present a renewal framework to overcome them. This framework offers a unified approach for a wide range of problems, including those with single-point, half-line, and interval targets. The latter have so far evaded exact solutions. Our analysis reveals that solutions to gated problems can be obtained directly from the ungated dynamics. This, in turn, reveals universal properties and asymptotic behaviors, shedding light on cryptic intermediate-time regimes and refining the notion of high-crypticity for continuous-space gated processes. Moreover, we extend our formalism to higher dimensions, showcasing its versatility and applicability. Overall, this work provides valuable insights into the dynamics of continuous gated first-passage processes and offers analytical tools for studying them across diverse domains.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal Structural Effects of Water on DNA Homology Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03213v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mechanism behind mutual recognition of homologous DNA sequences prior to genetic recombination is one of the remaining puzzles in molecular biology. Leading models of homology recognition, based on classical electrostatics, neglect the short-range nonlocal screening effects arising from structured water around DNA, and hence may only provide insight for relatively large separations between interacting DNAs. We elucidate the role of the effects of the nonlocal dielectric response of water on DNA-DNA interaction and show that these can dramatically enhance the driving force for recognition.</description>

      <title>Automated chemical reaction network generation and its application to exoplanet atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the advent of JWST and spectroscopic characterization of exoplanet atmospheres with unprecedented detail, there is a demand for a more complete picture of chemical and photochemical reactions and their impact on atmospheric composition. Traditionally, building reaction networks for (exo)planetary atmospheres involves manually tracking relevant species and reactions, a time-consuming and error-prone process. This approach's applicability is also often limited to specific conditions, making it less versatile for different planetary types. (i.e., photochemical networks for Jupiters may not be directly applicable to water-rich exoplanets). We introduce an automated approach using a computer-aided chemical reaction network generator, combined with a one-dimensional photochemical kinetic-transport model, offering significant advantages. This approach automatically selects reaction rates through a rate-based iterative algorithm and refinement steps, enhancing model reliability. Also, this approach allows for the efficient simulation of diverse chemical environments, from hydrogen to water, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen-dominated atmospheres. Using WASP-39b and WASP-80b as examples, we demonstrate our approach's effectiveness. Our WASP-39b model aligns with prior studies and JWST observations, capturing photochemically produced sulfur dioxide. The WASP-80b model reveals an atmosphere influenced by deep interior thermochemistry and vertical mixing, consistent with JWST NIRCam observations. Furthermore, our model identifies a novel initial step for the N2-NH3-HCN pathway that enhances the conversion efficiency in high-temperature/pressure environments. This automated chemical network generation offers a novel, efficient, and precise framework for studying exoplanetary atmospheres, marking a significant advancement over traditional modeling techniques.</description>

      <title>Approaching Periodic Systems in Ensemble Density Functional Theory via Finite One-Dimensional Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ensemble Density Functional Theory (EDFT) is a generalization of ground-state Density Functional Theory (GS DFT), which is based on an exact formal theory of finite collections of a system's ground and excited states. EDFT in various forms has been shown to improve the accuracy of calculated energy level differences in isolated model systems, atoms, and molecules, but it is not yet clear how EDFT could be used to calculate band gaps for periodic systems. We extend the application of EDFT toward periodic systems by estimating the thermodynamic limit with increasingly large finite one-dimensional ``particle in a box'' systems, which approach the uniform electron gas (UEG). Using ensemble-generalized Hartree and Local Spin Density Approximation (LSDA) exchange-correlation functionals, we find that corrections go to zero in the infinite limit, as expected for a metallic system. However, there is a correction to the effective mass, with results from tri-ensembles similar to literature on 2D and 3D UEGs, indicating promise for non-trivial results from EDFT on periodic systems. Singlet excitation energies are found to be positive, but triplet excitation energies are sometimes negative (a triplet instability), pointing to deficiencies of the approximations.</description>

      <title>Understanding Energy Level Structure Using Quantum Rubik's Cube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study combines the quantum Rubik's Cube matrix with the Benalcazar Bernevig Hughes model, defines a matrix algorithm based on the reverse process of convolution, and constructs an expression for the quantum Rubik's Cube matrix and Hamiltonian. Furthermore, in order to make the operation of the quantum Rubik's Cube matrix clearer, we use a Josephus ring to draw a topological graph of the Rubik's Cube expansion. This article uses a quantum Rubik's Cube to calculate energy level transitions of electrons, and shows that its operation corresponds to path integration. The band dispersion is obtained. This work provides new ideas and methods for calculating Hamiltonians and studying energy level structure.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium Green's function approach to low-energy fission dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concept of a compound nucleus was proposed by Bohr in 1936 to explain narrow resonances in neutron scattering off a nucleus. While a compound nucleus has been understood in terms of statistical mechanics, its description based on a many-body Hamiltonian has yet to be developed. Here we present a microscopic modeling of a compound nucleus starting from a nucleonic degree of freedom. We focus in particular on a decay of a heavy compound nucleus, that is, fission and radiative capture. To this end, we develop an approach based on a non-equilibrium Green's function, which is combined with a configuration interaction (CI) approach based on a constrained density-functional theory (DFT). We apply this approach to a barrier-top fission of $^{236}$U, restricting the model space to seniority zero configurations of neutrons and protons. Our calculation with a Skyrme energy functional yields the fission-to-capture branching ratio of around 0.07. While this value is still reasonable, the calculation underestimates the branching ratio by about a factor of 40 as compared to the empirical value, indicating a necessity of seniority non-zero configurations in the model space. We also find that the distribution of the fission probability approximately follows the chi-squared distribution with the number of degrees of freedom of the order of 1, which is consistent with the experimental finding.</description>
