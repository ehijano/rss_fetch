      <title>Design and Simulation of a III-Nitride Light Emitting Transistor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes the design and characteristics of monolithically integrated three-terminal gated III-Nitride light emitting diodes (LEDs) devices. The impact of channel doping and thickness on the voltage penalty of the transistor-LED hybrid device is analyzed, and it is shown that with appropriate design, low voltage drop can be realized across integrated gated LED structures. The impact of device design on the switching charge is investigated, and it is shown that the adoption of an integrated LED/transistor structure can reduce the switching charge necessary for operation of a switched LED display device by an order of magnitude when compared with stand-alone light-emitting diodes.</description>

      <title>Entropy Engineered Middle-In Synthesis of Dual Single-Atom Compounds for Nitrate Reduction Reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the immense potential of Dual Single-Atom Compounds (DSACs), the challenges in their synthesis process, including complexity, stability, purity, and scalability, remain primary concerns in current research. Here, we present a general strategy, termed "Entropy-Engineered Middle-In Synthesis of Dual Single-Atom Compounds" (EEMIS-DSAC), which is meticulously crafted to produce a diverse range of DSACs, effectively addressing the aforementioned issues. Our strategy integrates the advantages of both bottom-up and top-down paradigms, proposing a new insight to optimize the catalyst structure. The as-fabricated DSACs exhibited excellent activity and stability in the nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR). In a significant advancement, our prototypical CuNi DSACs demonstrated outstanding performance under conditions reminiscent of industrial wastewater. Specifically, under a NO3- concentration of 2000 ppm, it yielded a Faradaic efficiency (FE) for NH3 of 96.97 %, coupled with a mass productivity of 131.47 mg h-1 mg-1 and an area productivity of 10.06 mg h-1 cm-2. Impressively, even under a heightened NO3- concentration of 0.5 M, the FE for NH3 peaked at 90.61 %, with mass productivity reaching 1024.50 mg h-1 mg-1 and an area productivity of 78.41 mg h-1 cm-2. This work underpins the potential of the EEMIS-DSAC approach, signaling a promising frontier for high-performing DSACs.</description>

      <title>Tunnel Junction-Enabled Monolithically Integrated GaN Micro-Light Emitting Transistor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GaN/InGaN microLEDs are a very promising technology for next generation displays. Switching control transistors and their integration are key components in achieving high-performance, efficient displays. Monolithic integration of microLEDs with GaN switching devices provides an opportunity to control microLED output power with capacitive (voltage) control rather than current controlled schemes. This approach can greatly reduce system complexity for the driver circuit arrays while maintaining device opto-electronic performance. In this work, we demonstrate a 3-terminal GaN micro-light emitting transistor that combines a GaN/InGaN blue tunneling-based microLED with a GaN n-channel FET. The integrated device exhibits excellent gate control, drain current control and optical emission control. This work provides a promising pathway for future monolithic integration of GaN FETs with microLED to enable fast switching high efficiency microLED display and communication systems.</description>

      <title>Zincophilic armor: Phytate ammonium as a multifunctional additive for enhanced performance in aqueous zinc-ion batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Corrosion and the formation of by-products resulting from parasitic side reactions, as well as random dendrite growth, pose significant challenges for aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs). In this study, phytate ammonium is introduced into the traditional dilute Zinc sulfate electrolyte as a multi-functional additive. Leveraging the inherent zincophilic nature of the phytic anion, a protective layer is formed on the surface of the zinc anode. This layer can effectively manipulate the deposition process, mitigate parasitic reactions, and reduce the accumulation of detrimental by-products. Additionally, the competitive deposition between dissociated ammonium ions and Zn2+ promotes uniform deposition, thereby alleviating dendrite growth. Consequently, the modified electrolyte with a lower volume addition exhibits superior performance. The zinc symmetric battery demonstrates much more reversible plating/stripping, sustaining over 2000 hours at 5 mA cm-2 and 1 mA h cm-2. A high average deposition/stripping efficiency of 99.83% is achieved, indicating the significant boosting effect and practical potential of our strategy for high-performance aqueous zinc-ion batteries.</description>

      <title>NAND-like SOT-MRAM-based Approximate Storage for Error-Tolerant Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate approximate storage based on NAND-like spin-orbit torque (SOT) MRAM, through "device-modeling-architecture" explorations. We experimentally achieve down to 1E-5 level selectivity. Selectivity and low-power solutions are established by numerical calculation workflow. System-level power consumption is evaluated in the 512 KB last-level cache according to 5 quality levels. Error-tolerant applications, such as image processing, alleviate the demand for selectivity down to the 5E-2 level, leading to 54% ~ 61% energy-saving. Our proposal paves the novel and suitable path for high-density and low-power NAND-like SOT-MRAM.</description>

      <title>Negative Photo Conductivity Triggered with Visible Light in Wide Bandgap Oxide-Based Optoelectronic Crossbar Memristive Array for Photograph Sensing and Neuromorphic Computing Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoresponsivity studies of wide-bandgap oxide-based devices have emerged as a vibrant and popular research area. Researchers have explored various material systems in their quest to develop devices capable of responding to illumination. In this study, we engineered a mature wide bandgap oxide-based bilayer heterostructure synaptic memristor to emulate the human brain for applications in neuromorphic computing and photograph sensing. The device exhibits advanced electric and electro-photonic synaptic functions, such as long-term potentiation (LTP), long-term depression (LTD), and paired pulse facilitation (PPF), by applying successive electric and photonic pulses. Moreover, the device exhibits exceptional electrical SET and photonic RESET endurance, maintaining its stability for a minimum of 1200 cycles without any degradation. Density functional theory calculations of the band structures provide insights into the conduction mechanism of the device. Based on this memristor array, we developed an autoencoder and convolutional neural network for noise reduction and image recognition tasks, which achieves a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 562 and high accuracy of 84.23%, while consuming lower energy by four orders of magnitude compared with the Tesla P40 GPU. This groundbreaking research not only opens doors for the integration of our device into image processing but also represents a significant advancement in the realm of in-memory computing and photograph sensing features in a single cell.</description>

      <title>Modelling magnetically-levitated superconducting ellipsoids, cylinders and cuboids for quantum magnetomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the properties of magnetically-levitated superconducting rotors confined in anti-Helmholtz traps, for application in magnetomechanical experiments. We study both the translational modes and a librational mode. The librational mode gives an additional degree of freedom that levitated spheres do not have access to. We compare rotors of different shapes: ellipsoids, cylinders and cuboids. We find that the stable orientations of the rotors depend on the rotors' aspect ratios.</description>

      <title>Suppressing Modulation Instability with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modulation instability is a phenomenon of spontaneous pattern formation in nonlinear media, oftentimes leading to an unpredictable behaviour and a degradation of a signal of interest. We propose an approach based on reinforcement learning to suppress the unstable modes by optimizing the parameters for the time modulation of the potential in the nonlinear system. We test our approach in 1D and 2D cases and propose a new class of physically-meaningful reward functions to guarantee tamed instability.</description>

      <title>Self-referencing photothermal common-path interferometry to measure absorption of Si3N4 membranes for laser-light sails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laser-light sails are a spacecraft concept wherein lightweight "sails" are propelled to high speeds by lasers with high intensities. The sails must comprise materials with low optical loss, to minimize the risk of laser damage. Stoichiometric silicon nitride (Si$_3$N$_4$) is a candidate material with low loss in the near infrared, but the precise absorption coefficient has not been characterized in the membrane form-factor needed for sails. We use photothermal common-path interferometry (PCI), a sensitive pump-probe technique, to measure the absorption coefficient of stoichiometric and nonstoichiometric silicon nitride. To calibrate PCI measurements of membranes, we developed a self-referencing technique where a measurement is performed twice: once on a bare membrane, and a second time with a monolayer of graphene deposited on the membrane. The absorption of the sample with graphene can be measured by both PCI and more-conventional spectroscopic techniques, enabling the calibration of the PCI measurement. We find that with an absorption coefficient of (2.09 $\pm$ 0.76) $\times$ 10$^{-2}$ cm$^{-1}$ at 1064 nm, Si$_3$N$_4$ is a suitable laser-sail material for laser intensities as high as ~10 GW/m$^{2}$, which have been proposed for some laser-sail missions, while silicon-rich SiN$_x$ (x~1), with an absorption coefficient of 7.94 $\pm$ 0.50 cm$^{-1}$, is unlikely to survive such high laser intensities.</description>

      <title>Formation and Microwave Losses of Hydrides in Superconducting Niobium Thin Films Resulting from Fluoride Chemical Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting Nb thin films have recently attracted significant attention due to their utility for quantum information technologies. In the processing of Nb thin films, fluoride-based chemical etchants are commonly used to remove surface oxides that are known to affect superconducting quantum devices adversely. However, these same etchants can also introduce hydrogen to form Nb hydrides, potentially negatively impacting microwave loss performance. Here, we present comprehensive materials characterization of Nb hydrides formed in Nb thin films as a function of fluoride chemical treatments. In particular, secondary-ion mass spectrometry, X-ray scattering, and transmission electron microscopy reveal the spatial distribution and phase transformation of Nb hydrides. The rate of hydride formation is determined by the fluoride solution acidity and the etch rate of Nb2O5, which acts as a diffusion barrier for hydrogen into Nb. The resulting Nb hydrides are detrimental to Nb superconducting properties and lead to increased power-independent microwave loss in coplanar waveguide resonators. However, Nb hydrides do not correlate with two-level system loss or device aging mechanisms. Overall, this work provides insight into the formation of Nb hydrides and their role in microwave loss, thus guiding ongoing efforts to maximize coherence time in superconducting quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Exact and Approximate Solutions for Magnetohydrodynamic Flow Control in Hele-Shaw Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider the motion of a thin layer of electrically conducting fluid, between two closely spaced parallel plates, in a classical Hele-Shaw geometry. Furthermore, let the system be immersed in a uniform external magnetic field (normal to the plates) and let electrical current be driven between conducting probes immersed in the fluid layer. In the present paper, we analyse the ensuing fluid flow at low Hartmann numbers. We first elucidate the mechanism of flow generation both physically and mathematically. We proceed by presenting mathematical solutions for a class of canonical multiply-connected geometries, in terms of the prime function developed by Crowdy (2020). Notably, those solutions can be written explicitly as series, and are thus exact, in doubly-connected geometries. Note that in higher connectivities, the prime function must be evaluated numerically. We then demonstrate how recently developed fast numerical methods may be applied to accurately determine the flow-field in arbitrary geometries when exact solutions are inaccessible.</description>

      <title>Photonic time crystals: Theory and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This tutorial offers a comprehensive overview of photonic time crystals - artificial materials whose electromagnetic properties are periodically modulated in time at scales comparable to the oscillation period of light while remaining spatially uniform. Being the temporal analogs to traditional photonic crystals, photonic time crystals differ in that they exhibit momentum bandgaps instead of energy bandgaps. The energy is not conserved within momentum bandgaps, and eigenmodes with exponentially growing amplitudes exist in the momentum bandgap. Such properties make photonic time crystals a fascinating novel class of artificial materials from a basic science and applied perspective. This tutorial overviews the fundamental electromagnetic equations governing photonic time crystals and explores the groundbreaking physical phenomena they support. Based on these properties, we also oversee a diverse range of applications they unlock. Different material platforms suitable for creating photonic time crystals are discussed and compared. Furthermore, we elaborate on the connections between wave amplification in photonic time crystals and parametric amplification mechanisms in electrical circuits and nonlinear optics. The tutorial will be helpful for readers with physics or engineering backgrounds. It is designed to serve as an introductory guide for beginners and to establish a reference baseline reflecting the current understanding for researchers in the field.</description>

      <title>Quantum and thermal noise in coupled non-Hermitian waveguide systems with different models of gain and loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian (NH) photonic systems leverage gain and loss to open new directions for nanophotonic technologies. However, the quantum and thermal noise intrinsically associated with gain/loss affects the eigenvalue/eigenvector structure of NH systems, as well as its practical noise performance. Here, we present a comparative analysis of the impact of different gain and loss mechanisms on the noise generated in gain-loss compensated NH waveguide systems. Our results highlight important differences in the eigenvalue/eigenvector structure, noise power, photon statistics and squeezing. At the same time, we identify some universal properties such as gain-loss compensation, broken to unbroken phase transitions, coalesce of pairs of eigenvectors, and linear scaling of the noise with the length of the waveguide. We believe that these results provide a more global understanding on the impact of the gain/loss mechanism on the noise generated in NH systems.</description>

      <title>Portable diamond maser with reduced magnetic field through orientation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Masers have the potential to transform medical sensing and boost qubit readout detection due to their superb low-noise amplification. The negatively-charged nitrogen vacancy (NV-) diamond maser is the only continuous-wave solid-state maser discovered at room temperature, however it suffers from requiring large and bulky magnets which prevent its more widespread use. We present a significant reduction in size of the entire diamond maser using a much lighter and small-footprint electromagnet, reducing the weight from an immovable 2000 kilograms to a portable 30 kilograms. We achieve a maximum maser output power near -80 dBm, ten times higher than the first implementation, and have discovered techniques to reduce the magnetic field strength required for masing by precise manipulation of the spin orientation. With the diamond maser now shrunk to a size that can fit on a lab benchtop, we have brought continuous-wave room temperature masers away from the confines of research laboratories and closer to transforming readouts in quantum computing, frequency standards and quantum-limited medical sensing.</description>

      <title>Morphological stability of electrostrictive thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A large electric field is typically present in anodic or passive oxide films. Stresses induced by such a large electric field are critical in understanding the breakdown mechanism of thin oxide films and improving their corrosion resistance. In this work, we consider electromechanical coupling through the electrostrictive effect. A continuum model incorporating lattice misfit and electric field-induced stresses is developed. We perform a linear stability analysis of the full coupled model and show that, for typical oxides, neglecting electrostriction underestimates the film's instability, especially in systems with a large electric field. Moreover, a region where electrostriction can potentially provide a stabilizing effect is identified, allowing electrostriction to enhance corrosion resistance. We identified an equilibrium electric field intrinsic to the system and the corresponding equilibrium film thickness. The film's stability is very sensitive to the electric field: a 40 percent deviation from the equilibrium electric field can change the maximum growth rate by nearly an order of magnitude. Moreover, our model reduces to classical morphological instability models in the limit of misfit-only, electrostatic-only, and no-electrostriction cases. Finally, the effect of various parameters on the film's stability is studied.</description>

      <title>Significant Photoluminescence Improvements from Bulk Germanium-Based Thin Films with Ultra-low Threading Dislocation Densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bulk Ge crystals, characterized by significantly lower threading dislocation densities (TDD) than their epitaxial counterparts, emerge as optimal candidates for studying and improving Ge laser performance. Our study focused on the Ge thickness and TDD impacts on Ge's photoluminescence (PL). The PL peak intensity of a bulk Ge sample (TDD = 6000 cm^(-2), n-doping = 10^16 cm^(-3)) experiences a remarkable 32-fold increase as the thickness is reduced from 535 to 2 micron. This surpasses the PL peak intensity of a 0.75 micron thick epi-Ge on Si (biaxial tensile strain= 0.2 %, n-doping = 10^19 cm^(-3)) by a factor of 2.5. Furthermore, the PL peak intensity of a 405 micron thick zero-TDD bulk Ge sample (n-doping = 5 * 10^17 cm^(-3)) is ten times that of the 0.75 micron thick epi-Ge, rising to twelve times when thinned to 1 micron. The TDD reduction method is highly effective, which relaxes the requirements of high n-doping and stress in enhancing Ge laser performance and thus reduces the side effects of high optical absorption, high non-radiative recombination, bandgap narrowing, and large footprints associated with these two techniques.</description>

      <title>Comparison studies between BHBT2:PC71BM composite nanotubes and its bulk-heterojunction properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08698</link>
      <description>arXiv:1910.08698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the morphological, structural, and optical properties of both bulk-heterojunction and composite nanotubes that composed of thiophene-based small molecules BHBT2 and fullerene PC71BM. Mix-blended and template-assisted methods were used to fabricate the bulk-heterojunction and composite nanotubes, respectively. A single material of BHBT2 thin films and nanotubes that fabricated via spin-coating and template-assisted methods, respectively, was also studied. Two different formations between bulk-heterojunction and composite nanotubes were compared to elaborate their advancement in properties. Absorption spectra of BHBT2:PC71BM bulk-heterojunction and composite nanotubes have fallen within the ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) range. Field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) images show that the carbon-rich of PC71BM, has successfully infiltrated into the BHBT2 nanotube to form the BHBT2:PC71BM composite nanotubes. However, due to the informality distribution of infiltration, charge carrier transfer is seen to be better in bulk-heterojunction rather than in the composite nanotubes.</description>

      <title>Analytical Modeling of Acoustic Exponential Materials and Physical Mechanism of Broadband Anti-Reflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03538v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatially exponential distributions of material properties are ubiquitous in many natural and engineered systems, from the vertical distribution of the atmosphere to acoustic horns and anti-reflective coatings. These media seamlessly interface different impedances, enhancing wave transmission and reducing internal reflections. This work advances traditional transfer matrix theory by integrating analytical solutions for acoustic exponential materials, which possess exponential density and/or bulk modulus, offering a more accurate predictive tool and revealing the physical mechanism of broadband anti-reflection for sound propagation in such non-uniform materials. Leveraging this method, we designed an acoustic dipole array that effectively mimics exponential mass distribution. Through experiments with precisely engineered micro-perforated plates, we demonstrate an ultra-low reflection rate of about 0.86% across a wide frequency range from 420 Hz to 10,000 Hz. Our modified transfer matrix approach underpins the design of exponential materials, and our layering strategy for stacking acoustic dipoles suggests a pathway to more functional gradient acoustic metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Solving partial differential equations with waveguide-based metatronic networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photonic computing has recently become an interesting paradigm for high-speed calculation of computing processes using light-matter interactions. Here, we propose and study an electromagnetic wave-based structure with the ability to calculate the solution of partial differential equations in the form of the Helmholtz wave equation. To do this, we make use of a network of interconnected waveguides filled with dielectric inserts. In so doing, it is shown how the proposed network can mimic the response of a network of T-circuit elements formed by two series and a parallel impedance, i.e., the waveguide network effectively behaves as a metatronic network. An in-depth theoretical analysis of the proposed metatronic structure is presented showing how the governing equation for the currents and impedances of the metatronic network resembles that of the finite difference representation of the Helmholtz wave equation. Different studies are then discussed including the solution of partial differential equations for Dirichlet and open boundary value problems, demonstrating how the proposed metatronic-based structure has the ability to calculate their solutions.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Localization and Recognition of Subwavelength Non-Cooperative Entities Based on SISO Time Reversal and Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04150v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The simultaneous localization and recognition of subwavelength non-cooperative entities within complex multi-scattering environments using a simplified system continues to pose a substantial challenge. This letter addresses this challenge by synergistically integrating time reversal time-frequency phase prints (TRTFPPs) and neural networks. Initially, a time reversal (TR) single-input single-output (SISO) framework is employed to generate TRTFPPs. To enhance the models' adaptability, particularly in the presence of noise, data augmentation techniques are applied. Subsequently, neural networks are employed to comprehend the TRTFPPs. Specifically, a cascaded neural network structure is embraced, encompassing both a recognition neural network and distinct neural networks for localizing different entities. Through the devised approach, two types of subwavelength entities are successfully identified and precisely localized through numerical simulations and experimental verification in laboratory environment. The proposed methodology holds applicability across various electromagnetic systems, including but not limited to detection, imaging, human-computer interaction, and the Internet of Things (IoT).</description>

      <title>High Fidelity Freeform Manufacturing via Polyspectral Tomographic Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.13941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A key goal of freeform manufacturing is to achieve speed, precision and design freedom at the same time. Volumetric additive manufacturing via tomographic reconstruction offers high speed but cannot achieve optical resolution at high design freedom. Here we combine polyspectral tomographic reconstruction with pseudo-negative illumination to resolve the trilemma. We used the same units on a digital micromirror device to modulate two colors of illumination simultaneously to control the chemical stability of binary photoinhibition. The methodology enables a typical 4K projector to 3D-print up to 8.9 billion voxels in a 30x30x50 mm vial at two-digit-m-resolution in minutes, with prolonged process window and geometrically fidelous greyscale printing. These results are linked to, and thus can be improved directly upon upgrading, the precision of the optomechanical modality.</description>

      <title>CVD Graphene Contacts for Lateral Heterostructure MoS${_2}$ Field Effect Transistors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.01177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intensive research is carried out on two-dimensional materials, in particular molybdenum disulfide, towards high-performance transistors for integrated circuits. Fabricating transistors with ohmic contacts is challenging due to the high Schottky barrier that severely limits the transistors' performance. Graphene-based heterostructures can be used in addition or as a substitute for unsuitable metals. We present lateral heterostructure transistors made of scalable chemical vapor-deposited molybdenum disulfide and chemical vapor-deposited graphene with low contact resistances of about 9 k${\Omega}$${\mu}$m and high on/off current ratios of 10${^8}$. We also present a theoretical model calibrated on our experiments showing further potential for scaling transistors and contact areas into the few nanometers range and the possibility of a strong performance enhancement by means of layer optimizations that would make transistors promising for use in future logic circuits.</description>

      <title>Proton-CAT: a Novel Proposal for Enhanced Proton Therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02760v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a nitrogen-targeting-Proton-Carbon-Alpha-Therapy method, abbreviated as Proton-CAT, which partially converts protons into carbon-12 and $\alpha$ particles through nuclear reactions between protons and nitrogen-15. Monte Carlo simulations validated the effectiveness of the Proton-CAT, and the study specifically focused on the distribution of relative energy deposition. The results indicated that the presence of nitrogen-15 enhanced the maximum dose level of protons, resulting in more effective damage confined to tumor cells. Statistical analysis of secondary ions has shown that the Proton-CAT significantly increases the production efficiencies of carbon-12 and $\alpha$ particles. Furthermore, it has been revealed that elevating the nitrogen-15 concentration significantly boosts the dose of carbon and $\alpha$ particles within the tumor region. The present work would contribute to the future development of proton therapy.</description>

      <title>Environmental monitoring using orbital angular momentum mode decomposition enhanced machine learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atmospheric interaction with light has been an area of fascination for many researchers over the last century. Environmental conditions, such as temperature and wind speed, heavily influence the complex and rapidly varying optical distortions propagating optical fields experience. The continuous random phase fluctuations commonly make deciphering the exact origins of specific optical aberrations challenging. The generation of eddies is a major contributor to atmospheric turbulence, similar in geometric structure to optical vortices that sit at the centre of OAM beams. Decomposing the received optical fields into OAM provides a unique spatial similarity that can be used to analyse turbulent channels. In this work, we present a novel mode decomposition assisted machine learning approach that reveals trainable features in the distortions of vortex beams that allow for effective environmental monitoring. This novel technique can be used reliably with Support Vector Machine regression models to measure temperature variations of 0.49C and wind speed variations of 0.029 m/s over a 36m experimental turbulent free-space channels with controllable and verifiable temperature and wind speed with short 3s measurement. The predictable nature of these findings could indicate the presence of an underlying physical relationship between environmental conditions that lead to specific eddy formation and the OAM spiral spectra.</description>
