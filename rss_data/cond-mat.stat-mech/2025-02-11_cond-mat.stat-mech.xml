      <title>Accelerated Transition Rates in Generalized Kramers Problems for Non-Variational, Non-Normal System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kramers' escape problem serves as a paradigm for understanding transitions and various types of reactions, such as chemical and nuclear reactions, in systems driven by thermal fluctuations and damping, particularly within the realm of classical variational dynamics. Here, we generalize Kramers' problem to processes with non-normal dynamics characterized by asymmetry, hierarchy, and stochastic fluctuations, where transient amplification and stochastic perturbations play a critical role. The obtained generalized escape rates are structurally similar to those for variational systems, but with a renormalized temperature proportional to the square of the condition number k which measures non-normality. Because k can take large values (e.g., 10 r more) in many systems, the resulting acceleration of transition rates can be enormous, given the exponential dependence on the inverse temperature in Kramers' formula. We propose that non-normal accelerated escape rates are relevant to a wide range of systems, including biological metabolism, ecosystem shifts, climate dynamics, and socio-economic processes.</description>

      <title>Origin of the Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics and its Role in Statistical Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In statistical mechanics the zeroth law of thermodynamics is taken as a postulate which, as its name indicates, logically precedes the first and second laws. Treating it as a postulate has consequences for how temperature is introduced into statistical mechanics and for the molecular interpretation of temperature. One can, however, derive the zeroth law from first principles starting from a classical Hamiltonian using basic mechanics and a geometric representation of the phase space of kinetic energy configurations - the velocity hypersphere. In this approach there is no difficulty in providing a molecular interpretation of temperature, nor in deriving equality of temperature as the condition of thermal equilibrium. The approach to the macroscopic limit as a function of the number of atoms is easily determined. One also obtains with little difficulty the Boltzmann probability distribution, the statistical mechanical definition of entropy and the configuration partition function. These relations, along with the zeroth law, emerge as straightforward consequences of atoms in random motion.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Baxter-Wu model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using Monte Carlo simulations, we investigated the dynamical properties of the Baxter-Wu model under linear quench. For the linear cooling process, the scaling behavior of the excess energy excitation density in the critical region aligns well with the predictions of the Kibble-Zurek (KZ) mechanism. However, the scaling behavior of the excess energy excitation density at the end of linear cooling does not conform to a simple interplay between the KZ mechanism and the coarsening process; after exiting the impulse regime, the system undergoes a decay close to a power-law form, with a decaying exponent that is significantly different from the coarsening exponent observed in instantaneous quenching. For the linear heating process, we found that if the initial state is the ground state of the model, the relevant exponents describing the KZ mechanism are identical to those in the cooling scenario. We find that the system does not directly enter the adiabatic regime after leaving the impulse regime but instead passes through a crossover regime with exponential decay of the excess energy excitation density. If the initial state is ordered but not the ground state of the system, the energy excitation density still exhibits good scaling behavior, but the relevant exponents do not conform to the predictions of the KZ mechanism. We found that this discrepancy is related to the peculiar zero-temperature dynamical properties arising from the unique ground states of the model.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Cost of Steady State Erasure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments have implemented resetting by means of a time-varying external harmonic trap whereby the trap stiffness is changed from an initial to a final value in finite-time and then the system is reset when it relaxes to an equilibrium distribution in the final trap. Such setups are very similar to those studied in the context of the finite-time Landauer erasure principle. We analyse the thermodynamic costs of such a setup by deriving a moment generating function for the work cost of changing the trap stiffness in finite-time for a system in steady state. We analyse the mean and variance of the work required for a specific experimentally viable protocol and also obtain an optimal protocol which minimises the mean cost. For both these procedures, our analysis captures both the large-time and short-time corrections. For the optimal protocol, we obtain a closed form expression for the mean cost for all protocol durations, thereby making contact with earlier work on geometric measures of dissipation-minimising optimal protocols that implement information erasure.</description>

      <title>An ideal entropy transporter with finite power and vanishing fluctuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a micro-magnet that interacts with a spin-polarized electric current, a heat bath, as well as a static magnetic field. The resulting non-equilibrium steady-state transports entropy between the current and the heat bath, without need of any thermodynamic force. In the limit of strong magnetic field, both the entropy production rate and the fluctuation of entropy transport become vanishingly small, whereas the average rate of entropy transport remains finite. Our results demonstrate that there is no fundamental limitation on the performance of thermodynamic engines other than the first and second laws of thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic entropic uncertainty relation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermodynamic uncertainty relations reveal a fundamental trade-off between the precision of trajectory observables and entropy production, where the uncertainty in observables is quantified by their variance. In the context of information theory, uncertainty is often evaluated in terms of Shannon entropy, but it remains unclear whether there is a quantitative relation between Shannon entropy of the observables and entropy production in stochastic thermodynamics. In this Letter, we show that uncertainty relations can be formulated with observable Shannon entropy and entropy production. We introduce symmetry entropy, an entropy measure that quantifies the symmetry of the observable distribution, and demonstrate that a greater asymmetry in the observable distribution demands higher entropy production. This Letter elucidates the role of Shannon entropy of observables within stochastic thermodynamics, thereby establishing a foundation for deriving new uncertainty relations.</description>

      <title>Nonanalytic Landau functionals shaping the finite-size scaling of fluctuations and response functions in and out of equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Landau theory relates phase transitions to the minimization of the Landau functional (e.g., free energy functional), which is expressed as a power series of the order parameter. It has been shown that the critical behavior of certain physical systems can be described using Landau functionals that include nonanalytic terms, corresponding to odd or even noninteger powers of the absolute value of the order parameter. In particular, these nonanalytic terms can determine the order of the phase transition and the values of the critical exponents. Here, we show that such terms can also shape the finite-size scaling behavior of fluctuations of observables (e.g., of energy or magnetization) or the response functions (e.g., heat capacity or magnetic susceptibility) at the continuous phase transition point. We demonstrate this on two examples, the equilibrium molecular zipper and the nonequilibrium version of the Curie--Weiss model.</description>

      <title>Quicker flocking in aligning active matters for noisier beginning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The constituents in a class of active matter systems change their directions of motion by being influenced by the velocities of the neighbors. Such systems may undergo phase transitions, with respect to ordering in the velocity field, as well as clustering in the density field, when the strength of an externally imposed noise is varied. Via computer simulations, with a well-known model, that faithfully represents these systems, we show that evolutions in both clustering and ordering exhibit certain interesting features that were hitherto unrealized. The transformations occur quicker, following quenches to a fixed final state, below the transition point, for disordered starting states that are farther away from the ``critical" noise strength. This implies earliest arrival of the farthest, at a given destination. Detailed analysis of the results, combined with the outcomes from a similar study of para- to ferromagnetic transitions, show that the variation in critical fluctuations in the initial configurations can lead to such interesting effect. We quantify this via the Ornstein-Zernike theory.</description>

      <title>Crossover from BKT to first-order transition induced by higher-order terms in 2D XY models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study phase transitions in $XY$ models, generalized by inclusion of $n$ higher-order pairwise interactions of equal strength, by Monte Carlo simulation. It is found that by adding new terms the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition, observed in the standard $XY$ model, gradually changes to the first-order phase transition. We determine the critical number of terms for which the first-order transition appears as $n_c=6$. It is also found that for $n=5$ the transition is pseudo-first-order but it becomes true first-order if the couplings are allowed to increase. In general, a more rapid increase of the coupling intensity supports the first-order transition, however, a too fast increase may result in splitting of the single transition to multiple transitions. Consequently, the minimal number of the terms required for the change of the BKT phase transition to first order in the present model with arbitrary couplings is estimated to be $2 &lt; n_c \leq 5$.</description>

      <title>Survival probabilities in biased random walks: To restart or not to restart? that is the question</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The time-dependent survival probability function $S(t;x_0,q)$ of biased Sisyphus random walkers, who at each time step have a finite probability $q$ to step towards an absorbing trap at the origin and a complementary probability $1-q$ to return to their initial position $x_0$, is derived {\it analytically}. In particular, we explicitly prove that the survival probability function of the walkers decays exponentially at asymptotically late times. Interestingly, our analysis reveals the fact that, for a given value $q$ of the biased jumping probability, the survival probability function $S(t;x_0,q)$ is characterized by a {\it critical} (marginal) value $x^{\text{crit}}_0(q)$ of the initial gap between the walkers and the trap, above which the late-time survival probability of the biased Sisyphus random walkers is {\it larger} than the corresponding survival probability of standard random walkers.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions in Nonreciprocal Driven-Dissipative Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of boundaries and spatial nonreciprocity on nonequilibrium driven-dissipative phase transitions. We focus on a one-dimensional lattice of nonlinear bosons described by a Lindblad master equation, where the interplay between coherent and incoherent dynamics generates nonreciprocal interactions between sites. Using a mean-field approach, we analyze the phase diagram under both periodic and open boundary conditions. For periodic boundaries, the system always forms a condensate at nonzero momentum and frequency, resulting in a time-dependent traveling wave pattern. In contrast, open boundaries reveal a far richer phase diagram, featuring multiple static and dynamical phases, as well as exotic phase transitions, including the spontaneous breaking of particle-hole symmetry associated with a critical exceptional point and phases with distinct bulk and edge behavior. Our model avoids post-selection or unphysical non-Hermitian Hamiltonians and is experimentally realizable in platforms such as superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>Neurophysiological correlates to the human brain complexity through $q$-statistical analysis of electroencephalogram</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The prospects of assessing neural complexity (NC) by $q$-statistics of the systemic organization of different types and levels of brain activity were studied. In 70 adult subjects, NC was assessed via the parameter $q$ of $q$-statistics, applied to the ongoing and EEG and its spectral power of 20 scalp points (channels). The NC were estimated both globally for all channels (AllCh) and locally (for each single channel) in different Functional States (FSs). The values of $q$ was compared among FSs and single channels, as well they were correlated with the power of $\theta$ (4-8Hz), $\beta_1$ (15-25Hz) and others EEG bands, in each FS. The value of $q$ across all FSs was higher for AllCh than for the single channels FSs. Consistently with previous studies, we found a negative correlation between NC and age. The FSs did not influence the $q$ of the EEG in AllCh, although locally the FS modulated $q$ in a consistent manner (e.g., reducing $q$ in posterior sites with eyes closed). The $q$ was correlated positively with the power of the $\theta$ and negatively with that of the $\beta_1$ band in general. These findings support the idea that, as a first approach, $q$-statistics can describe the human NC. The relationship between $q$ and $\theta$ power aligns with greater NC during FSs such as listening music and resting with eyes open, which is consistent with high-order representations rather than low-informative attentional tasks (OddBall).</description>

      <title>Enhanced diffusion over a periodic trap by hydrodynamic coupling to an elastic mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many physical systems, degrees of freedom are coupled \emph{via} hydrodynamic forces, even in the absence of Hamiltonian interactions. A particularly important and widespread example concerns the transport of microscopic particles in fluids near deformable boundaries. In such a situation, the influence of elastohydrodynamic couplings on Brownian motion remains to be understood. Unfortunately, the temporal and spatial scales associated with the thermal fluctuations of usual surfaces are often so small that their deformations are difficult to monitor experimentally, together with the much slower and larger particle motion at stake. Here, we propose a minimal model describing the hydrodynamic coupling of a colloidal particle to a fluctuating elastic mode, in presence of an external periodic potential. We demonstrate that the late-time diffusion coefficient of the particle increases with the compliance of the elastic mode. Remarkably,  our results reveal that, and quantify how: i) spontaneous microscopic transport in complex environnements can be affected by soft boundaries -- a situation with numerous practical implications in nanoscale and biological physics; ii) the effects of fast and tiny surface deformations are imprinted over the long-term and large-distance colloidal mobility -- and are hence measurable in practice.</description>

      <title>Gradient flow of the infinite-volume free energy for lattice systems of continuous spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an infinite lattice system of interacting spins living on a smooth compact manifold, with short- but not necessarily finite-range pairwise interactions. We construct the gradient flow of the infinite-volume free energy on the space of translation-invariant spin measures, using an adaptation of the variational approach in Wasserstein space pioneered by Jordan, Kinderlehrer, and Otto. We also construct the infinite-volume diffusion corresponding to the so-called overdamped Langevin dynamics of the spins under the effect of the interactions and of thermal agitation.
  We show that the trajectories of the gradient flow and of the law of the spins under this diffusion both satisfy, in a weak sense, the same hierarchy of coupled parabolic PDE's, which we interpret as an infinite-volume Fokker--Planck--Kolmogorov equation. We prove regularity of weak solutions and derive an Evolution Variational Inequality for regular solutions, which implies uniqueness. Thus, in particular, the trajectories of the gradient flow coincide with those obtained from the Langevin dynamics.
  Concerning the long-time evolution, we check that the free energy is always non-increasing along the flow and that moreover, if the Ricci curvature of the spin space is uniformly positive, then at high enough temperature the dynamics converges exponentially, in free energy and in specific Wasserstein distance, to the unique minimizer of the infinite-volume free energy.</description>

      <title>Time Evolution of the Symmetry Resolved Entanglement Entropy after a Mass Quench</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the properties of the symmetry resolved entanglement entropy after a mass quench in the Ising field theory. Since the theory is free and the post-quench state known explicitly, the one-point function of the relevant (composite) branch point twist field can be computed using form factor techniques, similar to previous work on the branch point twist field and the magnetisation, respectively. We find that the symmetry resolved entropy grows linearly in time at the same rate as the total entropy, and that there are sub-leading oscillatory corrections. This result provides the first explicit computation of the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of the symmetry resolved entropy employing twist fields in quantum field theory and is consistent with existing results based on the quasiparticle picture.</description>

      <title>Exact NESS of XXZ circuits boundary driven with arbitrary resets or fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose spatially inhomogeneous matrix product ansatz for an exact many-body density operator of a boundary driven XXZ quantum circuit. The ansatz has formally infinite bond-dimension and is fundamentally different from previous constructions. The circuit is driven by a pair of reset quantum channels applied on the boundary qubits, which polarize the qubits to arbitrary pure target states. Moreover, one of the reset channels can be replaced by an arbitrary local unitary gate, thus representing a hybrid case with coherent/incoherent driving. Analyzing the ansatz we obtain a family of relatively robust separable nonequilibrium steady states (NESS), which can be viewed as a circuit extension of spin-helix states, and are particularly suited for experimental investigations.</description>

      <title>Universal relations and bounds for fluctuations in quasistatic small heat engines</title>

      <description>arXiv:1910.08096v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The efficiency of any heat engine, defined as the ratio of average work output to heat input, is bounded by Carnot's celebrated result. However, this measure is insufficient to characterize the properties of miniaturized heat engines carrying non-negligible fluctuations, and a study of higher-order statistics of their energy exchanges is required. Here, we generalize Carnot's result for reversible cycles to arbitrary order moment of the work and heat fluctuations. Our results show that, in the quasistatic limit, higher-order statistics of a small engine's energetics depend solely on the ratio between the temperatures of the thermal baths. We further prove that our result for the second moment gives universal bounds for the ratio between the variances of work and heat for quasistatic cycles. We test this theory with our previous experimental results of a Brownian Carnot engine and observe the consistency between them, even beyond the quasistatic regime. Our results can be exploited in the design of thermal nanomachines to reduce their fluctuations of work output without marginalizing its average value and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Token-driven totally asymmetric simple exclusion process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.13558v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a family of totally asymmetric simple exclusion processes (TASEPs), consisting of particles on a lattice that require binding by a "token" in various physical configurations to advance over the lattice. Using a combination of theory and simulations, we address the following questions: (i) How token binding kinetics affects the current-density relation on the lattice; (ii) How this current-density relation depends on the scarcity of tokens; (iii) How tokens propagate the effects of the locally-imposed disorder (such as a slow site) over the entire lattice; (iv) How a shared pool of tokens couples concurrent TASEPs running on multiple lattices; (v) How our results translate to TASEPs with open boundaries that exchange particles with the reservoir. Since real particle motion (including in biological systems that inspired the standard TASEP model, e.g., protein synthesis or movement of molecular motors) is often catalyzed, regulated, actuated, or otherwise mediated, the token-driven TASEP dynamics analyzed in this paper should allow for a better understanding of real systems and enable a closer match between TASEP theory and experimental observations.</description>

Abstract: We show that classical DNA unzipping transition which is equivalently described by quantum mechanical localization-delocalization transition in the ground state of non-Hermitian single impurity Hatano-Nelson Hamiltonian is underpinned by generalized parity ({\bf P})-time reversal ({\bf T}) symmetry breaking transition. We also study the one-dimensional discretized version of Hatano-Nelson model in the presence of the single impurity and random disorder on a finite-size lattice. These discrete models are useful to study unzipping of a single adsorbed polymer from a surface. Our results show that the discrete models also undergo a phase transition from a PT unbroken phase to a broken phase. Interestingly, the generalized PT phase transition points coincide with the localization-delocalization transition for continuum as well as lattice models.</description>

      <title>Free fermions with dephasing and boundary driving: Bethe Ansatz results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By employing the Lindblad equation, we derive the evolution of the two-point correlator for a free-fermion chain of length $L$ subject to bulk dephasing and boundary losses. We use the Bethe ansatz to diagonalize the Liouvillian ${\mathcal L}^{\scriptscriptstyle(2)}$ governing the dynamics of the correlator. The majority of its energy levels are complex. Precisely, $L(L-1)/2$ complex energies do not depend on dephasing, apart for a trivial shift. The remaining complex levels are perturbatively related to the dephasing-independent ones for large $L$. The long-time dynamics is governed by a band of real energies, which contains an extensive number of levels. They give rise to diffusive scaling at intermediate times, when boundaries can be neglected. Moreover, they encode the breaking of diffusion at asymptotically long times. Interestingly, for large loss rate two boundary modes appear in the spectrum. The real energies correspond to string solutions of the Bethe equations, and can be treated effectively for large chains. This allows us to derive compact formulas for the dynamics of the fermionic density. We check our results against exact diagonalization, finding perfect agreement.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations of dynamical observables in linear diffusions with time delay: a Riccati-based approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our current understanding of fluctuations of dynamical (time-integrated) observables in non- Markovian processes is still very limited. A major obstacle is the lack of an appropriate theoretical framework to evaluate the associated large deviation functions. In this paper we bypass this difficulty in the case of linear diffusions with time delay by using a Markovian embedding procedure that introduces an infinite set of coupled differential equations. We then show that the generating functions of current-type observables can be computed at arbitrary finite time by solving matrix Riccati differential equations (RDEs) somewhat similar to those encountered in optimal control and filtering problems. By exploring in detail the properties of these RDEs and of the corresponding continuous-time algebraic Riccati equations (CAREs), we identify the generic fixed point towards which the solutions converge in the long-time limit. This allows us to derive the explicit expressions of the scaled cumulant generating function (SCGF), of the pre-exponential factors, and of the effective (or driven) process that describes how fluctuations are created dynamically. Finally, we describe the special behavior occurring at the limits of the domain of existence of the SCGF, in connection with fluctuation relations for the heat and the entropy production.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic Thermalization for Highly Degenerate Hamiltonians After Slight Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15832v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We say of an isolated macroscopic quantum system in a pure state $\psi$ that it is in macroscopic thermal equilibrium if $\psi$ lies in or close to a suitable subspace $\mathcal{H}_{eq}$ of Hilbert space. It is known that every initial state $\psi_0$ will eventually reach macroscopic thermal equilibrium and stay there most of the time ("thermalize") if the Hamiltonian is non-degenerate and satisfies the appropriate version of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), i.e., that every eigenvector is in macroscopic thermal equilibrium. Shiraishi and Tasaki recently proved the ETH for a certain perturbation $H_\theta$ of the Hamiltonian $H_0$ of $N\gg 1$ free fermions on a one-dimensional lattice. The perturbation is needed to remove the high degeneracies of $H_0$. Here, we point out that also for degenerate Hamiltonians, all $\psi_0$ thermalize if the ETH holds for every eigenbasis, and we prove that this is the case for $H_0$. On top of that and more generally, we develop another strategy of proving thermalization, inspired by the fact that there is one eigenbasis of $H_0$ for which ETH can be proven more easily and with smaller error bounds than for the others. This strategy applies to arbitrarily small generic perturbations $H$ of $H_0$ and to arbitrary spatial dimensions. In fact, we consider any given $H_0$, suppose that the ETH holds for some but not necessarily every eigenbasis of $H_0$, and add a small generic perturbation, $H=H_0+\lambda V$ with $\lambda\ll 1$. Then, although $H$ (which is non-degenerate) may still not satisfy the ETH, we show that nevertheless (i) every $\psi_0$ thermalizes for most perturbations $V$, and more generally, (ii) for any subspace $\mathcal{H}_\nu$ (such as corresponding to a non-equilibrium macro state), most perturbations $V$ are such that most $\psi_0$ from $\mathcal{H}_\nu$ thermalize.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we focus on the measurement-induced physics and stochastic dynamics in the systems of single-body quasiparticle and many-body microscopic cases. In the former case, it shows a smooth evolution from non-Gaussian (Poission or binomial distribution) with local dephasing to Gaussian with global dephasing (quantum to classical) where in late time there is a global symmetry consist of exponentially many pure states due to the suppressed (stochastic) fluctuation and heating; In the latter case, it shows exponentially many distinct (Krylov) sectors due to the fragmentation and dynamical constrain on Hilbert-space.</description>

Abstract: Random matrix theory yields valuable insights into the universal features of quantum many-body chaotic systems. Although all-to-all interactions are traditionally studied, many interesting dynamical questions, such as transport of a conserved density, require a notion of spatially local interactions. We study the transport of the energy, the most basic conserved density, in few-body and 1D chains of nearest-neighbor random matrix terms that square to one. In the few-body but large local Hilbert space dimension case, we develop a mapping for the energy dynamics to a single-particle hopping picture. This allows for the computation of the energy density autocorrelators and an out-of-time-ordered correlator of the energy density. In the 1D chain, we numerically study the energy transport for a small local Hilbert space dimension. We also discuss the density of states throughout and touch upon the relation to free probability theory.</description>

      <title>Operator Growth in Disordered Spin Chains: Indications for the Absence of Many-Body Localization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08031v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the spreading of a local operator $A$ in one-dimensional systems with Hamiltonian $H$ by calculating the $k$-fold commutator $[H,[H,[...,[H,A]]]]$. We derive bounds for the operator norm of this commutator in free and interacting systems with and without disorder thus directly connecting the operator growth hypothesis with questions of localization. We analytically show that an almost factorial growth of the operator norm - as recently proven for the random Ising model - is inconsistent with an exponential localization of $A$. Assuming that a quasi-local unitary $U$ exists which maps $H$ onto an effective Hamiltonian $\tilde H=UHU^\dagger=\sum_n E_n \tau^z_n +\sum_{i,j} J_{ij} \tau^z_i\tau^z_j+\dots$, we show that $\tilde A=UAU^\dagger$ is a quasi-local operator which in the many-body case does not remain exponentially localized in general leading to an almost factorial norm growth. Therefore the unitary $U$ in many-body systems with maximal norm growth either does not exist and such systems are always ergodic or unusual non-ergodic phases described by $\tilde H$ do exist which violate the operator growth hypothesis and in which operators spread, implying that transport will eventually set in. We analytically and symbolically verify our results for the Anderson and Aubry-Andr\'e models. For the XXX case, the symbolic calculations are consistent with a maximal norm growth. Furthermore, we find no indication of a weakened exponential localization of $A$, expected for strong disorder and low commutator orders if the unitary $U$ does exist. Finally, we try to perturbatively construct $U$ by consecutive Schrieffer-Wolff transformations. While it is straightforward to show that this construction converges in the Anderson case, we find no indications for a convergence in the interacting case, suggesting that $U$ does not exist and that many-body localization is absent.</description>

Abstract: Recently multiple families of spin chain models were found, which have a free fermionic spectrum,even though they are not solvable by a Jordan-Wigner transformation. Instead, the free fermions emerge as a result of a rather intricate construction. In this work we consider the quantum circuit formulation of the problem. We construct circuits using local unitary gates built from the terms in the local Hamiltonians of the respective models, and ask the question: which circuit geometries (sequence of gates) lead to a free fermionic spectrum? Our main example is the 4-fermion model of Fendley, where we construct free fermionic circuits with various geometries. In certain cases we prove the free fermionic nature, while for other geometries we confirm it numerically. Surprisingly, we find that many standard brickwork circuits are not free fermionic, but we identify certain symmetric constructions which are. We also consider a recent generalization of the 4-fermion model and obtain the factorization of its transfer matrix, and subsequently derive a free-fermionic circuit for this case as well.</description>

Abstract: Discrete time crystalline phases have attracted significant theoretical and experimental attention in the last few years. Such systems require a seemingly impossible combination of nonadiabatic driving and a finite-entropy long-time state, which, surprisingly, is possible in nonergodic systems. Previous works have often relied on disorder for the required nonergodicity; here, we describe the construction of a discrete time crystal (DTC) phase in nondisordered, nonintegrable Ising-type systems. After discussing the conditions for interacting and periodically driven systems to display such phases in general, we propose a concrete model and then provide approximate analytical arguments and direct numerical evidence that it satisfies the conditions and displays a DTC phase robust to local periodic perturbations.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Localization in the Age of Classical Computing</title>

Abstract: Statistical mechanics provides a framework for describing the physics of large, complex many-body systems using only a few macroscopic parameters to determine the state of the system. For isolated quantum many-body systems, such a description is achieved via the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), which links thermalization, ergodicity and quantum chaotic behavior. However, tendency towards thermalization is not observed at finite system sizes and evolution times in a robust many-body localization (MBL) regime found numerically and experimentally in the dynamics of interacting many-body systems at strong disorder. Although the phenomenology of the MBL regime is well-established, the central question remains unanswered: under what conditions does the MBL regime give rise to an MBL phase in which the thermalization does not occur even in the asymptotic limit of infinite system size and evolution time?
  This review focuses on recent numerical investigations aiming to clarify the status of the MBL phase, and it establishes the critical open questions about the dynamics of disordered many-body systems. Persistent finite size drifts towards ergodicity consistently emerge in spectral properties of disordered many-body systems, excluding naive single-parameter scaling hypothesis and preventing comprehension of the status of the MBL phase. The drifts are related to tendencies towards thermalization and non-vanishing transport observed in the dynamics of many-body systems, even at strong disorder. These phenomena impede understanding of microscopic processes at the ETH-MBL crossover. Nevertheless, the abrupt slowdown of dynamics with increasing disorder strength suggests the proximity of the MBL phase. This review concludes that the questions about thermalization and its failure in disordered many-body systems remain a captivating area open for further explorations.</description>

      <title>Motility-induced mixing transition in exponentially growing multicellular spheroids</title>

Abstract: Growth drives cellular dynamics in dense aggregates including bacterial colonies, developing tissues, and tumors. We investigate the underlying physical principles emerging from the interplay of growth, steric repulsion, and motility in a minimal agent-based model of exponentially growing, three-dimensional spheroids. Our results reveal a motility-induced mixing transition: Without motility, deterministic radial motion from volume expansion dominates, while growth and division cause tangential, cellular-scale diffusion, largely independent of expansion velocity. Despite this small-scale diffusion, cell lineages remain confined to their local environment. This confinement persists at weak motility and is overcome only above a threshold, leading to tangential superdiffusivity and global cell mixing with a diverging timescale near the transition, reminiscent of glassy dynamics. Using a phenomenological model, we identify two effects governing this transition: Steric interactions that suppress motility-induced velocity below a threshold, and the expanding nature of the system which inhibits complete mixing. Our study highlights the complex interaction of local cell division and motility with global expansion, mediated exclusively by mechanics. The results provide a baseline for identifying additional biological mechanisms in experiments, for example in tissue spheroids. The mixing dynamics might also be relevant for competition or tumor progression by interacting with genetic heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>The atomizing pulsed jet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01959v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Direct Numerical Simulations of the injection of a pulsed round liquid jet in a stagnant gas are performed in a series of runs of geometrically progressing resolution. The Reynolds and Weber numbers and the density ratio are sufficiently large for reaching a complex high-speed atomization regime but not so large so that the small length scales of the flow are impossible to resolve, except for very small liquid-sheet thickness. The Weber number based on grid size is then small, an indication that the simulations are very well resolved. Computations are performed using octree adaptive mesh refinement with a finite volume method and height-function computation of curvature, down to a specified minimum grid size $\Delta$. Qualitative analysis of the flow and its topology reveals a complex structure of ligaments, sheets, droplets and bubbles that evolve and interact through impacts, ligament breakup, sheet rupture and engulfment of air bubbles in the liquid. A rich gallery of images of entangled structures is produced. Most processes occurring in this type of atomization are reproduced in detail, except at the instant of thin sheet perforation or breakup. We analyze droplet statistics, showing that as the grid resolution is increased, the small-scale part of the distribution does not converge, and contains a large number of droplets close in order of magnitude to the minimum grid size with a significant peak at $d = 3\Delta$. This non-convergence arises from the numerical sheet breakup effect, in which the interface becomes rough just before it breaks. The rough appearance of the interface is associated to a high-wavenumber oscillation of the curvature. To recover convergence, we apply the controlled "manifold death" numerical procedure, in which thin sheets are detected, and then pierced by fiat before they reach a set critical thickness $h_c$.</description>

      <title>Explicit decoders using fixed-point amplitude amplification based on QSVT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06051v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reliably transmitting quantum information via a noisy quantum channel is a central challenge in quantum information science. While constructing a decoder is crucial to this goal, little was known about quantum circuit implementations of decoders that reach high communication rates. In this paper, we provide two decoders with explicit quantum circuits, which achieve the optimal rate, i.e., the quantum capacity. The decoders are constructed by extending a previous approach applicable only to erasure noise, using the fixed-point amplitude amplification (FPAA) based on the quantum singular value transformation (QSVT). By developing a proof technique that relies on a symmetric structure of the construction, we rigorously show that the proposed decoders are applicable to any noise model and successfully recover quantum information when the decoupling condition is satisfied. This implies that the proposed decoders can be used to achieve the quantum capacity. Our constructions have advantages also in terms of the computational cost, largely reducing the circuit complexity compared to previously known explicit decoders. Through an investigation of the decoding problem, unique advantages of the QSVT-based FPAA are highlighted.</description>

      <title>Cascade of phase transitions in the training of Energy-based models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14689v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the feature encoding process in a prototypical energy-based generative model, the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM). We start with an analytical investigation using simplified architectures and data structures, and end with numerical analysis of real trainings on real datasets. Our study tracks the evolution of the model's weight matrix through its singular value decomposition, revealing a series of phase transitions associated to a progressive learning of the principal modes of the empirical probability distribution. The model first learns the center of mass of the modes and then progressively resolve all modes through a cascade of phase transitions. We first describe this process analytically in a controlled setup that allows us to study analytically the training dynamics. We then validate our theoretical results by training the Bernoulli-Bernoulli RBM on real data sets. By using data sets of increasing dimension, we show that learning indeed leads to sharp phase transitions in the high-dimensional limit. Moreover, we propose and test a mean-field finite-size scaling hypothesis. This shows that the first phase transition is in the same universality class of the one we studied analytically, and which is reminiscent of the mean-field paramagnetic-to-ferromagnetic phase transition.</description>

      <title>Interaction-induced topological phase transition at finite temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04779v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of topological phase transitions in interacting, symmetry-protected quantum matter at finite temperatures. Using a combined numerical and analytical approach, we study a one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with added Hubbard interactions, where no thermodynamic phase transition occurs at finite temperatures. The transition is signalled by a quantized, non-local bulk topological order parameter. It is driven by defects, which are enabled by the combination of interaction and thermal activation, with no counterpart in the non-interacting limit. The defects localize topological zero modes, which, when sufficiently abundant, cause the order parameter to vanish. This phenomenon, interpreted via bulk-boundary correspondence, reflects the loss of a topological edge mode at a well-defined critical temperature in the thermodynamic limit. Unlike zero-temperature topological transitions, these finite-temperature transitions lack thermodynamic signatures but remain observable in controlled quantum systems, such as ultracold fermionic atoms in optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Quantum Supercritical Crossover with Dynamical Singularity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05455v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supercritical states, characterized by strong fluctuations and intriguing phenomena, emerge above the critical point. In this study, we extend this notable concept of supercriticality from classical to quantum systems near the quantum critical point, by studying the one- and two-dimensional quantum Ising models through tensor network calculations and scaling analyses. We reveal the existence of quantum supercritical (QSC) crossover lines, determined by not only response functions but also quantum information quantities. A supercritical scaling law, $h \sim (g - g_c)^{\Delta}$, is revealed, where $g$ ($h$) is the transverse (longitudinal) field, $g_c$ is the critical field, and $\Delta$ is a critical exponent. Moreover, we uncover the QSC crossover line defines a boundary for the dynamical singularity to appear in quench dynamics, which can be ascribed to the intersection between the Lee-Yang zero line and the real-time axis. In particular, when the Hamiltonian parameter is quenched to the QSC crossover line, a singular cusp with exponent 1/2 emerge in the Loschmidt rate function, signaling a new dynamical universality class different from the linear cusp for $h=0$. Possible platforms, such as quantum simulators and quantum magnets are proposed for studying QSC crossovers in experiments. Our work paves the way for exploring QSC crossovers in and out of equilibrium in quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Gapless deconfined phase in a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetric Hamiltonian created in a cold-atom setup</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a quasi-two-dimensional system consisting of two species of alkali atoms confined in a specific optical lattice potential [Phys. Rev. A 95, 053608 (2017)]. In the low-energy regime, this system is governed by a unique $\mathbb{Z}_N$ gauge theory, where field theory arguments have suggested that it may exhibit two exotic gapless deconfined phases, namely a dipolar liquid phase and a Bose liquid phase, along with two gapped (confined and deconfined) phases. We address these predictions numerically by using large-scale density matrix renormalization group simulations. Our findings provide conclusive evidence for the existence of a gapless Bose liquid phase for $N \geq 7$. We demonstrate that this gapless phase shares the same critical properties as one-dimensional critical phases, resembling weakly coupled chains of Luttinger liquids. In the range of ladder and cylinder geometries and $N$ considered, the gapless dipolar phase predicted theoretically is still elusive and its characterization will probably require a full two-dimensional treatment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a thorough investigation of nonstabilizerness - a fundamental quantum resource that quantifies state complexity within the framework of quantum computing - in a one-dimensional U(1) lattice gauge theory. We show how nonstabilizerness is always extensive with volume, and has no direct relation to the presence of critical points. However, its derivatives typically display discontinuities across the latter: This indicates that nonstabilizerness is strongly sensitive to criticality, but in a manner that is very different from entanglement (that, typically, is maximal at the critical point). Our results indicate that error-corrected simulations of lattice gauge theories close to the continuum limit have similar computational costs to those at finite correlation length and provide rigorous lower bounds for quantum resources of such quantum computations.</description>

      <title>Modular Properties of Generalised Gibbs Ensembles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the modular properties of Generalised Gibbs Ensembles (GGEs) in two dimensional conformal field theories. These are obtained by inserting higher spin charges in the expressions for the partition function of the theory. We investigate the particular case where KdV charges are inserted in the GGE. We first determine an asymptotic expression for the transformed GGE. This expression is an expansion in terms of the zero modes of all the quasi-primary fields in the theory, not just the KdV charges. While these charges are non-commuting they can be re-exponentiated to give an asymptotic expression for the transformed GGE in terms of another GGE. As an explicit example we focus on the Lee-Yang model. We use the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz in the Lee-Yang model to first replicate the asymptotic results, and then find additional energies that need to be included in the transformed GGE in order to find the exact modular transformation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18509v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a method to evaluate the partition function and energy density of a massive scalar on a 2-sphere of radius $r$ and at finite temperature $\beta$ as power series in $\frac{\beta}{r}$. Each term in the power series can be written in terms of polylogarithms. We use this result to obtain the gap equation for the large $N$, critical $O(N)$ model with a quartic interaction on $S^1\times S^2$ in the large radius expansion. Solving the gap equation perturbatively we obtain the leading finite size corrections to the expectation value of stress tensor for the $O(N)$ vector model on $S^1\times S^2$. Applying the Euclidean inversion formula on the perturbative expansion of the thermal two point function we obtain the finite size corrections to the expectation value of the higher spin currents of the critical $O(N)$ model. Finally we show that these finite size corrections of higher spin currents tend to that of the free theory at large spin as seen earlier for the model on $S^1\times R^2$.</description>

Abstract: In social networking services, users constantly change, and the network structure changes simultaneously. As the network structure changes, so does the word-of-mouth within it. To study how information transfer on the network changes with the aging of the network, we investigated the relation of the structure and the percolation in the aged networks. We first prepared the Bianconi-Barab\'{a}si model as the initial network and observed the time evolution of its properties by repeatedly deleting and adding nodes. We introduced two tunable parameters, the deleting parameter $\alpha$ and the adding parameter $\beta$, and observed the aging behavior for the various parameter sets. We found that the network did not reach its steady state depending on the parameters. We also found that when the network is stable, there is a parameter region where the degree distribution changes from power-law to exponential decay. We performed the percolation analyses and found that the behavior of the percolation probability changes simultaneously with changes in the network's structure. This study is expected to help control network structure in steady-state aged networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Maximum entropy methods, based on the inverse Ising/Potts problem from statistical mechanics, are essential for modeling interactions between pairs of variables in data-driven problems across disciplines such as bioinformatics, ecology, and neuroscience. Despite their considerable success, these methods typically fail to capture higher-order interactions that are often essential for understanding complex systems. Conversely, modern machine learning methods capture these complex interactions, but the computational cost of interpretable frameworks makes them impractical for real-world applications. Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) provide a computationally efficient way to capture statistical correlations using hidden nodes in a bipartite neural network. In this study, we introduce a new method that maps RBMs to generalized Potts models, allowing for the extraction of interactions up to any specified order. This method utilizes large-$N$ approximations, enabled by the RBM's simple structure, to extract effective many-body couplings with minimal computational effort. Furthermore, we propose a robust framework for extracting higher-order interactions in more complex probabilistic models and a simple gauge-fixing method within the effective many-body Potts model. Our validation on synthetic datasets confirms the method's ability to recover two- and three-body interactions accurately. When applied to protein sequence data, the framework competently reconstructs protein contact maps and provides performance comparable to the best inverse Potts models. These findings confirm that RBMs are an effective and streamlined tool for exploring higher-order interactions within complex systems.</description>

      <title>Soil creep facilitated by cyclic variations of environmental conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sloped terrains tend to creep downward over time, even when their slope is below the nominal angle of repose. This behavior can result from periodic variations in environmental conditions, such as daily or seasonal fluctuations in temperature and humidity. We study this process by considering a model of an athermal yield stress material under an applied stress lower than the critical yield stress value $\sigma_c$. Normally, in such a situation the material does not flow at all. However, under cyclic temporal variation of system parameters a finite amount of irreversible deformation can remain after each cycle, and a long term steady-state flow of the whole system can be induced. In our model, we cycle the strength of internal elastic interactions to mimic the effect of cyclic variation of environmental conditions in the real soils. We find that the amount of deformation per cycle increases if $\sigma_c$ is approached from below, and it decreases and even vanishes at a novel critical stress $\sigma_0&lt;\sigma_c$ when this, in turn, is reached from above. Interestingly, $\sigma_0$ plays a role similar to the endurance limit in the context of fatigue damage propagation. Despite the model's simplicity, our results offer a fresh perspective on subcritical landform evolution, with implications for the creep of hill slopes over long periods and the precursors to runaway landslides.</description>

      <title>The quantum relative entropy of the Schwarzschild black-hole and the area law</title>

Abstract: The area law obeyed by the thermodynamic entropy of black holes is one of the fundamental results relating gravity to statistical mechanics. In this work we provide a derivation of the area law for the quantum relative entropy of the Schwarzschild black-hole for arbitrary Schwarzschild radius. The quantum relative entropy between the metric of the manifold and the metric induced by the geometry and the matter field has been proposed in G. Bianconi "Gravity from entropy", Phys. Rev. D (2025) as the action for entropic quantum gravity leading to modified Einstein equations. The quantum relative entropy generalizes Araki entropy and treats the metrics between zero-forms, one-forms, and two-forms as quantum operators. Although the Schwarzschild metric is not an exact solution of the modified Einstein equations of the entropic quantum gravity, it is an approximate solution valid in the low coupling, small curvature limit. Here we show that the quantum relative entropy associated to the Schwarzschild metric obeys the area law for large Schwarzschild radius. We provide a full statistical mechanics interpretation of the results.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal projections of hypercubes</title>

Abstract: Projections of hypercubes have been applied to visualize high-dimensional binary state spaces in various scientific fields. Conventional methods for projecting hypercubes, however, face practical difficulties. Manual methods require nontrivial adjustments of the projection basis, while optimization-based algorithms limit the interpretability and reproducibility of the resulting plots. These limitations motivate us to explore theoretically analyzable projection algorithms such as principal component analysis (PCA). Here, we investigate the mathematical properties of PCA-projected hypercubes. Our numerical and analytical results show that PCA effectively captures polarized distributions within the hypercubic state space. This property enables the assessment of the asymptotic distribution of projected vertices and error bounds, which characterize the performance of PCA in the projected space. We demonstrate the application of PCA to visualize the hypercubic energy landscapes of Ising spin systems. By adding projected hypercubic edges, these visualizations reveal pathways of correlated spin flips. Our work provides a better understanding of how PCA discovers hidden patterns in high-dimensional binary data.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Breaking Dynamics in Quantum Many-Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement asymmetry has emerged as a powerful tool for characterizing symmetry breaking in quantum many-body systems. In this Letter, we explore how symmetry is dynamically broken through the lens of entanglement asymmetry in two distinct scenarios: a non-symmetric random quantum circuit and a non-symmetric Hamiltonian quench, with a particular focus on U(1) symmetry. In the former case, the symmetry is initially broken and subsequently restored, whereas in the latter case, symmetry remains broken in the subsystem at late times, consistent with the principles of quantum thermalization. Notably, the growth of entanglement asymmetry exhibits unexpected overshooting behavior at early times in both contexts, contrasting with the behavior of charge variance. We also consider dynamics of non-symmetric initial states under the symmetry-breaking evolution. Due to the competition of symmetry-breaking in both the initial state and Hamiltonian, the early-time entanglement asymmetry can increase and decrease, while quantum Mpemba effects remain evident despite the weak symmetry-breaking in both settings.</description>
