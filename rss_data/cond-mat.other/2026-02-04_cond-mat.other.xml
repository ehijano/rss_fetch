      <title>Nanoscale spin-wave frequency-selective limiter for 5G technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power limiters are essential devices in modern radio frequency (RF) communications systems to protect highly sensitive input channels from large incoming signals. Nowadays-used semiconductor limiters suffer from high electronic noise and switching delays when approaching the GHz range, which is crucial for the modern generation of 5G communication technologies aiming to operate at the EU 5G high band (24.25-27.5 GHz). The proposed solution is to use ferrite-based Frequency Selective Limiters (FSLs), which maintain their efficiency at high GHz frequencies, although they have only been studied at the macroscale so far. In this study, we demonstrate a proof of concept of nanoscale FSLs. The devices are based on spin-wave transmission affected by four-magnon scattering phenomena in a 97-nm-thin Yttrium Iron Garnet (YIG) film. Spin waves were excited and detected using coplanar waveguide (CPW) transducers of the smallest feature size of 250 nm. The FSLs are tested in the frequency range up to 25 GHz, and the key parameters are extracted (power threshold, power limiting level, insertion losses, bandwidth) for different spin-wave modes and transducer lengths. An analytical theory has been formulated to describe the fundamental physical processes, and a numerical model has been developed to quantitatively describe the insertion losses and power characteristics of the FSLs. Additionally, the perspective of the spin-wave devices is discussed, including the possibility of simultaneously integrating three devices into one: a frequency-selective limiter, an RF filter, and a delay line, allowing for more efficient use of space and energy.</description>

      <title>Generalized Time-Varying Drude Model for Dispersive and Lossy Modulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a generalization of the time-varying Drude model, treating carrier density, effective mass, and collision rate as explicit functions of time. We derive expressions for polarization, susceptibility, displacement, and permittivity in different domains. Our analysis reveals that non-adiabatic modulations and time-dependent losses induce rich and distinct behaviors, leading to temporal blurring, selective gating and suppression, and low-frequency spectral reshaping. Besides underpinning and upgrading the current framework on photonics of time-varying media, this model may be useful in the design and fitting theoretical models with experimental realizations.</description>
