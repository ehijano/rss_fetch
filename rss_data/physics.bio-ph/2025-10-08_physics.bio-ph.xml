      <title>Nitrogen-doped carbon quantum dots enhance bacteria growth and biosensing signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbon quantum dots (CQDs) are known for their antibacterial properties and ability to inhibit bacteria growth. In the current study, we observed a dopant and concentration-dependency on the antibacterial effect of CQDs. High concentrations of CQDs completely inhibited bacteria growth yet low concentrations enhanced growth. Unlike undoped CQDs, nitrogen-doped CQDs (N-CQDs) enhanced bacteria growth in a concentration-dependant manner and nitrogen/iron co-doped CQDs (Fe/N-CQDs) resulted in growth profiles similar to untreated bacteria. N-CQDs also exhibited the strongest photoluminescence (PL) signal which was quenched by bacteria, and the reduction in the maximum PL intensity was linear over the concentration range tested until saturation. N-CQDs were found to be located around the bacteria cell periphery suggesting intimate interactions. Illumination prior to interaction with bacteria had little influence on these growth effects. Absorbance measurements of colloidal CQD, N-CQD and Fe/N-CQD confirmed long-term stability (7 days). Such materials have potential for incorporation into rapid sensing and diagnostic systems for bacteria detection in liquids for biomedical applications.</description>

      <title>Space-filling discrete helices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proteins are linear chain molecules that play a central role in life and health. Protein native state folds are modular assemblies of space-filling building blocks of {\alpha}-helices, \{beta}-sheets and tight turns. Here we deduce the structures of a countable set of space-filling helical forms of a uniform discrete thick string from first principles with no additional input or adjustable parameters. These forms occur in correspondence with the natural numbers, loosely analogous to the energy levels in a Bohr atom. We find the remarkable result that one of these helical forms is an excellent candidate for an {\alpha}-helix through seemingly improbable quantum chemistry coincidences that fit the geometrical requirements. Our work suggests that geometry and chemistry are complementary ways of looking at proteins and suggests a route for developing a unified framework for understanding proteins.</description>

      <title>The Hidden Wheel-Within</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is this old, eternal question: Why don't animals have wheels? In this perspective we show that they actually do. And they do so in a physically extraordinary way -- by combining incompatible elasticity, differential geometry and dissipative self-organization. Nature's wheel -- the ``wheel-within'' -- has been mysteriously concealed in plain sight, yet it spins in virtually every slender-body organism: in falling cats, crocodilians spinning to subdue their prey, rolling fruit-fly larvae, circumnutating plants and even in some of our own body movements. Flying somehow under the radar of our cognition, in recent years the wheel-within also tacitly entered the field of soft robotics, finally opening our eyes for its ubiquitous role in Nature. We here identify its underlying physical ingredients, namely the existence of a neutrally-stable, shape-invariant and actively driven elastic mode. We then reflect on various man-made realizations of the wheel-within and outline where it could be spinning from here.</description>

      <title>The generic temperature response of large biochemical networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17202v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biological systems are remarkably susceptible to relatively small temperature changes. The most obvious example is fever, when a modest rise in body temperature of only few Kelvin has strong effects on our immune system and how it fights pathogens. Another very important example is climate change, when even smaller temperature changes lead to dramatic shifts in ecosystems. Although it is generally accepted that the main effect of an increase in temperature is the acceleration of biochemical reactions according to the Arrhenius equation, it is not clear how it affects large biochemical networks with complicated architectures. For developmental systems like fly and frog, it has been shown that the system response to temperature deviates in a characteristic manner from the linear Arrhenius plot of single reactions, but a rigorous explanation has not been given yet. Here we use a graph-theoretical interpretation of the mean first-passage times of a biochemical master equation to give a statistical description. We find that in the limit of large system size and if the network has a bias towards a target state, then the Arrhenius plot is generically quadratic, in excellent agreement with numerical simulations for large networks as well as with experimental data for developmental times in fly and frog. We also discuss under which conditions this generic response can be violated, for example for linear chains, which have only one spanning tree.</description>

      <title>Super-resolved anomalous diffusion: deciphering the joint distribution of anomalous exponent and diffusion coefficient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18133v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The molecular motion in heterogeneous media displays anomalous diffusion by the mean-squared displacement $\langle X^2(t) \rangle = 2 D t^\alpha$. Motivated by experiments reporting populations of the anomalous diffusion parameters $\alpha$ and $D$, we aim to disentangle their respective contributions to the observed variability when this last is due to a true population of these parameters and when it arises due to finite-duration recordings. We introduce estimators of the anomalous diffusion parameters on the basis of the time-averaged mean squared displacement and study their statistical properties. By using a copula approach, we derive a formula for the joint density function of their estimations conditioned on their actual values. The methodology introduced is indeed universal, it is valid for any Gaussian process and can be applied to any quadratic time-averaged statistics. We also explain the experimentally reported relation $D\propto\exp(\alpha c_1+c_2)$ for which we provide the exact expression. We finally compare our findings to numerical simulations of the fractional Brownian motion and quantify their accuracy by using the Hellinger distance.</description>
