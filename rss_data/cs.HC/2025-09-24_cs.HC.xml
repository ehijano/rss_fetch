      <title>Not a Collaborator or a Supervisor, but an Assistant: Striking the Balance Between Efficiency and Ownership in AI-incorporated Qualitative Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Qualitative research offers deep insights into human experiences, but its processes, such as coding and thematic analysis, are time-intensive and laborious. Recent advancements in qualitative data analysis (QDA) tools have introduced AI capabilities, allowing researchers to handle large datasets and automate labor-intensive tasks. However, qualitative researchers have expressed concerns about AI's lack of contextual understanding and its potential to overshadow the collaborative and interpretive nature of their work. This study investigates researchers' preferences among three degrees of delegation of AI in QDA (human-only, human-initiated, and AI-initiated coding) and explores factors influencing these preferences. Through interviews with 16 qualitative researchers, we identified efficiency, ownership, and trust as essential factors in determining the desired degree of delegation. Our findings highlight researchers' openness to AI as a supportive tool while emphasizing the importance of human oversight and transparency in automation. Based on the results, we discuss three factors of trust in AI for QDA and potential ways to strengthen collaborative efforts in QDA and decrease bias during analysis.</description>

      <title>Does Embodiment Matter to Biomechanics and Function? A Comparative Analysis of Head-Mounted and Hand-Held Assistive Devices for Individuals with Blindness and Low Vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual assistive technologies, such as Microsoft Seeing AI, can improve access to environmental information for persons with blindness or low vision (pBLV). Yet, the physical and functional implications of different device embodiments remain unclear. In this study, 11 pBLV participants used Seeing AI on a hand-held smartphone and on a head-mounted ARx Vision system to perform six activities of daily living, while their movements were captured with Xsens motion capture. Functional outcomes included task time, success rate, and number of attempts, and biomechanical measures included joint range of motion, angular path length, working volume, and movement smoothness. The head-mounted system generally reduced upper-body movement and task time, especially for document-scanning style tasks, whereas the hand-held system yielded higher success rates for tasks involving small or curved text. These findings indicate that both embodiments are viable, but they differ in terms of physical demands and ease of use. Incorporating biomechanical measures into assistive technology evaluations can inform designs that optimise user experience by balancing functional efficiency, physical sustainability, and intuitive interaction.</description>

      <title>When Collaborative Maintenance Falls Short: The Persistence of Retracted Papers on Wikipedia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wikipedia serves as a key infrastructure for public access to scientific knowledge, but it faces challenges in maintaining the credibility of cited sources, especially when scientific papers are retracted. This paper investigates how citations to retracted research are handled on English Wikipedia. We construct a novel dataset that integrates Wikipedia revision histories with metadata from Retraction Watch, Crossref, Altmetric, and OpenAlex, identifying 1,181 citations of retracted papers. We find that 71.6% of all citations analyzed are problematic. These are citations added before a paper's retraction, as well as the citations introduced after retraction without any in-text mention of the paper's retracted status. Our analysis reveals that these citations persist for a median of over 3.68 years (1,344 days). Through survival analysis, we find that signals of human attention are associated with a faster correction process. Unfortunately, a paper's established scholarly authority, a higher academic citation count, is associated with a slower time to correction. Our findings highlight how the Wikipedia community supports collaborative maintenance but leaves gaps in citation-level repair. We contribute to CSCW research by advancing our understanding of this sociotechnical vulnerability, which takes the form of a community coordination challenge, and by offering design directions to support citation credibility at scale.</description>

      <title>Mind Your Ps and Qs: Supporting Positive Reinforcement in Moderation Through a Positive Queue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online communities are constantly growing, with dozens of platforms housing millions of users. Large and small communities alike rely on volunteer moderators to maintain order. Despite their key role, moderators are given a toolbox of punishments and asked to fend off barrages of harmful content. However, prior research shows that positive feedback may proactively encourage higher quality contributions and discourage norm violations. Moreover, moderators themselves have requested support for locating and rewarding content to encourage in their communities. These requests notwithstanding, there is a tangible lack of practical support through tools. Building off moderators' ideas, we build a novel moderation system, the Positive Queue, that augments Reddit's existing moderator interface with features to discover and reward desirable content. Through a user study of moderators, we find that the system has value to vastly different moderation settings. We present design directions and insights for incorporating positive moderation strategies into existing spaces.</description>

      <title>The Ranking Effect: How Algorithmic Rank Influences Attention on Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media feeds have become central to the Internet. Among the most visible are trending feeds, which rank content deemed timely and relevant. To examine how feed signals influence behaviors and perceptions, we conducted a randomized experiment (n = 585) simulating Reddit's r/popular feed. By having participants view identical sets of posts in different orders, we isolate the effects of rank and social proof on engagement and perceived relevance, trustworthiness, and quality. We found that lower-ranked posts received about 40% less engagement, despite participants rarely reporting rank as a factor in their choices. In contrast, neither rank nor social proof shifted perceptions across the three dimensions. We also observed demographic patterns: older participants were more skeptical of trending content, while those with less formal education expressed greater trust. Overall, our findings show that algorithmic curation implicitly steers attention, with implications for platform design, research on algorithmic influence, and policy.</description>

      <title>null2: Boundary-Dissolving Bodies and Architecture towards Digital Nature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a case study of the thematic pavilion null2 at Expo 2025 Osaka-Kansai, contrasting with the static Jomon motifs of Taro Okamoto's Tower of the Sun from Expo 1970. The study discusses Yayoi-inspired mirror motifs and dynamically transforming interactive spatial configuration of null2, where visitors become integrated as experiential content. The shift from static representation to a new ontological and aesthetic model, characterized by the visitor's body merging in real-time with architectural space at installation scale, is analyzed. Referencing the philosophical context of Expo 1970 theme 'Progress and Harmony for Mankind,' this research reconsiders the worldview articulated by null2 in Expo 2025, in which computation is naturalized and ubiquitous, through its intersection with Eastern philosophical traditions. It investigates how immersive experiences within the pavilion, grounded in the philosophical framework of Digital Nature, reinterpret traditional spatial and structural motifs of the tea room, positioning them within contemporary digital art discourse. The aim is to contextualize and document null2 as an important contemporary case study from Expo practices, considering the historical and social background in Japan from the 19th to 21st century, during which world expositions served as pivotal points for the birth of modern Japanese concept of 'fine art,' symbolic milestones of economic development, and key moments in urban and media culture formation. Furthermore, this paper academically organizes architectural techniques, computer graphics methodologies, media art practices, and theoretical backgrounds utilized in null2, highlighting the scholarly significance of preserving these as an archival document for future generations.</description>

      <title>BloomIntent: Automating Search Evaluation with LLM-Generated Fine-Grained User Intents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If 100 people issue the same search query, they may have 100 different goals. While existing work on user-centric AI evaluation highlights the importance of aligning systems with fine-grained user intents, current search evaluation methods struggle to represent and assess this diversity. We introduce BloomIntent, a user-centric search evaluation method that uses user intents as the evaluation unit. BloomIntent first generates a set of plausible, fine-grained search intents grounded on taxonomies of user attributes and information-seeking intent types. Then, BloomIntent provides an automated evaluation of search results against each intent powered by large language models. To support practical analysis, BloomIntent clusters semantically similar intents and summarizes evaluation outcomes in a structured interface. With three technical evaluations, we showed that BloomIntent generated fine-grained, evaluable, and realistic intents and produced scalable assessments of intent-level satisfaction that achieved 72% agreement with expert evaluators. In a case study (N=4), we showed that BloomIntent supported search specialists in identifying intents for ambiguous queries, uncovering underserved user needs, and discovering actionable insights for improving search experiences. By shifting from query-level to intent-level evaluation, BloomIntent reimagines how search systems can be assessed -- not only for performance but for their ability to serve a multitude of user goals.</description>

      <title>FlexGuard: A Design Space for On-Body Feedback for Injury Prevention in Strength Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strength training carries risk of injury when exercises are performed without supervision. While haptics research has advanced, there remains a gap in how to integrate on-body feedback into intelligent wearables. Developing such a design space requires experiencing feedback in context, yet obtaining functional systems is costly. By addressing these challenges, we introduce FlexGuard, a design space for on-body feedback to support injury prevention in strength training. The design space was derived from nine co-design workshops, where novice trainees and expert trainers DIY'd low-fidelity on-body feedback systems, tried them immediately, and surfaced needs and challenges encountered in real exercising contexts. We then evaluated the space through speed dating, using storyboards to cover the design dimensions. We followed up with workshops to further validate selected dimensions in practice through a proof-of-concept wearable system prototype. Our findings extend the design space for sports and fitness wearables in the context of strength training.</description>

      <title>Experimentally Testing AI-Powered Content Transformations on Student Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI, which is capable of transforming static content into dynamic learning experiences, holds the potential to revolutionize student engagement in educational contexts. However, questions still remain around whether or not these tools are effective at facilitating student learning. In this research, we test the effectiveness of content transformations through Learn Your Way, an experimental research platform that transforms textbook chapters into dynamic visual and audio representations. Through a between-subjects, mixed methods experiment with 60 US-based students, we demonstrate that students who used Learn Your Way had a more positive learning experience and had better learning outcomes compared to students learning the same content via a digital reader. These findings indicate that AI-driven tools, capable of providing multiple, interactive representations of content, constitute an effective and promising method for enhancing student learning.</description>

      <title>NaviSense: A Multimodal Assistive Mobile application for Object Retrieval by Persons with Visual Impairment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: People with visual impairments often face significant challenges in locating and retrieving objects in their surroundings. Existing assistive technologies present a trade-off: systems that offer precise guidance typically require pre-scanning or support only fixed object categories, while those with open-world object recognition lack spatial feedback for reaching the object. To address this gap, we introduce 'NaviSense', a mobile assistive system that combines conversational AI, vision-language models, augmented reality (AR), and LiDAR to support open-world object detection with real-time audio-haptic guidance. Users specify objects via natural language and receive continuous spatial feedback to navigate toward the target without needing prior setup. Designed with insights from a formative study and evaluated with 12 blind and low-vision participants, NaviSense significantly reduced object retrieval time and was preferred over existing tools, demonstrating the value of integrating open-world perception with precise, accessible guidance.</description>

      <title>M4SER: Multimodal, Multirepresentation, Multitask, and Multistrategy Learning for Speech Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal speech emotion recognition (SER) has emerged as pivotal for improving human-machine interaction. Researchers are increasingly leveraging both speech and textual information obtained through automatic speech recognition (ASR) to comprehensively recognize emotional states from speakers. Although this approach reduces reliance on human-annotated text data, ASR errors possibly degrade emotion recognition performance. To address this challenge, in our previous work, we introduced two auxiliary tasks, namely, ASR error detection and ASR error correction, and we proposed a novel multimodal fusion (MF) method for learning modality-specific and modality-invariant representations across different modalities. Building on this foundation, in this paper, we introduce two additional training strategies. First, we propose an adversarial network to enhance the diversity of modality-specific representations. Second, we introduce a label-based contrastive learning strategy to better capture emotional features. We refer to our proposed method as M4SER and validate its superiority over state-of-the-art methods through extensive experiments using IEMOCAP and MELD datasets.</description>

      <title>Content and Quality Analysis of mHealth Apps for Feeding Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Approximately 1 in 100 children worldwide are diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and 46% to 89% experience significant feeding difficulties. Mobile health applications (mHealth apps) have emerged as a potential tool for scalable support. However, their quality and relevance in managing ASD-related feeding challenges remain unclear.
  Objective: To identify and evaluate the quality of mHealth apps available in the Africa region addressing feeding difficulties in children with ASD.
  Methods: A systematic search was conducted on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store between September and October 2024. Applications were included if they were free, in English, updated within the past year, explicitly focused on feeding in children with autism, available in the Africa region, and had more than 100 downloads. Eligible apps were assessed using the Behavior Change Wheel (BCW) framework and rated with the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS) across four domains: engagement, functionality, aesthetics, and information quality.
  Results: Of the 326 applications identified, only two iOS apps met all inclusion criteria. EduKitchen-Toddlers Food Games featured child-centered interactive games and sensory-friendly visuals, while Autism Food Coach 2 provided structured caregiver tools, visual meal plans, and progress tracking. Both apps aligned with multiple BCW intervention functions, including education, training, and enablement. MARS scores of 3.7 and 3.9 indicated acceptable to good usability and content quality.
  Conclusion: There is a critical shortage of high-quality, evidence-based mHealth applications addressing feeding difficulties in children with ASD. Future development should prioritize clinical validation and the integration of comprehensive, caregiver-centered support features to address this gap.</description>

      <title>When Ads Become Profiles: Large-Scale Audit of Algorithmic Biases and LLM Profiling Risks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated ad targeting on social media is opaque, creating risks of exploitation and invisibility to external scrutiny. Users may be steered toward harmful content while independent auditing of these processes remains blocked. Large Language Models (LLMs) raise a new concern: the potential to reverse-engineer sensitive user attributes from exposure alone. We introduce a multi-stage auditing framework to investigate these risks. First, a large-scale audit of over 435,000 ad impressions delivered to 891 Australian Facebook users reveals algorithmic biases, including disproportionate Gambling and Politics ads shown to socioeconomically vulnerable and politically aligned groups. Second, a multimodal LLM can reconstruct users' demographic profiles from ad streams, outperforming census-based baselines and matching or exceeding human performance. Our results provide the first empirical evidence that ad streams constitute rich digital footprints for public AI inference, highlighting urgent privacy risks and the need for content-level auditing and governance.</description>

      <title>Native Mixed Reality Compositing on Meta Quest 3: A Quantitative Feasibility Study of ARM-Based SoCs and Thermal Headroom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The adoption of current mixed reality (MR) content creation is primarily based on external PC-centric platforms and third-party cameras, limiting adoption for standalone virtual reality (VR) users. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of integrating an enhanced LIV SDK-like MR compositing pipeline into the Meta Quest 3 hardware, enabling native first-person physical perspective (FPP) MR content creation without external infrastructure. We conducted a simulation-based feasibility study using hardware specifications, developer documentation, and benchmarking with ARM-based SoCs, including Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 and MediaTek Dimensity 9300. The approach suggested Camera Passthrough Enhancement using Meta's experimental Passthrough Camera API with on-device machine learning segmentation through Unity Sentis and FastSAM, and an optimized real-time compositing engine for standalone VR. Benchmarking results show that Quest 3's Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 can support lightweight native MR compositing at 720p30 resolution using 95\% resource utilization, leaving 5\% thermal headroom for sustained runtime. Comparison with next-generation SoCs such as Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 demonstrates 34\% headroom, enabling more robust MR experiences with 1.5--2x faster CPU/GPU performance and higher memory bandwidth. While current Quest 3 hardware supports basic native MR compositing, thermal limits restrict operation to 5--10 minutes before throttling. Experimental results confirm standalone MR content creation is possible on current hardware for short recordings, with new XR SoCs offering the headroom for extended sessions and improved quality. These findings lay groundwork for transitioning MR content creation from PC-based workflows to all-in-one VR devices, enhancing MR production for content creators and researchers.</description>

      <title>Preference-Guided Multi-Objective UI Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D Mixed Reality interfaces have nearly unlimited space for layout placement, making automatic UI adaptation crucial for enhancing the user experience. Such adaptation is often formulated as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem, where multiple, potentially conflicting design objectives must be balanced. However, selecting a final layout is challenging since MOO typically yields a set of trade-offs along a Pareto frontier. Prior approaches often required users to manually explore and evaluate these trade-offs, a time-consuming process that disrupts the fluidity of interaction. To eliminate this manual and laborous step, we propose a novel optimization approach that efficiently determines user preferences from a minimal number of UI element adjustments. These determined rankings are translated into priority levels, which then drive our priority-based MOO algorithm. By focusing the search on user-preferred solutions, our method not only identifies UIs that are more aligned with user preferences, but also automatically selects the final design from the Pareto frontier; ultimately, it minimizes user effort while ensuring personalized layouts. Our user study in a Mixed Reality setting demonstrates that our preference-guided approach significantly reduces manual adjustments compared to traditional methods, including fully manual design and exhaustive Pareto front searches, while maintaining high user satisfaction. We believe this work opens the door for more efficient MOO by seamlessly incorporating user preferences.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking PDF Accessibility Evaluation A Dataset and Framework for Assessing Automated and LLM-Based Approaches for Accessibility Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PDFs remain the dominant format for scholarly communication, despite significant accessibility challenges for blind and low-vision users. While various tools attempt to evaluate PDF accessibility, there is no standardized methodology to evaluate how different accessibility assessment approaches perform. Our work addresses this critical gap by introducing a novel benchmark dataset of scholarly PDFs with expert-validated accessibility annotations across seven criteria (alternative text quality, logical reading order, semantic tagging, table structure, functional hyperlinks, color contrast, and font readability), and a four-category evaluation framework with standardized labels (Passed, Failed, Not Present, Cannot Tell) to systematically assess accessibility evaluation approaches. Using our evaluation framework, we explore whether large language models (LLMs) are capable of supporting automated accessibility evaluation. We benchmark five LLMs, which demonstrate varying capabilities in correctly assessing different accessibility criteria, with GPT-4-Turbo achieving the highest overall accuracy (0.85). However, all models struggled in correctly categorizing documents with Not Present and Cannot Tell accessibility labels, particularly for alt text quality assessment. Our qualitative comparison with standard automated checkers reveals complementary strengths: rule-based tools excel at technical verification, while LLMs better evaluate semantic appropriateness and contextual relevance. Based on our findings, we propose a hybrid approach that would combine automated checkers, LLM evaluation, and human assessment as a future strategy for PDF accessibility evaluation.</description>

      <title>Position: Human-Robot Interaction in Embodied Intelligence Demands a Shift From Static Privacy Controls to Dynamic Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reasoning capabilities of embodied agents introduce a critical, under-explored inferential privacy challenge, where the risk of an agent generate sensitive conclusions from ambient data. This capability creates a fundamental tension between an agent's utility and user privacy, rendering traditional static controls ineffective. To address this, this position paper proposes a framework that reframes privacy as a dynamic learning problem grounded in theory of Contextual Integrity (CI). Our approach enables agents to proactively learn and adapt to individual privacy norms through interaction, outlining a research agenda to develop embodied agents that are both capable and function as trustworthy safeguards of user privacy.</description>

      <title>A Scoping Review of Mixed Initiative Visual Analytics in the Automation Renaissance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial agents are increasingly integrated into data analysis workflows, carrying out tasks that were primarily done by humans. Our research explores how the introduction of automation re-calibrates the dynamic between humans and automating technology. To explore this question, we conducted a scoping review encompassing twenty years of mixed-initiative visual analytic systems. To describe and contrast the relationship between humans and automation, we developed an integrated taxonomy to delineate the objectives of these mixed-initiative visual analytics tools, how much automation they support, and the assumed roles of humans. Here, we describe our qualitative approach of integrating existing theoretical frameworks with new codes we developed. Our analysis shows that the visualization research literature lacks consensus on the definition of mixed-initiative systems and explores a limited potential of the collaborative interaction landscape between people and automation. Our research provides a scaffold to advance the discussion of human-AI collaboration during visual data analysis.</description>

      <title>YAC: Bridging Natural Language and Interactive Visual Exploration with Generative AI for Biomedical Data Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incorporating natural language input has the potential to improve the capabilities of biomedical data discovery interfaces. However, user interface elements and visualizations are still powerful tools for interacting with data, even in the new world of generative AI. In our prototype system, YAC, Yet Another Chatbot, we bridge the gap between natural language and interactive visualizations by generating structured declarative output with a multi-agent system and interpreting that output to render linked interactive visualizations and apply data filters. Furthermore, we include widgets, which allow users to adjust the values of that structured output through user interface elements. We reflect on the capabilities and design of this system with an analysis of its technical dimensions and illustrate the capabilities through four usage scenarios.</description>

      <title>Fair Decisions through Plurality: Results from a Crowdfunding Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss an algorithmic intervention aimed at increasing equity and economic efficiency at a crowdfunding platform that gives cash subsidies to grantees. Through a blend of technical and qualitative methods, we show that the previous algorithm used by the platform -- Quadratic Funding (QF) -- suffered problems because its design was rooted in a model of individuals as isolated and selfish. We present an alternative algorithm -- Connection-Oriented Quadratic Funding (CO-QF) -- rooted in a theory of plurality and prosocial utilities, and show that it qualitatively and quantitatively performs better than QF. CO-QF has achieved an 89% adoption rate at the platform and has distributed over $4 Million to date. In simulations we show that it provides better social welfare than QF. While our design for CO-QF was responsive to the needs of a specific community, we also extrapolate out of this context to show that CO-QF is a potentially helpful tool for general-purpose public decision making.</description>

      <title>Reading Between the Lines: Scalable User Feedback via Implicit Sentiment in Developer Prompts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evaluating developer satisfaction with conversational AI assistants at scale is critical but challenging. User studies provide rich insights, but are unscalable, while large-scale quantitative signals from logs or in-product ratings are often too shallow or sparse to be reliable. To address this gap, we propose and evaluate a new approach: using sentiment analysis of developer prompts to identify implicit signals of user satisfaction. With an analysis of industrial usage logs of 372 professional developers, we show that this approach can identify a signal in ~8% of all interactions, a rate more than 13 times higher than explicit user feedback, with reasonable accuracy even with an off-the-shelf sentiment analysis approach. This new practical approach to complement existing feedback channels would open up new directions for building a more comprehensive understanding of the developer experience at scale.</description>

      <title>Assistive Decision-Making for Right of Way Navigation at Uncontrolled Intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uncontrolled intersections account for a significant fraction of roadway crashes due to ambiguous right-of-way rules, occlusions, and unpredictable driver behavior. While autonomous vehicle research has explored uncertainty-aware decision making, few systems exist to retrofit human-operated vehicles with assistive navigation support. We present a driver-assist framework for right-of-way reasoning at uncontrolled intersections, formulated as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). Using a custom simulation testbed with stochastic traffic agents, pedestrians, occlusions, and adversarial scenarios, we evaluate four decision-making approaches: a deterministic finite state machine (FSM), and three probabilistic planners: QMDP, POMCP, and DESPOT. Results show that probabilistic planners outperform the rule-based baseline, achieving up to 97.5 percent collision-free navigation under partial observability, with POMCP prioritizing safety and DESPOT balancing efficiency and runtime feasibility. Our findings highlight the importance of uncertainty-aware planning for driver assistance and motivate future integration of sensor fusion and environment perception modules for real-time deployment in realistic traffic environments.</description>

      <title>Agentic AutoSurvey: Let LLMs Survey LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exponential growth of scientific literature poses unprecedented challenges for researchers attempting to synthesize knowledge across rapidly evolving fields. We present \textbf{Agentic AutoSurvey}, a multi-agent framework for automated survey generation that addresses fundamental limitations in existing approaches. Our system employs four specialized agents (Paper Search Specialist, Topic Mining \&amp; Clustering, Academic Survey Writer, and Quality Evaluator) working in concert to generate comprehensive literature surveys with superior synthesis quality. Through experiments on six representative LLM research topics from COLM 2024 categories, we demonstrate that our multi-agent approach achieves significant improvements over existing baselines, scoring 8.18/10 compared to AutoSurvey's 4.77/10. The multi-agent architecture processes 75--443 papers per topic (847 total across six topics) while targeting high citation coverage (often $\geq$80\% on 75--100-paper sets; lower on very large sets such as RLHF) through specialized agent orchestration. Our 12-dimension evaluation captures organization, synthesis integration, and critical analysis beyond basic metrics. These findings demonstrate that multi-agent architectures represent a meaningful advancement for automated literature survey generation in rapidly evolving scientific domains.</description>

      <title>From latent factors to language: a user study on LLM-generated explanations for an inherently interpretable matrix-based recommender system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can generate effective, user-facing explanations from a mathematically interpretable recommendation model. The model is based on constrained matrix factorization, where user types are explicitly represented and predicted item scores share the same scale as observed ratings, making the model's internal representations and predicted scores directly interpretable. This structure is translated into natural language explanations using carefully designed LLM prompts. Many works in explainable AI rely on automatic evaluation metrics, which often fail to capture users' actual needs and perceptions. In contrast, we adopt a user-centered approach: we conduct a study with 326 participants who assessed the quality of the explanations across five key dimensions-transparency, effectiveness, persuasion, trust, and satisfaction-as well as the recommendations themselves.To evaluate how different explanation strategies are perceived, we generate multiple explanation types from the same underlying model, varying the input information provided to the LLM. Our analysis reveals that all explanation types are generally well received, with moderate statistical differences between strategies. User comments further underscore how participants react to each type of explanation, offering complementary insights beyond the quantitative results.</description>

      <title>A Mega-Study of Digital Twins Reveals Strengths, Weaknesses and Opportunities for Further Improvement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Do "digital twins" capture individual responses in surveys and experiments? We run 19 pre-registered studies on a national U.S. panel and their LLM-powered digital twins (constructed based on previously-collected extensive individual-level data) and compare twin and human answers across 164 outcomes. The correlation between twin and human answers is modest (approximately 0.2 on average) and twin responses are less variable than human responses. While constructing digital twins based on rich individual-level data improves our ability to capture heterogeneity across participants and predict relative differences between them, it does not substantially improve our ability to predict the exact answers given by specific participants or enhance predictions of population means. Twin performance varies by domain and is higher among more educated, higher-income, and ideologically moderate participants. These results suggest current digital twins can capture some degree of relative differences but are unreliable for individual-level predictions and sample mean and variance estimation, underscoring the need for careful validation before use. Our data and code are publicly available for researchers and practitioners interested in optimizing digital twin pipelines.</description>

      <title>Sliding Speed Influences Electrovibration-Induced Finger Friction Dynamics on Touchscreens</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electrovibration technology enables tactile texture rendering on capacitive touchscreens by modulating friction between the finger and the screen through electrostatic attraction forces, generated by applying an alternating voltage signal to the screen. Accurate signal calibration is essential for robust texture rendering but remains challenging due to variations in sliding speed, applied force, and individual skin mechanics, all of which unpredictably affect frictional behavior. Here, we investigate how exploration conditions affect electrovibration-induced finger friction on touchscreens and the role of skin mechanics in this process. Ten participants slid their index fingers across an electrovibration-enabled touchscreen at five sliding speeds ($20\sim100$ mm/s) and applied force levels ($0.2\sim0.6$ N). Contact forces and skin accelerations were measured while amplitude modulated voltage signals spanning the tactile frequency range were applied to the screen. We modeled the finger-touchscreen friction response as a first-order system and the skin mechanics as a mass-spring-damper system. Results showed that sliding speed influenced the friction response's cutoff frequency, along with the estimated finger moving mass and stiffness. For every $1$ mm/s increase in speed, the cutoff frequency, the finger moving mass, and stiffness increased by $13.8$ Hz, $3.23\times 10^{-5}$ kg, and $4.04$ N/m, respectively. Correlation analysis revealed that finger stiffness had a greater impact on the cutoff frequency than moving mass. Notably, we observed a substantial inter-participant variability in both finger-display interaction and skin mechanics parameters. Finally, we developed a speed-dependent friction model to support consistent and perceptually stable electrovibration-based haptic feedback across varying user conditions.</description>

      <title>LEKIA: Expert-Aligned AI Behavior Design for High-Risk Human-AI Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated technical accuracy in high-risk domains, such as mental health support and special education. However, they often fail to meet the nuanced behavioral expectations of domain experts. This gap constrains AI deployment in sensitive settings. To address this challenge, we introduce LEKIA (Layered Expert Knowledge Injection Architecture), a novel framework built upon the principle of expert-owned AI behavior design. LEKIA's core innovation lies in its dual architecture: a three-layer knowledge injection system featuring our "Supervision Metaphor Cycle", and a dual-agent safety system ensuring robustness and consistency. We implemented and evaluated LEKIA within psychological support scenarios in special education. Experiments indicate that LEKIA improves performance by 14.8% over baseline, driven by substantive increase in alignment with expert expectations while preserving technical accuracy. Beyond providing a reproducible technical framework, this work demonstrates expert-expectation alignment as a measurable evaluation criterion with implications for AI deployment in high-risk domains.</description>

      <title>XARP Tools: An Extended Reality Platform for Humans and AI Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04108v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) and extended reality (XR) are increasingly combined in applications such as motor skill training, personalized feedback, and embodied task guidance. Yet developing AI-XR systems remains challenging due to fragmented toolchains that push developers into ad hoc integrations, diverting their attention away from essential design concerns such as interactivity and context awareness. To address this issue, we present XARP (XR Agent-ready Remote Procedures), a toolkit for AI-XR development designed for both human developers and AI agents. XARP implements JSON-based remote procedure calls that allow server-side Python to control XR clients, providing a high-level abstraction over low-level integration details. Humans can use XARP as a Python library to write XR applications with reduced implementation overhead. AI agents operate with the same abstraction to dynamically call tools to generate XR applications at runtime in response to context changes and user requests. XARP offers Model Context Protocol (MCP) connectivity that allows third-party agents and tools to leverage XR capabilities, previously unavailable. We conducted three case studies that demonstrate XARP supports a variety of AI-XR applications, including AI-guided fencing, drone assistance, and room layout design. We evaluated XARP in a walkthrough study with 24 AI and XR developers. UTAUT scores indicate high potential for adoption, and participants reported that XARP can reduce authoring time, lower entry barriers for developers unfamiliar with AI or XR, and enable the implementation of novel AI-XR systems.</description>

      <title>Using Generative AI to Uncover What Drives Player Enjoyment in PC and VR Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16596v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As video games continue to evolve, understanding what drives player enjoyment remains a key challenge. Player reviews provide valuable insights, but their unstructured nature makes large-scale analysis difficult. This study applies generative AI and machine learning, leveraging Microsoft Phi-4 small language model (SLM) and Google Cloud, to quantify and analyze game reviews from Steam and Meta Quest stores. The approach converts qualitative feedback into structured data, enabling comprehensive evaluation of key game design elements, monetization models, and platform-specific trends. The findings reveal distinct patterns in player preferences across PC and VR games, highlighting factors that contribute to higher player enjoyment. By using Google Cloud for large scale data storage and processing, this study establishes a scalable framework for game review analysis. The study's insights offer actionable guidance for game developers, helping optimize game mechanics, pricing strategies, and player engagement.</description>

Abstract: Generative AI is reshaping higher education, yet research has focused largely on students, while instructors remain understudied despite their central role in mediating adoption and modeling responsible use. We present the \textit{AI Academy}, a faculty development program that combined AI exploration with pedagogical reflection and peer learning. Rather than a course evaluated for outcomes, the Academy provided a setting to study how instructors build AI literacies in relation to tools, policies, peer practices, and institutional supports. We studied 25 instructors through pre/post surveys, learning logs, and facilitator interviews. Findings show AI literacy gains alongside new insights. We position instructors as designers of responsible AI practices and contribute a replicable program model, a co-constructed survey instrument, and design insights for professional development that adapts to evolving tools and fosters ethical discussion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hands-on training sessions become a standard way to develop and increase knowledge in cybersecurity. As practical cybersecurity exercises are strongly process-oriented with knowledge-intensive processes, process mining techniques and models can help enhance learning analytics tools. The design of our open-source analytical dashboard is backed by guidelines for visualizing multivariate networks complemented with temporal views and clustering. The design aligns with the requirements for post-training analysis of a special subset of cybersecurity exercises -- supervised Capture the Flag games. Usability is demonstrated in a case study using trainees' engagement measurement to reveal potential flaws in training design or organization.</description>

      <title>Campus AI vs. Commercial AI: How Customizations Shape Trust and Usage of LLM as-a-Service Chatbots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the use of LLM chatbots by students and researchers becomes more prevalent, universities are pressed to develop AI strategies. One strategy that many universities pursue is to customize pre-trained LLM as-a-service (LLMaaS). While most studies on LLMaaS chatbots prioritize technical adaptations, we focus on psychological effects of user-salient customizations, such as interface changes. We assume that such customizations influence users' perception of the system and are therefore important in guiding safe and appropriate use. In a field study, we examine how students and employees (N = 526) at a German university perceive and use their institution's customized LLMaaS chatbot compared to ChatGPT. Participants using both systems (n = 116) reported greater trust, higher perceived privacy and less experienced hallucinations with their university's customized LLMaaS chatbot in contrast to ChatGPT. We discuss theoretical implications for research on calibrated trust, and offer guidance on the design and deployment of LLMaaS chatbots.</description>

      <title>DOTA: Distributional Test-Time Adaptation of Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-language foundation models (VLMs), such as CLIP, exhibit remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks. However, deploying these models can be unreliable when significant distribution gaps exist between training and test data, while fine-tuning for diverse scenarios is often costly. Cache-based test-time adapters offer an efficient alternative by storing representative test samples to guide subsequent classifications. Yet, these methods typically employ naive cache management with limited capacity, leading to severe catastrophic forgetting when samples are inevitably dropped during updates. In this paper, we propose DOTA (DistributiOnal Test-time Adaptation), a simple yet effective method addressing this limitation. Crucially, instead of merely memorizing individual test samples, DOTA continuously estimates the underlying distribution of the test data stream. Test-time posterior probabilities are then computed using these dynamically estimated distributions via Bayes' theorem for adaptation. This distribution-centric approach enables the model to continually learn and adapt to the deployment environment. Extensive experiments validate that DOTA significantly mitigates forgetting and achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Probing LLM World Models: Enhancing Guesstimation with Wisdom of Crowds Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17310v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Guesstimation--the task of making approximate quantitative estimates about objects or events-is a common real--world skill, yet remains underexplored in large language model (LLM) research. We introduce three guesstimation datasets: MARBLES, FUTURE, and ELECPRED, spanning physical estimation (e.g., how many marbles fit in a cup) to abstract predictions (e.g., the 2024 U.S. presidential election). Inspired by the social science concept of Wisdom of Crowds (WOC)- where the median of multiple estimates improves accuracy-we propose WOC decoding for LLMs. We replicate WOC effects in human participants and find that LLMs exhibit similar benefits: median aggregation across sampled responses consistently improves accuracy over greedy decoding, self-consistency decoding, and mean decoding. This suggests that LLMs encode a world model that supports approximate reasoning. Our results position guesstimation as a useful probe of LLM world knowledge and highlight WOC decoding as a strategy for enhancing LLM guesstimation performance on real-world tasks.</description>

      <title>Unlocking the Potential of AI Researchers in Scientific Discovery: What Is Missing?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05822v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The potential of AI researchers in scientific discovery remains largely untapped. Over the past decade, AI for Science (AI4Science) publications in 145 Nature Index journals have increased fifteen-fold, yet they still account for less than 3% of the total publications. Drawing upon the Diffusion of Innovation theory, we project AI4Science's share of total publications to rise from 2.72% in 2024 to approximately 20% by 2050. Achieving this shift requires fully harnessing the potential of AI researchers, as nearly 95% of AI-driven research in these journals is led by experimental scientists. To facilitate this, we propose structured workflows and strategic interventions to position AI researchers at the forefront of scientific discovery. Specifically, we identify three critical pathways: equipping experimental scientists with accessible AI tools to amplify the impact of AI researchers, bridging cognitive and methodological gaps to enable more direct involvement in scientific discovery, and proactively fostering a thriving AI-driven scientific ecosystem. By addressing these challenges, we aim to empower AI researchers as key drivers of future scientific breakthroughs.</description>

      <title>VIBE: Annotation-Free Video-to-Text Information Bottleneck Evaluation for TL;DR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17423v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many decision-making tasks, where both accuracy and efficiency matter, still require human supervision. For example, tasks like traffic officers reviewing hour-long dashcam footage or researchers screening conference videos can benefit from concise summaries that reduce cognitive load and save time. Yet current vision-language models (VLMs) often produce verbose, redundant outputs that hinder task performance. Existing video caption evaluation depends on costly human annotations and overlooks the summaries' utility in downstream tasks. We address these gaps with Video-to-text Information Bottleneck Evaluation (VIBE), an annotation-free method that scores VLM outputs using two metrics: grounding (how well the summary aligns with visual content) and utility (how informative it is for the task). VIBE selects from randomly sampled VLM outputs by ranking them according to the two scores to support effective human decision-making. Human studies on LearningPaper24, SUTD-TrafficQA, and LongVideoBench show that summaries selected by VIBE consistently improve performance-boosting task accuracy by up to 61.23% and reducing response time by 75.77% compared to naive VLM summaries or raw video.</description>

      <title>When and How Long Did Therapy Happen? Soft-Supervising Temporal Localization Using Audio-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09707v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prolonged Exposure (PE) therapy is an effective treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but evaluating therapist fidelity remains labor-intensive due to the need for manual review of session recordings. We present a method for the automatic temporal localization of key PE fidelity elements, identifying their start and stop times, directly from session audio and transcripts. Our approach fine-tunes a large pre-trained audio-language model, Qwen2-Audio, using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to process focused 30-second windows of audio-transcript input. Fidelity labels for three core protocol phases, therapist orientation (P1), imaginal exposure (P2), and post-imaginal processing (P3), are generated via LLM-based prompting and verified by trained raters. The model is trained to predict normalized boundary offsets using soft supervision guided by task-specific prompts. On a dataset of 308 real PE sessions, our best configuration (LoRA rank 8, 30s windows) achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 5.3s across tasks, within typical rater tolerance for timestamp review, enabling practical fidelity QC. We further analyze the effects of window size and LoRA rank, highlighting the importance of context granularity and model adaptation. This work introduces a privacy-preserving, scalable framework for fidelity tracking in PE therapy, with potential to support clinician training, supervision, and quality assurance.</description>

      <title>A Rigorous Behavior Assessment of CNNs Using a Data-Domain Sampling Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a data-domain sampling regime for quantifying CNNs' graphic perception behaviors. This regime lets us evaluate CNNs' ratio estimation ability in bar charts from three perspectives: sensitivity to training-test distribution discrepancies, stability to limited samples, and relative expertise to human observers. After analyzing 16 million trials from 800 CNNs models and 6,825 trials from 113 human participants, we arrived at a simple and actionable conclusion: CNNs can outperform humans and their biases simply depend on the training-test distance. We show evidence of this simple, elegant behavior of the machines when they interpret visualization images. osf.io/gfqc3 provides registration, the code for our sampling regime, and experimental results.</description>

      <title>Gender and Political Bias in Large Language Models: A Demonstration Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16264v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present ParlAI Vote, an interactive system for exploring European Parliament debates and votes, and for testing LLMs on vote prediction and bias analysis. This platform connects debate topics, speeches, and roll-call outcomes, and includes rich demographic data such as gender, age, country, and political group. Users can browse debates, inspect linked speeches, compare real voting outcomes with predictions from frontier LLMs, and view error breakdowns by demographic group. Visualizing the EuroParlVote benchmark and its core tasks of gender classification and vote prediction, ParlAI Vote highlights systematic performance bias in state-of-the-art LLMs. The system unifies data, models, and visual analytics in a single interface, lowering the barrier for reproducing findings, auditing behavior, and running counterfactual scenarios. It supports research, education, and public engagement with legislative decision-making, while making clear both the strengths and the limitations of current LLMs in political analysis.</description>

      <title>The Narcissus Hypothesis: Descending to the Rung of Illusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern foundational models increasingly reflect not just world knowledge, but patterns of human preference embedded in their training data. We hypothesize that recursive alignment-via human feedback and model-generated corpora-induces a social desirability bias, nudging models to favor agreeable or flattering responses over objective reasoning. We refer to it as the Narcissus Hypothesis and test it across 31 models using standardized personality assessments and a novel Social Desirability Bias score. Results reveal a significant drift toward socially conforming traits, with profound implications for corpus integrity and the reliability of downstream inferences. We then offer a novel epistemological interpretation, tracing how recursive bias may collapse higher-order reasoning down Pearl's Ladder of Causality, culminating in what we refer to as the Rung of Illusion.</description>
