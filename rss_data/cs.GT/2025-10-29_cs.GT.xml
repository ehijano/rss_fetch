      <title>What Are People's Actual Utility Functions in Budget Aggregation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While participatory budgeting and budget-aggregation mechanisms require assumptions about how voters evaluate non-ideal budget allocations, little empirical evidence exists to validate which utility models accurately capture human preferences. We conducted structured polls with human participants to test whether real people's preferences conform to commonly assumed utility functions such as $\ell_1$, $\ell_2$ and Leontief. Our results suggest that these models may have limited explanatory power for actual behavior: most participants showed inconsistent patterns across different metric comparisons, and standard assumptions of project symmetry and sign symmetry -- core features of common distance-based metrics -- received little empirical support. However, we find encouraging evidence for more fundamental preference structures: a large majority of participants showed consistency with star-shaped preferences, as well as with peak-linear utility functions, where utility changes proportionally with distance from the ideal budget. These findings have important implications for designers of budget aggregation mechanisms. While theoretical results demonstrate impossibility results for standard distance metrics regarding truthfulness, Pareto-efficiency, and proportionality, our evidence suggests alternative modeling approaches may be warranted. More broadly, this work introduces a systematic methodology to empirically test the utility function assumptions that underpin budget aggregation theories, paving the way for more robust and realistic mechanism design.</description>

      <title>Fair Indivisible Payoffs through Shapley Value</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of payoff division in indivisible coalitional games, where the value of the grand coalition is a natural number. This number represents a certain quantity of indivisible objects, such as parliamentary seats, kidney exchanges, or top features contributing to the outcome of a machine learning model. The goal of this paper is to propose a fair method for dividing these objects among players. To achieve this, we define the indivisible Shapley value and study its properties. We demonstrate our proposed technique using three case studies, in particular, we use it to identify key regions of an image in the context of an image classification task.</description>

      <title>Monopoly Deal: A Benchmark Environment for Bounded One-Sided Response Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Card games are widely used to study sequential decision-making under uncertainty, with real-world analogues in negotiation, finance, and cybersecurity. Typically, these games fall into three categories based on the flow of control: strictly-sequential (where players alternate single actions), deterministic-response (where some actions trigger a fixed outcome), and unbounded reciprocal-response (where alternating counterplays are permitted). A less-explored but strategically rich structure exists: the bounded one-sided response. This dynamic occurs when a player's action briefly transfers control to the opponent, who must satisfy a fixed condition through one or more sequential moves before the turn resolves. We term games featuring this mechanism Bounded One-Sided Response Games (BORGs).
  We introduce a modified version of Monopoly Deal as a benchmark environment that specifically isolates the BORG dynamic, where a Rent action forces the opponent to sequentially choose payment assets. We demonstrate that the gold-standard algorithm, Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR), successfully converges on effective strategies for this domain without requiring novel algorithmic extensions. To support efficient, reproducible experimentation, we present a lightweight, full-stack research platform that unifies the environment, a parallelized CFR runtime, and a human-playable web interface, all runnable on a single workstation. This system provides a practical foundation for exploring state representation and policy learning in bounded one-sided response settings.
  The trained CFR agent and source code are available at https://monopolydeal.ai.</description>

      <title>Timing Games in Responsive Consensus Protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimistic responsiveness -- the ability of a consensus protocol to operate at the speed of the network -- is widely used in consensus protocol design to optimize latency and throughput. However, blockchain applications incentivize validators to play timing games by strategically delaying their proposals, since increased block time correlates with greater rewards. Consequently, it may appear that responsiveness (even under optimistic conditions) is impossible in blockchain protocols. In this work, we develop a model of timing games in responsive consensus protocols and find a prisoner's dilemma structure, where cooperation (proposing promptly) is in the validators' best interest, but individual incentives encourage validators to delay proposals selfishly. To attain desirable equilibria, we introduce dynamic block rewards that decrease with round time to explicitly incentivize faster proposals. Delays are measured through a voting mechanism, where other validators vote on the current leader's round time. By carefully setting the protocol parameters, the voting mechanism allows validators to coordinate and reach the cooperative equilibrium, benefiting all through a higher rate-of-reward. Thus, instead of responsiveness being an unattainable property due to timing games, we show that responsiveness itself can promote faster block proposals. One consequence of moving from a static to dynamic block reward is that validator utilities become more sensitive to latency, worsening the gap between the best- and worst-connected validators. Our analysis shows, however, that this effect is minor in both theoretical latency models and simulations based on real-world networks.</description>

      <title>On Robust Popular Matchings with Tie-Bounded Preferences and Stable Matchings with Two-Sided Ties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are given a bipartite graph $G = \left( A \cup B, E \right)$. In the one-sided model, every $a \in A$ (often called agents) ranks its neighbours $z \in N_{a}$ strictly, and no $b \in B$ has any preference order over its neighbours $y \in N_{b}$, and vertices in $B$ abstain from casting their votes to matchings. In the two-sided model with one-sided ties, every $a \in A$ ranks its neighbours $z \in N_{a}$ strictly, and every $b \in B$ puts all of its neighbours into a single large tie, i.e., $b \in B$ prefers every $y \in N_{b}$ equally. In this two-sided model with one-sided ties, when two matchings compete in a majority election, $b \in B$ abstains from casting its vote for a matching when both the matchings saturate $b$ or both leave $b$ unsaturated; else $b$ prefers the matching where it is saturated. A popular matching $M$ is \emph{robust} if it remains popular among multiple instances.
  We have analysed the cases when a robust popular matching exists in the one-sided model where only one agent alters her preference order among the instances, and we have proposed a polynomial-time algorithm to decide if there exists a robust popular matching when instances differ only with respect to the preference orders of a single agent.
  We give a simple characterisation of popular matchings in the two-sided model with one-sided ties. We show that in the two-sided model with one-sided ties, if the input instances differ only with respect to the preference orders of a single agent, there is a polynomial-time algorithm to decide whether there exists a robust popular matching. We have been able to decide the stable matching problem in bipartite graphs $G = (A \cup B, E)$ where \textit{both} sides have weak preferences (ties allowed), with the restriction that every tie has length at most $k$.</description>

      <title>Learning-Augmented Online Bidding in Stochastic Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online bidding is a classic optimization problem, with several applications in online decision-making, the design of interruptible systems, and the analysis of approximation algorithms. In this work, we study online bidding under learning-augmented settings that incorporate stochasticity, in either the prediction oracle or the algorithm itself. In the first part, we study bidding under distributional predictions, and find Pareto-optimal algorithms that offer the best-possible tradeoff between the consistency and the robustness of the algorithm. In the second part, we study the power and limitations of randomized bidding algorithms, by presenting upper and lower bounds on the consistency/robustness tradeoffs. Previous works focused predominantly on oracles that do not leverage stochastic information on the quality of the prediction, and deterministic algorithms.</description>

      <title>Spoiler Susceptibility in Party Elections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.05115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An electoral spoiler is usually defined as a losing candidate whose removal would affect the outcome by changing the winner. So far, spoiler effects have been analyzed primarily for single-winner electoral systems. We consider this subject in the context of party elections, where there is no longer a sharp distinction between winners and losers. Hence, we propose a more general definition, under which a party is a spoiler if their elimination causes any other party's share in the outcome to decrease. We characterize spoiler-proof electoral allocation rules for zero-sum voting methods. In particular, we prove that for seats-votes functions only identity is spoiler-proof. However, even if spoilers are unavoidable under common electoral rules, their expected impact can vary depending on the rule. Hence, we introduce a measure of spoilership, which allows us to experimentally compare a number of multiwinner social choice rules according to their spoiler susceptibility. Since the probabilistic models used in COMSOC have been developed for nonparty elections, we extend them to generate multidistrict party elections.</description>

      <title>Partially Observable Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Information Sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08705v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study provable multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) in the general framework of partially observable stochastic games (POSGs). To circumvent the known hardness results and the use of computationally intractable oracles, we advocate leveraging the potential \emph{information-sharing} among agents, a common practice in empirical multi-agent RL, and a standard model for multi-agent control systems with communication. We first establish several computational complexity results to justify the necessity of information-sharing, as well as the observability assumption that has enabled quasi-polynomial time and sample single-agent RL with partial observations, for tractably solving POSGs. Inspired by the inefficiency of planning in the ground-truth model, we then propose to further \emph{approximate} the shared common information to construct an approximate model of the POSG, in which an approximate \emph{equilibrium} (of the original POSG) can be found in quasi-polynomial-time, under the aforementioned assumptions. Furthermore, we develop a partially observable multi-agent RL algorithm whose time and sample complexities are \emph{both} quasi-polynomial. Finally, beyond equilibrium learning, we extend our algorithmic framework to finding the \emph{team-optimal solution} in cooperative POSGs, i.e., decentralized partially observable Markov decision processes, a more challenging goal. We establish concrete computational and sample complexities under several structural assumptions of the model. We hope our study could open up the possibilities of leveraging and even designing different \emph{information structures}, a well-studied notion in control theory, for developing both sample- and computation-efficient partially observable multi-agent RL.</description>

      <title>On edge-colouring-games by Erd\H{o}s, and Bensmail and Mc Inerney</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study two games proposed by Erd\H{o}s, and one game by Bensmail and Mc Inerney, all sharing a common setup: two players alternately colour edges of a complete graph, or in the biased version, they colour $p$ and $q$ edges respectively on their turns, aiming to maximise a graph parameter determined by their respective induced subgraphs. In the unbiased case, we give a first reduction towards confirming the conjecture of Bensmail and Mc Inerney, propose a conjecture for Erd\H{o}s' game on maximum degree, and extend the clique and maximum-degree versions to edge-transitive and regular graphs. In the biased case, the maximum-degree and vertex-capturing games are resolved, and we prove the clique game with $(p,q)=(1,3)$.</description>

      <title>Timestamp Manipulation: Timestamp-based Nakamoto-style Blockchains are Vulnerable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05328v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nakamoto consensus are the most widely adopted decentralized consensus mechanism in cryptocurrency systems. Since it was proposed in 2008, many studies have focused on analyzing its security. Most of them focus on maximizing the profit of the adversary. Examples include the selfish mining attack [FC '14] and the recent riskless uncle maker (RUM) attack [CCS '23]. In this work, we introduce the Staircase-Unrestricted Uncle Maker (SUUM), the first block withholding attack targeting the timestamp-based Nakamoto-style blockchain. Through block withholding, timestamp manipulation, and difficulty risk control, SUUM adversaries are capable of launching persistent attacks with zero cost and minimal difficulty risk characteristics, indefinitely exploiting rewards from honest participants. This creates a self-reinforcing cycle that threatens the security of blockchains. We conduct a comprehensive and systematic evaluation of SUUM, including the attack conditions, its impact on blockchains, and the difficulty risks. Finally, we further discuss four feasible mitigation measures against SUUM.</description>
