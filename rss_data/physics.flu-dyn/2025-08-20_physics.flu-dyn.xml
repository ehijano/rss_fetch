      <title>Dynamic stall of a hydrofoil with tubercles in surface gravity waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction of an object with an unsteady flow is non-trivial and is still far from being fully understood. When an airfoil or hydrofoil, for example, undergoes time-dependent motion, nonlinear flow phenomena such as dynamic stall can emerge. The present work experimentally investigates the interaction between a hydrofoil and surface gravity waves. The waves impose periodic fluctuations of the velocity magnitude and orientation, causing a steadily translating hydrofoil to be susceptible to dynamic stall at large wave forcing amplitudes. Simultaneous measurement of both the forces acting on the hydrofoil and the flow around it by means of particle image velocimetry (PIV) are performed, to properly characterise the hydrofoil-wave interaction. In an attempt at alleviating the impact of the flow unsteadiness via passive flow control, a bio-inspired tubercle geometry is applied along the hydrofoil leading edge. This geometry is known to delay stall in steady cases but has scarcely been studied in unsteady flow conditions. The vortex structures associated with dynamic stall are identified, and their trajectories, dimension, and strength characterised. This analysis is performed for both straight- and tubercled-leading-edge geometries, with tubercles found to qualitatively modify the flow behaviour during dynamic stall. Contrary to previous studies, direct measurements of lift do not evidence any strong modification by tubercles. Drag-driven horizontal force fluctuations, however, which have not previously been measured in this context, are found to be strongly attenuated. This decrease is quantified, and a physical model based on the flow observations is finally proposed.</description>

      <title>A critical assessment of machine learning in fluid dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fluid dynamics community has increasingly adopted machine learning to analyze, model, predict, and control a wide range of flows. These methods offer powerful computational capabilities for regression, compression, and optimization. In some cases, machine learning has even outperformed traditional approaches. However, many fluid mechanics problems remain beyond the reach of current machine learning techniques. As the field moves from its current state toward a more mature paradigm, this article offers a critical assessment of the key challenges that must be addressed. Tackling these technical issues will not only deepen our understanding of flow physics but also expand the applicability of machine learning beyond fundamental research. We also highlight the importance of community-maintained datasets and open-source code repositories to accelerate progress in this area. Furthermore, the future success of machine learning in fluid dynamics will depend on effective training -- not only for the next generation of researchers but also for established fluid mechanicians adapting to this evolving landscape. Data-driven fluid dynamics is in its critical transitional state over the next few years to shape its future. This perspective article aims to spark discussions and encourage collaborative efforts to advance the integration of machine learning in fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear dynamics of water waves over nonuniformly periodic bottom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By numerical simulation of exact equations of motion (in terms of conformal variables) for planar non-stationary potential flows of an ideal fluid with a free surface over a strongly non-uniform bottom profile, the effect of nonlinear compression of a long wavepacket during its Bragg reflection from domain of gradually increasing, periodically placed barriers has been detected. In this case, a short and tall packet of standing waves with sharp crests is formed, and then it is transformed into the backward wave. It is essential that with variation of frequency of the incident wave, the effect is absent in the middle of the barrier-induced spectral gap, but it is quite prominent closely to the upper edge of the gap, when the forward wave penetrates deeply into the scattering domain and there, together with emerged backward wave, they form a semblance of Bragg soliton for some time interval.</description>

      <title>Wake-induced variations in noise levels and amplitude modulation for two interacting wind turbines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The influence of turbine-turbine interactions on sound propagation is investigated using numerical simulations. Three configurations are examined: turbines aligned downstream of each other, placed side by side, and arranged in a staggered pattern. The simulation framework combines large-eddy simulations for aerodynamic interactions, an aeroacoustic source model to simulate turbine sound emission, and parabolic equation methods for sound propagation. When a second turbine is positioned directly downstream, wake-induced flow focusing enhances sound pressure levels (SPL) and amplitude modulation (AM) by several decibels downwind. In side-by-side and staggered configurations, SPL increases are limited (&lt;2 dBA), and AM is generally reduced due to spatial averaging. Distinct AM patterns emerge in regions where acoustic contributions from both turbines are comparable. For nearly identical rotor speeds, AM is strongly affected by the angular offset between rotors. When rotor speeds differ slightly, beating effects occur, resulting in intermittent AM. These findings highlight the sensitivity of AM to rotor dynamics, a key factor influencing sound perception, with implications for environmental impact and turbine siting.</description>

      <title>The effects of no-slip boundaries and external force torque on two-dimensional turbulence in a square domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study two-dimensional turbulence in a square no-slip domain without bottom drag using direct numerical simulations. The dynamics are shown to depend strongly on the torque $M$ of the external forcing. When $M$ is relatively large, a long-lived coherent vortex forms at the domain center, establishing a persistent angular momentum. At lower torques, the angular momentum undergoes random sign reversals due to spontaneous switching of the central vortex circulation, though it predominantly aligns with the torque direction. We investigate the transition between these regimes by smoothly varying $M$, observing that the time-averaged angular momentum of the system follows $\langle \mathcal{L} \rangle \propto M^{1/3}$. A significant part of the energy dissipates near the domain boundaries, requiring a revision of scaling laws for homogeneous systems. New scaling relations are proposed and they enable velocity profiles in the boundary layers to collapse onto a universal curve for simulations with varying fluid viscosities and forcing amplitudes. The velocity profiles feature a linear viscous sublayer followed by a short logarithmic region. The boundary layer thickness $\delta$ scales with the large-scale Reynolds number $Re$ as $\delta \sim L \cdot Re^{-1/2}$, indicating that the friction at no-slip walls is not sufficient to halt the inverse energy cascade before it reaches the system size $L$. The results highlight how no-slip boundaries and forcing asymmetry govern the dynamics of large-scale coherent structures in confined two-dimensional turbulence.</description>

      <title>Generative Super-Resolution of Turbulent Flows via Stochastic Interpolants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Capturing the intricate multiscale features of turbulent flows remains a fundamental challenge due to the limited resolution of experimental data and the computational cost of high-fidelity simulations. In many practical scenarios only coarse representations of the flows are feasible, leaving crucial fine-scale dynamics unresolved. This study addresses that limitation by leveraging generative models to perform super-resolution of velocity fields and reconstruct the unresolved scales from low-resolution conditionals. In particular, the recently formalized stochastic interpolants are employed to super-resolve a case study of two-dimensional turbulence. Key to our approach is the iterative application of stochastic interpolants over local patches of the flow field, that enables efficient reconstruction without the need to process the full domain simultaneously. The patch-wise strategy is shown to yield physically consistent super-resolved flow snapshots, and key statistical quantities -- such as the kinetic energy spectrum and the spatially averaged dissipation rate -- are accurately recovered. Moreover, compared with full-field reconstruction, the patch-wise approach produces higher-quality super-resolutions, and, in general, stochastic interpolants are observed to outperform contesting generative models across a range of metrics. These results establish stochastic interpolants as a viable tool for super-resolving turbulent flows and highlight their potential for future applications.</description>

      <title>OpenLB-UQ: An Uncertainty Quantification Framework for Incompressible Fluid Flow Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is crucial in computational fluid dynamics to assess the reliability and robustness of simulations, given the uncertainties in input parameters. OpenLB is an open-source lattice Boltzmann method library designed for efficient and extensible simulations of complex fluid dynamics on high-performance computers. In this work, we leverage the efficiency of OpenLB for large-scale flow sampling with a dedicated and integrated UQ module. To this end, we focus on non-intrusive stochastic collocation methods based on generalized polynomial chaos and Monte Carlo sampling. The OpenLB-UQ framework is extensively validated in convergence tests with respect to statistical metrics and sample efficiency using selected benchmark cases, including two-dimensional Taylor--Green vortex flows with up to four-dimensional uncertainty and a flow past a cylinder. Our results confirm the expected convergence rates and show promising scalability, demonstrating robust statistical accuracy as well as computational efficiency. OpenLB-UQ enhances the capability of the OpenLB library, offering researchers a scalable framework for UQ in incompressible fluid flow simulations and beyond.</description>

      <title>Circulation Fluctuations of Elementary Turbulent Vortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thin vortex tubes, with core sizes within the dissipation range, profuse in a homogeneous and isotropic turbulent flow. Their intersections with an arbitrary plane define, as a mathematical construct, a dilute gas of localized, intermittently distributed, two-dimensional vortex spots. While their planar density fluctuations are described by a field-theoretical extension of log-normal single-point statistics, known as Gaussian multiplicative chaos (GMC), they carry circulations which are Gaussian-correlated throughout the inertial range. It is puzzling, then, to find that the circulations of individual vortices are fat-tailed distributed, an apparent paradox that we fix within the GMC framework. The solution, validated through the examination of direct numerical simulation data for a broad range of Reynolds numbers, unveils, as a surprising phenomenological result, an existing coupling between the circulation of vortex structures and the short-distance properties of their spatial distribution fluctuations at sub-Taylor microscales.</description>

      <title>Viscous influences on impulsively generated focused jets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.05239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Impulsively generated focused jets play a significant role in various applications, including inkjet printing, needle-free drug delivery, and microfluidic devices. As the demand for generating jets and droplets from medium to highly viscous liquids increases, understanding the role of viscosity in jetting dynamics becomes crucial. While previous studies have examined the viscous effects on walls, the impact on free surfaces has not been thoroughly understood. This study aims to bridge this gap by integrating experiments with numerical simulations to investigate the viscous effects on focused jet formation. We demonstrate that mass and momentum transfer along the tangential direction of the free surface contribute to focused jet formation, and viscosity plays a key role in this transfer process. The viscosity-induced diffusion of the shear flow and vorticity near the free surface reduces the jet speed. Based on experimental observations and simulation results, we propose an equation to predict the viscous jet velocity. These findings offer new perspectives on viscous interface dynamics in advanced manufacturing and biomedical applications.</description>

      <title>Particulate Reshapes Surface Jet Dynamics Induced by a Cavitation Bubble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Liquid jet formations on water surfaces serve as a cornerstone in diverse scientific disciplines, underpinning processes in climatology, environmental science, and human health issues. Traditional models predominantly focus on pristine conditions, an idealisation that overlooks common environmental irregularities such as the presence of particulate matter on water surfaces. To address this shortfall, our research examines the dynamic interactions between surface particulate matter and cavitation bubbles using floating spheres and spark bubbles. We unveil five novel jet modes, advancing beyond classical models and demonstrating enhanced variability in jet dynamics. We observe that particulates significantly lower the energy threshold for jet formation, showing the enhanced sensitivity of jet dynamics to their presence. The phase diagram and analyses illustrate how the interplay between the dimensionless immersion time of the particulate and the spark bubble's dimensionless depth influences jet mode development, from singular streams to complex cavity forms. These insights not only advance our understanding of jet formation, but also unlock the potential for refined jet manipulation across a broad range of physical, environmental, and medical applications.</description>

      <title>Experimental validation of a linear momentum and bluff-body model for high-blockage cross-flow turbine arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16705v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a confined flow, the performance of a turbine and its near-wake fluid dynamics depend on the blockage ratio, defined as the ratio of the turbine projected area to the channel cross-sectional area. While blockage is understood to increase the power coefficient for turbine "fences" spanning a channel, most investigations at the upper range of practically-achievable blockage ratios have been theoretical or numerical in nature. Furthermore, while linear momentum actuator disk theory is frequently used to model turbines in confined flows, as confinement increases, the ability of this idealized model to describe performance and flow fields has not been established. In this work, the performance and near-wake flow field of a pair of cross-flow turbines are experimentally evaluated at blockage ratios from 30% to 55%. The fluid velocity measured in the bypass region is found to be well-predicted by the open-channel linear momentum model developed by Houlsby et al. (2008), while the wake velocity is not. Additionally, self-similar power and thrust coefficients are identified across this range of blockage ratios when array performance is scaled by the modeled bypass velocity following Whelan et al.'s (2009) adaptation of the bluff-body theory of Maskell (1963). This result demonstrates that, despite multiple non-idealities, relatively simple models can quantitatively describe highly confined turbines. From this, an analytical method for predicting array performance as a function of blockage is presented. Overall, this work illustrates turbine performance at relatively high confinement and demonstrates the suitability of analytical models for predicting and interpreting their hydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Computing sessile droplet shapes on arbitrary surfaces with a new pairwise force smoothed particle hydrodynamics model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of the shape of droplets on surfaces is an important problem in the physics of fluids and has applications in multiple industries, from agrichemical spraying to microfluidic devices. Motivated by these real-world applications, computational predictions for droplet shapes on complex substrates -- rough and chemically heterogeneous surfaces -- are desired. Grid-based discretisations in axisymmetric coordinates form the basis of well-established numerical solution methods in this area, but when the problem is not axisymmetric, the shape of the contact line and the distribution of the contact angle around it are unknown. Recently, particle methods, such as pairwise force smoothed particle hydrodynamics (PF-SPH), have been used to conveniently forego explicit enforcement of the contact angle. The pairwise force model, however, is far from mature, and there is no consensus in the literature on the choice of pairwise force profile. We propose a new pair of polynomial force profiles with a simple motivation and validate the PF-SPH model in both static and dynamic tests. We demonstrate its capabilities by computing droplet shapes on a physically structured surface, a surface with a hydrophilic stripe, and a virtual wheat leaf with both micro-scale roughness and variable wettability. We anticipate that this model can be extended to dynamic scenarios, such as droplet spreading or impaction, in the future.</description>

      <title>Modeling wind farm noise emission and propagation: effects of flow and layout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study demonstrates how wind farm flow physics influence noise generation and downstream propagation through numerical simulations. The flow field is modeled using large-eddy simulations (LES), and the time-averaged output serves as input to acoustic models that predict wind turbine noise. In the first turbine row, turbulence-induced noise (TIN) and trailing edge noise (TEN) contribute equally, with TIN dominating at low frequencies and TEN at higher frequencies. Downstream, TEN decreases due to lower wind speeds, while TIN mostly persists due to increased turbulence dissipation. These effects are more pronounced in aligned wind farms, where stronger wake interactions occur, than in staggered layouts. However, staggered farms produce more noise overall because turbines operate at higher wind speeds.Additionally, wind farm flow significantly affects sound propagation downwind. The wake superposition modifies sound focusing leading to different amplification area than for an isolated turbine. For a staggered layout it particularly shows enhanced sound focusing downwind due to the position of the turbine wakes. This leads to higher sound levels and higher amplitude modulation downwind for the wind farm compared to an aligned layout. These phenomena are not captured by models based on isolated turbines. These findings underscore the importance of integrating flow and acoustic models to more accurately assess the environmental impact of wind farms.</description>
