      <title>Flatten Wisely: How Patch Order Shapes Mamba-Powered Vision for MRI Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision Mamba models promise transformer-level performance at linear computational cost, but their reliance on serializing 2D images into 1D sequences introduces a critical, yet overlooked, design choice: the patch scan order. In medical imaging, where modalities like brain MRI contain strong anatomical priors, this choice is non-trivial. This paper presents the first systematic study of how scan order impacts MRI segmentation. We introduce Multi-Scan 2D (MS2D), a parameter-free module for Mamba-based architectures that facilitates exploring diverse scan paths without additional computational cost. We conduct a large-scale benchmark of 21 scan strategies on three public datasets (BraTS 2020, ISLES 2022, LGG), covering over 70,000 slices. Our analysis shows conclusively that scan order is a statistically significant factor (Friedman test: $\chi^{2}_{20}=43.9, p=0.0016$), with performance varying by as much as 27 Dice points. Spatially contiguous paths -- simple horizontal and vertical rasters -- consistently outperform disjointed diagonal scans. We conclude that scan order is a powerful, cost-free hyperparameter, and provide an evidence-based shortlist of optimal paths to maximize the performance of Mamba models in medical imaging.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nerve segmentation is crucial in medical imaging for precise identification of nerve structures. This study presents an optimized DeepLabV3-based segmentation pipeline that incorporates automated threshold fine-tuning to improve segmentation accuracy. By refining preprocessing steps and implementing parameter optimization, we achieved a Dice Score of 0.78, an IoU of 0.70, and a Pixel Accuracy of 0.95 on ultrasound nerve imaging. The results demonstrate significant improvements over baseline models and highlight the importance of tailored parameter selection in automated nerve detection.</description>

      <title>Domain-randomized deep learning for neuroimage analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized neuroimage analysis by delivering unprecedented speed and accuracy. However, the narrow scope of many training datasets constrains model robustness and generalizability. This challenge is particularly acute in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), where image appearance varies widely across pulse sequences and scanner hardware. A recent domain-randomization strategy addresses the generalization problem by training deep neural networks on synthetic images with randomized intensities and anatomical content. By generating diverse data from anatomical segmentation maps, the approach enables models to accurately process image types unseen during training, without retraining or fine-tuning. It has demonstrated effectiveness across modalities including MRI, computed tomography, positron emission tomography, and optical coherence tomography, as well as beyond neuroimaging in ultrasound, electron and fluorescence microscopy, and X-ray microtomography. This tutorial paper reviews the principles, implementation, and potential of the synthesis-driven training paradigm. It highlights key benefits, such as improved generalization and resistance to overfitting, while discussing trade-offs such as increased computational demands. Finally, the article explores practical considerations for adopting the technique, aiming to accelerate the development of generalizable tools that make deep learning more accessible to domain experts without extensive computational resources or machine learning knowledge.</description>

      <title>BreastSegNet: Multi-label Segmentation of Breast MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Breast MRI provides high-resolution imaging critical for breast cancer screening and preoperative staging. However, existing segmentation methods for breast MRI remain limited in scope, often focusing on only a few anatomical structures, such as fibroglandular tissue or tumors, and do not cover the full range of tissues seen in scans. This narrows their utility for quantitative analysis. In this study, we present BreastSegNet, a multi-label segmentation algorithm for breast MRI that covers nine anatomical labels: fibroglandular tissue (FGT), vessel, muscle, bone, lesion, lymph node, heart, liver, and implant. We manually annotated a large set of 1123 MRI slices capturing these structures with detailed review and correction from an expert radiologist. Additionally, we benchmark nine segmentation models, including U-Net, SwinUNet, UNet++, SAM, MedSAM, and nnU-Net with multiple ResNet-based encoders. Among them, nnU-Net ResEncM achieves the highest average Dice scores of 0.694 across all labels. It performs especially well on heart, liver, muscle, FGT, and bone, with Dice scores exceeding 0.73, and approaching 0.90 for heart and liver. All model code and weights are publicly available, and we plan to release the data at a later date.</description>

      <title>Converting T1-weighted MRI from 3T to 7T quality using deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-high resolution 7 tesla (7T) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides detailed anatomical views, offering better signal-to-noise ratio, resolution and tissue contrast than 3T MRI, though at the cost of accessibility. We present an advanced deep learning model for synthesizing 7T brain MRI from 3T brain MRI. Paired 7T and 3T T1-weighted images were acquired from 172 participants (124 cognitively unimpaired, 48 impaired) from the Swedish BioFINDER-2 study. To synthesize 7T MRI from 3T images, we trained two models: a specialized U-Net, and a U-Net integrated with a generative adversarial network (GAN U-Net). Our models outperformed two additional state-of-the-art 3T-to-7T models in image-based evaluation metrics. Four blinded MRI professionals judged our synthetic 7T images as comparable in detail to real 7T images, and superior in subjective visual quality to 7T images, apparently due to the reduction of artifacts. Importantly, automated segmentations of the amygdalae of synthetic GAN U-Net 7T images were more similar to manually segmented amygdalae (n=20), than automated segmentations from the 3T images that were used to synthesize the 7T images. Finally, synthetic 7T images showed similar performance to real 3T images in downstream prediction of cognitive status using MRI derivatives (n=3,168). In all, we show that synthetic T1-weighted brain images approaching 7T quality can be generated from 3T images, which may improve image quality and segmentation, without compromising performance in downstream tasks. Future directions, possible clinical use cases, and limitations are discussed.</description>

      <title>Software architecture and manual for novel versatile CT image analysis toolbox -- AnatomyArchive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have developed a novel CT image analysis package named AnatomyArchive, built on top of the recent full body segmentation model TotalSegmentator. It provides automatic target volume selection and deselection capabilities according to user-configured anatomies for volumetric upper- and lower-bounds. It has a knowledge graph-based and time efficient tool for anatomy segmentation mask management and medical image database maintenance. AnatomyArchive enables automatic body volume cropping, as well as automatic arm-detection and exclusion, for more precise body composition analysis in both 2D and 3D formats. It provides robust voxel-based radiomic feature extraction, feature visualization, and an integrated toolchain for statistical tests and analysis. A python-based GPU-accelerated nearly photo-realistic segmentation-integrated composite cinematic rendering is also included. We present here its software architecture design, illustrate its workflow and working principle of algorithms as well provide a few examples on how the software can be used to assist development of modern machine learning models. Open-source codes will be released at https://github.com/lxu-medai/AnatomyArchive for only research and educational purposes.</description>

      <title>Blind Super Resolution with Reference Images and Implicit Degradation Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous studies in blind super-resolution (BSR) have primarily concentrated on estimating degradation kernels directly from low-resolution (LR) inputs to enhance super-resolution. However, these degradation kernels, which model the transition from a high-resolution (HR) image to its LR version, should account for not only the degradation process but also the downscaling factor. Applying the same degradation kernel across varying super-resolution scales may be impractical. Our research acknowledges degradation kernels and scaling factors as pivotal elements for the BSR task and introduces a novel strategy that utilizes HR images as references to establish scale-aware degradation kernels. By employing content-irrelevant HR reference images alongside the target LR image, our model adaptively discerns the degradation process. It is then applied to generate additional LR-HR pairs through down-sampling the HR reference images, which are keys to improving the SR performance. Our reference-based training procedure is applicable to proficiently trained blind SR models and zero-shot blind SR methods, consistently outperforming previous methods in both scenarios. This dual consideration of blur kernels and scaling factors, coupled with the use of a reference image, contributes to the effectiveness of our approach in blind super-resolution tasks.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Pathology Foundation Models for Panoptic Segmentation of Melanoma in H&amp;E Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Melanoma is an aggressive form of skin cancer with rapid progression and high metastatic potential. Accurate characterisation of tissue morphology in melanoma is crucial for prognosis and treatment planning. However, manual segmentation of tissue regions from haematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stained whole-slide images (WSIs) is labour-intensive and prone to inter-observer variability, this motivates the need for reliable automated tissue segmentation methods. In this study, we propose a novel deep learning network for the segmentation of five tissue classes in melanoma H&amp;E images. Our approach leverages Virchow2, a pathology foundation model trained on 3.1 million histopathology images as a feature extractor. These features are fused with the original RGB images and subsequently processed by an encoder-decoder segmentation network (Efficient-UNet) to produce accurate segmentation maps. The proposed model achieved first place in the tissue segmentation task of the PUMA Grand Challenge, demonstrating robust performance and generalizability. Our results show the potential and efficacy of incorporating pathology foundation models into segmentation networks to accelerate computational pathology workflows.</description>

      <title>OrthoInsight: Rib Fracture Diagnosis and Report Generation Based on Multi-Modal Large Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing volume of medical imaging data has increased the need for automated diagnostic tools, especially for musculoskeletal injuries like rib fractures, commonly detected via CT scans. Manual interpretation is time-consuming and error-prone. We propose OrthoInsight, a multi-modal deep learning framework for rib fracture diagnosis and report generation. It integrates a YOLOv9 model for fracture detection, a medical knowledge graph for retrieving clinical context, and a fine-tuned LLaVA language model for generating diagnostic reports. OrthoInsight combines visual features from CT images with expert textual data to deliver clinically useful outputs. Evaluated on 28,675 annotated CT images and expert reports, it achieves high performance across Diagnostic Accuracy, Content Completeness, Logical Coherence, and Clinical Guidance Value, with an average score of 4.28, outperforming models like GPT-4 and Claude-3. This study demonstrates the potential of multi-modal learning in transforming medical image analysis and providing effective support for radiologists.</description>

      <title>D2IP: Deep Dynamic Image Prior for 3D Time-sequence Pulmonary Impedance Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised learning methods, such as Deep Image Prior (DIP), have shown great potential in tomographic imaging due to their training-data-free nature and high generalization capability. However, their reliance on numerous network parameter iterations results in high computational costs, limiting their practical application, particularly in complex 3D or time-sequence tomographic imaging tasks. To overcome these challenges, we propose Deep Dynamic Image Prior (D2IP), a novel framework for 3D time-sequence imaging. D2IP introduces three key strategies - Unsupervised Parameter Warm-Start (UPWS), Temporal Parameter Propagation (TPP), and a customized lightweight reconstruction backbone, 3D-FastResUNet - to accelerate convergence, enforce temporal coherence, and improve computational efficiency. Experimental results on both simulated and clinical pulmonary datasets demonstrate that D2IP enables fast and accurate 3D time-sequence Electrical Impedance Tomography (tsEIT) reconstruction. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, D2IP delivers superior image quality, with a 24.8% increase in average MSSIM and an 8.1% reduction in ERR, alongside significantly reduced computational time (7.1x faster), highlighting its promise for clinical dynamic pulmonary imaging.</description>

      <title>UGPL: Uncertainty-Guided Progressive Learning for Evidence-Based Classification in Computed Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate classification of computed tomography (CT) images is essential for diagnosis and treatment planning, but existing methods often struggle with the subtle and spatially diverse nature of pathological features. Current approaches typically process images uniformly, limiting their ability to detect localized abnormalities that require focused analysis. We introduce UGPL, an uncertainty-guided progressive learning framework that performs a global-to-local analysis by first identifying regions of diagnostic ambiguity and then conducting detailed examination of these critical areas. Our approach employs evidential deep learning to quantify predictive uncertainty, guiding the extraction of informative patches through a non-maximum suppression mechanism that maintains spatial diversity. This progressive refinement strategy, combined with an adaptive fusion mechanism, enables UGPL to integrate both contextual information and fine-grained details. Experiments across three CT datasets demonstrate that UGPL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving improvements of 3.29%, 2.46%, and 8.08% in accuracy for kidney abnormality, lung cancer, and COVID-19 detection, respectively. Our analysis shows that the uncertainty-guided component provides substantial benefits, with performance dramatically increasing when the full progressive learning pipeline is implemented.

      <title>A Novel APVD Steganography Technique Incorporating Pseudorandom Pixel Selection for Robust Image Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Steganography is the process of embedding secret information discreetly within a carrier, ensuring secure exchange of confidential data. The Adaptive Pixel Value Differencing (APVD) steganography method, while effective, encounters certain challenges like the "unused blocks" issue. This problem can cause a decrease in security, compromise the embedding capacity, and lead to lower visual quality. This research presents a novel steganographic strategy that integrates APVD with pseudorandom pixel selection to effectively mitigate these issues. The results indicate that the new method outperforms existing techniques in aspects of security, data hiding capacity, and the preservation of image quality. Empirical results reveal that the combination of APVD with pseudorandom pixel selection significantly enhances key image quality metrics such as Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Universal Image Quality Index (UIQ), and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), surpassing other contemporary methods in performance. The newly proposed method is versatile, able to handle a variety of cover and secret images in both color and grayscale, thereby ensuring secure data transmission without compromising the aesthetic quality of the image.</description>

      <title>From Binary to Semantic: Utilizing Large-Scale Binary Occupancy Data for 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate perception of the surrounding environment is essential for safe autonomous driving. 3D occupancy prediction, which estimates detailed 3D structures of roads, buildings, and other objects, is particularly important for vision-centric autonomous driving systems that do not rely on LiDAR sensors. However, in 3D semantic occupancy prediction -- where each voxel is assigned a semantic label -- annotated LiDAR point clouds are required, making data acquisition costly. In contrast, large-scale binary occupancy data, which only indicate occupied or free space without semantic labels, can be collected at a lower cost. Despite their availability, the potential of leveraging such data remains unexplored. In this study, we investigate the utilization of large-scale binary occupancy data from two perspectives: (1) pre-training and (2) learning-based auto-labeling. We propose a novel binary occupancy-based framework that decomposes the prediction process into binary and semantic occupancy modules, enabling effective use of binary occupancy data. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing methods in both pre-training and auto-labeling tasks, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing 3D semantic occupancy prediction.

      <title>Tackling fake images in cybersecurity -- Interpretation of a StyleGAN and lifting its black-box</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In today's digital age, concerns about the dangers of AI-generated images are increasingly common. One powerful tool in this domain is StyleGAN (style-based generative adversarial networks), a generative adversarial network capable of producing highly realistic synthetic faces. To gain a deeper understanding of how such a model operates, this work focuses on analyzing the inner workings of StyleGAN's generator component. Key architectural elements and techniques, such as the Equalized Learning Rate, are explored in detail to shed light on the model's behavior. A StyleGAN model is trained using the PyTorch framework, enabling direct inspection of its learned weights. Through pruning, it is revealed that a significant number of these weights can be removed without drastically affecting the output, leading to reduced computational requirements. Moreover, the role of the latent vector -- which heavily influences the appearance of the generated faces -- is closely examined. Global alterations to this vector primarily affect aspects like color tones, while targeted changes to individual dimensions allow for precise manipulation of specific facial features. This ability to finetune visual traits is not only of academic interest but also highlights a serious ethical concern: the potential misuse of such technology. Malicious actors could exploit this capability to fabricate convincing fake identities, posing significant risks in the context of digital deception and cybercrime.</description>

      <title>A Quantum-assisted Attention U-Net for Building Segmentation over Tunis using Sentinel-1 Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building segmentation in urban areas is essential in fields such as urban planning, disaster response, and population mapping. Yet accurately segmenting buildings in dense urban regions presents challenges due to the large size and high resolution of satellite images. This study investigates the use of a Quanvolutional pre-processing to enhance the capability of the Attention U-Net model in the building segmentation. Specifically, this paper focuses on the urban landscape of Tunis, utilizing Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery. In this work, Quanvolution was used to extract more informative feature maps that capture essential structural details in radar imagery, proving beneficial for accurate building segmentation. Preliminary results indicate that proposed methodology achieves comparable test accuracy to the standard Attention U-Net model while significantly reducing network parameters. This result aligns with findings from previous works, confirming that Quanvolution not only maintains model accuracy but also increases computational efficiency. These promising outcomes highlight the potential of quantum-assisted Deep Learning frameworks for large-scale building segmentation in urban environments.</description>

      <title>Convergent transformations of visual representation in brains and models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental question in cognitive neuroscience is what shapes visual perception: the external world's structure or the brain's internal architecture. Although some perceptual variability can be traced to individual differences, brain responses to naturalistic stimuli evoke similar activity patterns across individuals, suggesting a convergent representational principle. Here, we test if this stimulus-driven convergence follows a common trajectory across people and deep neural networks (DNNs) during its transformation from sensory to high-level internal representations. We introduce a unified framework that traces representational flow by combining inter-subject similarity with alignment to model hierarchies. Applying this framework to three independent fMRI datasets of visual scene perception, we reveal a cortex-wide network, conserved across individuals, organized into two pathways: a medial-ventral stream for scene structure and a lateral-dorsal stream tuned for social and biological content. This functional organization is captured by the hierarchies of vision DNNs but not language models, reinforcing the specificity of the visual-to-semantic transformation. These findings show a convergent computational solution for visual encoding in both human and artificial vision, driven by the structure of the external world.</description>

      <title>Large-Vocabulary Segmentation for Medical Images with Text Prompts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17183v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper aims to build a model that can Segment Anything in 3D medical images, driven by medical terminologies as Text prompts, termed as SAT. Our main contributions are three-fold: (i) We construct the first multimodal knowledge tree on human anatomy, including 6502 anatomical terminologies; Then, we build the largest and most comprehensive segmentation dataset for training, collecting over 22K 3D scans from 72 datasets, across 497 classes, with careful standardization on both image and label space; (ii) We propose to inject medical knowledge into a text encoder via contrastive learning and formulate a large-vocabulary segmentation model that can be prompted by medical terminologies in text form; (iii) We train SAT-Nano (110M parameters) and SAT-Pro (447M parameters). SAT-Pro achieves comparable performance to 72 nnU-Nets -- the strongest specialist models trained on each dataset (over 2.2B parameters combined) -- over 497 categories. Compared with the interactive approach MedSAM, SAT-Pro consistently outperforms across all 7 human body regions with +7.1% average Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) improvement, while showing enhanced scalability and robustness. On 2 external (cross-center) datasets, SAT-Pro achieves higher performance than all baselines (+3.7% average DSC), demonstrating superior generalization ability.</description>

      <title>A Mixture of Experts (MoE) model to improve AI-based computational pathology prediction performance under variable levels of histopathology image blur</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09298v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI-based models for histopathology whole slide image (WSI) analysis are increasingly common, but unsharp or blurred areas within WSI can significantly reduce prediction performance. In this study, we investigated the effect of image blur on deep learning models and introduced a mixture of experts (MoE) strategy that combines predictions from multiple expert models trained on data with varying blur levels. Using H&amp;E-stained WSIs from 2,093 breast cancer patients, we benchmarked performance on grade classification and IHC biomarker prediction with both CNN- (CNN_CLAM and MoE-CNN_CLAM) and Vision Transformer-based (UNI_CLAM and MoE-UNI_CLAM) models. Our results show that baseline models' performance consistently decreased with increasing blur, but expert models trained on blurred tiles and especially our proposed MoE approach substantially improved performance, and outperformed baseline models in a range of simulated scenarios. MoE-CNN_CLAM outperformed the baseline CNN_CLAM under moderate (AUC: 0.868 vs. 0.702) and mixed blur conditions (AUC: 0.890 vs. 0.875). MoE-UNI_CLAM outperformed the baseline UNI_CLAM model in both moderate (AUC: 0.950 vs. 0.928) and mixed blur conditions (AUC: 0.944 vs. 0.931). This MoE method has the potential to enhance the reliability of AI-based pathology models under variable image quality, supporting broader application in both research and clinical settings.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Data Augmentation for Ultrasound Images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data augmentation is a widely used and effective technique to improve the generalization performance of deep neural networks. Yet, despite often facing limited data availability when working with medical images, it is frequently underutilized. This appears to come from a gap in our collective understanding of the efficacy of different augmentation techniques across different tasks and modalities. One modality where this is especially true is ultrasound imaging. This work addresses this gap by analyzing the effectiveness of different augmentation techniques at improving model performance across a wide range of ultrasound image analysis tasks. To achieve this, we introduce a new standardized benchmark of 14 ultrasound image classification and semantic segmentation tasks from 10 different sources and covering 11 body regions. Our results demonstrate that many of the augmentations commonly used for tasks on natural images are also effective on ultrasound images, even more so than augmentations developed specifically for ultrasound images in some cases. We also show that diverse augmentation using TrivialAugment, which is widely used for natural images, is also effective for ultrasound images. Moreover, our proposed methodology represents a structured approach for assessing various data augmentations that can be applied to other contexts and modalities.</description>

      <title>Exposing and Mitigating Calibration Biases and Demographic Unfairness in MLLM Few-Shot In-Context Learning for Medical Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23298v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enormous potential to perform few-shot in-context learning in the context of medical image analysis. However, safe deployment of these models into real-world clinical practice requires an in-depth analysis of the accuracies of their predictions, and their associated calibration errors, particularly across different demographic subgroups. In this work, we present the first investigation into the calibration biases and demographic unfairness of MLLMs' predictions and confidence scores in few-shot in-context learning for medical image classification. We introduce CALIN, an inference-time calibration method designed to mitigate the associated biases. Specifically, CALIN estimates the amount of calibration needed, represented by calibration matrices, using a bi-level procedure: progressing from the population level to the subgroup level prior to inference. It then applies this estimation to calibrate the predicted confidence scores during inference. Experimental results on three medical imaging datasets: PAPILA for fundus image classification, HAM10000 for skin cancer classification, and MIMIC-CXR for chest X-ray classification demonstrate CALIN's effectiveness at ensuring fair confidence calibration in its prediction, while improving its overall prediction accuracies and exhibiting minimum fairness-utility trade-off.

      <title>Inverse Synthetic Aperture Fourier Ptychography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fourier ptychography (FP) is a powerful light-based synthetic aperture imaging technique that allows one to reconstruct a high-resolution, wide field-of-view image by computationally integrating a diverse collection of low-resolution, far-field measurements. Typically, FP measurement diversity is introduced by changing the angle of the illumination or the position of the camera; either approach results in sampling different portions of the target's spatial frequency content, but both approaches introduce substantial costs and complexity to the acquisition process. In this work, we introduce Inverse Synthetic Aperture Fourier Ptychography, a novel approach to FP that foregoes changing the illumination angle or camera position and instead generates measurement diversity through target motion. Critically, we also introduce a novel learning-based method for estimating k-space coordinates from dual plane intensity measurements, thereby enabling synthetic aperture imaging without knowing the rotation of the target. We experimentally validate our method in simulation and on a tabletop optical system.</description>

      <title>SpecMaskFoley: Steering Pretrained Spectral Masked Generative Transformer Toward Synchronized Video-to-audio Synthesis via ControlNet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foley synthesis aims to synthesize high-quality audio that is both semantically and temporally aligned with video frames. Given its broad application in creative industries, the task has gained increasing attention in the research community. To avoid the non-trivial task of training audio generative models from scratch, adapting pretrained audio generative models for video-synchronized foley synthesis presents an attractive direction. ControlNet, a method for adding fine-grained controls to pretrained generative models, has been applied to foley synthesis, but its use has been limited to handcrafted human-readable temporal conditions. In contrast, from-scratch models achieved success by leveraging high-dimensional deep features extracted using pretrained video encoders. We have observed a performance gap between ControlNet-based and from-scratch foley models. To narrow this gap, we propose SpecMaskFoley, a method that steers the pretrained SpecMaskGIT model toward video-synchronized foley synthesis via ControlNet. To unlock the potential of a single ControlNet branch, we resolve the discrepancy between the temporal video features and the time-frequency nature of the pretrained SpecMaskGIT via a frequency-aware temporal feature aligner, eliminating the need for complicated conditioning mechanisms widely used in prior arts. Evaluations on a common foley synthesis benchmark demonstrate that SpecMaskFoley could even outperform strong from-scratch baselines, substantially advancing the development of ControlNet-based foley synthesis models.
