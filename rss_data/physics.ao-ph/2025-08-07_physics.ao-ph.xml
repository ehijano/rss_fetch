      <title>Adiabatic lapse rate estimation using a van der Waals-type equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit a family of temperature-dependent van der Waals-type equations of state (EOS) to improve the estimation of the adiabatic lapse rate in planetary atmospheres. These EOS generalize the classical van der Waals and Berthelot models by introducing a single parameter that modulates the temperature dependence of intermolecular interactions. We analyze their thermodynamic properties, including critical behavior, spinodal and coexistence curves, and entropy. The adiabatic curves are computed by incorporating explicitly the contribution of molecular vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom. Using a generalized expression for the adiabatic lapse rate, we estimate the adiabatic lapse rate in the troposphere of Titan and Venus. Our results show that the van der Waals-type EOS reproduce observed lapse rates more accurately than the van der Waals EOS.</description>

      <title>Physical Scales Matter: The Role of Receptive Fields and Advection in Satellite-Based Thunderstorm Nowcasting with Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The focus of nowcasting development is transitioning from physically motivated advection methods to purely data-driven Machine Learning (ML) approaches. Nevertheless, recent work indicates that incorporating advection into the ML value chain has improved skill for radar-based precipitation nowcasts. However, the generality of this approach and the underlying causes remain unexplored. This study investigates the generality by probing the approach on satellite-based thunderstorm nowcasts for the first time. Resorting to a scale argument, we then put forth an explanation when and why skill improvements can be expected. In essence, advection guarantees that thunderstorm patterns relevant for nowcasting are contained in the receptive field at long forecast times. To test our hypotheses, we train ResU-Nets solving segmentation tasks with lightning observations as ground truth. The input of the Baseline Neural Network (BNN) are short time series of multispectral satellite imagery and lightning observations, whereas the Advection-Informed Neural Network (AINN) additionally receives the Lagrangian persistence nowcast of all input channels at the desired forecast time. Overall, we find only a minor skill improvement of the AINN over the BNN when considering fully averaged scores. However, assessing skill conditioned on forecast time and advection speed, we demonstrate that our scale argument correctly predicts the onset of skill improvement of the AINN over the BNN after 2h forecast time. We confirm that, generally, advection becomes gradually more important with longer forecast times and higher advection speeds. Our work accentuates the importance of considering and incorporating the underlying physical scales when designing ML-based forecasting models.</description>

      <title>Structured dataset of reported cloud seeding activities in the United States (2000-2025) using a large language model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01555v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cloud seeding, a weather modification technique used to increase precipitation, has been employed in the western United States since the 1940s. However, structured datasets are not currently available to analyze these efforts. To address this gap, we present a structured dataset of reported cloud seeding activities in the U.S. from 2000-2025, including the project name, year, season, state, operator, seeding agent, apparatus used for deployment, stated purpose, target area, control area, start date, and end date. Using OpenAI's o3 large language model (LLM), combined with our multi-stage PDF-to-text extraction pipeline, we processed 832 historical reports from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The resulting dataset demonstrates 98.38% estimated accuracy, based on manual review of a random sample of 200 records, and is publicly available on Zenodo. Our results help fill the gap in structured cloud seeding data and demonstrate the potential for LLMs to extract structured environmental data from historical documents. More broadly, this work provides a scalable framework for unlocking historical data from scanned documents across scientific domains.</description>
