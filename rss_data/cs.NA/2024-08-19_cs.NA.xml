      <title>Strong Approximation of Stochastic Semiclassical Schroedinger Equation with Multiplicative Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the stochastic nonlinear Schroedinger equation driven by a multiplicative noise in a semiclassical regime, where the Plank constant is small. In this regime, the solution of the equation exhibits high-frequency oscillations. We design an efficient numerical method combining the spectral Galerkin approximation and the midpoint scheme. This accurately approximates the solution, or at least of the associated physical observables. Furthermore, the strong convergence rate for the proposed scheme is derived, which explicitly depends on the Planck constant. This conclusion implies the semiclassical regime's admissible meshing strategies for obtaining "correct" physical observables.</description>

      <title>Point Source Identification Using Singularity Enriched Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inverse problem of recovering point sources represents an important class of applied inverse problems. However, there is still a lack of neural network-based methods for point source identification, mainly due to the inherent solution singularity. In this work, we develop a novel algorithm to identify point sources, utilizing a neural network combined with a singularity enrichment technique. We employ the fundamental solution and neural networks to represent the singular and regular parts, respectively, and then minimize an empirical loss involving the intensities and locations of the unknown point sources, as well as the parameters of the neural network. Moreover, by combining the conditional stability argument of the inverse problem with the generalization error of the empirical loss, we conduct a rigorous error analysis of the algorithm. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method with several challenging experiments.</description>

      <title>Numerical Computation of High Reynolds Number Cavity Flow Using SPH Method with Stream Function and Vorticity Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When numerically computing high Reynolds number cavity flow, it is known that by formulating the Navier-Stokes equations using the stream function and vorticity as unknown functions, it is possible to reproduce finer flow structures. Although numerical computations applying methods such as the finite difference method are well known, to the best of our knowledge, there are no examples of applying particle-based methods like the SPH method to this problem. Therefore, we applied the SPH method to the Navier-Stokes equations, formulated with the stream function and vorticity as unknown functions, and conducted numerical computations of high Reynolds number cavity flow. The results confirmed the reproduction of small vortices and demonstrated the effectiveness of the scheme using the stream function and vorticity.</description>

      <title>A new decoupled unconditionally stable scheme and its optimal error analysis for the Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a decoupled, first-order, fully discrete, and unconditionally energy stable scheme for the Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes equations. The scheme is divided into two main parts. The first part involves the calculation of the Cahn-Hilliard equations, and the other part is calculating the Navier-Stokes equations subsequently by utilizing the phase field and chemical potential values obtained from the above step. Specifically, the velocity in the Cahn-Hilliard equation is discretized explicitly at the discrete time level, which enables the computation of the Cahn-Hilliard equations is fully decoupled from that of Navier-Stokes equations. Furthermore, the pressure-correction projection method, in conjunction with the scalar auxiliary variable approach not only enables the discrete scheme to satisfy unconditional energy stability, but also allows the convective term in the Navier-Stokes equations to be treated explicitly. We subsequently prove that the time semi-discrete scheme is unconditionally stable and analyze the optimal error estimates for the fully discrete scheme. Finally, several numerical experiments validate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>A new interpretation of the weighted pseudoinverse and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the generalized linear least squares (GLS) problem $\min\|Lx\|_2 \ \mathrm{s.t.} \ \|M(Ax-b)\|_2=\min$. The weighted pseudoinverse $A_{ML}^{\dag}$ is the matrix that maps $b$ to the minimum 2-norm solution of this GLS problem. By introducing a linear operator induced by $\{A, M, L\}$ between two finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, we show that the minimum 2-norm solution of the GLS problem is equivalent to the minimum norm solution of a linear least squares problem involving this linear operator, and $A_{ML}^{\dag}$ can be expressed as the composition of the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of this linear operator and an orthogonal projector. With this new interpretation, we establish the generalized Moore-Penrose equations that completely characterize the weighted pseudoinverse, give a closed-form expression of the weighted pseudoinverse using the generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD), and propose a generalized LSQR (gLSQR) algorithm for iteratively solving the GLS problem. We construct several numerical examples to test the proposed iterative algorithm for solving GLS problems. Our results highlight the close connections between GLS, weighted pseudoinverse, GSVD and gLSQR, providing new tools for both analysis and computations.</description>

      <title>Convergence of a moving window method for the Schr\"odinger equation with potential on $\mathbb{R}^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel framework, called moving window method, for solving the linear Schr\"odinger equation with an external potential in $\mathbb{R}^d$. This method employs a smooth cut-off function to truncate the equation from Cauchy boundary conditions in the whole space to a bounded window of scaled torus, which is itself moving with the solution. This allows for the application of established schemes on this scaled torus to design algorithms for the whole-space problem. Rigorous analysis of the error in approximating the whole-space solution by numerical solutions on a bounded window is established. Additionally, analytical tools for periodic cases are used to rigorously estimate the error of these whole-space algorithms. By integrating the proposed framework with a classical first-order exponential integrator on the scaled torus, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves first-order convergence in time and $\gamma/2$-order convergence in space for initial data in $H^\gamma(\mathbb{R}^d) \cap L^2(\mathbb{R}^d;|x|^{2\gamma} dx)$ with $\gamma \geq 2$. In the case where $\gamma = 1$, the numerical scheme is shown to have half-order convergence under an additional CFL condition. In practice, we can dynamically adjust the window when waves reach its boundary, allowing for continued computation beyond the initial window. Extensive numerical examples are presented to support the theoretical analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Fredholm Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the family of explainable machine-learning, we present Fredholm neural networks (Fredholm NNs), deep neural networks (DNNs) which replicate fixed point iterations for the solution of linear and nonlinear Fredholm Integral Equations (FIE) of the second kind. Applications of FIEs include the solution of ordinary, as well as partial differential equations (ODEs, PDEs) and many more. We first prove that Fredholm NNs provide accurate solutions. We then provide insight into the values of the hyperparameters and trainable/explainable weights and biases of the DNN, by directly connecting their values to the underlying mathematical theory. For our illustrations, we use Fredholm NNs to solve both linear and nonlinear problems, including elliptic PDEs and boundary value problems. We show that the proposed scheme achieves significant numerical approximation accuracy across both the domain and boundary. The proposed methodology provides insight into the connection between neural networks and classical numerical methods, and we posit that it can have applications in fields such as Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). Thus, we believe that it will trigger further advances in the intersection between scientific machine learning and numerical analysis.</description>

      <title>A robust hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin scheme with harmonic averaging technique for steady state of real-world semiconductor devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving real-world nonlinear semiconductor device problems modeled by the drift-diffusion equations coupled with the Poisson equation (also known as the Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations) necessitates an accurate and efficient numerical scheme which can avoid non-physical oscillations even for problems with extremely sharp doping profiles. In this paper, we propose a flexible and high-order hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) scheme with harmonic averaging (HA) technique to tackle these challenges. The proposed HDG-HA scheme combines the robustness of finite volume Scharfetter-Gummel (FVSG) method with the high-order accuracy and $hp$-flexibility offered by the locally conservative HDG scheme. The coupled Poisson equation and two drift-diffusion equations are simultaneously solved by the Newton method. Indicators based on the gradient of net doping $N$ and solution variables are proposed to switch between cells with HA technique and high-order conventional HDG cells, utilizing the flexibility of HDG scheme. Numerical results suggest that the proposed scheme does not exhibit oscillations or convergence issues, even when applied to heavily doped and sharp PN-junctions. Devices with circular junctions and realistic doping profiles are simulated in two dimensions, qualifying this scheme for practical simulation of real-world semiconductor devices.</description>

      <title>Parallel-in-Time Solutions with Random Projection Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers one of the fundamental parallel-in-time methods for the solution of ordinary differential equations, Parareal, and extends it by adopting a neural network as a coarse propagator. We provide a theoretical analysis of the convergence properties of the proposed algorithm and show its effectiveness for several examples, including Lorenz and Burgers' equations. In our numerical simulations, we further specialize the underpinning neural architecture to Random Projection Neural Networks (RPNNs), a 2-layer neural network where the first layer weights are drawn at random rather than optimized. This restriction substantially increases the efficiency of fitting RPNN's weights in comparison to a standard feedforward network without negatively impacting the accuracy, as demonstrated in the SIR system example.</description>

      <title>Equivalent Systems for Differential Equations with Polynomially Distributed Delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider delay differential equations with a polynomially distributed delay. We derive an equivalent system of delay differential equations, which includes just two discrete delays. The stability of the equivalent system and its stationary solutions are investigated. Alternatively, a Gaussian quadrature generates a discretisation of the integral, which describes the distributed delay in the original delay differential equation. This technique yields an approximate differential equation with multiple discrete delays. We present results of numerical computations, where initial value problems of the differential equations are solved. Therein, the two approaches are compared.</description>

      <title>Fast Hermitian Diagonalization with Nearly Optimal Precision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algorithms for numerical tasks in finite precision simultaneously seek to minimize the number of floating point operations performed, and also the number of bits of precision required by each floating point operation. This paper presents an algorithm for Hermitian diagonalization requiring only $\lg(1/\varepsilon)+O(\log(n)+\log\log(1/\varepsilon))$ bits of precision where $n$ is the size of the input matrix and $\varepsilon$ is the target error. Furthermore, it runs in near matrix multiplication time.
  In the general setting, the first complete analysis of the stability of a near matrix multiplication time algorithm for diagonalization is that of Banks et al. [BGVKS20]. They exhibit an algorithm for diagonalizing an arbitrary matrix up to $\varepsilon$ backward error using only $O(\log^4(n/\varepsilon)\log(n))$ bits of precision. This work focuses on the Hermitian setting, where we determine a dramatically improved bound on the number of bits needed. In particular, the result is close to providing a practical bound. The exact bit count depends on the specific implementation of matrix multiplication and QR decomposition one wishes to use, but if one uses suitable $O(n^3)$-time implementations, then for $\varepsilon=10^{-15},n=4000$, we show 92 bits of precision suffice (and 59 are necessary). By comparison, the same parameters in [BGVKS20] does not even show that 682,916,525,000 bits suffice.</description>

      <title>Stabilized Lagrange Multipliers for Dirichlet Boundary Conditions in Divergence Preserving Unfitted Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the divergence preserving cut finite element method presented in [T. Frachon, P. Hansbo, E. Nilsson, S. Zahedi, SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 46 (2024)] for the Darcy interface problem to unfitted outer boundaries. We impose essential boundary conditions on unfitted meshes with a stabilized Lagrange multiplier method. The stabilization term for the Lagrange multiplier is important for stability but it may perturb the approximate solution at the boundary. We study different stabilization terms from cut finite element discretizations of surface partial differential equations and trace finite element methods. To reduce the perturbation we use a Lagrange multiplier space of higher polynomial degree compared to previous work on unfitted discretizations. We propose a symmetric method that results in 1) optimal rates of convergence for the approximate velocity and pressure; 2) well-posed linear systems where the condition number of the system matrix scales as for fitted finite element discretizations; 3) optimal approximation of the divergence with pointwise divergence-free approximations of solenoidal velocity fields. The three properties are proven to hold for the lowest order discretization and numerical experiments indicate that these properties continue to hold also when higher order elements are used.</description>

      <title>On the loss of orthogonality in low-synchronization variants of reorthogonalized block classical Gram-Schmidt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interest in communication-avoiding orthogonalization schemes for high-performance computing has been growing recently. This manuscript addresses open questions about the numerical stability of various block classical Gram-Schmidt variants that have been proposed in the past few years. An abstract framework is employed, the flexibility of which allows for new rigorous bounds on the loss of orthogonality in these variants. We first analyze a generalization of (reorthogonalized) block classical Gram-Schmidt and show that a "strong" intrablock orthogonalization routine is only needed for the very first block in order to maintain orthogonality on the level of the unit roundoff.
  Then, using this variant, which has four synchronization points per block column, we remove the synchronization points one at a time and analyze how each alteration affects the stability of the resulting method. Our analysis shows that the variant requiring only one synchronization per block column cannot be guaranteed to be stable in practice, as stability begins to degrade with the first reduction of synchronization points.
  Our analysis of block methods also provides new theoretical results for the single-column case. In particular, it is proven that DCGS2 from [Bielich, D. et al. Par. Comput. 112 (2022)] and CGS-2 from [\'{S}wirydowicz, K. et al, Num. Lin. Alg. Appl. 28 (2021)] are as stable as Householder QR. Numerical examples from the BlockStab toolbox are included throughout, to help compare variants and illustrate the effects of different choices of intraorthogonalization subroutines.</description>

      <title>A new temperature evolution equation that enforces thermodynamic vapour-liquid equilibrium in multiphase flows -- application to CO2 modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a novel framework for numerically simulating the depressurization of tanks and pipelines containing carbon dioxide (CO2). The framework focuses on efficient solution strategies for the coupled system of fluid flow equations and thermodynamic constraints. A key contribution lies in proposing a new set of equations for phase equilibrium calculations which simplifies the traditional vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) calculations for two-phase CO2 mixtures. The first major novelty resides in the reduction of the conventional four-equation VLE system to a single equation, enabling efficient solution using a non-linear solver. This significantly reduces computational cost compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, a second novelty is introduced by deriving an ordinary differential equation (ODE) directly from the UV-Flash equation. This ODE can be integrated alongside the governing fluid flow equations, offering a computationally efficient approach for simulating depressurization processes.</description>

      <title>Parametric Sensitivity Analysis for Models of Reaction Networks within Interacting Compartments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Models of reaction networks within interacting compartments (RNIC) are a generalization of stochastic reaction networks. It is most natural to think of the interacting compartments as ``cells'' that can appear, degrade, split, and even merge, with each cell containing an evolving copy of the underlying stochastic reaction network. Such models have a number of parameters, including those associated with the internal chemical model and those associated with the compartment interactions, and it is natural to want efficient computational methods for the numerical estimation of sensitivities of model statistics with respect to these parameters. Motivated by the extensive work on computational methods for parametric sensitivity analysis in the context of stochastic reaction networks over the past few decades, we provide a number of methods in the RNIC setting. Provided methods include the (unbiased) Girsanov transformation method (also called the Likelihood Ratio method) and a number of coupling methods for the implementation of finite differences. We provide several numerical examples and conclude that the method associated with the ``Split Coupling'' provides the most efficient algorithm. This finding is in line with the conclusions from the work related to sensitivity analysis of standard stochastic reaction networks. We have made all of the Matlab code used to implement the various methods freely available for download.</description>

      <title>Parameterized Physics-informed Neural Networks for Parameterized PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex physical systems are often described by partial differential equations (PDEs) that depend on parameters such as the Reynolds number in fluid mechanics. In applications such as design optimization or uncertainty quantification, solutions of those PDEs need to be evaluated at numerous points in the parameter space. While physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a new strong competitor as a surrogate, their usage in this scenario remains underexplored due to the inherent need for repetitive and time-consuming training. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a novel extension, parameterized physics-informed neural networks (P$^2$INNs). P$^2$INNs enable modeling the solutions of parameterized PDEs via explicitly encoding a latent representation of PDE parameters. With the extensive empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that P$^2$INNs outperform the baselines both in accuracy and parameter efficiency on benchmark 1D and 2D parameterized PDEs and are also effective in overcoming the known "failure modes".</description>

      <title>A Framework for Approximating Perturbed Optimal Control Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider trajectory optimal control problems in which parameter uncertainty limits the applicability of control trajectories computed prior to travel. Hence, efficient trajectory adjustment is needed to ensure successful travel. However, it is often prohibitive or impossible to recalculate the optimal control in-transit due to strict time constraints or limited onboard computing resources. Thus, we propose a framework for quick and accurate trajectory approximations by using post-optimality sensitivity information. This allows the reduction of uncertain parameter space and an instantaneous approximation of the new optimal controller while using sensitivity data computed and stored pretransit.</description>

      <title>Attention is a smoothed cubic spline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We highlight a perhaps important but hitherto unobserved insight: The attention module in a transformer is a smoothed cubic spline. Viewed in this manner, this mysterious but critical component of a transformer becomes a natural development of an old notion deeply entrenched in classical approximation theory. More precisely, we show that with ReLU-activation, attention, masked attention, encoder-decoder attention are all cubic splines. As every component in a transformer is constructed out of compositions of various attention modules (= cubic splines) and feed forward neural networks (= linear splines), all its components -- encoder, decoder, and encoder-decoder blocks; multilayered encoders and decoders; the transformer itself -- are cubic or higher-order splines. If we assume the Pierce-Birkhoff conjecture, then the converse also holds, i.e., every spline is a ReLU-activated encoder. Since a spline is generally just $C^2$, one way to obtain a smoothed $C^\infty$-version is by replacing ReLU with a smooth activation; and if this activation is chosen to be SoftMax, we recover the original transformer as proposed by Vaswani et al. This insight sheds light on the nature of the transformer by casting it entirely in terms of splines, one of the best known and thoroughly understood objects in applied mathematics.</description>

      <title>Solving stochastic climate-economy models: A deep least-squares Monte Carlo approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic versions of recursive integrated climate-economy assessment models are essential for studying and quantifying policy decisions under uncertainty. However, as the number of stochastic shocks increases, solving these models as dynamic programming problems using deterministic grid methods becomes computationally infeasible, and simulation-based methods are needed. The least-squares Monte Carlo (LSMC) method has become popular for solving optimal stochastic control problems in quantitative finance. In this paper, we extend the application of the LSMC method to stochastic climate-economy models. We exemplify this approach using a stochastic version of the DICE model with all five main uncertainties discussed in the literature. To address the complexity and high dimensionality of these models, we incorporate deep neural network approximations in place of standard regression techniques within the LSMC framework. Our results demonstrate that the deep LSMC method can be used to efficiently derive optimal policies for climate-economy models in the presence of uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Non-isothermal diffuse interface model for phase transition and interface evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive a thermodynamically consistent non-isothermal diffuse interface model for phase transition and interface evolution involving heat transfer. This model is constructed by integrating concepts from classical irreversible thermodynamics with the energetic variational approach. By making specific assumptions about the kinematics of the temperature, we derive a non-isothermal Allen-Cahn equation. Through both asymptotic analysis and numerical simulations, we demonstrate that in the sharp interface limit, the non-isothermal Allen-Cahn equation converges to a two-phase Stefan-like problem, under a certain scaling of the melting/freezing energy. In this regime, the motion of the liquid-solid interface and the temperature interface coincide and are governed by the mean curvature, at least for a short time. The result provides a justification for the classical Stefan problem within a certain physical regime.</description>

Abstract: Using generating functions, we are proposing a unified approach to produce explicit formulas, which count the number of nodes in Smolyak grids based on various univariate quadrature or interpolation rules. Our approach yields, for instance, a new formula for the cardinality of a Smolyak grid, which is based on Chebyshev nodes of the first kind and it allows to recover certain counting-formulas previously found by Bungartz-Griebel, Kaarnioja, M\"uller-Gronbach, Novak-Ritter and Ullrich.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present and analyze a framework for designing symplectic neural networks (SympNets) based on geometric integrators for Hamiltonian differential equations. The SympNets are universal approximators in the space of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms, interpretable and have a non-vanishing gradient property. We also give a representation theory for linear systems, meaning the proposed P-SympNets can exactly parameterize any symplectic map corresponding to quadratic Hamiltonians. Extensive numerical tests demonstrate increased expressiveness and accuracy -- often several orders of magnitude better -- for lower training cost over existing architectures. Lastly, we show how to perform symbolic Hamiltonian regression with SympNets for polynomial systems using backward error analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This survey examines the broad suite of methods and models for combining machine learning with physics knowledge for prediction and forecast, with a focus on partial differential equations. These methods have attracted significant interest due to their potential impact on advancing scientific research and industrial practices by improving predictive models with small- or large-scale datasets and expressive predictive models with useful inductive biases. The survey has two parts. The first considers incorporating physics knowledge on an architectural level through objective functions, structured predictive models, and data augmentation. The second considers data as physics knowledge, which motivates looking at multi-task, meta, and contextual learning as an alternative approach to incorporating physics knowledge in a data-driven fashion. Finally, we also provide an industrial perspective on the application of these methods and a survey of the open-source ecosystem for physics-informed machine learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recently published article by G. Ambrus et al. a new upper bound for the density of an unit avoiding, periodic set is given as $0.2470$, the first upper bound $&lt; 1/4$. A construction of Croft 1967 gave a lower bound $\delta_C = 0.22936$ for the density. To this date, no better construction with a higher lower bound has been given. In this article I give a construction planar sets with a higher density than Croft's tortoises. No explicit value for this density is given, it's just shown that Croft's density is a local minima of the density of a here constructed 1-parameter family of planar sets. So the densities are $&gt; \delta_C$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.00229v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the stability analysis of the perfectly matched layer (PML) in two-space dimensional layered elastic media. Using normal mode analysis we prove that all interface wave modes present at a planar interface of bi-material elastic solids are dissipated by the PML. Our analysis builds upon the ideas presented in [SIAM Journal on Numerical Analysis 52 (2014) 2883-2904] and extends the stability results of boundary waves (such as Rayleigh waves) on a half-plane elastic solid to interface wave modes (such as Stoneley waves) transmitted into the PML at a planar interface separating two half-plane elastic solids. Numerical experiments in two-layer and multi-layer elastic solids corroborate the theoretical analysis, and generalise the results to complex elastic media. Numerical examples using the Marmousi model demonstrates the utility of the PML and our numerical method for seismological applications.</description>

Abstract: Recently, the stochastic asymptotical regularization (SAR) has been developed in (Inverse Problems, 39: 015007, 2023) for the uncertainty quantification of the stable approximate solution of linear ill-posed inverse problems. In this paper, we extend the regularization theory of SAR for nonlinear inverse problems. By combining techniques from classical regularization theory and stochastic analysis, we prove the regularizing properties of SAR with regard to mean-square convergence. The convergence rate results under the canonical sourcewise condition are also studied. Several numerical examples are used to show the accuracy and advantages of SAR: compared with the conventional deterministic regularization approaches for deterministic inverse problems, SAR can quantify the uncertainty in error estimates for ill-posed problems, improved accuracy by selecting the optimal path, escape local minimums for nonlinear problems, and identify of multi-solutions by clustering samples of obtained approximate solutions.</description>

      <title>Balanced Binary Tree Schemes for Computing Zernike Radial Polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.02495v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zernike radial polynomials (ZRP) play a significant role in application areas such as optics design, imaging systems, and image processing systems. Currently, there are two kinds of numerical schemes for computing the ZRP automatically with computer programs: one is based on the definition in which the factorial operations may lead to the overflow problem and the high order derivatives are troublesome, and the other is based on recursion which is either unstable or with high computational complexity. In this paper, our emphasis is focused on exploring the balanced binary tree (BBT) schemes for computing the ZRP: firstly an elegant formulae for computation is established; secondly the recursive and iterative algorithms based-on BBT are proposed; thirdly the computational complexity of the algorithms are analyzed rigorously; finally the performance of BBT schemes by testing the running time is verified and validated. Theoretical analysis shows that the computational complexity of balanced binary tree recursive algorithm (BBRTA) and iterative algorithm are exponential and quadratic respectively, which coincides with the running time test very well. Experiments show that the time consumption is about $1\sim 10$ microseconds with different computation platforms for the balanced binary tree iterative algorithm (BBTIA), which is stable and efficient for real-time applications. In the sense of STEM education, the connection of the BBT and ZRP exhibits the beauty and applications of discrete mathematical structure behind the engineering problem, which is worthy of introducing to the college students, computer programmers and optics engineers.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a novel ridge detection algorithm for time-frequency (TF) analysis, particularly tailored for intricate nonstationary time series encompassing multiple non-sinusoidal oscillatory components. The algorithm is rooted in the distinctive geometric patterns that emerge in the TF domain due to such non-sinusoidal oscillations. We term this method \textit{shape-adaptive mode decomposition-based multiple harmonic ridge detection} (\textsf{SAMD-MHRD}). A swift implementation is available when supplementary information is at hand. We demonstrate the practical utility of \textsf{SAMD-MHRD} through its application to a real-world challenge. We employ it to devise a cutting-edge walking activity detection algorithm, leveraging accelerometer signals from an inertial measurement unit across diverse body locations of a moving subject.</description>

Abstract: Root-zone soil moisture monitoring is essential for sensor-based smart irrigation and agricultural drought prevention. Modeling the spatiotemporal water flow dynamics in porous media such as soil is typically achieved by solving an agro-hydrological model, the most important of which being the Richards equation. In this paper, we present a novel data-driven solution algorithm named the DRW (Data-driven global Random Walk) algorithm, which holistically integrates adaptive linearization scheme, neural networks, and global random walk in a finite volume discretization framework. We discuss the need and benefits of introducing these components to achieve synergistic improvements in solution accuracy and numerical stability. We show that the DRW algorithm can accurately solve $n$-dimensional Richards equation with guaranteed convergence under reasonable assumptions. Through examples, we also demonstrate that the DRW algorithm can better preserve the underlying physics and mass conservation of the Richards equation compared to state-of-the-art solution algorithms and commercial solver.</description>

Abstract: This study analyzes the nonasymptotic convergence behavior of the quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) method with applications to linear elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs) with lognormal coefficients. Building upon the error analysis presented in (Owen, 2006), we derive a nonasymptotic convergence estimate depending on the specific integrands, the input dimensionality, and the finite number of samples used in the QMC quadrature. We discuss the effects of the variance and dimensionality of the input random variable. Then, we apply the QMC method with importance sampling (IS) to approximate deterministic, real-valued, bounded linear functionals that depend on the solution of a linear elliptic PDE with a lognormal diffusivity coefficient in bounded domains of $\mathbb{R}^d$, where the random coefficient is modeled as a stationary Gaussian random field parameterized by the trigonometric and wavelet-type basis. We propose two types of IS distributions, analyze their effects on the QMC convergence rate, and observe the improvements.</description>

      <title>On the convergence of adaptive approximations for stochastic differential equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14201v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study numerical approximations for stochastic differential equations (SDEs) that use adaptive step sizes. In particular, we consider a general setting where decisions to reduce step sizes are allowed to depend on the future trajectory of the underlying Brownian motion. Since these adaptive step sizes may not be previsible, the standard mean squared error analysis cannot be directly applied to show that the numerical method converges to the solution of the SDE. Building upon the pioneering work of Gaines and Lyons, we instead use rough path theory to establish pathwise convergence for a wide class of adaptive numerical methods on general Stratonovich SDEs (with sufficiently smooth vector fields). To our knowledge, this is the first convergence guarantee that applies to standard solvers, such as the Milstein and Heun methods, with non-previsible step sizes. In our analysis, we require the sequence of adaptive step sizes to be nested and the SDE solver to have unbiased "L\'evy area" terms in its Taylor expansion. We conjecture that for adaptive SDE solvers more generally, convergence is still possible provided the method does not introduce "L\'evy area bias". We present a simple example where the step size control can skip over previously considered times, resulting in the numerical method converging to an incorrect limit (i.e. not the Stratonovich SDE). Finally, we conclude with an experiment demonstrating the accuracy of Heun's method and a newly introduced Splitting Path-based Runge-Kutta scheme (SPaRK) when used with adaptive step sizes.</description>

Abstract: A class of (block) rational Krylov subspace based projection method for solving large-scale continuous-time algebraic Riccati equation (CARE) $0 = \mathcal{R}(X) := A^HX + XA + C^HC - XBB^HX$ with a large, sparse $A$ and $B$ and $C$ of full low rank is proposed. The CARE is projected onto a block rational Krylov subspace $\mathcal{K}_j$ spanned by blocks of the form $(A^H - s_kI)^{-1}C^H$ for some shifts $s_k, k = 1, \ldots, j.$ The considered projections do not need to be orthogonal and are built from the matrices appearing in the block rational Arnoldi decomposition associated to $\mathcal{K}_j.$ The resulting projected Riccati equation is solved for the small square Hermitian $Y_j.$ Then the Hermitian low-rank approximation $X_j = Z_jY_jZ_j^H$ to $X$ is set up where the columns of $Z_j$ span $\mathcal{K}_j.$ The residual norm $\|R(X_j )\|_F$ can be computed efficiently via the norm of a readily available $2p \times 2p$ matrix. We suggest to reduce the rank of the approximate solution $X_j$ even further by truncating small eigenvalues from $X_j.$ This truncated approximate solution can be interpreted as the solution of the Riccati residual projected to a subspace of $\mathcal{K}_j.$ This gives us a way to efficiently evaluate the norm of the resulting residual. Numerical examples are presented.</description>

      <title>A Priori Estimation of the Approximation, Optimization and Generalization Errors of Random Neural Networks for Solving Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, neural networks have achieved remarkable progress in various fields and have also drawn much attention in applying them on scientific problems. A line of methods involving neural networks for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), such as Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and the Deep Ritz Method (DRM), has emerged. Although these methods outperform classical numerical methods in certain cases, the optimization problems involving neural networks are typically non-convex and non-smooth, which can result in unsatisfactory solutions for PDEs. In contrast to deterministic neural networks, the hidden weights of random neural networks are sampled from some prior distribution and only the output weights participate in training. This makes training much simpler, but it remains unclear how to select the prior distribution. In this paper, we focus on Barron type functions and approximate them under Sobolev norms by random neural networks with clear prior distribution. In addition to the approximation error, we also derive bounds for the optimization and generalization errors of random neural networks for solving PDEs when the solutions are Barron type functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the strong convergence analysis of parareal algorithms for stochastic Maxwell equations with the damping term driven by additive noise. The proposed parareal algorithms proceed as two-level temporal parallelizable integrators with the stochastic exponential integrator as the coarse propagator and both the exact solution integrator and the stochastic exponential integrator as the fine propagator. It is proved that the convergence order of the proposed algorithms linearly depends on the iteration number. Numerical experiments are performed to illustrate the convergence of the parareal algorithms for different choices of the iteration number and the damping coefficient.</description>

      <title>Regenerative Ulam-von Neumann Algorithm: An Innovative Markov chain Monte Carlo Method for Matrix Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an extension of the classical Ulan-von Neumann Markov chain Monte-Carlo algorithm for the computation of the matrix inverse. The algorithm presented in this paper, termed as \emph{regenerative Ulam-von Neumann algorithm}, utilizes the regenerative structure of classical, non-truncated Neumann series defined by a non-singular matrix and produces an unbiased estimator of the matrix inverse. Furthermore, the accuracy of the proposed algorithm depends on a single parameter that controls the total number of Markov transitions simulated thus avoiding the challenge of balancing between the total number of Markov chain replications and its corresponding length as in the classical Ulam-von Neumann algorithm. To efficiently utilize the Markov chain transition samples in the calculation of the regenerative quantities, the proposed algorithm quantifies automatically the contribution of each Markov transition to all regenerative quantities by a carefully designed updating scheme that utilized three separate matrices containing the current weights, total weights, and regenerative cycle count, respectively. A probabilistic analysis of the performance of the algorithm, including the variance of the estimator, is provided. Finally, numerical experiments verify the qualitative effectiveness of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>Structure-preserving approximations of the Serre-Green-Naghdi equations in standard and hyperbolic form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02665v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop structure-preserving numerical methods for the Serre-Green-Naghdi equations, a model for weakly dispersive free-surface waves. We consider both the classical form, requiring the inversion of a non-linear elliptic operator, and a hyperbolic approximation of the equations, allowing fully explicit time stepping. Systems for both flat and variable topography are studied. Our novel numerical methods conserve both the total water mass and the total energy. In addition, the methods for the original Serre-Green-Naghdi equations conserve the total momentum for flat bathymetry. For variable topography, all the methods proposed are well-balanced for the lake-at-rest state. We provide a theoretical setting allowing us to construct schemes of any kind (finite difference, finite element, discontinuous Galerkin, spectral, etc.) as long as summation-by-parts operators are available in the chosen setting. Energy-stable variants are proposed by adding a consistent high-order artificial viscosity term. The proposed methods are validated through a large set of benchmarks to verify all the theoretical properties. Whenever possible, comparisons with exact, reference numerical, or experimental data are carried out. The impressive advantage of structure preservation, and in particular energy preservation, to resolve accurately dispersive wave propagation on very coarse meshes is demonstrated by several of the tests.</description>

      <title>Local divergence-free velocity interpolation for the immersed boundary method using composite B-splines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces an approach to improve volume conservation in the immersed boundary (IB) method using regularized delta functions derived from composite B-splines. These delta functions employ tensor product kernels using B-splines, whose polynomial degrees vary in normal and tangential directions based on the corresponding velocity component. Our method addresses the long-standing volume conservation issues in the conventional IB method, particularly evident in simulations of pressurized, closed membranes. We demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances volume conservation, rivaling the performance of the non-local Divergence-Free Immersed Boundary (DFIB) method introduced by Bao et al. while maintaining the local nature of the classical IB method. This avoids the computational overhead associated with the DFIB method's construction of an explicit velocity potential which requires additional Poisson solves. Numerical experiments show that sufficiently regular composite B-spline kernels can maintain initial volumes to within machine precision. We analyze the relationship between kernel regularity and the accuracy of force spreading and velocity interpolation operations. Our findings indicate that composite B-splines of at least $C^1$ regularity produce results comparable to the DFIB method in dynamic simulations, with volume conservation errors primarily dominated by the time-stepping scheme's truncation error. This work offers a computationally efficient alternative for improving volume conservation in IB methods, particularly beneficial for large-scale, three-dimensional simulations. The proposed approach requires minimal modifications to an existing IB code, making it an accessible improvement for a wide range of applications in computational fluid dynamics and fluid-structure interaction.</description>

      <title>Graph-based Semi-supervised Local Clustering with Few Labeled Nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.11114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Local clustering aims at extracting a local structure inside a graph without the necessity of knowing the entire graph structure. As the local structure is usually small in size compared to the entire graph, one can think of it as a compressive sensing problem where the indices of target cluster can be thought as a sparse solution to a linear system. In this paper, we apply this idea based on two pioneering works under the same framework and propose a new semi-supervised local clustering approach using only few labeled nodes. Our approach improves the existing works by making the initial cut to be the entire graph and hence overcomes a major limitation of the existing works, which is the low quality of initial cut. Extensive experimental results on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Auto-weighted Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Networks and robust estimations for multitask inverse problems in pore-scale imaging of dissolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we present a novel data assimilation strategy in pore-scale imaging and demonstrate that this makes it possible to robustly address reactive inverse problems incorporating Uncertainty Quantification (UQ). Pore-scale modeling of reactive flow offers a valuable opportunity to investigate the evolution of macro-scale properties subject to dynamic processes. Yet, they suffer from imaging limitations arising from the associated X-ray microtomography (X-ray microCT) process, which induces discrepancies in the properties estimates. Assessment of the kinetic parameters also raises challenges, as reactive coefficients are critical parameters that can cover a wide range of values. We account for these two issues and ensure reliable calibration of pore-scale modeling, based on dynamical microCT images, by integrating uncertainty quantification in the workflow.
  The present method is based on a multitasking formulation of reactive inverse problems combining data-driven and physics-informed techniques in calcite dissolution. This allows quantifying morphological uncertainties on the porosity field and estimating reactive parameter ranges through prescribed PDE models with a latent concentration field and dynamical microCT. The data assimilation strategy relies on sequential reinforcement incorporating successively additional PDE constraints. We guarantee robust and unbiased uncertainty quantification by straightforward adaptive weighting of Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Networks (BPINNs), ensuring reliable micro-porosity changes during geochemical transformations. We demonstrate successful Bayesian Inference in 1D+Time and 2D+Time calcite dissolution based on synthetic microCT images with meaningful posterior distribution on the reactive parameters and dimensionless numbers.</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework to Enforce, Discover, and Promote Symmetry in Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry is present throughout nature and continues to play an increasingly central role in physics and machine learning. Fundamental symmetries, such as Poincar\'{e} invariance, allow physical laws discovered in laboratories on Earth to be extrapolated to the farthest reaches of the universe. Symmetry is essential to achieving this extrapolatory power in machine learning applications. For example, translation invariance in image classification allows models with fewer parameters, such as convolutional neural networks, to be trained on smaller data sets and achieve state-of-the-art performance. In this paper, we provide a unifying theoretical and methodological framework for incorporating symmetry into machine learning models in three ways: 1. enforcing known symmetry when training a model; 2. discovering unknown symmetries of a given model or data set; and 3. promoting symmetry during training by learning a model that breaks symmetries within a user-specified group of candidates when there is sufficient evidence in the data. We show that these tasks can be cast within a common mathematical framework whose central object is the Lie derivative associated with fiber-linear Lie group actions on vector bundles. We extend and unify several existing results by showing that enforcing and discovering symmetry are linear-algebraic tasks that are dual with respect to the bilinear structure of the Lie derivative. We also propose a novel way to promote symmetry by introducing a class of convex regularization functions based on the Lie derivative and nuclear norm relaxation to penalize symmetry breaking during training of machine learning models. We explain how these ideas can be applied to a wide range of machine learning models including basis function regression, dynamical systems discovery, neural networks, and neural operators acting on fields.</description>

      <title>Tractable Optimal Experimental Design using Transport Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07971v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a flexible method for computing Bayesian optimal experimental designs (BOEDs) for inverse problems with intractable posteriors. The approach is applicable to a wide range of BOED problems and can accommodate various optimality criteria, prior distributions and noise models. The key to our approach is the construction of a transport-map-based surrogate to the joint probability law of the design, observational and inference random variables. This order-preserving transport map is constructed using tensor trains and can be used to efficiently sample from (and evaluate approximate densities of) conditional distributions that are required in the evaluation of many commonly-used optimality criteria. The algorithm is also extended to sequential data acquisition problems, where experiments can be performed in sequence to update the state of knowledge about the unknown parameters. The sequential BOED problem is made computationally feasible by preconditioning the approximation of the joint density at the current stage using transport maps constructed at previous stages. The flexibility of our approach in finding optimal designs is illustrated with some numerical examples inspired by disease modeling and the reconstruction of subsurface structures in aquifers.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Potential of Random Equations with Mixture Models: Modeling and Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20152v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to demonstrate the general modeling and practical simulation of approximate solutions of random equations with mixture model parameter random variables. Random equations, understood as stationary (non-dynamical) equations with parameters as random variables, have a long history and a broad range of applications. The specific novelty of this explorative study lies on the demonstration of the combinatorial complexity of these equations with mixture model parameters. In a Bayesian argumentation framework, we derive a likelihood function and posterior density of approximate best fit solutions while avoiding significant restrictions about the type of nonlinearity of the equation or mixture models, and demonstrate their numerically efficient implementation for the applied researcher. In the results section, we are specifically focusing on expressive example simulations showcasing the combinatorial potential of random linear equation systems and nonlinear systems of random conic section equations. Introductory applications to portfolio optimization, stochastic control and random matrix theory are provided in order to show the wide applicability of the presented methodology.</description>
