      <title>Improved analysis of strong-interaction-stable doubly-bottom tetraquarks on the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We update earlier lattice results for the binding energies of the flavor antitriplet of strong-interaction-stable doubly bottom, $J^P=1^+$ tetraquarks, employing an extended sink construction which produces significantly improved ground-state effective-mass plateaus, as well as new, larger-volume ensembles which reduce possible finite-volume effects at lighter pion masses. The updated bindings are $115(17)$ MeV for the $I=0$ member of the antitriplet and $47(8)$ MeV for its $I=1/2$ partner. We also provide an update of our earlier study of the variable heavy mass dependence of binding in the $1^+$ channel and new results on this dependence for binding in the $0^+$ channel, accessible when the two heavy quarks have unequal masses. Implications of these results of potential relevance to experimental searches for signals of the production of doubly bottom tetraquarks and/or a possible bottom-charm partner of the $T_{cc}$ are also discussed.</description>

      <title>High-precision analysis of the critical point in heavy-quark QCD at $N_t=6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binder-cumulant analysis of the critical point in the heavy-quark region of QCD is performed by Monte-Carlo simulations with the hopping-parameter expansion at $N_t=6$. We extend our previous analysis at $N_t=4$ to finer lattices and perform high-precision analyses on large spatial volumes up to the aspect ratio $LT=N_s/N_t=18$. Higher order terms in the hopping-parameter expansion are incorporated effectively up to 14th order. The numerical results show that the violation of the finite-size scaling becomes more prominent on the finer lattice at a given aspect ratio.</description>

      <title>Phase Diagram of the Schwinger Model by Adiabatic Preparation of States on a Quantum Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue the feasibility to study the phase structure of a quantum physical system on quantum devices via adiabatic preparation of states. We introduce a novel method and successfully test it in application to the Schwinger model in the presence of a topological $\theta$-term. We explore the first-order-phase-transition and the no-transition regions of the corresponding phase diagram. The core idea of the method is to separately evolve the ground and the first excited states with a time-dependent Hamiltonian, the time-dependence of which interpolates between different values of $\theta$. Despite our approach being a direct application of the adiabatic theorem, in some cases we are able to demonstrate its advantages in comparison to a different method from the literature that also employs adiabatic state preparation.</description>

      <title>Understanding the approach to thermalization from the eigenspectrum of non-Abelian gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the spectral properties of SU(3) gauge theory with and without dynamical quarks (QCD) at thermal equilibrium using lattice gauge theory techniques. By measuring eigenstates of a massless overlap Dirac operator on the gauge configurations, we provide a gauge invariant method to study spectral properties of non-Abelian gauge theories. Whereas the majority of these eigenstates below the magnetic scale have universal nearest-neighbor level spacing fluctuations consistent with certain class of random matrix theories at temperatures away from the chiral crossover transition in QCD, a few among them start to become prominent just above the crossover forming clusters percolating over the entire volume. By matching the non-perturbative magnetic scales in a high temperature thermal state and a particular non-equilibrium chaotic state of QCD, we provide an estimate of thermalization time $\sim 1.44$ fm/c.</description>

      <title>Strangeness-Correlations on the pseudo-critical line in (2+1)-flavor QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present some lattice QCD results on first ($\chi_1^i$) and second ($\chi_2^i$) cumulants of and correlations ($\chi_{11}^{ij}$) among net baryon-number ($B$), strangeness ($S$) and electric charge ($Q$) along the pseudo-critical line ($T_{pc}(\mu_B)$) in the temperature ($T$)--baryon chemical potential ($\mu_B$) phase diagram of (2+1)-flavor QCD. We point out that violations of the isospin symmetric limit of vanishing electric charge chemical potential are small along the $T_{pc}(\mu_B)$ for the entire range of $\mu_B$ covered in the RHIC beam energy scan. For the strangeness neutral matter produced in heavy-ion collisions this leads to a close relation between $\chi_{11}^{BS}$ and $\chi_{11}^{QS}$. We compare lattice QCD results for $\chi_{11}^{BS}/\chi_2^S$ along the $T_{pc}(\mu_B)$ line with preliminary experimental measurements of $\chi_{11}^{BS}/\chi_2^S$ for collision energies $7.7~{\rm GeV}\le \sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}\le 62.4~{\rm GeV}$. While we find good agreements for $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}\ge 39$~GeV, differences are sizeable at smaller values of $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}$. Moreover, we compare lattice QCD results for the ratio of the strangeness ($\mu_S$) to baryon ($\mu_B$) chemical potentials, which define a strangeness neutral system with fixed electric charge to baryon number density, with experimental results obtained by the STAR collaboration for $\mu_S/\mu_B$ using strange baryon yields on the freeze-out line. Finally, we determine the baryon chemical potential at the freeze-out ($\mu_B^f$) by comparing $\chi_1^B/\chi_2^B$ along the $T_{pc}(\mu_B)$ with the experimentally measured net-proton cumulants $\chi_1^p/\chi_2^p$. We find that $\{\mu_B^f, T_{pc}(\mu_B^f) \}$ are consistent with the freeze-out parameters of the statistical-model fits to experimentally measured hadron yields for $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}} \geq 11.5$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Beyond the instanton gas approach: dominant thimbles approximation for the Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To each complex saddle point of an action, one can attach a Lefschetz thimble on which the imaginary part of the action is constant. Cauchy theorem states that summation over a set of thimbles produces the exact result. This reorganization of the path integral, is an appealing starting point for various approximations: In the realm of auxiliary quantum Monte Carlo methods it provides a framework to alleviate the negative sign problem. Here, we suggest to constrain the integration to the \textit{dominant} thimbles: the thimbles attached to the saddle points with the largest statistical weight. For the Hubbard model, in a formulation where the the Hubbard Stratonovitch field couples to the charge, this provides a \textit{symmetry} consistent approximation to the physics of the Hubbard model: constraining the integration domain does not explicitly break a symmetry. We can test this approach for the Hubbard model at half-filling on a bipartite lattice. The paper builds on the previously developed instanton gas approach, where an exhaustive saddle point approximation was constructed. We present results, showing that the dominant thimbles approximation provides results that are in remarkable agreement with the exact results for various fermionic observables including spin and charge order parameters and single electron spectral functions. We discuss implications of our results for simulations away of half filling.</description>

      <title>Simulating (2+1)D SU(2) Yang-Mills Lattice Gauge Theory at finite density with tensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09396v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We numerically simulate a non-Abelian lattice gauge theory in two spatial dimensions, with tensor networks (TN), up to intermediate sizes (&gt;30 matter sites) well beyond exact diagonalization. We focus on the SU(2) Yang-Mills model in Hamiltonian formulation, with dynamical matter and minimally truncated gauge field (hardcore gluon). Thanks to the TN sign-problem-free approach, we characterize the phase diagram of the model at zero and finite baryon number as a function of the quark bare mass and color charge. At intermediate system sizes, we detect a liquid phase of quark-pair bound-state quasiparticles (baryons), whose mass is finite towards the continuum limit. Interesting phenomena arise at the transition boundary where color-electric and color-magnetic terms are maximally frustrated: For low quark masses, we see traces of potential deconfinement, while for high masses, signatures of a possible topological order.</description>
