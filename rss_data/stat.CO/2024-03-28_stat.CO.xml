      <title>Modifying Gibbs sampling to avoid self transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gibbs sampling repeatedly samples from the conditional distribution of one variable, x_i, given other variables, either choosing i randomly, or updating sequentially using some systematic or random order. When x_i is discrete, a Gibbs sampling update may choose a new value that is the same as the old value. A theorem of Peskun indicates that, when i is chosen randomly, a reversible method that reduces the probability of such self transitions, while increasing the probabilities of transitioning to each of the other values, will decrease the asymptotic variance of estimates. This has inspired two modified Gibbs sampling methods, originally due to Frigessi, et al and to Liu, though these do not always reduce self transitions to the minimum possible. Methods that do reduce the probability of self transitions to the minimum, but do not satisfy the conditions of Peskun's theorem, have also been devised, by Suwa and Todo. I review past methods, and introduce a broader class of reversible methods, based on what I call "antithetic modification", which also reduce asymptotic variance compared to Gibbs sampling, even when not satisfying the conditions of Peskun's theorem. A modification of one method in this class reduces self transitions to the minimum possible, while still always reducing asymptotic variance compared to Gibbs sampling. I introduce another new class of non-reversible methods based on slice sampling that can also minimize self transition probabilities. I provide explicit, efficient implementations of all these methods, and compare their performance in simulations of a 2D Potts model, a Bayesian mixture model, and a belief network with unobserved variables. The non-reversibility produced by sequential updating can be beneficial, but no consistent benefit is seen from the individual updates being done by a non-reversible method.</description>

      <title>Goal-Oriented Bayesian Optimal Experimental Design for Nonlinear Models using Markov Chain Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal experimental design (OED) provides a systematic approach to quantify and maximize the value of experimental data. Under a Bayesian approach, conventional OED maximizes the expected information gain (EIG) on model parameters. However, we are often interested in not the parameters themselves, but predictive quantities of interest (QoIs) that depend on the parameters in a nonlinear manner. We present a computational framework of predictive goal-oriented OED (GO-OED) suitable for nonlinear observation and prediction models, which seeks the experimental design providing the greatest EIG on the QoIs. In particular, we propose a nested Monte Carlo estimator for the QoI EIG, featuring Markov chain Monte Carlo for posterior sampling and kernel density estimation for evaluating the posterior-predictive density and its Kullback-Leibler divergence from the prior-predictive. The GO-OED design is then found by maximizing the EIG over the design space using Bayesian optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the overall nonlinear GO-OED method, and illustrate its differences versus conventional non-GO-OED, through various test problems and an application of sensor placement for source inversion in a convection-diffusion field.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Finite Volume Method for Uncertainty Management in Gas Pipeline Network Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Natural gas consumption by users of pipeline networks is subject to increasing uncertainty that originates from the intermittent nature of electric power loads serviced by gas-fired generators. To enable computationally efficient optimization of gas network flows subject to uncertainty, we develop a finite volume representation of stochastic solutions of hyperbolic partial differential equation (PDE) systems on graph-connected domains with nodal coupling and boundary conditions. The representation is used to express the physical constraints in stochastic optimization problems for gas flow allocation subject to uncertain parameters. The method is based on the stochastic finite volume approach that was recently developed for uncertainty quantification in transient flows represented by hyperbolic PDEs on graphs. In this study, we develop optimization formulations for steady-state gas flow over actuated transport networks subject to probabilistic constraints. In addition to the distributions for the physical solutions, we examine the dual variables that are produced by way of the optimization, and interpret them as price distributions that quantify the financial volatility that arises through demand uncertainty modeled in an optimization-driven gas market mechanism. We demonstrate the computation and distributional analysis using a single-pipe example and a small test network.</description>

      <title>From Two-Dimensional to Three-Dimensional Environment with Q-Learning: Modeling Autonomous Navigation with Reinforcement Learning and no Libraries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have become indispensable tools in artificial intelligence, empowering agents to acquire optimal decision-making policies through interactions with their environment and feedback mechanisms. This study explores the performance of RL agents in both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) environments, aiming to research the dynamics of learning across different spatial dimensions. A key aspect of this investigation is the absence of pre-made libraries for learning, with the algorithm developed exclusively through computational mathematics. The methodological framework centers on RL principles, employing a Q-learning agent class and distinct environment classes tailored to each spatial dimension. The research aims to address the question: How do reinforcement learning agents adapt and perform in environments of varying spatial dimensions, particularly in 2D and 3D settings? Through empirical analysis, the study evaluates agents' learning trajectories and adaptation processes, revealing insights into the efficacy of RL algorithms in navigating complex, multi-dimensional spaces. Reflections on the findings prompt considerations for future research, particularly in understanding the dynamics of learning in higher-dimensional environments.</description>

      <title>skscope: Fast Sparsity-Constrained Optimization in Python</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Applying iterative solvers on sparsity-constrained optimization (SCO) requires tedious mathematical deduction and careful programming/debugging that hinders these solvers' broad impact. In the paper, the library skscope is introduced to overcome such an obstacle. With skscope, users can solve the SCO by just programming the objective function. The convenience of skscope is demonstrated through two examples in the paper, where sparse linear regression and trend filtering are addressed with just four lines of code. More importantly, skscope's efficient implementation allows state-of-the-art solvers to quickly attain the sparse solution regardless of the high dimensionality of parameter space. Numerical experiments reveal the available solvers in skscope can achieve up to 80x speedup on the competing relaxation solutions obtained via the benchmarked convex solver. skscope is published on the Python Package Index (PyPI) and Conda, and its source code is available at: https://github.com/abess-team/skscope.</description>

      <title>Simulating counterfactuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.15328v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Counterfactual inference considers a hypothetical intervention in a parallel world that shares some evidence with the factual world. If the evidence specifies a conditional distribution on a manifold, counterfactuals may be analytically intractable. We present an algorithm for simulating values from a counterfactual distribution where conditions can be set on both discrete and continuous variables. We show that the proposed algorithm can be presented as a particle filter leading to asymptotically valid inference. The algorithm is applied to fairness analysis in credit-scoring.</description>

      <title>Partial Information Decomposition for Continuous Variables based on Shared Exclusions: Analytical Formulation and Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06373v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Describing statistical dependencies is foundational to empirical scientific research. For uncovering intricate and possibly non-linear dependencies between a single target variable and several source variables within a system, a principled and versatile framework can be found in the theory of Partial Information Decomposition (PID). Nevertheless, the majority of existing PID measures are restricted to categorical variables, while many systems of interest in science are continuous. In this paper, we present a novel analytic formulation for continuous redundancy--a generalization of mutual information--drawing inspiration from the concept of shared exclusions in probability space as in the discrete PID definition of $I^\mathrm{sx}_\cap$. Furthermore, we introduce a nearest-neighbor based estimator for continuous PID, and showcase its effectiveness by applying it to a simulated energy management system provided by the Honda Research Institute Europe GmbH. This work bridges the gap between the measure-theoretically postulated existence proofs for a continuous $I^\mathrm{sx}_\cap$ and its practical application to real-world scientific problems.</description>
