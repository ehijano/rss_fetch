      <title>Comment on "Transformation of phase velocity among inertial frames [Wave Motion 50 (2013) 520-524, https://doi.org/10.1063/1.1888051]"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transformation formulas between two inertial frames for the minimum phase velocity and the phase velocity in an arbitrary direction are given. The derived transformation formula for the reciprocal of the phase velocity along the particle's direction of motion is a correction of the formula provided by J.J. Zhang and P.X. Wang in Wave Motion 50 (2013) 520-524.</description>

      <title>Simple methods for converting equations between the SI, Heaviside-Lorentz and Gaussian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: School and undergraduate students are almost always taught the equations of electromagnetism using a set of conventions that are described as the SI. More advanced students are often introduced to different conventions that produce different equations for the same relationships, using either the Gaussian or Heaviside-Lorentz systems. In general, the connection between these equations is not simple. However, if the basis of each system is understood, conversion from SI equations to either Gaussian or Heaviside-Lorentz ones is very straightforward. The reverse processes are less straightforward, but more comprehensible when the fundamental differences are understood. Simple methods for these processes are presented, using a novel application of dimensional analysis, without factors of (square root (epsilon0)) appearing. It is also shown that when different physical quantities are given different symbols, and these are used consistently, the SI can be seen to provide general equations, with the Gaussian and Heaviside-Lorentz ones being simplifications of them. This removes any need for system-independent versions of electromagnetic equations, with additional parameters that take different values in the different systems, which have been proposed in various forms over many decades.</description>

      <title>Aerobars Position Effect: What is the Interaction Between Aerodynamic Drag and Power Production?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extensive research has been dedicated to optimizing the cyclist's position on the bike to enhance aerodynamic performance. This study aims to further investigate the aerobars position effect on cycling speed. Drawing from previous work (Fintelman et al., 2015), a relationship is established between position variations and hip angle, a critical determinant of power output. Based on a 3D scan of an elite athlete on his Time Trial (TT) bike, a digital twin with upper body mobility is created, utilizing inverse kinematics with aerobars as a root. Adjustments to the aerobars position translate into alterations in the cyclist's upper body posture. These changes influence both aerodynamic drag -quantified by Computational Fluid Dynamics method (CFD)- and hip angle -computed by 3D software, directly affecting the athlete's capacity for power generation. The interplay between aerodynamic efficiency and power output is analyzed, with varying parameters such as speed and slope angle considered to ascertain the optimal aerobar position for individual athletes in a specific cycling context. Results show impactful variations in cycling speed as a function of the aerobars position, the latter having a strong influence on aerodynamic drag and theoretical power production.</description>

      <title>Properties of covariant Lyapunov vectors as continuous vector fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.12543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of ``covariant Lyapunov field'', which assigns all the components of covariant Lyapunov vectors at almost all points of the phase space of a dynamical system. We focus on the case in which these fields are overall continuous and also differentiable along individual trajectories. We show that in ergodic systems such fields can be characterized as the global solutions of a differential equation on the phase space. Due to the arbitrariness in the choice of a multiplicative scalar factor for the Lyapunov vector at each point of the phase space, this differential equation presents a gauge invariance that is formally analogous to that of quantum electrodynamics. Under the hypothesis that the covariant Lyapunov field is overall differentiable, we give a geometric interpretation of our result: each 2-dimensional foliation of the space that contains whole trajectories is univocally associated with a Lyapunov exponent and the corresponding covariant Lyapunov field is one of the generators of the foliation.</description>
