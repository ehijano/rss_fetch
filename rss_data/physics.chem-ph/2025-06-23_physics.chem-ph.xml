      <title>Intracluster ion-molecule reaction in quinoline and isoquinoline dimers under the influence of diverse ionizing radiations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work demonstrates the tendency of two model PANH isomers to dimerize under pure ambient evaporative conditions and then undergo complex intracluster ion-molecule reactions to produce rich chemistry. Despite the population of such dimers at room temperature is found to be relatively low, they are found to produce observable effects in typical stellar radiation conditions. It is also demonstrated that various types of energetic radiation (UV radiation at 266 nm, synchrotron VUV radiation and high-energy protons) can induce intracluster ion-molecule reactions in the dimers. The existence of such dimers is confirmed via the analysis of the mass-selected photoelectron spectra of various species observed in the mass spectra. The signal from such processes is enhanced by UV multiphoton ionization/dissociation and is analysed using energy-correlated time-of-flight mass spectrometry. These measurements, together with the dependence on laser intensity, disclose the reaction energetics as well as the hierarchy of the decay of the reaction products. The findings of this work on dimer-driven ion-molecular reactions in quinoline and isoquinoline provide an alternative to the path for molecular growth in the astrochemical environment through cluster dynamics, which is otherwise attributed to dust and ice-driven processes.</description>

      <title>The Phase-Space Way To Electronic Structure Theory and Subsequently Chemical Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase-space electronic structure theory offers up a new and powerful approach for tackling problems with coupled nuclear-electronic dynamics in a fashion that goes beyond Born-Oppenheimer (BO) theory. Whereas BO theory stipulates that we consider electronic states parameterized by nuclear position $X$ only, i.e. molecular orbitals are functions of nuclear positions but not nuclear velocities, phase-space (PS) theory allows for electronic states to be parameterized by both nuclear position X and nuclear momentum $P$. As a result, within a phase-space approach, one can directly recover many new features, including electronic momentum and vibrational circular dichroism spectra. Moreover, phase-space electronic structure theory is exact for the hydrogen atom and, for a set of model problems, the method can even improve upon vibrational energies relative to BO theory. Perhaps most importantly, the phase-space approach offers up a very new perspective on spin physics, stipulating that molecules and materials with degenerate or nearly degenerate ground states (due to spin degeneracy) display broken-symmetry ground states in their phase-space potential energy surfaces. This last feature opens up very new possibilities for exploring spin chemistry (including the Einstein-de Haas effect and chiral induced spin selectivity) within the context of more established electronic structure theory. At the end of the day, in order to tackle electronic dynamical phenomena, especially subtle problems in magnetic chemistry, it will be essential for the electronic structure community to pivot towards diagonalizing $\hat H_{PS}(X, P)$ rather than $\hat H_{BO}(X)$.</description>

      <title>Quantitative agreement between experiment and theory for Vibrational Circular Dichroism enhanced by electronically excited states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intensity enhancement in vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) arises in open-shell transition metal complexes from coupling between low-lying excited states (LLESs) and ground-state vibrational modes. In this work we apply Nafie's vibronic coupling theory to M(II)-(-)-sparteine-Cl$_2$ to investigate these enhancement effects. We show that the VCD intensity is extremely sensitive to the excitation energies that neither time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) nor state-averaged complete active space self consistent field (SA-CASSCF) calculations can predict with sufficient accuracy. We argue that instead of using more accurate quantum chemistry methods these excitation energies can be treated as parameters and optimized against experimental spectra. With this approach we obtain simulated VCD similarity scores above 0.4, a threshold considered reliable for absolute configuration assignment.</description>

      <title>Extension of the CC($P$;$Q$) Formalism to the Electron Attachment and Ionization Potential Equation-of-Motion Coupled-Cluster Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We combine the electron attachment (EA) and ionization potential (IP) equation-of-motion (EOM) coupled-cluster (CC) approaches with the CC($P$;$Q$) formalism. The resulting methodologies are used to describe the electronic states of several open-shell molecules, with the goal of approximating high-level EA/IP-EOMCC energetics corresponding to a full treatment of 3-particle-2-hole (3$p$-2$h$) and 3-hole-2-particle (3$h$-2$p$) excitations on top of CC with singles and doubles (CCSD). We show that the active-orbital-based EA/IP-EOMCC CC($P$;$Q$) approaches, abbreviated as EA/IP-CC(t;3), achieve sub-millihartree accuracies relative to the parent EA-EOMCCSD(3$p$-2$h$)/IP-EOMCCSD(3$h$-2$p$) data using reduced computational effort, while improving upon their completely renormalized EA/IP-CR-EOMCC(2,3) counterparts.</description>

      <title>Exact static linear response of excited states from ensemble density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following a recent work [E. Fromager, J. Phys. Chem. A 2025, 129, 4, 1143-1155] on the ensemble density functional theory (DFT) of excited electronic energy levels, we derive in this paper the ensuing static linear response theory, thus allowing for an in-principle exact evaluation of excited-state density-density linear response functions in a completely frequency-independent setting. Once individual-state components of the inverse ensemble linear response function have been introduced, a working Dyson-type equation naturally emerges for each state, individually. By considering the zero-weight limit of the theory, which infinitesimally deviates from standard Kohn--Sham DFT, exact excited-state corrections to ground-state linear response DFT can be identified. They involve the first-order weight derivatives of the ensemble Hartree-exchange-correlation (Hxc) potential and kernel, thus confirming the importance in ensemble DFT of both weight and density-functional derivatives of the ensemble Hxc energy functional.</description>

      <title>Critical point search and linear response theory for computing electronic excitation energies of molecular systems. Part I: General framework, application to Hartree-Fock and DFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing excited states of many-body quantum Hamiltonians is a fundamental challenge in computational physics and chemistry, with state-of-the-art methods broadly classified into variational (critical point search) and linear response approaches. This article introduces a unified framework based on the K\"ahler manifold formalism, which naturally accommodates both strategies for a wide range of variational models, including Hartree-Fock, CASSCF, Full CI, and adiabatic TDDFT. In particular, this formalism leads to a systematic and straightforward way to obtain the final equations of linear response theory for nonlinear models, which provides, in the case of mean-field models (Hartree-Fock and DFT), a simple alternative to Casida's derivation. We detail the mathematical structure of Hamiltonian dynamics on K\"ahler manifolds, establish connections to standard quantum chemistry equations, and provide theoretical and numerical comparisons of excitation energy computation schemes at the Hartree-Fock level.</description>

      <title>Defects at Play: Shaping the Photophysics and Photochemistry of Ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanisms by which light interacts with ice and the impact of photo-induced reactions are central to our understanding of environmental, atmospheric and astrophysical processes. However, a microscopic description of the photoproducts originating from UV absorption and emission processes has remained elusive. Here we explore the photochemistry of ice using time-dependent hybrid density functional theory on various models of pristine and defective ice Ih. Our investigation of the excited state potential energy surface of the crystal shows that UV absorption can lead to the formation of hydronium ions, hydroxyl radicals and excess electrons. One of the dominant mechanisms of decay from the excited to the ground-state involves the recombination of the electron with the hydroxyl radical yielding hydronium-hydroxide ion-pairs. We find that the details of this charge recombination process, sensitively depends on the presence of defects in the lattice such as, vacancies and pre-existing photoproducts. We also observe the formation of Bjerrum defects following UV absorption and suggest that, together with hydroxide anions, they are likely responsible for prominent features experimentally detected in long UV exposure absorption spectra, remarkably red-shifted relative to short exposure spectra. Our results highlight the key role of defects in determining the onset of absorption and emission processes in ice.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Correlated Wave Function Calculations with Hierarchical Matrix Compression of the Two-Electron Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leveraging matrix sparsity has proven a fruitful strategy for accelerating quantum chemical calculations. Here we present the hierarchical SOS-MP2 algorithm, which uses hierarchical matrix ($\mathcal{H}^{2}$) compression of the electron repulsion integral (ERI) tensor to reduce both time and space complexity. This approach is based on the atomic orbital Laplace transform MP2 calculations, leveraging the data sparsity of the ERI tensor and the element-wise sparsity of the energy-weighted density matrices. The $\mathcal{H}^{2}$ representation approximates the ERI tensor in a block low-rank form, taking advantage of the inherent low-rank nature of the repulsion integrals between distant sets of atoms. The resulting algorithm enables the calculation of the Coulomb-like term of the MP2 energy with a theoretical time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N^{2}\log N)$ and a space complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N^{2}\log N)$, where $N$ denotes the number of basis functions. Numerical tests show asymptotic time and space complexities better than $\mathcal{O}(N^{2})$ for both linear alkanes and three-dimensional water clusters.</description>

      <title>Aufbau suppressed coupled cluster as a post-linear-response method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the ability of Aufbau suppressed coupled cluster theory to act as a post-linear-response correction to widely used linear response methods for electronically excited states. We find that the theory is highly resilient to shortcomings in the underlying linear response method, with final results from less accurate starting points nearly as good as those from the best starting points. This pattern is especially stark in charge transfer states, where the approach converts starting points with multi-eV errors into post-linear-response results with errors on the order of 0.1 eV. These findings highlight the ability of Aufbau suppressed coupled cluster to perform its own orbital relaxations and raise the question of whether initializing it with an orbital relaxed reference is worth the trouble.</description>

      <title>Electrochemistry-Enhanced Dynamic Paths Sampling Unveiling Nuclear Quantum Effects in Electrocatalysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proton-coupled electron transfers (PCET) are elementary steps in electrocatalysis. However, accurate calculations of PCET rates remain challenging, especially considering nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) under a constant potential condition. Statistical sampling of reaction paths is an ideal approach for rate calculations, however, is always limited by the rare-event issue. Here we develop an electrochemistry-driven quantum dynamics approach enabling realistic enhanced paths sampling under constant potentials without a priori defined reaction coordinates. We apply the method in modeling the Volmer step of the hydrogen evolution reaction, and demonstrate that the NQEs exhibit more than one order of magnitude impact on the computed rate constant, indicating an essential role of NQEs in electrochemistry.</description>

      <title>A reduced cost equation of motion coupled cluster method for excited states based on state-specific natural orbitals: Theory, Implementation, Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a reduced-cost equation-of-motion coupled-cluster method for excited states, built on a new state-specific frozen natural orbital (SS-FNO) framework. This approach enables systematic and controllable truncation of the virtual spaces, significantly reducing computational demands while maintaining high accuracy. The method allows black-box application via two adjustable thresholds and includes a perturbative correction that compensates for truncation errors. We have tested the performance of both CIS(D) and ADC(2) methods in generating appropriate natural orbitals for excited states. Benchmarking on valence, Rydberg, and charge-transfer excited states demonstrates excellent agreement with canonical EE-EOM-CCSD results, with mean absolute deviations typically below 0.02 eV when ADC(2) natural orbitals with perturbative corrections are applied.</description>

      <title>Coupled cluster method tailored by quantum selected configuration interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the quantum-selected configuration interaction-tailored coupled-cluster (QSCI-TCC) method, a hybrid quantum-classical scheme that tailors coupled-cluster (CC) theory with a quantum-selected configuration interaction (QSCI) wave function. QSCI provides a scalable, shot-efficient approach to reconstructing the many-electron state prepared on quantum hardware on a classical computer. The resulting active-space CI coefficients, which are free from additive shot noise, are mapped to fixed cluster amplitudes within the tailored coupled-cluster framework, after which a conventional CC calculation optimizes the remaining amplitudes. This workflow embeds static (strong) correlation from the quantum device and subsequently recovers dynamical (weak) correlation, yielding a balanced description of both. The method is classically simulated and applied to the simultaneous O-H bond dissociation in H$_2$O and the triple-bond dissociation in N$_2$. QSCI-TCC and its perturbative-triples variant, QSCI-TCC(T), provide accurate results even where CCSD or CCSD(T) begin to break down. Shot-count tests for the N$_2$ (6e, 6o) active space demonstrate that, with the (c) correction, chemically sufficient precision ($\leq 1$ kcal/mol) is achieved with only $1.0 \times 10^5$ shots in the strongly correlated regime ($r=2.2$ \r{A}) -- an order of magnitude fewer than required by an earlier matchgate-shadows implementation [J. Chem. Theory Comput., 20, 5068 (2024)]. By pairing resource-efficient quantum sampling with the CC theory, QSCI-TCC provides a promising pathway to quantum-chemical calculations of classically intractable systems.</description>

      <title>Rotational Excitation of Vinyl Cyanide by Collisions with Helium Atoms at Low Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Among the numerous molecular systems found in the interstellar medium (ISM), vinyl cyanide is the first identified olephinic nitrile. While it has been observed in various sources, its detection in Sgr B2 is notable as the 2$_{11}$-2$_{12}$ rotational transition exhibits maser features. This indicates that local thermodynamic equilibrium conditions are not fulfilled, and an accurate estimation of the molecular abundance in such conditions involves solving the statistical equilibrium equations taking into account the competition between the radiative and collisional processes. This in turn requires the knowledge of rotational excitation data for collisions with the most abundant species - He or H$_2$. In this paper the first three-dimensional CH$_2$CHCN - He potential energy surface is computed using explicitly correlated coupled-cluster theory [(CCSD(T)-F12] with a combination of two basis sets. Scattering calculations of the rotational (de-)excitation of CH$_2$CHCN induced by He atoms are performed with the quantum-mechanical close-coupling method in the low-energy regime. Rotational state-to-state cross sections derived from these calculations are used to compute the corresponding rate coefficients. The interaction potential exhibits a high anisotropy, with a global minimum of $-53.5$ cm$^{-1}$ and multiple local minima. Collisional cross sections are calculated for total energies up to 100 cm$^{-1}$. By thermally averaging the cross-sections, collisional rate coefficients are determined for temperatures up to 20 K. A propensity favouring the transitions with $\Delta k_a=0$ is observed.</description>

      <title>Rotationally inelastic scattering of cyanocyclopentadiene by helium atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the interstellar medium (ISM), polycylic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are believed to be an important carbon reservoir, accounting for up to a quarter of all interstellar carbon in our galaxy. This makes the investigation of their potential formation precursors highly relevant in the context of ISM chemistry. This, in turn, includes knowing the abundance of the precursor species. One of the possible precursor molecules for PAHs is the recently detected cyanocyclopentadiene, c-C$_5$H$_5$CN. Given the physical conditions of the dense dark molecular cloud TMC-1 where the cyclic species was detected, it is crucial to consider that local thermodynamic equilibrium conditions may not be satisfied. In such case an accurate estimation of the molecular abundance involves taking into account the competition between the radiative and collisional processes, which requires the knowledge of rotational excitation data for collisions with the most abundant interstellar species - He or H$_2$. In this paper the first potential energy surface (PES) for the interaction of the most stable isomer of cyanocyclopentadiene (1-cyano-1,3-cyclopentadiene) with He atoms is computed using the explicitly correlated coupled-cluster theory [CCSD(T)-F12]. The obtained PES demonstrates a high anisotropy and is characterized by a global potential well of -101.8 cm$^{-1}$. Scattering calculations of the rotational (de-)excitation of 1-cyano-cyclopentadiene induced by He atoms are performed with the quantum mechanical close-coupling method for total energies up to 125 cm$^{-1}$. The resulting rotational state-to-state cross sections are used to compute the corresponding rate coefficients for temperatures up to 20 K. A propensity favoring the transitions with $\Delta k_a=0$ is observed.</description>

      <title>Descriptor-based Foundation Models for Molecular Property Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast and accurate prediction of molecular properties with machine learning is pivotal to scientific advancements across myriad domains. Foundation models in particular have proven especially effective, enabling accurate training on small, real-world datasets. This study introduces CheMeleon, a novel molecular foundation model pre-trained on deterministic molecular descriptors from the Mordred package, leveraging a Directed Message-Passing Neural Network to predict these descriptors in a noise-free setting. Unlike conventional approaches relying on noisy experimental data or biased quantum mechanical simulations, CheMeleon uses low-noise molecular descriptors to learn rich molecular representations. Evaluated on 58 benchmark datasets from Polaris and MoleculeACE, CheMeleon achieves a win rate of 79% on Polaris tasks, outperforming baselines like Random Forest (46%), fastprop (39%), and Chemprop (36%), and a 97% win rate on MoleculeACE assays, surpassing Random Forest (63%) and other foundation models. However, it struggles to distinguish activity cliffs like many of the tested models. The t-SNE projection of CheMeleon's learned representations demonstrates effective separation of chemical series, highlighting its ability to capture structural nuances. These results underscore the potential of descriptor-based pre-training for scalable and effective molecular property prediction, opening avenues for further exploration of descriptor sets and unlabeled datasets.</description>

      <title>On the action for a charged particle moving in a magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Application of the Bohr-Wilson-Sommerfeld quantization condition to a charged particle in a uniform magnetic field requires knowledge of the canonical momentum of such a particle, which in turn requires students to know about the vector potential. The canonical momentum in this situation is conventionally obtained by introducing an appropriate additional term involving the corresponding vector potential in the Lagrangian. In this work, we take a different approach to this problem by analyzing it with Maupertuis principle of least action. We show that satisfying this principle for a charged particle moving in a uniform magnetic field requires that a term proportional to the flux passing through the area enclosed by the trajectory of the particle be included in its action. This additional term accomplishes two tasks. First, it facilitates applying the Bohr-Wilson-Sommerfeld quantum condition for a charged particle moving in a uniform magnetic field without using the Lagrangian approach, and, secondly, it gives the appropriate canonical momentum and Lagrangian for a charged particle in a general electromagnetic field in a straightforward manner.</description>

      <title>The nanoscale molecular chemistry of outer solar system organic matter in asteroid Ryugu</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The analysis of biorelevant molecules in returned mission samples such as from the carbonaceous asteroid (162173) Ryugu is key to unravelling the role of extraterrestrial organics in the evolution of life. Coordinated analyses using minimally destructive techniques at the finest length-scales on pristine samples are particularly important. Here, we identify the chemical signature of unique globular and nitrogen-containing diffuse organic matter in asteroid Ryugu and map the distribution of these biorelevant molecules with unprecedented detail. Using a novel electron-microscopy-based combination of vibrational and core-level spectroscopy, we disentangle the chemistry and nanoscale petrography of these organics. We show that some of these organics contain soluble and highly aliphatic components as well as NHx functional groups, that must have formed in outer solar nebula environments before parent body incorporation. These novel coordinated analyses will open up new avenues of research on these types of precious and rare asteroidal dust samples.</description>

      <title>A many-body characterization of the fundamental gap in monolayer CrI$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The many-body fixed-node and fixed-phase spin-orbit Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) methods are applied to accurately predict the fundamental gap of monolayer CrI$_3$ - the first experimentally-realized 2D material with intrinsic magnetism. The fundamental gap obtained, 2.9(1)~eV, agrees well with the highest peak in optical spectroscopy measurements and a previous $GW$ result. We numerically show that as expected in DMC the same value of the fundamental gap is obtained in the thermodynamic limit using both neutral promotions and the standard quasiparticle definition of the gap based on the ionization potential and electron affinity. Additional analysis of the differences between density matrices formed in different bases using configuration interaction calculations explains why a single-reference trial wave function can produce an accurate excitation. We find that accounting for electron correlation is more crucial than accounting for spin-orbit effects in determining the fundamental gap. These results highlight how DMC can be used to benchmark 2D material physics and emphasize the importance of using beyond-DFT methods for studying 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Consistent Sampling and Simulation: Molecular Dynamics with Energy-Based Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have recently gained significant attention due to their effectiveness in various scientific domains, including biochemistry. When trained on equilibrium molecular distributions, diffusion models provide both: a generative procedure to sample equilibrium conformations and associated forces derived from the model's scores. However, using the forces for coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations uncovers inconsistencies in the samples generated via classical diffusion inference and simulation, despite both originating from the same model. Particularly at the small diffusion timesteps required for simulations, diffusion models fail to satisfy the Fokker-Planck equation, which governs how the score should evolve over time. We interpret this deviation as an indication of the observed inconsistencies and propose an energy-based diffusion model with a Fokker-Planck-derived regularization term enforcing consistency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on toy systems, alanine dipeptide, and introduce a state-of-the-art transferable Boltzmann emulator for dipeptides that supports simulation and demonstrates enhanced consistency and efficient sampling.</description>

      <title>Critical Limitations in Quantum-Selected Configuration Interaction Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07231v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Selected Configuration Interaction (QSCI) methods (also known as Sample-based Quantum Diagonalization, SQD) have emerged as promising near-term approaches to solving the electronic Schr{\"o}dinger equation with quantum computers. In this work, we perform numerical analysis to show that QSCI methods face critical limitations that severely hinder their practical applicability in chemistry. Using the nitrogen molecule and the iron-sulfur cluster [2Fe-2S] as examples, we demonstrate that while QSCI can, in principle, yield high-quality configuration interaction (CI) expansions similar to classical SCI heuristics in some cases, the method struggles with inefficiencies in finding new determinants as sampling repeatedly selects already seen configurations. This inefficiency becomes especially pronounced when targeting high-accuracy results or sampling from an approximate ansatz. In cases where the sampling problem is not present, the resulting CI expansions are less compact than those generated from classical heuristics, rendering QSCI an overall more expensive method. Our findings suggest a significant drawback in QSCI methods when sampling from the ground-state distribution as the inescapable trade-off between finding sufficiently many determinants and generating compact, accurate CI expansions. This ultimately hinders utility in quantum chemistry applications, as QSCI falls behind more efficient classical counterparts.</description>

      <title>Towards Using Matrix-Free Tensor Decompositions to Systematically Improve Approximate Tensor-Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a novel approach to approximate tensor-network contraction via the exact, matrix-free decomposition of full tensor-networks. We study this method as a means to eliminate the propagation of error in the approximation of tensor-networks. Importantly, this decomposition-based approach is generic, i.e. it does not depend on a specific tensor-network, the tensor index (physical) ordering, or the choice of tensor decomposition. Careful consideration should be made to determine the best decomposition strategy. Furthermore, this method does not rely on robust cancellation of errors (i.e. the Taylor expansion). As a means to study the effectiveness of the approach, we replace the exact contraction of the particle particle ladder (PPL) tensor diagram in the popular coupled-cluster with single and double excitation (CCSD) method with a low-rank tensor decomposition, namely the canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD). With this approach, we replace an $\mathcal{O}(N^6)$ tensor contractions with a potentially reduced-scaling $\mathcal{O}(N^4R)$ optimization problem, where $R$ is the CP rank, and we reduce the computational storage of the PPL tensor from $\mathcal{O}(N^4)$ to $\mathcal{O}(NR)$, although we do not take advantage of this compression in this study. To minimize the cost of the CPD optimization, we utilize the iterative structure of CCSD to efficiently initialize the CPD optimization. We show that accurate chemically-relevant energy values can be computed with an error of less than 1 kcal/mol using a relatively low CP rank.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium origin of cavity-induced resonant modifications of chemical reactivities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the influence of light-matter coupling on reaction dynamics and equilibrium properties of a single molecule inside an optical cavity. The reactive molecule is modeled using a triple-well potential, allowing two competing reaction pathways that yield distinct products. Dynamical and equilibrium simulations are performed using the numerically exact hierarchical equations of motion approach in real- and imaginary-time formulations, respectively, both implemented with tree tensor network decomposition schemes. We consider two illustrative cases: one dominated by slow kinetics and another by ultrafast processes. Our results demonstrate that in both scenarios, the rates of ground-state reaction pathways can be selectively enhanced when the cavity frequency is tuned in resonance with the relevant vibrational transition, which directly leads to the formation of the corresponding product. In addition, due to the anharmonicity of chemical reactions, cavity-induced vibrational transitions within the reactant region can also influence reaction rates even when they do not directly result in product formation. However, we found that the equilibrium populations remain unchanged when the molecule is moved into the cavity, regardless of the cavity frequency. Thus, our proof-of-concept study highlights that cavity-induced modifications of chemical reactivities in resonant conditions arise from dynamical and non-equilibrium interactions between the cavity mode and molecular vibrations, rather than from the significant changes in equilibrium properties.</description>

      <title>Generative design of functional organic molecules for terahertz radiation detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Plasmonic nanocavities are molecule-nanoparticle junctions that offer a promising approach to upconvert terahertz radiation into visible or near-infrared light, enabling nanoscale detection at room temperature. However, the identification of molecules with strong terahertz-to-visible frequency upconversion efficiency is limited by the availability of suitable compounds in commercial databases. Here, we employ the generative autoregressive deep neural network, G-SchNet, to perform property-driven design of novel monothiolated molecules tailored for terahertz radiation detection. To design functional organic molecules, we iteratively bias G-SchNet to drive molecular generation towards highly active and synthesizable molecules based on machine learning-based property predictors, including molecular fingerprints and state-of-the-art neural networks. We study the reliability of these property predictors for generated molecules and analyze the chemical space and properties of generated molecules to identify trends in activity. Finally, we filter generated molecules and plan retrosynthetic routes from commercially available reactants to identify promising novel compounds and their most active vibrational modes in terahertz-to-visible upconversion.</description>

      <title>Conformally-coated Nickel-Carbon Nitride on Structured Pyrolytic Carbon Electrodes for Enhanced Hydrogen Evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a three-dimensional electrode for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), tackling challenges in corrosion resistance, catalytic activity, and durability. The electrode features a rod-connected diamond structure made of pyrolytic carbon (PyC), with sequential Ni and CN conformal coatings, resulting in an increase of its electrochemical active surface area more than 80 times their geometric surface area, marking the first application of CN/Ni/RCD-PyC electrodes for HER. The CN layer enhances corrosion resistance under acidic and alkaline conditions, while synergizing with Ni boosts catalytic activity. We demonstrate that the CN/Ni/RCD-PyC electrode exhibited superior HER activity, achieving lower overpotentials of 0.6 V and 0.4 V for a current density of $\mathrm{10~mA\cdot cm^{-2}}$ in acidic and alkaline media, respectively. The electrode demonstrates excellent durability with performance over 2000 cycles of cyclic voltammetry at high scan rates with no significant decay. Therefore, this electrode offers a scalable, cost-effective solution for sustainable hydrogen production.</description>

      <title>Accurate Chemistry Collection: Coupled cluster atomization energies for broad chemical space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate thermochemical data with sub-chemical accuracy (i.e., within $\pm$1 kcal mol$^{-1}$ from sufficiently accurate experimental or theoretical reference data) is essential for the development and improvement of computational chemistry methods. Challenging thermochemical properties such as heats of formation and total atomization energies (TAEs) are of particular interest because they rigorously test the ability of computational chemistry methods to accurately describe complex chemical transformations involving multiple bond rearrangements. Yet, existing thermochemical datasets that confidently reach this level of accuracy are limited in either size or scope. Datasets with highly accurate reference values include a small number of data points, and larger datasets provide less accurate data or only cover a narrow portion of the chemical space. The existing datasets are therefore insufficient for developing data-driven methods with predictive accuracy over a large chemical space. The Microsoft Research Accurate Chemistry Collection (MSR-ACC) will address this challenge. Here, it offers the MSR-ACC/TAE25 dataset of 76,879 total atomization energies obtained at the CCSD(T)/CBS level via the W1-F12 thermochemical protocol. The dataset is constructed to exhaustively cover chemical space for all elements up to argon by enumerating and sampling chemical graphs, thus avoiding bias towards any particular subspace of the chemical space (such as drug-like, organic, or experimentally observed molecules). With this first dataset in MSR-ACC, we enable data-driven approaches for developing predictive computational chemistry methods with unprecedented accuracy and scope.</description>

      <title>Automatic Forward Model Parameterization with Bayesian Inference of Conformational Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18532v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To quantify how well theoretical predictions of structural ensembles agree with experimental measurements, we depend on the accuracy of forward models. These models are computational frameworks that generate observable quantities from molecular configurations based on empirical relationships linking specific molecular properties to experimental measurements. Bayesian Inference of Conformational Populations (BICePs) is a reweighting algorithm that reconciles simulated ensembles with ensemble-averaged experimental observations, even when such observations are sparse and/or noisy. This is achieved by sampling the posterior distribution of conformational populations under experimental restraints as well as sampling the posterior distribution of uncertainties due to random and systematic error. In this study, we enhance the algorithm for the refinement of empirical forward model (FM) parameters. We introduce and evaluate two novel methods for optimizing FM parameters. The first method treats FM parameters as nuisance parameters, integrating over them in the full posterior distribution. The second method employs variational minimization of a quantity called the BICePs score that reports the free energy of `turning on` the experimental restraints. This technique, coupled with improved likelihood functions for handling experimental outliers, facilitates force field validation and optimization, as illustrated in recent studies (Raddi et al. 2023, 2024). Using this approach, we refine parameters that modulate the Karplus relation, crucial for accurate predictions of J-coupling constants based on dihedral angles between interacting nuclei. We validate this approach first with a toy model system, and then for human ubiquitin, predicting six sets of Karplus parameters. Finally, we demonstrate that our framework naturally generalizes optimization to any differentiable forward model...</description>
