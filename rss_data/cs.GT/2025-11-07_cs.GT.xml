      <title>On the Existence of Fair Allocations for Goods and Chores under Dissimilar Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the fundamental problem of fairly allocating a multiset $\mathcal{M}$ of $t$ types of indivisible items among $d$ groups of agents, where all agents within a group have identical additive valuations. Gorantla et al. [GMV23] showed that for every such instance, there exists a finite number $\mu$ such that, if each item type appears at least $\mu$ times, an envy-free allocation exists. Their proof is non-constructive and only provides explicit upper bounds on $\mu$ for the cases of two groups ($d=2$) or two item types ($t=2$).
  In this work, we resolve one of the main open questions posed by Gorantla et al. [GMV23] by deriving explicit upper bounds on $\mu$ that hold for arbitrary numbers of groups and item types. We introduce a significantly simpler, yet powerful technique that not only yields constructive guarantees for indivisible goods but also extends naturally to chores and continuous domains, leading to new results in related fair division settings such as cake cutting.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Equilibrium Refinements in Potential Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complexity of computing equilibrium refinements has been at the forefront of algorithmic game theory research, but it has remained open in the seminal class of potential games; we close this fundamental gap in this paper.
  We first establish that computing a pure-strategy perfect equilibrium is $\mathsf{PLS}$-complete under different game representations -- including extensive-form games and general polytope games, thereby being polynomial-time equivalent to pure Nash equilibria. For normal-form proper equilibria, our main result is that a perturbed (proper) best response can be computed efficiently in extensive-form games. As a byproduct, we establish $\mathsf{FIXP}_a$-completeness of normal-form proper equilibria in extensive-form games, resolving a long-standing open problem. In stark contrast, we show that computing a normal-form proper equilibrium in polytope potential games is both $\mathsf{NP}$-hard and $\mathsf{coNP}$-hard.
  We next turn to more structured classes of games, namely symmetric network congestion and symmetric matroid congestion games. For both classes, we show that a perfect pure-strategy equilibrium can be computed in polynomial time, strengthening the existing results for pure Nash equilibria. On the other hand, we establish that, for a certain class of potential games, there is an exponential separation in the length of the best-response path between perfect and Nash equilibria.
  Finally, for mixed strategies, we prove that computing a point geometrically near a perfect equilibrium requires a doubly exponentially small perturbation even in $3$-player potential games in normal form. On the flip side, in the special case of polymatrix potential games, we show that equilibrium refinements are amenable to perturbed gradient descent dynamics, thereby belonging to the complexity class $\mathsf{CLS}$.</description>

      <title>Fraud-Proof Revenue Division on Subscription Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a model of subscription-based platforms where users pay a fixed fee for unlimited access to content, and creators receive a share of the revenue. Existing approaches to detecting fraud predominantly rely on machine learning methods, engaging in an ongoing arms race with bad actors. We explore revenue division mechanisms that inherently disincentivize manipulation. We formalize three types of manipulation-resistance axioms and examine which existing rules satisfy these. We show that a mechanism widely used by streaming platforms, not only fails to prevent fraud, but also makes detecting manipulation computationally intractable. We also introduce a novel rule, ScaledUserProp, that satisfies all three manipulation-resistance axioms. Finally, experiments with both real-world and synthetic streaming data support ScaledUserProp as a fairer alternative compared to existing rules.</description>

      <title>Fisher Meets Lindahl: A Unified Duality Framework for Market Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fisher market equilibrium for private goods and the Lindahl equilibrium for public goods are classic and fundamental solution concepts for market equilibria. While Fisher market equilibria have been well-studied, the theoretical foundations for Lindahl equilibria remain substantially underdeveloped.
  In this work, we propose a unified duality framework for market equilibria. We show that Lindahl equilibria of a public goods market correspond to Fisher market equilibria in a dual Fisher market with dual utilities, and vice versa. The dual utility is based on the indirect utility, and the correspondence between the two equilibria works by exchanging the roles of allocations and prices.
  Using the duality framework, we address the gaps concerning the computation and dynamics for Lindahl equilibria and obtain new insights and developments for Fisher market equilibria. First, we leverage this duality to analyze welfare properties of Lindahl equilibria. For concave homogeneous utilities, we prove that a Lindahl equilibrium maximizes Nash Social Welfare (NSW). For concave non-homogeneous utilities, we show that a Lindahl equilibrium achieves $(1/e)^{1/e}$ approximation to the optimal NSW, and the approximation ratio is tight. Second, we apply the duality framework to market dynamics, including proportional response dynamics (PRD) and t\^atonnement. We obtain new market dynamics for the Lindahl equilibria from market dynamics in the dual Fisher market. We also use duality to extend PRD to markets with total complements utilities, the dual class of gross substitutes utilities. Finally, we apply the duality framework to markets with chores. We propose a program for private chores for general convex homogeneous disutilities that avoids the "poles" issue, whose KKT points correspond to Fisher market equilibria. We also initiate the study of the Lindahl equilibrium for public chores.</description>

      <title>Attractors Is All You Need: Parity Games In Polynomial Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a polynomial-time algorithm for solving parity games that runs in $\mathcal{O}(n^{2}\cdot(n + m))$ time-ending a search that has taken decades. Unlike previous attractor-based algorithms, the presented algorithm only removes regions with a determined winner. The paper introduces a new type of attractor that can guarantee finding the minimal dominion of a parity game. The attractor runs in polynomial time and can peel the graph empty.</description>

      <title>Large language models replicate and predict human cooperation across experiments in game theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used both to make decisions in domains such as health, education and law, and to simulate human behavior. Yet how closely LLMs mirror actual human decision-making remains poorly understood. This gap is critical: misalignment could produce harmful outcomes in practical applications, while failure to replicate human behavior renders LLMs ineffective for social simulations. Here, we address this gap by developing a digital twin of game-theoretic experiments and introducing a systematic prompting and probing framework for machine-behavioral evaluation. Testing three open-source models (Llama, Mistral and Qwen), we find that Llama reproduces human cooperation patterns with high fidelity, capturing human deviations from rational choice theory, while Qwen aligns closely with Nash equilibrium predictions. Notably, we achieved population-level behavioral replication without persona-based prompting, simplifying the simulation process. Extending beyond the original human-tested games, we generate and preregister testable hypotheses for novel game configurations outside the original parameter grid. Our findings demonstrate that appropriately calibrated LLMs can replicate aggregate human behavioral patterns and enable systematic exploration of unexplored experimental spaces, offering a complementary approach to traditional research in the social and behavioral sciences that generates new empirical predictions about human social decision-making.</description>

      <title>Robust Equilibria in Shared Resource Allocation via Strengthening Border's Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider repeated allocation of a shared resource via a non-monetary mechanism, wherein a single item must be allocated to one of multiple agents in each round. We assume that each agent has i.i.d. values for the item across rounds, and additive utilities. Past work on this problem has proposed mechanisms where agents can get one of two kinds of guarantees: $(i)$ (approximate) Bayes-Nash equilibria via linkage-based mechanisms which need extensive knowledge of the value distributions, and $(ii)$ simple distribution-agnostic mechanisms with robust utility guarantees for each individual agent, which are worse than the Nash outcome, but hold irrespective of how others behave (including possibly collusive behavior). Recent work has hinted at barriers to achieving both simultaneously. Our work however establishes this is not the case, by proposing the first mechanism in which each agent has a natural strategy that is both a Bayes-Nash equilibrium and also comes with strong robust guarantees for individual agent utilities.
  Our mechanism comes out of a surprising connection between the online shared resource allocation problem and implementation theory, and uses a surprising strengthening of Border's theorem. In particular, we show that establishing robust equilibria in this setting reduces to showing that a particular subset of the Border polytope is non-empty. We establish this via a novel joint Schur-convexity argument. This strengthening of Border's criterion for obtaining a stronger conclusion is of independent technical interest, as it may prove useful in other settings.</description>

      <title>Pay for The Second-Best Service: A Game-Theoretic Approach Against Dishonest LLM Providers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00847v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) induces a critical vulnerability: the potential for dishonest manipulation by service providers. This manipulation can manifest in various forms, such as secretly substituting a proclaimed high-performance model with a low-cost alternative, or inflating responses with meaningless tokens to increase billing. This work tackles the issue through the lens of algorithmic game theory and mechanism design. We are the first to propose a formal economic model for a realistic user-provider ecosystem, where a user can iteratively delegate $T$ queries to multiple model providers, and providers can engage in a range of strategic behaviors. As our central contribution, we prove that for a continuous strategy space and any $\epsilon\in(0,\frac12)$, there exists an approximate incentive-compatible mechanism with an additive approximation ratio of $O(T^{1-\epsilon}\log T)$, and a guaranteed quasi-linear second-best user utility. We also prove an impossibility result, stating that no mechanism can guarantee an expected user utility that is asymptotically better than our mechanism. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our mechanism in simulation experiments with real-world API settings.</description>

      <title>Evaluating LLM-Contaminated Crowdsourcing Data Without Ground Truth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06991v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent success of generative AI highlights the crucial role of high-quality human feedback in building trustworthy AI systems. However, the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) by crowdsourcing workers poses a significant challenge: datasets intended to reflect human input may be compromised by LLM-generated responses. Existing LLM detection approaches often rely on high-dimensional training data such as text, making them unsuitable for annotation tasks like multiple-choice labeling. In this work, we investigate the potential of peer prediction -- a mechanism that evaluates the information within workers' responses without using ground truth -- to mitigate LLM-assisted cheating in crowdsourcing with a focus on annotation tasks. Our approach quantifies the correlations between worker answers while conditioning on (a subset of) LLM-generated labels available to the requester. Building on prior research, we propose a training-free scoring mechanism with theoretical guarantees under a crowdsourcing model that accounts for LLM collusion. We establish conditions under which our method is effective and empirically demonstrate its robustness in detecting low-effort cheating on real-world crowdsourcing datasets.</description>
