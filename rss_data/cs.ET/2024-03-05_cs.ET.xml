      <title>Nonlinear dynamics and stability analysis of locally-active Mott memristors using a physics-based compact model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Locally-active memristors are a class of emerging nonlinear dynamic circuit elements that hold promise for scalable yet biomimetic neuromorphic circuits. Starting from a physics-based compact model, we performed small-signal linearization analyses and applied Chua's local activity theory to a one-dimensional locally-active vanadium dioxide Mott memristor based on an insulator-to-metal phase transition. This approach allows a connection between the dynamical behaviors of a Mott memristor and its physical device parameters, which could guide materials and device development for neuromorphic circuit applications. We also examined the applicability of local analyses on a second-order circuit consists of a vanadium dioxide memristor coupled to an external reactive element, specifically a parallel capacitor. Finally, we show that global nonlinear techniques including nullclines and phase portraits provide insights on instabilities and persistent oscillations near non-hyperbolic fixed points, such as the creation of a stable limit cycle in a supercritical Hopf bifurcation, with some of the bifurcation characteristics distinctive from the general predictions.</description>

      <title>Acceleration of digital memcomputing by jumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we present the potential benefits of incorporating jumps into the dynamics of digital memcomputing machines (DMMs), which have been developed to address complex optimization problems. We illustrate the potential speed improvement of a DMM solver with jumps over an unmodified DMM solver by solving Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problems of different complicatedness. Our findings suggest that jumps can modify scaling exponents and improve solving times by up to 75 %. Interestingly, the advantages of jumps can be seen in cases where the size of the jump is so large that otherwise the continuous dynamics of voltage variables becomes almost binary.</description>

      <title>Training Computer Scientists for the Challenges of Hybrid Quantum-Classical Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As we enter the post-Moore era, we experience the rise of various non-von-Neumann-architectures to address the increasing computational demand for modern applications, with quantum computing being among the most prominent and promising technologies. However, this development creates a gap in current computer science curricula since most quantum computing lectures are strongly physics-oriented and have little intersection with the remaining curriculum of computer science. This fact makes designing an appealing course very difficult, in particular for non-physicists. Furthermore, in the academic community, there is consensus that quantum computers are going to be used only for specific computational tasks (e.g., in computational science), where hybrid systems - combined classical and quantum computers - facilitate the execution of an application on both quantum and classical computing resources. A hybrid system thus executes only certain suitable parts of an application on the quantum machine, while other parts are executed on the classical components of the system. To fully exploit the capabilities of hybrid systems and to meet future requirements in this emerging field, we need to prepare a new generation of computer scientists with skills in both distributed computing and quantum computing. To bridge this existing gap in standard computer science curricula, we designed a new lecture and exercise series on Hybrid Quantum-Classical Systems, where students learn how to decompose applications and implement computational tasks on a hybrid quantum-classical computational continuum. While learning the inherent concepts underlying quantum systems, students are obligated to apply techniques and methods they are already familiar with, making the entrance to the field of quantum computing comprehensive yet appealing and accessible to students of computer science.</description>

      <title>Boosting the Efficiency of Quantum Divider through Effective Design Space Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rapid progress in the design of scalable, robust quantum computing necessitates efficient quantum circuit implementation for algorithms with practical relevance. For several algorithms, arithmetic kernels, in particular, division plays an important role. In this manuscript, we focus on enhancing the performance of quantum slow dividers by exploring the design choices of its sub-blocks, such as, adders. Through comprehensive design space exploration of state-of-the-art quantum addition building blocks, our work have resulted in an impressive achievement: a reduction in Toffoli Depth of up to 94.06%, accompanied by substantial reductions in both Toffoli and Qubit Count of up to 91.98% and 99.37%, respectively. This paper offers crucial perspectives on efficient design of quantum dividers, and emphasizes the importance of adopting a systematic design space exploration approach.</description>

      <title>Efficient FIR filtering with Bit Layer Multiply Accumulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bit Layer Multiplier Accumulator (BLMAC) is an efficient method to perform dot products without multiplications that exploits the bit level sparsity of the weights. A total of 1,980,000 low, high, band pass and band stop type I FIR filters were generated by systematically sweeping through the cut off frequencies and by varying the number of taps from 55 to 255. After their coefficients were quantized to 16 bits, applying the filter using a BLMAC required, on average, from ~123.3 to ~513.6 additions, depending on the number of taps. A BLMAC dot product machine, specialised for 127 taps FIR filters, was designed for AMD FPGAs. The design footprint is ~110 LUTs, including coefficient and sample storage and is able to apply the filter in ~232 clock cycles on average. This implies a filtering rate of 1.4-3.4 Msamples/s, depending on the FPGA family.</description>

      <title>Spatially parallel decoding for multi-qubit lattice surgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Running quantum algorithms protected by quantum error correction requires a real time, classical decoder. To prevent the accumulation of a backlog, this decoder must process syndromes from the quantum device at a faster rate than they are generated. Most prior work on real time decoding has focused on an isolated logical qubit encoded in the surface code. However, for surface code, quantum programs of utility will require multi-qubit interactions performed via lattice surgery. A large merged patch can arise during lattice surgery -- possibly as large as the entire device. This puts a significant strain on a real time decoder, which must decode errors on this merged patch and maintain the level of fault-tolerance that it achieves on isolated logical qubits.
  These requirements are relaxed by using spatially parallel decoding, which can be accomplished by dividing the physical qubits on the device into multiple overlapping groups and assigning a decoder module to each. We refer to this approach as spatially parallel windows. While previous work has explored similar ideas, none have addressed system-specific considerations pertinent to the task or the constraints from using hardware accelerators. In this work, we demonstrate how to configure spatially parallel windows, so that the scheme (1) is compatible with hardware accelerators, (2) supports general lattice surgery operations, (3) maintains the fidelity of the logical qubits, and (4) meets the throughput requirement for real time decoding. Furthermore, our results reveal the importance of optimally choosing the buffer width to achieve a balance between accuracy and throughput -- a decision that should be influenced by the device's physical noise.</description>

Abstract: The recent development of quantum computing, which makes use of entanglement, superposition, and other quantum fundamental concepts, has the ability to provide substantial processing advantages over traditional computing. These quantum features help solve many hard problems that cannot be solved with traditional computing methods. These problems are in areas like modeling quantum mechanics, logistics, making chemical-based advances, designing drugs, statistical science, sustainable energy, banking, reliable communication, and quantum chemical engineering. The last few years have witnessed remarkable advancements in quantum software and algorithm creation as well as quantum hardware research, which have significantly advanced the prospect of the realization of quantum computers. It would be helpful to have comprehensive literature research on this area to grasp the current status and find outstanding problems that require considerable attention from the research community working in the quantum computing industry. To better understand quantum computing, this paper examines the foundations and vision based on current research in this area. We discuss cutting-edge developments in quantum computer hardware advancement, and subsequent advances in quantum cryptography, quantum software, and high-scalability quantum computers. Many potential challenges and exciting new trends for quantum technology research and development are highlighted in this paper for a wider debate.</description>

      <title>MITS: A Quantum Sorcerer Stone For Designing Surface Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the evolving landscape of quantum computing, determining the most efficient parameters for Quantum Error Correction (QEC) is paramount. Various quantum computers possess varied types and amounts of physical noise. Traditionally, simulators operate in a forward paradigm, taking parameters such as distance, rounds, and physical error to output a logical error rate. However, usage of maximum distance and rounds of the surface code might waste resources. An approach that relies on trial and error to fine-tune QEC code parameters using simulation tools like STIM can be exceedingly time-consuming. Additionally, daily fluctuations in quantum error rates can alter the ideal QEC settings needed. As a result, there is a crucial need for an automated solution that can rapidly determine the appropriate QEC parameters tailored to the current conditions. To bridge this gap, we present MITS, a tool designed to reverse-engineer the well-known simulator STIM for designing QEC codes. MITS accepts the specific noise model of a quantum computer and a target logical error rate as input and outputs the optimal surface code rounds and code distances. This guarantees minimal qubit and gate usage, harmonizing the desired logical error rate with the existing hardware limitations on qubit numbers and gate fidelity. We explored and compared multiple heuristics and machine learning models for training/designing MITS and concluded that XGBoost and Random Forest regression were most effective, with Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.98 and 0.96 respectively.</description>

      <title>Q-Embroidery: A Study on Weaving Quantum Error Correction into the Fabric of Quantum Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11127v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing holds transformative potential for various fields, yet its practical application is hindered by the susceptibility to errors. This study makes a pioneering contribution by applying quantum error correction codes (QECCs) for complex, multi-qubit classification tasks. We implement 1-qubit and 2-qubit quantum classifiers with QECCs, specifically the Steane code, and the distance 3 &amp; 5 surface codes to analyze 2-dimensional and 4-dimensional datasets. This research uniquely evaluates the performance of these QECCs in enhancing the robustness and accuracy of quantum classifiers against various physical errors, including bit-flip, phase-flip, and depolarizing errors. The results emphasize that the effectiveness of a QECC in practical scenarios depends on various factors, including qubit availability, desired accuracy, and the specific types and levels of physical errors, rather than solely on theoretical superiority.</description>
