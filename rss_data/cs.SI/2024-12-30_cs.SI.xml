      <title>Integrating Zero-Shot Classification to Advance Long COVID Literature: A Systematic Social Media-Centered Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long COVID continues to challenge public health by affecting a significant segment of individuals who have recovered from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection yet endure prolonged and often debilitating symptoms. Social media has emerged as a vital resource for those seeking real-time information, peer support, and validating their health concerns related to Long COVID. This paper examines recent works focusing on mining, analyzing, and interpreting user-generated content on social media platforms such as Twitter, Reddit, Facebook, and YouTube to capture the broader discourse on persistent post-COVID conditions. A novel transformer-based zero-shot learning approach serves as the foundation for classifying research papers in this area into four primary categories: Clinical or Symptom Characterization, Advanced NLP or Computational Methods, Policy, Advocacy, or Public Health Communication, and Online Communities and Social Support. This methodology showcases the adaptability of advanced language models in categorizing research papers without predefined training labels, thus enabling a more rapid and scalable assessment of existing literature. This review highlights the multifaceted nature of Long COVID research, where computational techniques applied to social media data reveal insights into narratives of individuals suffering from Long COVID. This review also demonstrates the capacity of social media analytics to inform clinical practice and contribute to policy-making related to Long COVID.</description>

      <title>Casevo: A Cognitive Agents and Social Evolution Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a multi-agent simulation framework Casevo (Cognitive Agents and Social Evolution Simulator), that integrates large language models (LLMs) to simulate complex social phenomena and decision-making processes. Casevo is designed as a discrete-event simulator driven by agents with features such as Chain of Thoughts (CoT), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Customizable Memory Mechanism. Casevo enables dynamic social modeling, which can support various scenarios such as social network analysis, public opinion dynamics, and behavior prediction in complex social systems. To demonstrate the effectiveness of Casevo, we utilize one of the U.S. 2020 midterm election TV debates as a simulation example. Our results show that Casevo facilitates more realistic and flexible agent interactions, improving the quality of dynamic social phenomena simulation. This work contributes to the field by providing a robust system for studying large-scale, high-fidelity social behaviors with advanced LLM-driven agents, expanding the capabilities of traditional agent-based modeling (ABM). The open-source code repository address of casevo is https://github.com/rgCASS/casevo.</description>

      <title>Exploring Text Representations for Online Misinformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mis- and disinformation, commonly collectively called fake news, continue to menace society. Perhaps, the impact of this age-old problem is presently most plain in politics and healthcare. However, fake news is affecting an increasing number of domains. It takes many different forms and continues to shapeshift as technology advances. Though it arguably most widely spreads in textual form, e.g., through social media posts and blog articles. Thus, it is imperative to thwart the spread of textual misinformation, which necessitates its initial detection. This thesis contributes to the creation of representations that are useful for detecting misinformation. Firstly, it develops a novel method for extracting textual features from news articles for misinformation detection. These features harness the disparity between the thematic coherence of authentic and false news stories. In other words, the composition of themes discussed in both groups significantly differs as the story progresses. Secondly, it demonstrates the effectiveness of topic features for fake news detection, using classification and clustering. Clustering is particularly useful because it alleviates the need for a labelled dataset, which can be labour-intensive and time-consuming to amass. More generally, it contributes towards a better understanding of misinformation and ways of detecting it using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing.</description>

      <title>Evaluating authorship disambiguation quality through anomaly analysis on researchers' career transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Authorship disambiguation is crucial for advancing studies in science of science. However, assessing the quality of authorship disambiguation in large-scale databases remains challenging since it is difficult to manually curate a gold-standard dataset that contains disambiguated authors. Through estimating the timing of when 5.8 million biomedical researchers became independent Principal Investigators (PIs) with authorship metadata extracted from the OpenAlex -- the largest open-source bibliometric database -- we unexpectedly discovered an anomaly: over 60% of researchers appeared as the last authors in their first career year. We hypothesized that this improbable finding results from poor name disambiguation, suggesting that such an anomaly may serve as an indicator of low-quality authorship disambiguation. Our findings indicated that authors who lack affiliation information, which makes it more difficult to disambiguate, were far more likely to exhibit this anomaly compared to those who included their affiliation information. In contrast, authors with Open Researcher and Contributor ID (ORCID) -- expected to have higher quality disambiguation -- showed significantly lower anomaly rates. We further applied this approach to examine the authorship disambiguation quality by gender over time, and we found that the quality of disambiguation for female authors was lower than that for male authors before 2010, suggesting that gender disparity findings based on pre-2010 data may require careful reexamination. Our results provide a framework for systematically evaluating authorship disambiguation quality in various contexts, facilitating future improvements in efforts to authorship disambiguation.</description>

      <title>Innovation beyond intention: harnessing exaptation for technological breakthroughs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The frameworks that explore scientific and technological evolution suggest that discoveries and inventions are intrinsic processes, while the wealth of knowledge accumulated over time enables researchers to make further advancements, echoing Newton's sentiment of "standing on the shoulders of giants." Despite the exponential growth in new scientific and technical knowledge, the consolidation-disruption (D) index suggests a concerning decline in the disruptiveness of papers and patents. "Exaptation" a concept borrowed from biological evolution, is now recognized as a pivotal yet often neglected mechanism in technological evolution. Significant technologies often do not emerge out of thin air but rather result from the application of existing technologies in other domains. For instance, bird feathers initially served as waterproofing and insulation before enabling flight, and microwave ovens originated from radar magnetrons. Exaptation, acknowledged as the catalyst for "innovation beyond intention" signifies a cross-field evolutionary process that is driven by functional shifts in pre-existing knowledge, technology, or artifacts. In this study, we introduce the concept of exaptation value, deliberately excluding serendipity. Our analysis reveals that, despite a declining trend in the disruptiveness of innovation, there is an increasing trend in the application of cross-domain knowledge within the innovation process over time. We also explore the impact of technology exaptation on innovation disruptiveness and discuss how leveraging technology adaptability enhances innovation's disruptive potential.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Landscape of AI-Driven Human Resource Management: A Social Network Analysis of Research Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) transforms human resource management (HRM), understanding the research landscape becomes crucial for both academics and practitioners. While existing studies examine isolated aspects of AI in HRM, a comprehensive analysis of collaboration patterns and emerging themes remains lacking. This research employs social network analysis (SNA) to examine the co-authorship network within AI applications in HRM research, providing insights into collaboration dynamics and identifying key research directions. Through analysis of centrality measures and application of the TOPSIS method, the study identifies influential authors, institutions, and emerging research themes. Analysis of 102,296 authors and 287,799 collaborations reveals distinct communities focusing on specific aspects of AI-HRM across regions. The findings identify four primary research themes: AI for System Identification and Control, focusing on workforce planning and adaptive management; HR Analytics and Performance Management, emphasizing data-driven decision making; Machine Learning for Classification and Prediction, addressing talent acquisition and retention; and AI-Driven HR Decision-Making, exploring strategic planning and unbiased evaluation systems. The country co-authorship network analysis uncovers three main communities: Global HR Applications, HRM in the Middle East and Asia, and Global Integration of AI in HRM, reflecting shared regional challenges. Institutional collaboration patterns indicate five distinct communities, from established Asian AI research centers to emerging research hubs in developing economies.</description>

      <title>Reviving Life on the Edge: Joint Score-Based Graph Generation of Rich Edge Attributes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph generation is integral to various engineering and scientific disciplines. Nevertheless, existing methodologies tend to overlook the generation of edge attributes. However, we identify critical applications where edge attributes are essential, making prior methods potentially unsuitable in such contexts. Moreover, while trivial adaptations are available, empirical investigations reveal their limited efficacy as they do not properly model the interplay among graph components. To address this, we propose a joint score-based model of nodes and edges for graph generation that considers all graph components. Our approach offers three key novelties: \textbf{(1)} node and edge attributes are combined in an attention module that generates samples based on the two ingredients, \textbf{(2)} node, edge and adjacency information are mutually dependent during the graph diffusion process, and \textbf{(3)} the framework enables the generation of graphs with rich attributes along the edges, providing a more expressive formulation for generative tasks than existing works. We evaluate our method on challenging benchmarks involving real-world and synthetic datasets in which edge features are crucial. Additionally, we introduce a new synthetic dataset that incorporates edge values. Furthermore, we propose a novel application that greatly benefits from the method due to its nature: the generation of traffic scenes represented as graphs. Our method outperforms other graph generation methods, demonstrating a significant advantage in edge-related measures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: PageRank is a widely used algorithm for ranking webpages and plays a significant role in determining web traffic. This study employs the Gini coefficient, a measure of income/wealth inequality, to assess the inequality in PageRank distributions and explores six deterministic methods for reducing inequality. Our findings indicate that a combination of two distinct heuristics may present an effective strategy for minimizing inequality.</description>

      <title>A Starting Point for Dynamic Community Detection with Leiden Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11658v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-world graphs often evolve over time, making community or cluster detection a crucial task. In this technical report, we extend three dynamic approaches - Naive-dynamic (ND), Delta-screening (DS), and Dynamic Frontier (DF) - to our multicore implementation of the Leiden algorithm, known for its high-quality community detection. Our experiments, conducted on a server with a 64-core AMD EPYC-7742 processor, show that ND, DS, and DF Leiden achieve average speedups of 1.37x, 1.47x, and 1.98x on large graphs with random batch updates, compared to the Static Leiden algorithm - while scaling at a rate of 1.6x for every doubling of threads. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply dynamic approaches to the Leiden algorithm. We hope these early results pave the way for further development of dynamic approaches for evolving graphs.</description>
