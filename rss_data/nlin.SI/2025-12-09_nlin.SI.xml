      <title>Integrable construction of a two-dimensional lattice model with anisotropic Hubbard couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By defining a graded global R-operator $\mathbb{R}_{ab}^{(2D,2S)}$ that couples free-fermion structures and incorporates anisotropic Hubbard interactions while satisfying the Yang--Baxter equation, we construct a strictly solvable two-dimensional lattice model. We then build the layer-to-layer transfer matrix through a bidirectional-monodromy construction and prove the model's integrability via the associated global RTT relations. Using the nested algebraic Bethe ansatz, we obtain the exact eigenvalues of the transfer matrix and derive the corresponding first- and second-level Bethe equations. Finally, by taking the logarithmic derivative of the transfer matrix at the regular point, we recover explicitly a local Hamiltonian that features anisotropic hopping, an on-site Hubbard interaction, and orbital-coupling contributions.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional multiplicative Poisson vertex algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce the notion of multidimensional multiplicative Poisson vertex algebra, the generalization of the notion of multiplicative Poisson vertex algebra to a difference algebra endowed with D commuting shifts. After showing the equivalence of this notion to the notion of Hamiltonian difference operator on a D-dimensional lattice, we characterize scalar local Hamiltonian difference operators up to the order (-2,2) and investigate the bi-Hamiltonian pairs they form.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with potential and dispersion given by arbitrary functions: Reductions and exact solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper deals with nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations of the general form, depending on time and two spatial variables, the potential and dispersion of which are specified by one or two arbitrary functions. The equations under consideration naturally generalize a number of related nonlinear partial differential equations that occur in various areas of theoretical physics, including nonlinear optics, superconductivity, and plasma physics. Two- and one-dimensional reductions are described, which lead the studied nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations to simpler equations of lower dimension or ordinary differential equations (or systems of ordinary differential equations). Using methods of generalized and functional separation of variables, a number of new exact solutions of two-dimensional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations of the general form are found, which are expressed in quadratures or elementary functions. To analyze the equations under consideration, both Cartesian and polar coordinate systems are utilized. Special attention is paid to finding solutions with radial symmetry. The exact solutions obtained in this work can be used as test problems intended to assess the accuracy of numerical and approximate analytical methods for solving complex nonlinear PDEs of mathematical physics.</description>

      <title>Isoperiodic deformations of Abelian differentials of the second kind over elliptic curves and the Boussinesq equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study deformations of a genus one Riemann surface and of a second order Abelian differential on the surface which preserve the periods of the differential with respect to a chosen canonical homology basis of the surface. We call these deformations isoperiodic. We derive a second order ordinary differential equation with rational coefficients governing the variations of the position of the unique pole of the differential under the isoperiodic deformations. The obtained equation depends on the order of the pole of the differential. We characterize the solutions of the obtained ordinary differential equations that correspond to the isoperiodic deformations. We apply these results to the theory of genus one solutions to the Boussinesq equation.</description>

      <title>Deformations of the Hill curves and isoperiodicity in the KdV and the sine-Gordon equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a family of genus $g$ hyperelliptic curves as double ramified coverings over the Riemann sphere with the set of branch points of the form $\{0, \infty, x_1, \dots, x_g, u_1, \dots, u_g\}$. The branch point at infinity $P_\infty$ is selected to be a marked point on the Riemann surfaces. A meromorphic differential $\Omega$ with a unique pole being of order two at $P_\infty$, is completely defined by the values of half of its periods, the $a$-periods. Fixing values of $a$-periods of $\Omega$, we then find a continuous subfamily in the considered family of hyperelliptic curves along which all the periods of $\Omega$ are constant. This subfamily is defined by the functions $u_j(x_1, \dots, x_g)$, while $x_1, \dots, x_g$ are independent parameters. We derive a system of differential equations for the functions $u_j(x_1, \dots, x_g)$, which, remarkably, has rational coefficients. We call this subfamily the isoperiodic deformations of the hyperelliptic curves relative to the given differential of the second kind $\Omega.$ We deduce necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of isoperiodic deformations. We discuss reality conditions as well. Using the obtained results, we solve the following problem for the Korteweg-de Vries and sine-Gordon equations: starting from an algebro-geometric data which generate a real periodic solution of a period $T$, how to deform the data, so that the associated solutions remain periodic with the same period $T$.</description>

      <title>Varied Branches of Nondegenerate Vector Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our study on nondegenerate dark-bright-bright solitons in a three-component Manakov model with repulsive interactions reveals the existence of diverse branches of nondegenerate vector solitons. For fixed bright component particle numbers and a given soliton velocity, the nondegenerate dark-bright-bright solitons exhibit four distinct branches with different density profiles and phase distributions, comprising two positive mass branches and two negative mass branches. The energy-velocity dispersion relation of each pair of positive- and one negative-mass branches form a closed loop, resulting in two mutually independent loops for the soliton's overall dispersion. All soliton branches share a common maximal velocity, which is determined by the larger bright soliton particle number. Linear stability analysis shows that all these branches are stable against weak perturbations. Extending to an $N$-component Manakov system, the nondegenerate solitons have $2^{N-1}$ distinct branches, of which $2^{N-2}$ branches solitons is positive mass and $2^{N-2}$ branches solitons is negative mass. Each pair of positive- and negative-mass branches form a closed dispersion relation loop, so that the vector solitons have $2^{N-2}$ disjoint loops. These results uncover the rich branches and interesting dispersion relations of nondegenerate vector solitons in multi-component models.</description>

      <title>Hirota-tau and Heun-function framework for Dirac vacuum polarization and quantum stabilization of kinks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a modified affine Toda model coupled to matter (ATM) which includes a scalar self-interacting potential and demonstrate that its first-order integro-differential structure, preserving a deformed Noether-topological current correspondence, provides a consistent framework for fermion-soliton interactions. In this formulation, the fermion-soliton energy is proportional to the soliton's topological charge. We show that fermionic back-reaction and the self-interacting scalar critically shape the fermion-kink energy, the in-gap bound-state spectrum, and the fermionic vacuum-polarization energy, yielding well-defined stability minima of the total energy as functions of the fermion and scalar masses and coupling parameters. A key result is that the Heun-equation formalism is necessary to construct nonzero-energy bound and scattering states: unlike the tau-function method, which captures only the zero mode, the Heun approach encodes the full scattering data through local solution matching conditions. These results refine the spectral analysis of deformed integrable models. The stability of soliton-fermion configurations has direct implications for topologically protected states in quantum information and condensed-matter systems.</description>

Abstract: The Lagrange identity expresses the second derivative of the moment of inertia of a system of material points through kinetic energy and homogeneous potential energy, from which follows the Jacobi well-known result on the instability of a system of gravitating bodies. In this work, it is proven that if a Hamiltonian system satisfies the Lagrange identity, then it possesses additional tensor invariants that are not expressed through the basic invariants existing for all Hamiltonian systems. A new class of Hamiltonian systems with inhomogeneous potentials is considered, which also possess similar additional tensor invariants.</description>

      <title>Degenerate Addition Formulas of the KP hierarchy and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that tau functions of the KP hierarchy satisfy addition formulas. We consider the general addition formula in the determinant form and take a certain limit of it. It expresses certain shifts of a tau function in terms of the Wronskian determinants of wave functions at various values of the spectral parameter. As an application the relation between solutions created by vertex operators and those created by Darboux transformations is clarified. As another application the new addition formula for Riemann's theta functions of Riemann surfaces is obtained by considering theta function solutions of the KP hierarchy. This addition formula is different from any of formulas in Fay's book.</description>

      <title>Bennett Vorticity: A family of nonlinear Shear-Flow Stabilized Z-pinch equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05727v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Bennett profile is a classic form for the plasma number density of an equilibrium Z-pinch that has been studied for almost a century by plasma physicists interested in nonlinear plasma pinch science, and fusion energy. By transferring the nonlinearity entirely from the number density to the plasma flow velocity the current density of the resulting flowing Z-pinch equilibrium remains unchanged whilst now being defined by a vortical flow which previously did not exist in the classic case. Due to the positive-definite structure of the nonlinearity's first derivative, in the ideal limit this equilibrium conforms globally to the validity criterion for a shear-flow stabilized Z-pinch when the form of the temperature profile satisfies certain constraints. For a cubic temperature the equilibrium has an analytic solution which is investigated.</description>
