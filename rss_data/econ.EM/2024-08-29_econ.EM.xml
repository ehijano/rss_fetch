      <title>Sensitivity Analysis for Dynamic Discrete Choice Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In dynamic discrete choice models, some parameters, such as the discount factor, are being fixed instead of being estimated. This paper proposes two sensitivity analysis procedures for dynamic discrete choice models with respect to the fixed parameters. First, I develop a local sensitivity measure that estimates the change in the target parameter for a unit change in the fixed parameter. This measure is fast to compute as it does not require model re-estimation. Second, I propose a global sensitivity analysis procedure that uses model primitives to study the relationship between target parameters and fixed parameters. I show how to apply the sensitivity analysis procedures of this paper through two empirical applications.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Dynamics of Growth in Master-Planned Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper describes how a time-varying Markov model was used to forecast housing development at a master-planned community during a transition from high to low growth. Our approach draws on detailed historical data to model the dynamics of the market participants, producing results that are entirely data-driven and free of bias. While traditional time series forecasting methods often struggle to account for nonlinear regime changes in growth, our approach successfully captures the onset of buildout as well as external economic shocks, such as the 1990 and 2008-2011 recessions and the 2021 post-pandemic boom.
  This research serves as a valuable tool for urban planners, homeowner associations, and property stakeholders aiming to navigate the complexities of growth at master-planned communities during periods of both system stability and instability.</description>
