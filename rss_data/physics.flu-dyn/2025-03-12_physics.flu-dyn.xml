      <title>Diffuselet method for three-dimensional turbulent mixing of a cloudy air filament</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mixing properties of vapor content, temperature and particle fields are of paramount importance in cloud turbulence as they pertain to essential processes, such as cloud water droplet evaporation and entrainment. Our study examines the mixing of a single cloudy air (which implies droplet-laden) filament with its clear air environment, a characteristic process at the cloud edge, in two ways. The first consists of 3-dimensional combined Euler-Lagrangian DNSs which describe the scalar supersaturation as an Eulerian field and the individual cloud water droplets as an ensemble of Lagrangian tracers. The second way builds on the recently developed diffuselet method, a kinematic Lagrangian framework that decomposes a scalar filament into a collection of small sections subject to deformation by local stirring and cross-sheet diffusion. The Schmidt number is Sc=0.7. The entrainment process causes a deformation of the supersaturated cloud filament in combination with diffusion until the system reaches a well-mixed equilibrium state with all droplets evaporated. We compare the time dependence of the variance and probability density function of the supersaturation field. For the initial period of the mixing process they agree very well; at later stages deviations caused by non-zero mean of the conserved scalar are observed. For the cases including cloud water droplets, we investigate also the impact of droplet number density and condensation growth response. Turbulence causes deviations from the d2-law similar to recent experiments in sprays. A simulation at a Sc that is by a factor of 100 larger than in clouds improves the agreement between simulation and diffuselet method significantly. The latter result promotes the diffuselet framework as an efficient parametrization for turbulent high-Sc mixing which can reduce the resolution efforts of the viscous-convective range of scalar turbulence.</description>

      <title>Python-JAX-based Fast Stokesian Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stokesian Dynamics (SD) is a powerful computational framework for simulating the motion of particles in a viscous Newtonian fluid under Stokes-flow conditions. Traditional SD implementations can be computationally expensive as they rely on the inversion of large mobility matrices to determine hydrodynamic interactions. Recently, however, the simulation of thermalized systems with large numbers of particles has become feasible [Fiore and Swan, J. Fluid. Mech. $\textbf{878}$, 544 (2019)]. Their ``fast Stokesian dynamics'' (FSD) method leverages a saddle-point formulation to ensure overall scaling of the algorithm that is linear in the number of particles $\mathcal{O}(N)$; performance relies on dedicated graphics-processing-unit computing. Here, we present a different route toward implementing FSD, which instead leverages the Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation capabilities of Google JAX. We refer to this implementation as JFSD and perform benchmarks on it to verify that it has the right scaling and is sufficiently fast by the standards of modern computational physics. In addition, we provide a series of physical test cases that help ensure accuracy and robustness, as the code undergoes further development. Thus, JFSD is ready to facilitate the study of hydrodynamic effects in particle suspensions across the domains of soft, active, and granular matter.</description>

      <title>MFC 5.0: An exascale many-physics flow solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Engineering, medicine, and the fundamental sciences broadly rely on flow simulations, making performant computational fluid dynamics solvers an open source software mainstay. A previous work made MFC 3.0 a published open source source solver with many features. MFC 5.0 is a marked update to MFC 3.0, including a broad set of well-established and novel physical models and numerical methods and the introduction of GPU and APU (or superchip) acceleration. We exhibit state-of-the-art performance and ideal scaling on the first two exascale supercomputers, OLCF Frontier and LLNL El Capitan. Combined with MFC's single-GPU/APU performance, MFC achieves exascale computation in practice. With these capabilities, MFC has evolved into a tool for conducting simulations that many engineering challenge problems hinge upon. New physical features include the immersed boundary method, $N$-fluid phase change, Euler--Euler and Euler--Lagrange sub-grid bubble models, fluid-structure interaction, hypo- and hyper-elastic materials, chemically reacting flow, two-material surface tension, and more. Numerical techniques now represent the current state-of-the-art, including general relaxation characteristic boundary conditions, WENO variants, Strang splitting for stiff sub-grid flow features, and low Mach number treatments. Weak scaling to tens of thousands of GPUs on OLCF Frontier and LLNL El Capitan see efficiencies within 5% of ideal to over 90% of their respective system sizes. Strong scaling results for a 16-time increase in device count show parallel efficiencies over 90% on OLCF Frontier. Other MFC improvements include ensuring code resilience and correctness with a continuous integration suite, the use of metaprogramming to reduce code length and maintain performance portability, and efficient computational representations for chemical reactions and thermodynamics via code generation with Pyrometheus.</description>

      <title>Rayleigh-B{\'e}nard Convection with Phase Change Close to the Critical Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rayleigh-B{\'e}nard convection is investigated with sulfur hexafluoride (SF$_6$) in the vicinity of its critical point. In the supercritical domain, direct measurements of the heat flux $Q$ as a function of the temperature difference $\Delta T$ are consistent with the usual scaling laws of single-phase turbulent convection. Along the liquid-vapor coexistence curve, heat fluxes are dramatically enhanced by condensation and boiling. Optical measurements are performed to document the size and velocity of the bubbles. We report $Q(\Delta T, \epsilon)$ in both domains, with $\epsilon$ the dimensionless distance to the critical point. Critical scaling laws are observed that can guide the development of theoretical models. In addition, this documents a system of diverging heat transfer coefficient, i.e., in which a significant heat flux can be achieved with an arbitrarily small temperature difference as $\epsilon\to 0$.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear optimals and their role in sustaining turbulence in channel flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the energy transfer from the mean profile to velocity fluctuations in channel flow by calculating nonlinear optimal disturbances,i.e. the initial condition of a given finite energy that achieves the highest possible energy growth during a given fixed time horizon. It is found that for a large range of time horizons and initial disturbance energies, the nonlinear optimal exhibits streak spacing and amplitude consistent with DNS at least at Re_tau = 180, which suggests that they isolate the relevant physical mechanisms that sustain turbulence. Moreover, the time horizon necessary for a nonlinear disturbance to outperform a linear optimal is consistent with previous DNS-based estimates using eddy turnover time, which offers a new perspective on how some turbulent time scales are determined.</description>

      <title>Propulsion of flapping foils undergoing in-plane clap-and-fling and deviation motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the performance of two flapping flat-plate foils interacting with each other while generating thrust at a Reynolds number of 800 through two-dimensional numerical simulations. These fluid dynamics simulations were conducted with a commercial computational fluid dynamics solver implementing a finite-volume method and an overset mesh capability. The foils performed a combined motion involving pitching, heaving, and deviation. Both foils exhibit similar movements, with one foil mirroring the other. The heaving and pitching motions occur at the same frequency but with a phase shift between them. The effects of varying the phase shift and the minimum spacing between the foils during motion were first explored. The study revealed that a maximum efficiency of 0.542 can be achieved by using two foils, representing an increase of 13.5% relative to the optimal single-foil case. Then, the impacts of the deviation motion were investigated. The deviation motion was introduced with a frequency twice as fast as the other motions, and a phase shift relative to the heaving motion. The other parameters such as the minimum spacing between the foils, the heaving and pitching amplitudes, and the frequency were those of the best configuration without deviation. The numerical simulations demonstrated that deviation can increase efficiency further to a value of 0.560, a relative increase of 3.95%.</description>

      <title>Elongated bubble centring and high-viscosity liquids in horizontal gas-liquid slug flow: Empirical analyses and novel theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elongated bubble centring$\unicode{x2013}$an obscure counter-buoyant phenomenon encountered in horizontal gas-liquid slug flow$\unicode{x2013}$is correlated with liquid viscosity and their connection is theorized. Extracting from three sets of high-viscosity liquid (HVL) photographic data with $\mu_{\scriptscriptstyle L}$$\in$[1,960]mPa-s and $D$$\in$[20,50.8]mm, the degree of incurred centring is found to increase, generally, in proportion to $\mu_{\scriptscriptstyle L}$ for a wide range of operational rates as evidenced through measurements at bubble nose, body and tail. It is demonstrated that full and nearly-symmetric centring can occur in HVL-containing flows$\unicode{x2013}$the former at relatively low inertial supply in contradiction to water-based dynamics. Qualitative advancements regarding the mechanistic nature of bubble centring and its plausible function within flow pattern transition theory are presented. Elaborating on recent modelling efforts, four distinct hypotheses are formulated: 1) film region laminarity as a modulator for centring; 2) boundary layer theory in slug flow to differentiate an outer-layer, relative motion-dominated film flow necessary for the initiation of centring; 3) wedge theory$\unicode{x2013}$a plausible alternative mechanism for partial-centring; and 4) a novel framework for the slug-annular transition composed of two unique mechanisms$\unicode{x2013}$centring and coalescence. The postulated boundary layer theory is investigated using a calibrated case of HVL slug flow and a dynamical environment conducive to centring mechanism proliferation is calculated.</description>

      <title>Orbiting, colliding and merging droplets on a soap film: toward gravitational analogues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern telescopes provide breathtaking images of nebulae, clouds and galaxies shaped by gravity-driven interactions between complex bodies. While such structures are prevalent on an astrophysical scale, they are rarely observed at the human scale. In this letter, we report the observations of the complex orbits, collision, and coalescence of droplets on a soap film, forming structures such as bridges and spiral arms, reminiscent of their astrophysical counterparts. These dynamics emerge from attractive forces caused by gravito-capillary-driven distortions of the supporting soap film. Long orbits and intricate coalescence mechanisms are enabled by the small dissipation in the soap film and the fluidic nature of the droplets and supporting film, respectively. The existence of stable droplets within the soap film featuring a universal radius, as well as the attractive potentials, are explained through a careful comparison of experimental data with models computing the distortions of the supporting soap film.

      <title>Mean resolvent analysis of periodic flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08401v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mean resolvent operator predicts, in the frequency domain, the mean linear response to forcing, and, as such, it provides the optimal LTI approximation of the input-output dynamics of flows in the statistically steady regime (Leclercq &amp; Sipp 2023). In this paper, we aim at providing numerical frameworks to extract optimal forcings and responses of the mean resolvent, also known as mean resolvent modes. For periodic flows, we rewrite the mean resolvent operator in terms of a harmonic resolvent operator (Wereley &amp; Hall 1990; Padovan &amp; Rowley 2022) to obtain reference mean resolvent modes. Successively, we propose a projection algorithm approximating those modes within a subspace of mean-flow resolvent modes. The projected problem is directly solved in the frequency domain, but we also discuss a time-stepper version that can bypass the explicit construction of the operator without recurring to direct-adjoint looping. We evaluate the algorithms on an incompressible axisymmetric laminar jet periodically forced at the inlet. For a weakly unsteady case, the mean-flow resolvent correctly approximates the main receptivity peak of the mean resolvent, but completely fails to capture a secondary receptivity peak. For a strongly unsteady case, even the main receptivity peak of the mean resolvent is incorrectly captured by the mean-flow resolvent. Although the present algorithms are currently restricted to periodic flows, input projection may be a key ingredient to extend mean resolvent analysis to more complex statistically steady flows.</description>

      <title>Excitation of non-modal perturbations in hypersonic boundary layers by freestream forcing: shock-fitting harmonic linearised Navier-Stokes approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the receptivity of non-modal perturbations in hypersonic boundary layers over a blunt wedge subject to freestream vortical, entropy and acoustic perturbations. Due to the absence of the Mack-mode instability and the rather weak entropy-layer instability, the non-modal perturbation is considered as the dominant factor triggering transition. This is a highly intricate problem, given the complexities arising from the presence of the bow shock, entropy layer, and their interactions with oncoming disturbances. To tackle this challenge, we develop a novel numerical tool, the shock-fitting harmonic linearized Navier-Stokes (SF-HLNS) approach, which offers a comprehensive investigation on the dependence of the receptivity efficiency on the nose bluntness and properties of the freestream forcing. The numerical findings suggest that the non-modal perturbations are more susceptible to freestream acoustic and entropy perturbations compared to the vortical perturbations, with the optimal spanwise length scale being comparable with the downstream boundary-layer thickness. Notably, as the nose bluntness increases, the receptivity to the acoustic and entropy perturbations intensifies, reflecting the transition reversal phenomenon observed experimentally in configurations with relatively large bluntness. In contrast, the receptivity to freestream vortical perturbations weakens with increasing bluntness. Additionally, through the SF-HLNS calculations, we examine the credibility of the optimal growth theory (OGT) on describing the evolution of non-modal perturbations. Its accuracy in predicting the early-stage evolution and the energy amplification proves to be unreliable. Given its high-efficiency and high-accuracy nature, the SF-HLNS approach shows great potential as a valuable tool for conducting future research on hypersonic blunt-body boundary-layer transition.</description>

Abstract: Detailed study of spectral properties and of linear stability is presented for a class of lattice Boltzmann models with a non-ideal equation of state. Examples include the van der Waals and the shallow water models. Both analytical and numerical approaches demonstrate that linear stability requires boundedness of propagation speeds of normal eigen-modes. The study provides a basis for the construction of unconditionally stable lattice Boltzmann models.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification for Multi-fidelity Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The work focuses on gathering high-fidelity and low-fidelity numerical simulations data using Nektar++ (Solver based on Applied Mathematics) and XFOIL respectively. The utilization of the higher polynomial distribution in calculating the Coefficient of lift and drag has demonstrated superior accuracy and precision. Further, Co-kriging Data fusion and Adaptive sampling technique has been used to obtain the precise data predictions for the lift and drag within the confined domain without conducting the costly simulations on HPC clusters. This creates a methodology to quantifying uncertainty in computational fluid dynamics by minimizing the required number of samples. To minimize the reliability on high-fidelity numerical simulations in Uncertainty Quantification, a multi-fidelity strategy has been adopted. The effectiveness of the multi-fidelity deep neural network model has been validated through the approximation of benchmark functions across 1-, 32-, and 100-dimensional, encompassing both linear and nonlinear correlations. The surrogate modelling results showed that multi-fidelity deep neural network model has shown excellent approximation capabilities for the test functions and multi-fidelity deep neural network method has outperformed Co-kriging in effectiveness. In addition to that, multi-fidelity deep neural network model is utilized for the simulation of aleatory uncertainty propagation in 1-, 32-, and 100 dimensional function test, considering both uniform and Gaussian distributions for input uncertainties. The results have shown that multi-fidelity deep neural network model has efficiently predicted the probability density distributions of quantities of interest as well as the statistical moments with precision and accuracy. The Co-Kriging model has exhibited limitations when addressing 32-Dimension problems due to the limitation of memory capacity for storage and manipulation.</description>

      <title>A global similarity correction for the RANS modeling of natural convection in unstably stratified flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12973v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study proposes a global similarity correction for Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS) modeling of buoyancy effects in unstably stratified flows. Conventional two-equation RANS models (e.g., the $k$-$\varepsilon$ model) lack a clear criterion for incorporating unstable buoyancy effects in their scale-determining equations (e.g., $\varepsilon$-equation). To address this gap, a global correction function is introduced, derived from a generalized algebraic formulation that incorporates available potential energy as an additional parameter. This function reproduces a global similarity law commonly observed in natural convection flows--for instance, the correlation among the Nusselt, Rayleigh, and Prandtl numbers, which can be approximately expressed as a single power law over a wide parameter range. A calibration method is proposed in which an approximate analytical solution for Rayleigh--B\'enard convection is obtained via equilibrium analysis, confirming that the proposed model captures similarity relations not addressed by conventional one-point closures. Numerical results show significantly improved agreement with experimental data, accurately reproducing Nusselt number dependencies over broad ranges of Rayleigh and Prandtl numbers in unstably stratified flows, such as Rayleigh--B\'enard convection and two types of internally heated convection. The method remains fully compatible with standard RANS frameworks and reverts to traditional turbulence treatments in shear-driven flows where buoyant effects are negligible. By introducing only a single, simple, algebraic global function in the conventional $\varepsilon$-equation, this approach significantly enhances the accuracy and robustness of buoyancy-driven turbulence simulations.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes in Lorentz violating black hole analogues</title>

Abstract: Analogue models of black holes typically have collective excitations with a dispersion relation that breaks the effective Lorentz symmetry at high energy. We investigate the consequences of such Lorentz violations on the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of the system, that is, the modes of energy dissipation. The model involves low frequency capillary-gravity waves (whose dispersion relation can be adjusted between sub- and superluminal modifications) around a draining vortex, which mimics a rotating black hole spacetime. For a subluminal/superluminal modification, the frequency and decay rate of co-rotating modes can be reduced/increased substantially, whilst counter-rotating modes are barely affected. A further consequence of the superluminal modification is that there are no corotating QNMs above a critical rotation and no counter-rotating ones below a critical rotation for strong enough Lorentz violations.</description>

      <title>Second quantization for classical nonlinear dynamics</title>

Abstract: Using techniques from many-body quantum theory, we propose a framework for representing the evolution of observables of measure-preserving ergodic flows through infinite-dimensional rotation systems on tori. This approach is based on a class of weighted Fock spaces $F_w(\mathcal H_\tau)$ generated by a 1-parameter family of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces $\mathcal H_\tau$, and endowed with commutative Banach algebra structure under the symmetric tensor product using a subconvolutive weight $w$. We describe the construction of the spaces $F_w(\mathcal H_\tau)$ and show that their Banach algebra spectra, $\sigma(F_w(\mathcal H_\tau))$, decompose into a family of tori of potentially infinite dimension. Spectrally consistent unitary approximations $U^t_\tau$ of the Koopman operator acting on $\mathcal H_\tau$ are then lifted to rotation systems on these tori akin to the topological models of ergodic systems with pure point spectra in the Halmos--von Neumann theorem. Our scheme also employs a procedure for representing observables of the original system by polynomial functions on finite-dimensional tori in $\sigma(F_w(\mathcal H_\tau))$ of arbitrarily large degree, with coefficients determined from pointwise products of eigenfunctions of $U^t_\tau$. This leads to models for the Koopman evolution of observables on $L^2$ built from tensor products of finite collections of approximate Koopman eigenfunctions. Numerically, the scheme is amenable to consistent data-driven implementation using kernel methods. We illustrate it with applications to Stepanoff flows on the 2-torus and the Lorenz 63 system. Connections with quantum computing are also discussed.</description>
