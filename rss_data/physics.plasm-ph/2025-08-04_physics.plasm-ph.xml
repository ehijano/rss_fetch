      <title>Unified Description of Kappa-type velocity distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An extension of Maxwell's original prescription for an ideal gas is adopted to derive a broad class of Kappa-type velocity distributions, encompassing both fat and short-tailed forms. Within this general framework, a physically consistent fat-tailed Kappa distribution is identified that accurately fits recent suprathermal data. In particular, a kinetic physical temperature $T$ emerges naturally from the model, eliminating the need to invoke an effective temperature $T_{\kappa\ell}$, as is commonly done in the literature. Finally, it is argued that only a particular value of $\ell$ ensures a satisfactory fit to the data when the physical kinetic temperature is employed.</description>

      <title>Probing Proton versus Electron Heating and Energization during Magnetic Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanisms controlling the relative heating and energization of electrons and protons during magnetic reconnection are explored. Simulations are carried out with the kglobal model, which produces bulk heating and the extended powerlaw distributions of both species that have been documented in observations. The simulations have been carried out with a range of proton-to-electron mass ratios and upstream temperatures to isolate the factors that control energy gain. The simulations reveal that when the upstream temperatures of the two species are equal, the proton heating and energization exceeds that of electrons and that this is a consequence of the much larger energy gain of protons on their first entry into the reconnection exhaust. The effective energy gain of protons on exhaust entry scales as $m_iC_A^2$ since the protons counterstream at the Alfv\'en speed $C_A$ while the initial electron energy gain is smaller by the factor $(\beta_{e0}m_e/m_i)^{1/2}$. Since Fermi reflection during flux rope merger dominates energy gain in large-scale reconnecting systems and the rate of energy gain is proportional to energy, protons continue to gain energy faster than electrons for the duration of the simulations, leading to temperature increments of protons exceeding that of electrons and the non-thermal energy content of protons also exceeding that of electrons.</description>

      <title>Experimental Demonstration of Dephasing Reduction in an Optically Guided Laser-Plasma Accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser-plasma accelerators offer a compact means of producing high-energy electron beams, but their performance is fundamentally limited by dephasing between the accelerated electrons and the plasma wave. To overcome this limitation, we investigate the combination of plasma density tapering and optical guiding to extend the effective acceleration length. Using a Joule-class femtosecond laser coupled into an optical-field-ionized plasma waveguide with a controlled density gradient, we experimentally achieve electron beam energies exceeding 1.6 GeV, a 40% increase compared to the constant-density case. Particle-in-cell simulations reproduce the main experimental features and reveal the central roles of delayed injection, nonlinear laser evolution, and self-focusing in enhancing energy gain.</description>

      <title>Favorable modifications of Scrape-Off Layer (SOL) heat flux width through pulsed fuelling in ADITYA-U Tokamak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhancement of the scrape-off layer (SOL) heat flux width has been observed in the ADITYA-U Tokamak following the injection of short fuel gas pulses. A notable reduction in parallel heat flux near the last closed flux surface (LCFS) is observed after each pulse. Comparative analysis indicates that pulsed fuelling is more effective in mitigating heat flux with improved core confinement than continuous gas feeding via real-time density control. Analytical and simulation works are also carried out for validation of experimental results. The analytical model shows that SOL width modification cannot be attributed solely to the decrease of temperature due to gas pulse injection; cross-field plasma diffusion also needs to increase. Simulations with the UEDGE code suggest that an increase in both the cross-field diffusion coefficient and inward pinch velocity is necessary to replicate the experimentally observed broadening of the heat flux SOL width. These findings provide insights into efficient SOL heat flux control strategies for future fusion devices.</description>

      <title>Collimated QED Cascades with Curved Plasma Mirror</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Converting light into matter has been a longstanding goal in physics, particularly the creation of electron-positron pairs through quantum electrodynamic (QED) processes. While current approaches using multiple colliding laser pulses can achieve this conversion, they struggle to produce well-collimated particle beams - a crucial requirement for practical applications. Here we demonstrate that a single ultra-intense laser pulse, when reflected from a curved plasma mirror, can generate highly collimated electron-positron pairs with unprecedented efficiency. By focusing the laser to field strengths exceeding $a_0 &gt; 2000$, our method triggers QED cascades that produce tightly focused particle beams, distinctly different from the diffuse plasmas created by conventional multi-laser setups. The technique works even at relatively modest laser powers of 13PW, making it immediately testable at existing facilities. This breakthrough opens new possibilities for studying fundamental QED processes and generating controlled matter-antimatter plasmas.</description>

      <title>Continuum damping of topologically-protected edge modes at the boundary of non-uniformly magnetized cylindrical plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an extension of recently discovered collisionlessly damped yet topologically protected surface plasma waves (TSPWs), from a simplified slab geometry to a cylindrical plasma-vacuum interface. A distinctive feature of these modes-emerging above the electron cyclotron frequency-is their collisionless damping, which arises from resonant coupling to a continuum of upper-hybrid modes localized within a smooth plasma-vacuum transition layer. We demonstrate both temporal and spatial damping of TSPWs at the boundary of a cylindrical magnetized plasma. Furthermore, we show that in the presence of a non-uniform magnetic field, the TSPW exhibits a smooth and continuous transition, highlighting its topological robustness under magnetic inhomogeneity.</description>

      <title>A COGENT case study: Supporting Applications with Chombo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a case study of how a software framework (Chombo) supported the specific needs of a scientific application (COGENT). Since its inception in 2000, the Chombo framework has supported various applications. One example of such support has been the collaboration with the Edge Simulation Laboratory to build the COGENT model. The specific needs of the COGENT effort required the design and implementation of a set of new capabilities in the Chombo framework, such as higher-order mapped-multiblock discretizations and multi-dimensional code organization. These capabilities allowed COGENT to develop a unique simulation capability for modeling the edge layers in tokamaks. Once developed, these capabilities were able to support other applications which had similar needs.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field Amplification and Reconstruction in Rotating Astrophysical Plasmas: Verifying the Roles of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ in Dynamo Action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01300v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigated the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ effects in a rotating spherical plasma system relevant to astrophysical environments. These coefficients were derived using three different approaches based on the large-scale magnetic field $\overline{\mathbf{B}}$, turbulent velocity $\mathbf{u}$, and turbulent magnetic field $\mathbf{b}$, yielding $\alpha_{\mathrm{EM-HM}}$, $\beta_{\mathrm{EM-HM}}$, $\beta_{\mathrm{vv-vw}}$, and $\beta_{\mathrm{bb+jb}}$. Using raw data from direct numerical simulations (DNS), we constructed the magnetic induction equation incorporating the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ coefficients. We then reproduced the $\overline{\mathbf{B}}$ field and compared the results with the DNS data. In the kinematic regime, where $\overline{\mathbf{B}}$ is weak, all models exhibit good agreement with the DNS results. However, in the nonlinear regime, the $\overline{\mathbf{B}}$ field, reproduced using $\beta_{\mathrm{vv-vw}}$, deviates from the DNS and exhibits unbounded growth. To address this discrepancy, we added $\beta_{\mathrm{bb+jb}}$, which represents the contribution of turbulent magnetic fields, to $\beta_{\mathrm{vv-vw}}$. This addition suppresses the divergent growth of $\overline{\mathbf{B}}$ in the nonlinear regime. We then assessed the actual influence of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ on the evolution of $\overline{\mathbf{B}}$ by applying weighted combinations of the two coefficients. Our results show that magnetic $\beta$ diffusion plays a dominant role throughout the entire process. In contrast, the $\alpha$ effect is minor in the kinematic regime but becomes essential for sustaining the $\overline{\mathbf{B}}$ field in the nonlinear regime. We also discussed the underlying physical mechanism responsible for this behavior.</description>

      <title>A generalized framework for the critical current for a one-dimensional crossed-field gap in an orthogonal coordinate system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies have applied variational calculus, conformal mapping, and point transformations to extend the one-dimensional SCLC from planar gaps to more complicated geometries. However, introducing a magnetic field orthogonal to the diode's electric field complicates these calculations due to changes in the electron trajectory. This paper extends a recent study that applied variational calculus to determine the SCLC for a cylindrical crossed-field diode to derive an equation that is valid for any orthogonal coordinate system. We then derive equations for the SCLC for crossed-field gaps in spherical, tip-to-tip, and tip-to-plane geometries that can be solved numerically. These calculations exhibit a discontinuity at the Hull cutoff magnetic field $B_H$ corresponding to the transition to magnetic insulation as observed analytically for a planar geometry. The ratio of the crossed-field SCLC to the nonmagnetic SCLC becomes essentially independent of geometry when we fix $\delta = D/D_M &gt; 0.6$, where $D$ is the canonical gap distance accounting for geometric effects on electric potential and $D_M$ is the effective gap distance that accounts for magnetic field and geometry. The solutions for these geometries overlap as $\delta \to 1$ since the geometric corrections for electric potential and magnetic field match. This indicates the possibility of more generally accounting for the combination of geometric and magnetic effects when calculating $B_H$ and SCLC.</description>

      <title>The Gardner equation and acoustic solitary waves in plasmas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ion-acoustic waves in a dusty plasma are investigated where it is assumed that the ions follow a Cairns distribution and the electrons are Boltzmann distributed. Two theoretical methods are applied: Sagdeev pseudopotential analysis (SPA) and reductive perturbation theory (RPT). Since SPA incorporates all nonlinearities of the model it is the most accurate but deriving soliton profiles requires numerical integration of Poisson's equation. By contrast, RPT is a perturbation method which at second order yields the Gardner equation incorporating both the quadratic nonlinearity of the KdV equation and the cubic nonlinearity of the modified KdV equation. For consistency with the perturbation scheme the coefficient of the quadratic term needs to be at least an order of magnitude smaller than the coefficient of the cubic term. Solving the Gardner equation yields an analytic expression of the soliton profile. Selecting an appropriate set of compositional parameters, the soliton solutions obtained from SPA and RPT are analyzed and compared.</description>

      <title>Fast solvers for Tokamak fluid models with PETSC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16676v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work begins the development of fast, scalable solvers for scientific and engineering-relevant magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) models of tokamaks using multigrid methods. These models are characterized by a distinguished direction following the magnetic field around the torus, which dominates the plasma dynamics. All tokamak models exploit this structure, for example, NIMROD uses 2D, unstructured, high-order finite elements in the poloidal plane with Fourier modes in the toroidal coordinate, and the 3D, extended MHD code M3D-C1 uses 2D, unstructured C1 elements in the poloidal plane with cubic Hermite functions in the toroidal direction and a regular grid that is partially aligned with the magnetic field. This structure suggests addressing the toroidal coordinate first, which NIMROD does at the formulation level, but M3D-C1 uses a full 3D discretization. The resulting algebraic system is solved at each time step in an implicit time integrator. This work addressed the toroidal coordinate in the M3D-C1 velocity solve by adding semi-coarsening multigrid to the existing PETSC - Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation - block Jacobi solver, with the addition of little new code. Competitive performance of this new solver configuration is demonstrated on a self-consistent runaway electron model of a SPARC4 disruption, and the next steps in the development of this solver are outlined.</description>

      <title>Nystr\"om Type Exponential Integrators for Strongly Magnetized Charged Particle Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00288v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Calculating the dynamics of charged particles in electromagnetic fields (i.e. the particle pushing problem) is one of the most computationally intensive components of particle-in-cell (PIC) methods for plasma physics simulations. This task is especially challenging when the plasma is strongly magnetized, since in this case the particle motion consists of a wide range of temporal scales from highly oscillatory fast gyromotion to slow macroscopic behavior and the resulting numerical model is very stiff. Current state-of-the-art time integrators used to simulate particle motion have limitations given the severe numerical stiffness of the problem and more efficient methods are of interest. Recently, exponential integrators have been proposed as a promising new approach for these simulations and shown to offer computational advantages over commonly used schemes. Exponential methods can solve linear problems exactly and are A-stable. In this paper, the standard exponential algorithms framework is extended to derive Nystr\"om-type exponential methods that integrate the Newtonian equations of motion as a second-order differential equation. Specific Nystr\"om-type schemes of second and third orders are derived and applied to strongly magnetized particle pushing problems. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate that the Nystr\"om-type exponential integrators can provide significant improvement in computational efficiency over the standard exponential methods.</description>
