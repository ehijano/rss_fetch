      <title>Existence, uniqueness and blow-up estimates for a reaction-diffusion equation with $p(x,t)$-exponents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $d \in \{3,4,5,\ldots\}$ and $\Omega \subset \Ri^d$ be open bounded with Lipschitz boundary.
  Let $Q = \Omega \times (0,\infty)$ and $p \in C(\overline{Q})$ be such that
  \[
  2 &lt; p^- \le p(\cdot) \le p^+ &lt; 2^* := \frac{2d}{d-2},
  \]
  where
  $
  p^- := \essinf_{(x,t) \in Q} p(x,t)
  $
  and
  $
  p^+ := \esssup_{(x,t) \in Q} p(x,t).
  $
  Consider the reaction-diffusion parabolic problem
  \[
  (P) \quad \left\{\begin{array}{ll}
  \displaystyle\frac{u_t}{|x|^2} - \Delta u = k(t) \, |u|^{p(x,t)-2}u &amp; (x,t) \in \Omega \times (0,T),
  u(x,t) = 0, &amp; (x,t) \in \partial \Omega \times (0,T), \smallskip
  u(x,0) = u_0(x), &amp; x \in \Omega,
  \end{array}\right.
  \]
  where $T &gt; 0$ and $0 \ne u_0 \in W^{1,2}_0(\Omega)$.
  We investigate the existence and uniqueness of a weak solution to $(P)$.
  The upper and lower bounds on the blow-up time of the weak solution are also considered.</description>

      <title>Structural stability of three dimensional steady Prandtl equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The well-posedness of the three dimensional Prandtl equation is an outstanding open problem due to the appearance of the secondary flow even though there are studies on analytic and Gevrey function spaces. This problem is raised as the third open problem in the classical book by Oleinik and Samokhin [43]. This paper aims to address this open problem in the steady case by introducing a new approach to study the structural stability of background profile that includes the famous Blasius solutions. The key observations include the introduction of some intrinsic vector fields and new versions of maximum principle. In particular, we overcome the difficulties caused by symmetry breaking through the analysis on the curvature-type quantities generated by commutators of the vector fields.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behavior of complete conformal metric near singular boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The boundary behavior of the singular Yamabe problem has been extensively studied near sufficiently smooth boundaries, while less is known about the asymptotic behavior of solutions near singular boundaries. In this paper, we study the asymptotic behaviors of solutions to the singular Yamabe problem with negative constant scalar curvature near singular boundaries and derive the optimal estimates for the background metric which is not necessarily conformally flat. In particular, we prove that the solutions are well approximated by the solutions in tangent cones at singular points on the boundaries.</description>

      <title>Inverse elastic obstacle scattering problems by monotonicity method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the elastic wave scattering problem involving rigid obstacles. This work addresses the inverse problem of reconstructing the position and shape of such obstacles using far-field measurements. A novel monotonicity-based approach is developed for this purpose. By factorizing the far-field operator and utilizing the existence of localized wave functions, we derive a shape characterization criterion for the obstacle boundary. The proposed method employs monotonicity tests to determine the geometric relationship between any given test domain and the actual scatterer. As a result, the shape and location of rigid elastic obstacles can be uniquely identified without requiring any initial guesses or prior knowledge of the physical parameters of the homogeneous background medium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the existence of solutions \(u(t,x)\) of the Schr{\"o}dinger equation with a saturation nonlinear term \((u/|u|)\) having compact support, for each \(t&gt;0,\) that expands with a growth law of the type \(C\sqrt{t}\). The primary tool is considering the self-similar solution of the associated equation. For more information see https://ejde.math.txstate.edu/Volumes/2025/53/abstr.html</description>

      <title>Lipschitz stability for Bayesian inference in porous medium tissue growth models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a macroscopic model for the dynamics of living tissues incorporating pressure-driven dispersal and pressure-modulated proliferation. Given a power-law constitutive relation between the pressure and cell density, the model can be written as a porous medium equation with a growth term. We prove Lipschitz continuity of the mild solutions of the model with respect to the diffusion parameter (the exponent $\gamma$ in the pressure-density law) in the $L_1$ norm. While of independent analytical interest, our motivation for this result is to provide a vital step towards using Bayesian inverse problem methodology for parameter estimation based on experimental data -- such stability estimates are indispensable for applying sampling algorithms which rely on the gradient of the likelihood function.</description>

      <title>Periodic solutions for p(t)-Lienard equations with a singular nonlinearity of attractive type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are concerned with the existence of $T$-periodic solutions to an equation of type $$\left (|u'(t))|^{p(t)-2} u'(t) \right )'+f(u(t))u'(t)+g(u(t))=h(t)\quad \mbox{ in }[0,T]$$ where $p:[0,T]\to(1,\infty)$ with $p(0)=p(T)$ and $h$ are continuous on $[0,T]$, $f,g$ are also continuous on $[0,\infty)$, respectively $(0,\infty)$. The mapping $g$ may have an attractive singularity (i.e. $g(x) \to +\infty$ as $x\to 0+$). Our approach relies on a continuation theorem obtained in the recent paper M. Garc\'{i}a-Huidobro, R. Man\'{a}sevich, J. Mawhin and S. Tanaka, J. Differential Equations (2024), a priori estimates and method of lower and upper solutions.</description>

      <title>Existence and multiplicity of normalized solutions for the generalized Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation in $\mathbb{R}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the existence and {multiplicity} of nontrivial solitary waves for the generalized Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation with prescribed {$L^2$-norm} \begin{equation*}\label{Equation1}
  \left\{\begin{array}{l}
  \left(-u_{x x}+D_x^{-2} u_{y y}+\lambda u-f(u)\right)_x=0,{\quad x \in \mathbb{R}^2, } \\[10pt]
  \displaystyle \int_{\mathbb{R}^2}u^2 d x=a^2,
  \end{array}\right.%\tag{$\mathscr E_\lambda$} \end{equation*} where $a&gt;0$ and $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$ is an unknown parameter that appears as a Lagrange multiplier. For the case $f(t)=|t|^{q-2}t$, with $2&lt;q&lt;\frac{10}{3}$ ($L^2$-subcritical case) and $\frac{10}{3}&lt;q&lt;6$ ($L^2$-supercritical case), we establish the existence of normalized ground state solutions for the above equation. Moreover, when $f(t)=\mu|t|^{q-2}t+|t|^{p-2}t$, with $2&lt;q&lt;\frac{10}{3}&lt;p&lt;6$ and $\mu&gt;0$, we prove the existence of normalized ground state solutions which corresponds to a local minimum of the associated energy functional. In this case, we further show that there exists a sequence $(a_n) \subset (0,a_0)$ with $a_n \to 0$ as $n \to+\infty$, such that for each $a=a_n$, the problem admits a second solution with positive energy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that studies the existence of solutions for the generalized Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equations under the $L^2$-constraint, which we refer to them as the normalized solutions.</description>

      <title>Remarks on radial symmetry of stationary and uniformly-rotating solutions for the 2D Euler equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that any uniformly rotating solution of the 2D incompressible Euler equation with compactly supported vorticity $\omega$ must be radially symmetric whenever its angular velocity satisfies $\Omega \in (-\infty,\inf \omega / 2] \cup \, [ \sup \omega / 2, +\infty )$, in both the patch and smooth settings. This result extends the rigidity theorems established in \cite{Gom2021MR4312192} (\textit{Duke Math. J.},170(13):2957-3038, 2021), which were confined to the case of non-positive angular velocities and non-negative vorticity. Moreover, our results do not impose any regularity conditions on the patch beyond requiring that its boundary consists of Jordan curves, thereby refining the previous result to encompass irregular vortex patches.</description>

      <title>Existence of infinitely many homotopy classes from $\mathbb S^3$ to $\mathbb S^2$ having a minimimzing $W^{s,\frac 3s}$-harmonic map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1998 T. Rivi\`{e}re proved that there exist infinitely many homotopy classes of $\pi_3(\mathbb S^2)$ having a minimizing 3-harmonic map. This result is especially surprising taking into account that in $\pi_3(\mathbb S^3)$ there are only three homotopy classes (corresponding to the degrees $\{-1,0,1\}$) in which a minimizer exists.
  We extend this theorem in the framework of fractional harmonic maps and prove that for $s\in(0,1)$ there exist infinitely many homotopy classes of $\pi_{3}(\mathbb S^{2})$ in which there is a minimizing $W^{s,\frac{3}{s}}$-harmonic map.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness for the ILW equation in $H^s(\mathbb{T})$ for $s&gt;-\frac12$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the intermediate long wave (ILW) equation is globally well-posed in the Sobolev spaces $H^s(\mathbb{T})$ for $s &gt; -\frac12$. The previous record for well-posedness was $s\geq 0$, and the system is known to be ill-posed for $s&lt;-\frac12$. We then demonstrate that the solutions of ILW converge to those of the Benjamin--Ono equation in $H^s(\mathbb{T})$ in the infinite-depth limit.
  Our methods do not rely on the complete integrability of ILW, but rather treat ILW as a perturbation of the Benjamin--Ono equation by a linear term of order zero. To highlight this, we establish a general well-posedness result for such perturbations, which also applies to the Smith equation for continental-shelf waves.</description>

      <title>Boundary regularity for subelliptic equations in the Heisenberg group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove boundary H\"older and Lipschitz regularity for a class of degenerate elliptic, second order, inhomogeneous equations in non-divergence form structured on the left-invariant vector fields of the Heisenberg group. Our focus is on the case of operators with bounded and measurable coefficients and bounded right-hand side; when necessary, we impose a dimensional restriction on the ellipticity ratio and a growth rate for the source term near characteristic points of the boundary. For solutions in the characteristic half-space $\{t&gt;0\}$, we obtain an intrinsic second order expansion near the origin when the source term belongs to an appropriate weighted $L^{\infty}$ space; this is a new result even for the frequently studied sub-Laplacian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a resolvent problem arising from the $Q$-tensor model for liquid crystal flows in the half-space. Our purpose is to show the $\mathcal{R}$-boundedness for the solution operator families of the resolvent problem when the resolvent parameter lies near the origin. The definition of the $\mathcal{R}$-solvability implies the uniform boundedness of the operator and, consequently, the resolvent estimates for the linear system.</description>

      <title>Symmetry breaking for local minimizers of a free discontinuity problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a functional defined on the class of piecewise constant functions, combining a jump penalization, which discourages discontinuities, with a fidelity term that penalizes deviations from a given linear function, called the forcing term.
  In one dimension, it is not difficult to see that local minimizers form staircases that approximate the forcing term. Here we show that in two dimensions symmetry breaking occurs, leading to the emergence of exotic minimizers whose level sets are not simple stripes with boundaries orthogonal to the gradient of the forcing term.
  The proof relies on the calibration method for free discontinuity problems.</description>

      <title>BridgeNet: A Hybrid, Physics-Informed Machine Learning Framework for Solving High-Dimensional Fokker-Planck Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: BridgeNet is a novel hybrid framework that integrates convolutional neural networks with physics-informed neural networks to efficiently solve non-linear, high-dimensional Fokker-Planck equations (FPEs). Traditional PINNs, which typically rely on fully connected architectures, often struggle to capture complex spatial hierarchies and enforce intricate boundary conditions. In contrast, BridgeNet leverages adaptive CNN layers for effective local feature extraction and incorporates a dynamically weighted loss function that rigorously enforces physical constraints. Extensive numerical experiments across various test cases demonstrate that BridgeNet not only achieves significantly lower error metrics and faster convergence compared to conventional PINN approaches but also maintains robust stability in high-dimensional settings. This work represents a substantial advancement in computational physics, offering a scalable and accurate solution methodology with promising applications in fields ranging from financial mathematics to complex system dynamics.</description>

      <title>Random dynamics and invariant measures for a class of non-Newtonian fluids of differential type on 2D and 3D Poincar\'e domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we consider a class of incompressible stochastic third-grade fluids (non-Newtonian fluids) equations on two- as well as three-dimensional Poincar\'e domains $\mathcal{O}$ (which may be bounded or unbounded). Our aims are to study the well-posedness and asymptotic analysis for the solutions of the underlying system. Firstly, we prove that the underlying system defined on $\mathcal{O}$ has a unique weak solution (in the analytic sense) under Dirichlet boundary condition and it also generates random dynamical system $\Psi$. Secondly, we consider the underlying system on bounded domains. Using the compact Sobolev embedding $\mathbb{H}^1(\mathcal{O}) \hookrightarrow\mathbb{L}^2(\mathcal{O})$, we prove the existence of a unique random attractor for the underlying system on bounded domains with external forcing in $\mathbb{H}^{-1}(\mathcal{O})+\mathbb{W}^{-1,\frac{4}{3}}(\mathcal{O})$. Thirdly, we consider the underlying system on unbounded Poincar\'e domains with external forcing in $\mathbb{L}^{2}(\mathcal{O})$ and show the existence of a unique random attractor. In order to obtain the existence of a unique random attractor on unbounded domains, due to the lack of compact Sobolev embedding $\mathbb{H}^1(\mathcal{O}) \hookrightarrow\mathbb{H}^2(\mathcal{O})$, we use the uniform-tail estimates method which helps us to demonstrate the asymptotic compactness of $\Psi$.
  Note that due to the presence of several nonlinear terms in the underlying system, we are not able to use the energy equality method to obtain the asymptotic compactness of $\Psi$ in unbounded domains, which makes the analysis of this work in unbounded domains more difficult and interesting. Finally, as a consequence of the existence of random attractors, we address the existence of invariant measures for underlying system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A method is presented for the fast evaluation of the transient acoustic field generated outside a spherical surface by sources inside the surface. The method employs Lebedev quadratures, which are the optimal method for spatial integration, and Lagrange interpolation and differentiation in an advanced time algorithm for the evaluation of the transient field. Numerical testing demonstrates that the approach gives near machine-precision accuracy and a speed-up in evaluation time which depends on the order of quadrature rule employed but breaks even with direct evaluation at a number of field points about 1.15 times the number of surface quadrature nodes.</description>

      <title>Conservation Laws and Boundedness for Linearised Einstein--Maxwell Equations on the Reissner--Nordstr\"om Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the linearised Einstein--Maxwell equations on the Reissner--Nordstr\"om spacetime and derive the canonical energy conservation law in double null gauge. In the spirit of the work of Holzegel and the second author, we avoid any use of the hyperbolic nature of the Teukolsky equations and rely solely on the conservation law to establish control of energy fluxes for the gauge-invariant Teukolsky variables, previously identified by the third author, along all outgoing null hypersurfaces, for charge-to-mass ratio $\frac{|Q|}{M} &lt; \frac{\sqrt{15}}{4}$. This yields uniform boundedness for the Teukolsky variables in Reissner--Nordstr\"om.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study limits at infinity for homogeneous Hajlasz-Sobolev functions defined on uniformly perfect metric spaces equipped with a doubling measure. We prove that a quasicontinuous representative of such a function has a pointwise limit at infinity outside an exceptional set, defined in terms of a variational relative capacity. Our framework refines earlier approaches that relied on Hausdorff content rather than relative capacity, and it extends previous results for homogeneous Newtonian and fractional Sobolev functions.</description>

Abstract: This paper is devoted to the construction of approximations of the propagator associated with a semi-classical matrix-valued Schr\"odinger operator with symbol presenting smooth eigenvalues crossings. Inspired by the approach of the theoretical chemists Herman and Kluk who propagated continuous superpositions of Gaussian wave-packets for scalar equations, we consider frozen and thawed Gaussian initial value representations that incorporate classical transport and branching processes along a hopping hypersurface. Based on the Gaussian wave-packet framework, our result relies on an accurate analysis of the solutions of the associated Schr\"odinger equation for data that are vector-valued wave-packets. We prove that these solutions are asymptotic to wavepackets at any order in terms of the semi-classical parameter.</description>

Abstract: We consider the uniqueness of the following positive solutions of $m$-Laplacian equation: \begin{equation} \left\{ \begin{aligned} -\Delta _m u&amp;=\lambda u^{m-1}+u^{p-1} \quad \text{in} \quad \Omega\\ u&amp;=0 \quad \text{on} \quad \partial \Omega \end{aligned} \right. \qquad(0.1)\end{equation} where $m&gt;1$ is a constant. When $p\rightarrow m$, the uniqueness of positive solutions of $(0.1)$ is shown which is based on the essential uniqueness of first eigenfunction for $m$-Laplacian equation. Futhermore, we also prove the uniqueness results when $(0.1)$ is a perturbation of Laplacian equation.</description>

      <title>Extended Sobolev scale for vector bundles, and its applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an extended Sobolev scale for smooth vector bundles over a smooth closed manifold. This scale is built on the base of inner product distribution spaces of generalized smoothness given by an arbitrary positive function OR-varying at infinity. We show that this scale is obtained by the quadratic interpolation (with a function parameter) between inner product Sobolev spaces, is closed with respect to the quadratic interpolation, and consists of all Hilbert spaces that are interpolation spaces between inner product Sobolev spaces. Embedding theorems and a duality theorem are proved for this scale. We give applications of the extended Sobolev scale to mixed-order (Douglis--Nirenberg) elliptic pseudodifferential operators acting between vector bundles of the same rank. We prove their Fredholm property on appropriate pairs of spaces on the scale, give a sufficient and necessary condition for the local generalized smoothness of solutions to a mixed-order elliptic system and provide a corresponding a priori estimate of the solutions. We also give a sufficient condition for a chosen component of the solution to be $q$ times continuously differentiable on a subset of the manifold.</description>

      <title>Lie Symmetry Net: Preserving Conservation Laws in Modelling Financial Market Dynamics via Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09189v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper employs a novel Lie symmetries-based framework to model the intrinsic symmetries within financial market. Specifically, we introduce Lie symmetry net (LSN), which characterises the Lie symmetries of the differential equations (DE) estimating financial market dynamics, such as the Black-Scholes equation. To simulate these differential equations in a symmetry-aware manner, LSN incorporates a Lie symmetry risk derived from the conservation laws associated with the Lie symmetry operators of the target differential equations. This risk measures how well the Lie symmetries are realised and guides the training of LSN under the structural risk minimisation framework. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that LSN effectively realises the Lie symmetries and achieves an error reduction of more than one order of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://github.com/Jxl163/LSN_code.</description>

      <title>On the refined analyticity radius of 3-D generalized Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the instantaneous growth of analyticity radius for three dimensional generalized Navier-Stokes equations. For the subcritical $H^{\gamma}(\mathbb R^3)$ case with $\gamma&gt;\frac12,$ we prove that there exists a positive time $t_0$ so that for any $t\in]0, t_0]$, the radius of analyticity of the solution $u$ satisfies the pointwise-in-time lower bound $${\mathrm{rad}}(u)(t)\ge \sqrt{(2\gamma-1)t\bigl(|\ln t|+\ln|\ln t|+K_t\bigr)},$$ where $K_t \to \infty$ as $t\to 0^+$. This in particular gives a nontrivial improvement of the previous result by Herbst and Skibsted in \cite{HS} for the case $\gamma\in ]1/2,3/2[$ and also settles the decade-long open question in \cite{HS}, namely, whether or not
  $\liminf_{t\to 0^+}\frac {{\mathrm{ rad}}(u)(t)}{\sqrt{t|\ln t|}}\ge \sqrt{2\gamma-1}$ for all $\gamma\ge \frac32$. For the critical case $H^{\frac 12}(\mathbb R^3)$, we prove that there exists $t_1&gt;0$ so that for any $t\in ]0, t_1],$ ${\mathrm {rad}}(u)(t)\ge \lambda(t)\sqrt{t}$ with $\lambda(t)$ satisfying $\lim_{t\to 0^+}\lambda(t)=\infty.$</description>

      <title>On existence of Sadovskii vortex patch: A touching pair of symmetric counter-rotating uniform vortex</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11379v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Sadovskii vortex patch is a traveling wave for the two-dimensional incompressible Euler equations consisting of an odd symmetric pair of vortex patches touching the symmetry axis. Its existence was first suggested by numerical computations of Sadovskii in [J. Appl. Math. Mech., 1971], and has gained significant interest due to its relevance in inviscid limit of planar flows via Prandtl--Batchelor theory and as the asymptotic state for vortex ring dynamics. In this work, we prove the existence of a Sadovskii vortex patch, by solving the energy maximization problem under the exact impulse condition and an upper bound on the circulation.</description>

      <title>Structural stability of supersonic spiral flows with large angular velocity for the Euler-Poisson system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper concerns the structural stability of smooth cylindrically symmetric supersonic spiral flows with large angular velocity for the steady Euler-Poisson system in a concentric cylinder. We establish the existence and uniqueness of some smooth supersonic Euler-Poisson flows with nonzero angular velocity and vorticity including both cylindrical spiral flows and axisymmetric spiral flows. The deformation-curl-Poisson decomposition for the steady Euler-Poisson system is utilized to deal with the hyperbolic-elliptic mixed structure in the supersonic region. For smooth cylindrical supersonic spiral flows, the key point lies on the well-posedness of a boundary value problem for a linear second order hyperbolic-elliptic coupled system, which is achieved by finding an appropriate multiplier to obtain the important basic energy estimates. The nonlinear structural stability is established by designing a two-layer iteration and combining the estimates for the hyperbolic-elliptic system and the transport equations. For smooth axisymmetric supersonic spiral flows, we use the special structure of the steady Euler-Poisson system to derive a priori estimates of the linearized second order elliptic system, which enable us to establish the structural stability of the background supersonic flow within the class of axisymmetric flows.</description>

      <title>Dynamics and leapfrogging phenomena of multiple helical vortices for 3D incompressible Euler equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12240v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the time evolution of multiple interacted helical vortices without swirl for the incompressible Euler equations in $\mathbb R^3$. Assuming that the initial helical symmetric vorticity is concentrated within an $\ep$ neighborhood of $N$ distinct helices with vanishing mutual distance of order $O(\frac{1}{|\ln \ep|})$, and each vortex core possesses a vorticity mass of order $O(\frac{1}{|\ln \ep|^2})$, we show that as $\ep\to 0$, the motion of the helical vortices converges to a dynamical system for positive times. Notably, in the case of two interacting helical vortices with initial mutual separation $ \frac{\rho_0}{|\ln \ep|}$, by selecting sufficiently small $\rho_0$, our analysis extends to longer timescales encompassing several periods. This result provides the first mathematical justification for the phenomena in numerical observation termed "leapfrogging of Kelvin waves" reported in e.g. [N. Hietala et al., Phys. Rev. Fluids, 2016].</description>

Abstract: We investigate the inverse Cauchy and data completion problems for elliptic partial differential equations in a bounded domain $D \subset \mathbb{R}^d$, $d \ge 2$, with a special emphasis on the steady-state heat conduction in anisotropic media. More precisely, boundary conditions are prescribed on an accessible part of the boundary $\varnothing \neq \Gamma_0 \subsetneqq \partial{D}$ and/or internal conditions are available inside the domain $D$ and the aim is to reconstruct the solution to these inverse problems in the domain and on the inaccessible remaining boundary $\Gamma_1 := \partial{D} \setminus \Gamma_0$. Although such severely ill-posed problems have been studied intensively in the past decades, deriving efficient methods for approximating their solution still remains challenging in the general setting, e.g., in high dimensions, for solutions and/or domains with singularities, in complex geometries, etc. Herein, we derive a fundamental probabilistic framework for the stable reconstruction of the solution to the Cauchy and data completion problems in steady-state anisotropic heat conduction, as well as enhancing the knowledge on the impact of the geometry of the domain $D$ and the structure of the conductivity tensor $\mathbf{K}$ on the stability of these inverse problems. This is achieved in three steps: ({\it i}) the spectrum of the direct problem is simulated using stochastic estimators; ({\it ii}) the singular value decomposition of the corresponding direct operator is performed; and ({\it iii}) for the prescribed measurements, a natural subspace of approximate solutions is constructed. This approach is based on elliptic measures, in conjunction with probabilistic representations and parallel Monte Carlo simulations. Thorough numerical simulations performed on GPU, for various two- and three-dimensional geometries, are also provided.</description>
