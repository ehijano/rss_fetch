      <title>Derived $\Gamma$-Geometry, Sheaf Cohomology, and Homological Functors on the Spectrum of Commutative Ternary $\Gamma$-Semirings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a comprehensive geometric and homological framework for derived Gamma-geometry, extending the theory of commutative ternary Gamma-semirings established in our earlier works. Building upon the ideal-theoretic, computational, and categorical foundations of Papers A to D (Rao 2025A, Rao 2025B1, Rao 2025B2, Rao 2025C, Rao 2025D), the present study constructs the algebraic and geometric infrastructure necessary to place Gamma-semirings within the modern language of derived and categorical geometry.
  We define the affine Gamma-spectrum Spec_Gamma(T) together with its structure sheaf O_{Spec_Gamma(T)}, establishing a Zariski-type topology adapted to ternary Gamma-operations. In this setting, the category of Gamma-modules is shown to be additive, exact, and monoidal-closed, supporting derived functors Ext_Gamma and Tor^Gamma, whose existence is ensured through explicit projective and injective resolutions. The derived category D(T-Gamma-Mod) is then constructed to host homological dualities and Serre-type vanishing theorems, culminating in a categorical analogue of the Serre-Swan correspondence (Swan 1962, Gelfand 1960) for Gamma-modules.
  Geometric and categorical unification is achieved through fibered and derived Gamma-stacks, which provide a natural environment for studying morphisms of affine Gamma-schemes and cohomological descent. The theory connects with noncommutative geometry and higher-arity (n-ary) generalizations, showing that derived Gamma-geometry forms a coherent homological universe capable of expressing algebraic, geometric, and physical dualities within one categorical law. Computational methods for finite Gamma-semirings and applications to mathematical physics, where ternary operations model triadic couplings, are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Structure and Spectral Theory of Non-Commutative and $n$-ary $\Gamma$-Semirings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops the structural and spectral foundations of noncommutative and n-ary Gamma semirings, extending the commutative ternary framework established in earlier studies. We introduce left, right, and two-sided ideals in the noncommutative setting, derive quotient characterizations of prime and semiprime ideals, and construct corresponding Gamma-Jacobson radicals. For general n-ary operations, we define (n,m)-type ideals and establish diagonal criteria for n-ary primeness and semiprimeness. A unified radical theory and a Zariski-type spectral topology are then formulated, connecting primitive ideals with simple module representations. The results culminate in a noncommutative Wedderburn-Artin-type decomposition, revealing a triadic spectral geometry that unifies commutative, noncommutative, and higher-arity cases</description>

      <title>Essential Dimension of Central Simple Algebras when the Characteristic is Bad</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a survey of the existing literature, the state of the art, and a few minor new results and open questions regarding the essential dimension of central simple algebras and finite sequences of such algebras over fields whose characteristic divides the degree of the algebras under discussion. Upper and lower bounds as well as a few precise evaluations of this dimension are included.</description>

      <title>(projectively coresolved) Gorenstein flat modules over tensor rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $T_R(M)$ be a tensor ring, where $R$ is a ring and $M$ is an $N$-nilpotent $R$-bimodule. Under certain conditions, we characterize projectively coresolved Gorenstein flat modules over $T_R(M)$, showing that a $T_R(M)$ module $(X,u)$ is projectively coresolved Gorenstein flat if and only if $u$ is monomorphic and $coker(u)$ is a projectively coresolved Gorenstein flat $R$-module. A class of Gorenstein at modules over $T_R(M)$ are also explicitly described. We discuss applications to trivial ring extensions and Morita context rings.</description>

      <title>From quantum groups to quantum cluster algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a homomorphism of algebras from the quantum group $\mathbf{U}^+_v(\mathfrak{g})$ to the corresponding quantum cluster algebra $\mathcal {A}_q$ with principal coefficients. As a by-product, we show that the quantum cluster variables arising from one-step mutations from the initial cluster variables satisfy the (high order) quantum Serre relations in $\mathcal {A}_q$.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we first prove a general result in topology which asserts that every quasi-component of a quasi-spectral space is connected. As an important application, the structure of all connected components of a quasi-compact quasi-separated (qcqs) scheme $X$ are fully understood. They are exactly of the form ...</description>

      <title>The $q$-deformed random-to-random family in the Hecke algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17580v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize Reiner--Saliola--Welker's well-known but mysterious family of *$k$-random-to-random shuffles* from Markov chains on symmetric groups to Markov chains on the Type-$A$ Iwahori--Hecke algebras. We prove that the family of operators pairwise commutes and has eigenvalues that are polynomials in $q$ with non-negative integer coefficients. Our work generalizes work of Reiner--Saliola--Welker and Lafreni\`ere for the symmetric group, and simplifies all known proofs in this case.</description>

      <title>Tropicalization and cluster asymptotic phenomenon of generalized Markov equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The generalized Markov equations are deeply connected with the generalized cluster algebras of Markov type. We construct a deformed Fock-Goncharov tropicalization for the generalized Markov equations and prove that their tropicalized tree structure is essentially the same as that of the classical Euclid tree. We then define the generalized Euclid tree and prove that it converges to the classical Euclid tree up to a scalar multiple. Moreover, by means of cluster mutations, we exhibit an asymptotic phenomenon, up to some limit q, between the logarithmic generalized Markov tree and the classical Euclid tree. A rationality conjecture of q is then put forward. We also propose a generalized Markov uniqueness conjecture for the generalized Markov equations, which illustrates an application of the asymptotic phenomenon.</description>
