      <title>Solving Min-Cost Concave Generalized Dynamic Flows and Approximating Dynamic Optimal Power Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assuming power travels instantaneously, can be steered by us, and is lost quadratically in each power line, the dynamic optimal power flow problem simplifies to a min-cost dynamic generalized flow with quadratic losses (MCDGFWQL) problem. As this is a special case of the min-cost concave dynamic generalized flow (MCCDGF) problem, we derive both general results for the MCCDGF problem and stronger results for the MCDGFWQL problem.
  Our main contribution is a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme for a mild restriction of the MCDGFWQL problem. We also implement and benchmark a slight modification of this algorithm, finding it to be efficient in practice, with a slightly superlinear and possibly subquadratic dependence of execution time on the edge count of the input graph.
  Our secondary contributions are the derivation of a reduction from the MCCDGF problem to a convex program and a corresponding sensitivity analysis of the MCCDGF problem. We also provide a brief comparison of our dynamic optimal power flow simplification and the classic direct current simplification and point out some interesting directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Randomized Greedy Methods for Weak Submodular Sensor Selection with Robustness Considerations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a pair of budget- and performance-constrained weak submodular maximization problems. For computational efficiency, we explore the use of stochastic greedy algorithms which limit the search space via random sampling instead of the standard greedy procedure which explores the entire feasible search space. We propose a pair of stochastic greedy algorithms, namely, Modified Randomized Greedy (MRG) and Dual Randomized Greedy (DRG) to approximately solve the budget- and performance-constrained problems, respectively. For both algorithms, we derive approximation guarantees that hold with high probability. We then examine the use of DRG in robust optimization problems wherein the objective is to maximize the worst-case of a number of weak submodular objectives and propose the Randomized Weak Submodular Saturation Algorithm (Random-WSSA). We further derive a high-probability guarantee for when Random-WSSA successfully constructs a robust solution. Finally, we showcase the effectiveness of these algorithms in a variety of relevant uses within the context of Earth-observing LEO constellations which estimate atmospheric weather conditions and provide Earth coverage.</description>

      <title>Finite-time Linear-Quadratic Optimal Control of Partial Differential-Algebraic Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finite-time linear-quadratic control of partial differential-algebraic equations (PDAEs) is considered. The discussion is restricted to those that are radial with index $0$; this corresponds to a nilpotency degree of 1. We establish the existence of a unique minimizing optimal control. A projection is used to derive a system of differential Riccati-like equation coupled with an algebraic equation, yielding the solution of the optimization problem in a feedback form. This generalizes the well-known result for PDEs to this class of PDAEs. These equations and hence the optimal control can be calculated without construction of the projected PDAE. Finally, we provide numerical simulations to illustrate application of the theoretical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mathematical Program Networks (MPNs) are introduced in this work. A MPN is a collection of interdependent Mathematical Programs (MPs) which are to be solved simultaneously, while respecting the connectivity pattern of the network defining their relationships. The network structure of an MPN impacts which decision variables each constituent mathematical program can influence, either directly or indirectly via solution graph constraints representing optimal decisions for their decedents. This framework unifies many existing problem formulations, such as Nash Equilibrium problems; bi-, tri-, and multi-level optimization problems, and Equilibrium Programs with Equilibrium Constraints (EPECs). Computing equilibrium points for any of these specific problem formulations would typically require dedicated algorithms and solver code. Within the presented framework, a collection of decision problems can be solved under various network structures, all using the same framework and algorithms. The presented framework not only enables easier exploration of existing equilibrium definitions and problems, but also facilitates the imagining of many other interesting networks of mathematical programs.</description>

      <title>An Optimal Control Problem Arising in Sailboat Trajectory Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate the optimal control problem for a sailboat that seeks to reach an upwind buoy, under the hypothesis that the wind speed is constant and the wind direction is a Brownian motion. The yacht moves in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and the target is a ball of radius $\eta \geq 0$ centered at the origin. The yacht can be subject to a tacking cost $c\geq 0$. We consider three control problems depending on the value of the parameters: the first one corresponds to the case $\eta =0$, $c=0$, the second to the case $\eta &gt;0$, $c=0$, and the third to the case $\eta \geq 0$, $c&gt;0$. We define the control problems, and prove that their value function is finite. We guess the optimal strategy $A^\star$ for $\eta \geq 0$, $c=0$. The process controlled by $A^\star$ has non continuous and unbounded coefficients near the origin, so the standard results on existence and uniqueness of a strong solution do not apply. We provide a proof using the Yamada-Watanabe argument.</description>

      <title>SLS-BRD: A system-level approach to seeking generalised feedback Nash equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes a policy learning algorithm for generalised feedback Nash equilibrium seeking in $N_P$-players non-cooperative dynamic games. We consider linear-quadratic games with stochastic dynamics and design a best-response dynamics in which players update and communicate a parametrisation of their state-feedback policies. Our approach leverages the System Level Synthesis (SLS) framework to formulate each player's update rule as the solution of a tractable robust optimisation problem. Under certain conditions, the conditions and rates of convergence can be established. The algorithm is showcased for an exemplary problem from decentralised control of multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>Minimal hyperbolic polynomials and ranks of homogeneous cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The starting point of this paper is the computation of minimal hyperbolic polynomials of duals of cones arising from chordal sparsity patterns. From that, we investigate the relation between ranks of homogeneous cones and their minimal polynomials. Along the way, we answer in the negative a question posed in an earlier paper and show examples of homogeneous cones that cannot be realized as rank-one generated (ROG) hyperbolicity cones.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Impact of Coalitions between EV Charging Stations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of electric vehicles (EVs) is driving the expansion of charging infrastructure globally. This expansion, however, places significant charging demand on the electricity grid, impacting grid operations and electricity pricing. While coordination among all charging stations is beneficial, it may not be always feasible. However, a subset of charging stations, which could be jointly operated by a company, could coordinate to decide their charging profile. In this paper we investigate whether such coalitions between charging stations is better than no coordination.
  We model EV charging as a non-cooperative aggregative game, where each station's cost is determined by both monetary payments tied to reactive electricity prices on the grid and its sensitivity to deviations from a nominal charging profile. We consider a solution concept that we call $\mathcal{C}$-Nash equilibrium, which is tied to a coalition $\mathcal{C}$ of charging stations coordinating to reduce their cumulative costs. We provide sufficient conditions, in terms of the demand and sensitivity of charging stations, to determine when independent (uncoordinated) operation of charging stations could result in lower overall costs to charging stations, the coalition, and charging stations outside the coalition. Somewhat counter to intuition, we demonstrate scenarios where allowing charging stations to operate independently is better than coordinating as a coalition. Jointly, these results provide operators of charging stations insights into how to coordinate their charging behavior, and open several research directions.</description>

      <title>Fuel-Optimal Trajectory Planning for Lunar Vertical Landing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a trajectory planning problem arising from a lunar vertical landing with minimum fuel consumption. The vertical landing requirement is written as a final steering angle constraint, and a nonnegative regularization term is proposed to modify the cost functional. In this way, the final steering angle constraint will be inherently satisfied according to Pontryagin's Minimum Principle. As a result, the modified optimal steering angle has to be determined by solving a transcendental equation. To this end, a transforming procedure is employed, which allows for finding the desired optimal steering angle by a simple bisection method. Consequently, the modified optimal control problem can be solved by the indirect shooting method. Finally, some numerical examples are presented to demonstrate and verify the developments of the paper.</description>

      <title>Distributed Optimization for Energy Grids: A Tutorial on ADMM and ALADIN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ongoing transition towards energy and power systems dominated by a large number of renewable power injections to the distribution grid poses substantial challenges for system operation, coordination, and control. Optimization-based methods for coordination and control are of substantial research interest in this context. Hence, this chapter provides a tutorial introduction of distributed optimization algorithms for energy systems with a large share of renewables. Specifically, we focus on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) and on the Augmented Lagrangian Alternating Direction Inexact Newton (ALADIN) method as both algorithms are frequently considered for coordination and control of power and energy systems. We discuss the application of ALADIN and ADMM to AC optimal power flow problems and to energy management problems. Moreover, we give an outlook on open problems.</description>

      <title>The quadratic tracking problem for systems with persistent memory in $\zzr^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical quadratic regulator problem has rarely been studied for systems with persistent memory until recent times. In this paper we study the quadratic tracking problem on a \emph{ finite time horizon} for a system described by a controlled linear Volterra integrodifferential equation in $\zzr^d$. We use the Fredholm equation approach and we derive the synthesis of the optimal control in terms of a Riccati differential equation, independent of the reference signal, and of two equations which instead depend on the reference signal. In the final section we introduce a representation of the system in a state space \emph{of finite memory } (as the tracking problem under study) and we show that the equations used in the synthesis can be formulated as a differential system in this space. This fact has to be contrasted with the semigroup approach which requires that the system be recasted in a space of infinite memory.</description>

      <title>Hardness of circuit and monotone diameters of polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Circuit diameter of polytopes was introduced by Borgwardt, Finhold and Hemmecke as a fundamental tool for the study of circuit augmentation schemes for linear programming and for estimating combinatorial diameters. Determining the complexity of computing the circuit diameter of polytopes was posed as an open problem by Sanit\`a as well as by Kafer, and was recently reiterated by Borgwardt, Grewe, Kafer, Lee and Sanit\`a.
  In this paper, we solve this problem by showing that computing the circuit diameter of a polytope given in halfspace-description is strongly NP-hard. To prove this result, we show that computing the combinatorial diameter of the perfect matching polytope of a bipartite graph is NP-hard. This complements a result by Sanit\`a (FOCS 2018) on the NP-hardness of computing the diameter of fractional matching polytopes and implies the new result that computing the diameter of a $\{0,1\}$-polytope is strongly NP-hard, which may be of independent interest. In our second main result, we give a precise graph-theoretic description of the monotone diameter of perfect matching polytopes and use this description to prove that computing the monotone (circuit) diameter of a given input polytope is strongly NP-hard as well.</description>

      <title>Adaptive generalized conditional gradient method for multiobjective optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a generalized conditional gradient method for multiobjective optimization, which can be viewed as an improved extension of the classical Frank-Wolfe (conditional gradient) method for single-objective optimization. The proposed method works for both constrained and unconstrained benchmark multiobjective optimization problems, where the objective function is the summation of a smooth function and a possibly nonsmooth convex function. The method combines the so-called normalized descent direction as an adaptive procedure and the line search technique. We prove the convergence of the algorithm with respect to Pareto optimality under mild assumptions. The iteration complexity for obtaining an approximate Pareto critical point and the convergence rate in terms of a merit function is also analyzed. Finally, we report some numerical results, which demonstrate the feasibility and competitiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>The link between $1$-norm approximation and effective Positivstellensatze for the hypercube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Schm\"udgen's Positivstellensatz gives a certificate to verify positivity of a strictly positive polynomial $f$ on a compact, basic, semi-algebraic set $\mathbf{K} \subset \mathbb{R}^n$. A Positivstellensatz of this type is called effective if one may bound the degrees of the polynomials appearing in the certificate in terms of properties of $f$. If $\mathbf{K} = [-1,1]^n$ and $0 &lt; f_\min := \min_{x \in \mathbf{K}} f(x)$, then the degrees of the polynomials appearing in the certificate may be bounded by $O\left(\sqrt{\frac{f_\max - f_\min}{f_\min}}\right)$, where $f_\max := \max_{x \in \mathbf{K}} f(x)$, as was recently shown by Laurent and Slot [Optimization Letters 17:515-530, 2023]. The big-O notation suppresses dependence on $n$ and the degree $d$ of $f$. In this paper we show a similar result, but with a better dependence on $n$ and $d$. In particular, our bounds depend on the $1$-norm of the coefficients of $f$, that may readily be calculated.</description>

      <title>Train timetabling with rolling stock assignment, short-turning and skip-stop strategy for a bidirectional metro line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metro train operations is becoming more challenging due to overcrowding and unpredictable irregular passenger demand. To avoid passenger dissatisfaction, metro operators employ various operational strategies to increase the number of train services using limited number of trains. This paper integrates metro timetabling with several operational strategies to improve passenger services with limited number of trains. We propose three optimization models for timetable planning during both peak and off-peak hours: The first model aims to minimize operational costs, the second aims to minimize passenger waiting time, and the third is a multi-objective optimization model that considers both objectives simultaneously. These models integrate operational strategies such as rolling-stock assignment, short-turning, and skip-stop strategies to increase the number of services with limited trains on a bidirectional metro line. The paper also provides detailed calculations for train services, running times, and station dwell times. The proposed models are then implemented on a simplified Santiago metro line 1.</description>

      <title>Polyhedral Analysis of Quadratic Optimization Problems with Stieltjes Matrices and Indicators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider convex quadratic optimization problems with indicators on the continuous variables. In particular, we assume that the Hessian of the quadratic term is a Stieltjes matrix, which naturally appears in sparse graphical inference problems and others. We describe an explicit convex formulation for the problem by studying the Stieltjes polyhedron arising as part of an extended formulation and exploiting the supermodularity of a set function defined on its extreme points. Our computational results confirm that the proposed convex relaxation provides an exact optimal solution and may be an effective alternative, especially for instances with large integrality gaps that are challenging with the standard approaches.</description>

      <title>Heat Death of Generative Models in Closed-Loop Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Improvement and adoption of generative machine learning models is rapidly accelerating, as exemplified by the popularity of LLMs (Large Language Models) for text, and diffusion models for image generation.As generative models become widespread, data they generate is incorporated into shared content through the public web. This opens the question of what happens when data generated by a model is fed back to the model in subsequent training campaigns. This is a question about the stability of the training process, whether the distribution of publicly accessible content, which we refer to as "knowledge", remains stable or collapses.
  Small scale empirical experiments reported in the literature show that this closed-loop training process is prone to degenerating. Models may start producing gibberish data, or sample from only a small subset of the desired data distribution (a phenomenon referred to as mode collapse). So far there has been only limited theoretical understanding of this process, in part due to the complexity of the deep networks underlying these generative models.
  The aim of this paper is to provide insights into this process (that we refer to as "generative closed-loop learning") by studying the learning dynamics of generative models that are fed back their own produced content in addition to their original training dataset. The sampling of many of these models can be controlled via a "temperature" parameter. Using dynamical systems tools, we show that, unless a sufficient amount of external data is introduced at each iteration, any non-trivial temperature leads the model to asymptotically degenerate. In fact, either the generative distribution collapses to a small set of outputs, or becomes uniform over a large set of outputs.</description>

      <title>Robust finite element solvers for distributed hyperbolic optimal control problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose, analyze, and test new robust iterative solvers for systems of linear algebraic equations arising from the space-time finite element discretization of reduced optimality systems defining the approximate solution of hyperbolic distributed, tracking-type optimal control problems with both the standard $L^2$ and the more general energy regularizations. In contrast to the usual time-stepping approach, we discretize the optimality system by space-time continuous piecewise-linear finite element basis functions which are defined on fully unstructured simplicial meshes. If we aim at the asymptotically best approximation of the given desired state $y_d$ by the computed finite element state $y_{\varrho h}$, then the optimal choice of the regularization parameter $\varrho$ is linked to the space-time finite element mesh-size $h$ by the relations $\varrho=h^4$ and $\varrho=h^2$ for the $L^2$ and the energy regularization, respectively. For this setting, we can construct robust (parallel) iterative solvers for the reduced finite element optimality systems. These results can be generalized to variable regularization parameters adapted to the local behavior of the mesh-size that can heavily change in the case of adaptive mesh refinements. The numerical results illustrate the theoretical findings firmly.</description>

      <title>Localized Distributional Robustness in Submodular Multi-Task Subset Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we approach the problem of multi-task submodular optimization with the perspective of local distributional robustness, within the neighborhood of a reference distribution which assigns an importance score to each task. We initially propose to introduce a regularization term which makes use of the relative entropy to the standard multi-task objective. We then demonstrate through duality that this novel formulation itself is equivalent to the maximization of a submodular function, which may be efficiently carried out through standard greedy selection methods. This approach bridges the existing gap in the optimization of performance-robustness trade-offs in multi-task subset selection. To numerically validate our theoretical results, we test the proposed method in two different setting, one involving the selection of satellites in low Earth orbit constellations in the context of a sensor selection problem, and the other involving an image summarization task using neural networks. Our method is compared with two other algorithms focused on optimizing the performance of the worst-case task, and on directly optimizing the performance on the reference distribution itself. We conclude that our novel formulation produces a solution that is locally distributional robust, and computationally inexpensive.</description>

      <title>Derivative-free tree optimization for complex systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A tremendous range of design tasks in materials, physics, and biology can be formulated as finding the optimum of an objective function depending on many parameters without knowing its closed-form expression or the derivative. Traditional derivative-free optimization techniques often rely on strong assumptions about objective functions, thereby failing at optimizing non-convex systems beyond 100 dimensions. Here, we present a tree search method for derivative-free optimization that enables accelerated optimal design of high-dimensional complex systems. Specifically, we introduce stochastic tree expansion, dynamic upper confidence bound, and short-range backpropagation mechanism to evade local optimum, iteratively approximating the global optimum using machine learning models. This development effectively confronts the dimensionally challenging problems, achieving convergence to global optima across various benchmark functions up to 2,000 dimensions, surpassing the existing methods by 10- to 20-fold. Our method demonstrates wide applicability to a wide range of real-world complex systems spanning materials, physics, and biology, considerably outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms. This enables efficient autonomous knowledge discovery and facilitates self-driving virtual laboratories. Although we focus on problems within the realm of natural science, the advancements in optimization techniques achieved herein are applicable to a broader spectrum of challenges across all quantitative disciplines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.07548v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with dynamic networks in which the causality relations between the vertex signals are represented by linear time-invariant transfer functions (modules). Considering an acyclic network where only a subset of its vertices are measured and a subset of the vertices are excited, we explore conditions under which all the modules are identifiable on the basis of measurement data. Two sufficient conditions are presented in the paper, where the first condition concerns an identifiability analysis that needs to be performed for each vertex, while the second condition, based on the concept of tree/anti-tree covering, results from a graphical synthesis approach to allocate actuators and sensors in an acyclic network for achieving generic identifiability.</description>

Abstract: Abstract convexity generalises classical convexity by considering the suprema of functions taken from an arbitrarily defined set of functions. These are called the abstract linear (abstract affine) functions. The purpose of this paper is to study the abstract subdifferential. We obtain a number of results on the calculus of this subdifferential: summation and composition rules, and prove that under some reasonable conditions the subdifferential is a maximal abstract monotone operator. Another contribution of this paper is a counterexample that demonstrates that the separation theorem between two abstract convex sets is generally not true. The lack of the extension of separation results to the case of abstract convexity is one of the obstacles in the development of abstract convexity based numerical methods.</description>

      <title>Variance Reduced Random Relaxed Projection Method for Constrained Finite-sum Minimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.13090v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For many applications in signal processing and machine learning, we are tasked with minimizing a large sum of convex functions subject to a large number of convex constraints. In this paper, we devise a new random projection method (RPM) to efficiently solve this problem. Compared with existing RPMs, our proposed algorithm features two useful algorithmic ideas. First, at each iteration, instead of projecting onto the subset defined by one of the constraints, our algorithm only requires projecting onto a half-space approximation of the subset, which significantly reduces the computational cost as it admits a closed-form formula. Second, to exploit the structure that the objective is a sum, variance reduction is incorporated into our algorithm to further improve the performance. As theoretical contributions, under a novel error bound condition and other standard assumptions, we prove that the proposed RPM converges to an optimal solution and that both optimality and feasibility gaps vanish at a sublinear rate. In particular, via a new analysis framework, we show that our RPM attains a faster convergence rate in optimality gap than existing RPMs when the objective function has a Lipschitz continuous gradient, capitalizing the benefit of the variance reduction. We also provide sufficient conditions for the error bound condition to hold. Experiments on a beamforming problem and a robust classification problem are also presented to demonstrate the superiority of our RPM over existing ones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.01892v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distributed aggregative optimization is a recently emerged framework in which the agents of a network want to minimize the sum of local objective functions, each one depending on the agent decision variable (e.g., the local position of a team of robots) and an aggregation of all the agents' variables (e.g., the team barycentre). In this paper, we address a distributed feedback optimization framework in which agents implement a local (distributed) policy to reach a steady-state minimizing an aggregative cost function. We propose Aggregative Tracking Feedback, i.e., a novel distributed feedback optimization law in which each agent combines a closed-loop gradient flow with a consensus-based dynamic compensator reconstructing the missing global information. By using tools from system theory, we prove that Aggregative Tracking Feedback steers the network to a stationary point of an aggregative optimization problem with (possibly) nonconvex objective function. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through numerical simulations on a multi-robot surveillance scenario.</description>

      <title>Learning-Assisted Optimization for Transmission Switching</title>

Abstract: The design of new strategies that exploit methods from Machine Learning to facilitate the resolution of challenging and large-scale mathematical optimization problems has recently become an avenue of prolific and promising research. In this paper, we propose a novel learning procedure to assist in the solution of a well-known computationally difficult optimization problem in power systems: The Direct Current Optimal Transmission Switching (DC-OTS) problem. The DC-OTS problem consists in finding the configuration of the power network that results in the cheapest dispatch of the power generating units. With the increasing variability in the operating conditions of power grids, the DC-OTS problem has lately sparked renewed interest, because operational strategies that include topological network changes have proved to be effective and efficient in helping maintain the balance between generation and demand. The DC-OTS problem includes a set of binaries that determine the on/off status of the switchable transmission lines. Therefore, it takes the form of a mixed-integer program, which is NP-hard in general. In this paper, we propose an approach to tackle the DC-OTS problem that leverages known solutions to past instances of the problem to speed up the mixed-integer optimization of a new unseen model. Although our approach does not offer optimality guarantees, a series of numerical experiments run on a real-life power system dataset show that it features a very high success rate in identifying the optimal grid topology (especially when compared to alternative competing heuristics), while rendering remarkable speed-up factors.</description>

      <title>Tight Big-Ms for Optimal Transmission Switching</title>

Abstract: This paper addresses the Optimal Transmission Switching (OTS) problem in electricity networks, which aims to find an optimal power grid topology that minimizes system operation costs while satisfying physical and operational constraints. Existing methods typically convert the OTS problem into a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP) using big-M constants. However, the computational performance of these approaches relies significantly on the tightness of these big-Ms. In this paper, we propose an iterative tightening strategy to strengthen the big-Ms by efficiently solving a series of bounding problems that account for the economics of the OTS objective function through an upper-bound on the generating cost. We also discuss how the performance of the proposed tightening strategy is enhanced if reduced line capacities are considered. Using the 118-bus test system we demonstrate that the proposed methodology outperforms existing approaches, offering tighter bounds and significantly reducing the computational burden of the OTS problem.</description>

      <title>Optimal Distributed Control for a Cahn-Hilliard-Darcy System with Mass Sources, Unmatched Viscosities and Singular Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01569v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a Cahn-Hilliard-Darcy system with mass sources, which can be considered as a basic, though simplified, diffuse interface model for the evolution of tumor growth. This system is equipped with an impermeability condition for the (volume) averaged velocity $\mathbf{u}$ as well as homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions for the phase function $\varphi$ and the chemical potential $\mu$. The source term in the convective Cahn-Hilliard equation contains a control $R$ that can be thought, for instance, as a drug or a nutrient in applications. Our goal is to study a distributed optimal control problem in the two dimensional setting with a cost functional of tracking-type. In the physically relevant case with unmatched viscosities for the binary fluid mixtures and a singular potential, we first prove the existence and uniqueness of a global strong solution with $\varphi$ being strictly separated from the pure phases $\pm 1$. This well-posedness result enables us to characterize the control-to-state mapping $\mathcal{S}:R \mapsto \varphi$. Then we obtain the existence of an optimal control, the Fr\'{e}chet differentiability of $\mathcal{S}$ and first-order necessary optimality conditions expressed through a suitable variational inequality for the adjoint variables. Finally, we prove the differentiability of the control-to-costate operator and establish a second-order sufficient condition for the strict local optimality.</description>

Abstract: We study a time-inconsistent singular control problem originating from irreversible reinsurance decisions with non-exponential discount. A novel definition of equilibrium for time-inconsistent singular control problems is introduced. For the problem with non-exponential discount, both sufficient and necessary conditions are derived, providing a thorough mathematical characterization of the equilibrium. Specifically, the equilibrium can be characterized by an extended HJB system, which is a coupled system of non-local parabolic equations with free boundaries. Finally, by showing the existence of classical solutions to the extended HJB system, the existence of equilibria is established under some additional assumptions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Convex quadratic programming (QP) is an important class of optimization problem with wide applications in practice. The classic QP solvers are based on either simplex or barrier method, both of which suffer from the scalability issue because their computational bottleneck is solving linear equations. In this paper, we design and analyze a first-order method for QP, called restarted accelerated primal-dual hybrid gradient (rAPDHG), whose computational bottleneck is matrix-vector multiplication. We show that rAPDHG has a linear convergence rate to an optimal solution when solving QP, and the obtained linear rate is optimal among a wide class of primal-dual methods. Furthermore, we connect the linear rate with a sharpness constant of the KKT system of QP, which is a standard quantity to measure the hardness of a continuous optimization problem. Numerical experiments demonstrate that both restarts and acceleration can significantly improve the performance of the algorithm. Lastly, we present PDQP.jl, an open-sourced prototype implementation of rAPDHG in Julia that can be run on both CPU and GPU, and present a numerical study with SCS and OSQP on standard QP benchmark sets.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Lookahead Strong Branching via a Stochastic Abstract Branching Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07041v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong Branching (SB) is a cornerstone of all modern branching rules used in the Branch-and-Bound (BnB) algorithm, which is at the center of Mixed-Integer Programming solvers. In its full form, SB evaluates all variables to branch on and then selects the one producing the best relaxation, leading to small trees, but high runtimes. State-of-the-art branching rules therefore use SB with working limits to achieve both small enough trees and short run times. So far, these working limits have been established empirically. In this paper, we introduce a theoretical approach to guide how much SB to use at each node within the BnB. We first define an abstract stochastic tree model of the BnB algorithm where the geometric mean dual gains of all variables follow a given probability distribution. This model allows us to relate expected dual gains to tree sizes and explicitly compare the cost of sampling an additional SB candidate with the reward in expected tree size reduction. We then leverage the insight from the abstract model to design a new stopping criterion for SB, which fits a distribution to the dual gains and, at each node, dynamically continues or interrupts SB. This algorithm, which we refer to as Probabilistic Lookahead Strong Branching, improves both the tree size and runtime over MIPLIB instances, providing evidence that the method not only changes the amount of SB, but allocates it better.</description>

      <title>Integrating Random Regret Minimization-Based Discrete Choice Models with Mixed Integer Linear Programming for Revenue Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03118v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the critical domain of Revenue Management (RM) within Operations Research (OR), focusing on intricate pricing dynamics. Utilizing Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) models, the study enhances revenue optimization by considering product prices as decision variables and emphasizing the interplay between demand and supply. Recent advancements in Discrete Choice Models (DCMs), particularly those rooted in Random Regret Minimization (RRM) theory, are investigated as potent alternatives to established Random Utility Maximization (RUM) based DCMs. Despite the widespread use of DCMs in RM, a significant gap exists between cutting-edge RRM-based models and their practical integration into RM strategies. The study addresses this gap by incorporating an advanced RRM-based DCM into MILP models, addressing pricing challenges in both capacitated and uncapacitated supply scenarios. The developed models demonstrate feasibility and offer diverse interpretations of consumer choice behavior, drawing inspiration from established RUM-based frameworks. This research contributes to bridging the existing gap in the application of advanced DCMs within practical RM implementations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a closed-form notion of controllability and observability for systems with communication delays, actuation delays, and locality constraints. The formulation reduces to classical notions of controllability and observability in the unconstrained setting. As a consequence of our formulation, we show that the addition of locality and communication constraints may not affect the controllability and observability of the system, and we provide an efficient sufficient condition under which this phenomenon occurs. This contrasts with actuation and sensing delays, which cause a gradual loss of controllability and observability as the delays increase. We illustrate our results using linearized swing equations for the power grid, showing how actuation delay and locality constraints affect controllability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.00684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Epidemics of infectious diseases posing a serious risk to human health have occurred throughout history. During recent epidemics there has been much debate about policy, including how and when to impose restrictions on behaviour. Policymakers must balance a complex spectrum of objectives, suggesting a need for quantitative tools. Whether health services might be `overwhelmed' has emerged as a key consideration. Here we show how costly interventions, such as taxes or subsidies on behaviour, can be used to exactly align individuals' decision making with government preferences even when these are not aligned. In order to achieve this, we develop a nested optimisation algorithm of both the government intervention strategy and the resulting equilibrium behaviour of individuals. We focus on a situation in which the capacity of the healthcare system to treat patients is limited and identify conditions under which the disease dynamics respect the capacity limit. We find an extremely sharp drop in peak infections at a critical maximum infection cost in the government's objective function. This is in marked contrast to the gradual reduction of infections if individuals make decisions without government intervention. We find optimal interventions vary less strongly in time when interventions are costly to the government and that the critical cost of the policy switch depends on how costly interventions are.</description>

Abstract: Minimizing the difference of two submodular (DS) functions is a problem that naturally occurs in various machine learning problems. Although it is well known that a DS problem can be equivalently formulated as the minimization of the difference of two convex (DC) functions, existing algorithms do not fully exploit this connection. A classical algorithm for DC problems is called the DC algorithm (DCA). We introduce variants of DCA and its complete form (CDCA) that we apply to the DC program corresponding to DS minimization. We extend existing convergence properties of DCA, and connect them to convergence properties on the DS problem. Our results on DCA match the theoretical guarantees satisfied by existing DS algorithms, while providing a more complete characterization of convergence properties. In the case of CDCA, we obtain a stronger local minimality guarantee. Our numerical results show that our proposed algorithms outperform existing baselines on two applications: speech corpus selection and feature selection.</description>

      <title>Rational social distancing in epidemics with uncertain vaccination timing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13618</link>

Abstract: During epidemics people may reduce their social and economic activity to lower their risk of infection. Such social distancing strategies will depend on information about the course of the epidemic but also on when they expect the epidemic to end, for instance due to vaccination. Typically it is difficult to make optimal decisions, because the available information is incomplete and uncertain. Here, we show how optimal decision-making depends on information about vaccination timing in a differential game in which individual decision-making gives rise to Nash equilibria, and the arrival of the vaccine is described by a probability distribution. We predict stronger social distancing the earlier the vaccination is expected and also the more sharply peaked its probability distribution. In particular, equilibrium social distancing only meaningfully deviates from the no-vaccination equilibrium course if the vaccine is expected to arrive before the epidemic would have run its course. We demonstrate how the probability distribution of the vaccination time acts as a generalised form of discounting, with the special case of an exponential vaccination time distribution directly corresponding to regular exponential discounting.</description>
