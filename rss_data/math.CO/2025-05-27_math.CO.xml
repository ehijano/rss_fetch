      <title>Higher Order Bell Symmetric Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study symmetric function analogues of the higher order Bell numbers. Their construction involves iterated plethystic exponential towers mimicking the single variable exponential generating functions for the higher order Bell numbers. We derive explicit recurrence relations for the expansion coefficients of the Bell functions into the monomial and power sum bases of the ring of symmetric functions. Using the machinery of combinatorial species, the Bell functions are proven to be the Frobenius characteristics of the permutation representations of symmetric groups on hyper-partitions of certain orders and sizes. In the order 1 case, we are able to give more details about the expansion coefficients of the Bell functions in terms of vector partitions and divisor sums as well as give a recurrence relation analogous to the well known recursion for the Bell numbers. Lastly, we use Littlewood's reciprocity theorem and the Hardy-Littlewood Tauberian theorem to prove that the Schur expansion coefficients of the order 1 Bell functions are certain asymptotic averages of restriction coefficients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we provide a topological definition of Maxwell-Cremona liftings for non-planar frameworks of surfaces (both oriented and non-oriented). In the non-oriented case we give an estimate on the dimension of self-stresses, when the frameworks will posses a non-trivial lifting.</description>

      <title>Examples of IDP lattice polytopes with non-log-concave $h^*$-vector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice polytopes are called IDP polytopes if they have the integer decomposition property, i.e., any lattice point in a $k$th dilation is a sum of $k$ lattice points in the polytope. It is a long-standing conjecture whether the numerator of the Ehrhart series of an IDP polytope, called the $h^*$-polynomial, has a unimodal coefficient vector. In this preliminary report on research in progress we present examples showing that $h^*$-vectors of IDP polytopes do not have to be log-concave. This answers a question of Luis Ferroni and Akihiro Higashitani.
  As this is an ongoing project, this paper will be updated with more details and examples in the near future.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Grothendieck polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a skew shape $\lambda/\mu$, we define the hybrid Grothendieck polynomial $${G}_{\lambda/\mu}(\textbf{x};\textbf{t};\textbf{w}) =\sum_{T\in \mathrm{SVRPP}(\lambda/\mu)} \textbf{x}^{\mathrm{ircont}(T)}\textbf{t}^{\mathrm{ceq} (T)}\textbf{w}^{\mathrm{ex}(T)}$$ as a weight generating function over set-valued reverse plane partitions of shape $\lambda/\mu$. It specializes to \begin{itemize}
  \item[(1)] the refined
  stable Grothendieck polynomial introduced by Chan--Pflueger by setting all $t_i=0$;
  \item[(2)] the refined dual stable Grothendieck polynomial introduced by Galashin--Grinberg--Liu by setting all $w_i=0$. \end{itemize}
  We show that ${G}_{\lambda/\mu}(\textbf{x};\textbf{t};\textbf{w})$ is symmetric in the $\textbf{x}$ variables. By building a crystal structure on set-valued reverse plane partitions, we obtain the expansion of ${G}_{\lambda/\mu}(\textbf{x};\textbf{t};\textbf{w})$ in the basis of Schur functions, extending previous work by Monical--Pechenik--Scrimshaw and Galashin. Based on the Schur expansion, we deduce that hybrid Grothendieck polynomials of straight shapes have saturated Newton polytopes. Finally, using Fomin--Greene's theory on noncommutative Schur functions, we give a combinatorial formula for the image of ${G}_{\lambda/\mu}(\textbf{x};\textbf{t};\textbf{w})$ (in the case $t_i=\alpha$ and $w_i=\beta$) under the omega involution on symmetric functions. The formula unifies the structures of weak set-valued tableaux and valued-set tableaux introduced by Lam--Pylyavskyy. Several problems and conjectures are motivated and discussed.</description>

      <title>Effective resistance in planar graphs and continued fractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a simple graph $G=(V,E)$ and edge $e\in E$, the effective resistance is defined as a ratio $\frac{\tau(G/e)}{\tau(G)}$, where $\tau(G)$ denotes the number of spanning trees in $G$. We resolve the inverse problem for the effective resistance for planar graphs. Namely, we determine (up to a constant) the smallest size of a simple planar graph with a given effective resistance. The results are motivated and closely related to our previous work arXiv:2411.18782 on Sedl\'a\v{c}ek's inverse problem for the number of spanning trees.</description>

      <title>Visibility in graphs under edge and vertex removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a connected graph $G$ and $X\subseteq V(G)$, we say that two vertices $u$, $v$ are $X$-visible if there is a shortest $u,v$-path $P$ with $V(P)\cap X \subseteq \{u,v\}$. If every two vertices from $X$ are $X$-visible, then $X$ is a mutual-visibility set in $G$. The largest cardinality of such a set in $G$ is the mutual-visibility number $\mu(G)$. When the visibility constraint is extended to further types of vertex pairs, we get the definitions of outer, dual, and total mutual-visibility sets and the respective graph invariants $\mu_o(G)$, $\mu_d(G)$, and $\mu_t(G)$.
  This work concentrates on the possible changes in the four visibility invariants when an edge $e$ or a vertex $x$ is removed from $G$ and the graph remains connected. It is proved that $\frac{1}{2}\mu(G) \le \mu(G-e) \le 2\mu(G)$ and $\frac{1}{6}\mu_o(G) \le \mu_o(G-e) \le 2\mu_o(G)+1$ hold for every graph. Further general upper bounds established here are $\mu_t(G-e) \leq \mu_t(G)+2$ and $\mu(G-x) \leq 2\mu(G)$. For all but one of the remaining cases, it is shown that the visibility invariant may increase or decrease arbitrarily under the considered local operation. For example, neither $\mu_d(G-e)$ nor $\mu_d(G-x)$ allows lower or upper bounds of the form $a \cdot \mu_d(G)+b$ with a positive constant $a$. Along the way, the realizability of the four visibility invariants in terms of the order is also characterized in the paper.</description>

      <title>On the weak $k$-metric dimension of Hamming graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a connected graph $G$, a set of vertices $X\subset V(G)$ is a weak $k$-resolving set of $G$ if for each two vertices $y,z\in V(G)$, the sum of the values $|d_G(y,x)-d_G(z,x)|$ over all $x\in X$ is at least $k$, where $d_G(u,v)$ stands for the length of a shortest path between $u$ and $v$. The cardinality of a smallest weak $k$-resolving set of $G$ is the weak $k$-metric dimension of $G$, and is denoted by $\mathrm{wdim}_k(G)$. In this paper, $\mathrm{wdim}_k(K_n\,\square\,K_n)$ is determined for every $n\ge 3$ and every $2\le k\le 2n$. An improvement of a known integer linear programming formulation for this problem is developed and implemented for the graphs $K_n\,\square\,K_m$. Conjectures regarding these general situations are posed.</description>

      <title>Pathographs and some (un)decidability results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce pathographs as a framework to study graph classes defined by forbidden structures, including forbidding induced subgraphs, minors, etc. Pathographs approximately generalize s-graphs of L\'ev\^eque--Lin--Maffray--Trotignon by the addition of two extra adjacency relations: one between subdivisible edges and vertices called spokes, and one between pairs of subdivisible edges called rungs. We consider the following decision problem: given a pathograph $\mathfrak{H}$ and a finite set of pathographs $\mathcal{F}$, is there an $\mathcal{F}$-free realization of $\mathfrak{H}$? This may be regarded as a generalization of the "graph class containment problem": given two graph classes $S$ and $S'$, is it the case that $S\subseteq S'$? We prove the pathograph realization problem is undecidable in general, but it is decidable in the case that $\mathfrak{H}$ has no rungs (but may have spokes), or if $\mathcal{F}$ is closed under adding edges, spokes, and rungs. We also discuss some potential applications to proving decomposition theorems.</description>

      <title>Isometric path partition: a new upper bound and a characterization of some extremal graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An $\textit{isometric path}$ is a shortest path between two vertices. An $\textit{isometric path partition}$ (IPP) of a graph $G$ is a set $I$ of vertex-disjoint isometric paths in $G$ that partition the vertices of $G$. The \textit{isometric path partition number} of $G$, denoted by $\text{ipp}(G)$, is the minimum cardinality of an IPP of $G$. In this article, we prove that every graph $G$ satisfies $\text{ipp}(G) \leq |V(G)| - \nu(G)$, where $\nu(G)$ is matching number of $G$. We further prove that a connected graph $G$ is extremal with respect to this upper bound, i.e.\ satisfies $\text{ipp}(G) = |V(G)| - \nu(G)$, if and only if either (i) all blocks of $G$ are odd complete graphs, or (ii) all blocks of $G$ except one are odd complete graphs, and the unique block $B$ of $G$ that is not an odd complete graph is even and satisfy $\text{ipp}(B) = |V(B)| - \nu(B)$. As corollaries of this result, we obtain a full structural characterization of all connected odd graphs that are extremal with respect to our upper bound, as well as of all extremal block graphs.</description>

      <title>On the monoid of lexicographically minimal extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A sequence $(e_i)_{i \le m}$ of nonnegative integers $e_i$, where $m \in \mathbb{N}$ or $m =\infty$, is called a binomid index if $\sum_{i=n-k+1}^{n} e_i\geq \sum_{i=1}^ke_i$ for all $k, n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $ 1\le k \le n &lt; m$. Infinite binomid indices give rise to binomid sequences (also known as Raney sequences) and generalized binomial coefficients. A finite binomid index $\eta$ can be extended to a unique lexicographically minimal infinite binomid index $\tilde{\eta}$. This lex-minimal extension $\tilde{\eta}$ is necessarily eventually periodic. In this research, we give a formula for the minimal period and provide an upper bound for the preperiod of $\tilde{\eta}$. We also show that the monoid of lex-minimal extensions is an inductive limit of finitely presented monoids.</description>

      <title>Notes on the Linear Algebraic View of Regularity Lemmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When regularity lemmas were first developed in the 1970s, they were described as results that promise a partition of any graph into a ``small'' number of parts, such that the graph looks ``similar'' to a random graph on its edge subsets going between parts. Regularity lemmas have been repeatedly refined and reinterpreted in the years since, and the modern perspective is that they can instead be seen as purely linear-algebraic results about sketching a large, complicated matrix with a smaller, simpler one. These matrix sketches then have a nice interpretation about partitions when applied to the adjacency matrix of a graph.
  In these notes we will develop regularity lemmas from scratch, under the linear-algebraic perspective, and then use the linear-algebraic versions to derive the familiar graph versions. We do not assume any prior knowledge of regularity lemmas, and we recap the relevant linear-algebraic definitions as we go, but some comfort with linear algebra will definitely be helpful to read these notes.</description>

      <title>Homotopy Type of Intersections of Real Bruhat Cells in Dimension 6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the arbitrary intersection of real Bruhat cells. Such objects have attracted interest from various authors, particularly due to their appearance in different contexts: such as in Kazhdan-Lusztig theory and in the study of locally convex curves. We study the homotopy type of the intersection of two real Bruhat cells. This homotopy type is the same as that of an explicit submanifold of the group of real lower triangular matrices with diagonal entries equal to 1. For $(n+1)\times(n+1)$ matrices with $n\leq4$, these submanifolds are the disjoint union of contractible connected components. Our focus is on such intersections for $6\times6$ real matrices. For this, we study the connected components of Bruhat cells for permutations $\sigma\in\Sn_6$ with at most 12 inversions. We make use of the structure of the dual CW complexes associated with these components. We show that for permutations with at most 12 inversions, with the exception of $\sigma=[563412]$ , all connected components are contractible. Furthermore, for $\sigma=[563412]$, we identify new non-contractible connected components with the homotopy type of the circle.</description>

      <title>Where Paths Collide: A Comprehensive Survey of Classic and Learning-Based Multi-Agent Pathfinding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is a fundamental problem in artificial intelligence and robotics, requiring the computation of collision-free paths for multiple agents navigating from their start locations to designated goals. As autonomous systems become increasingly prevalent in warehouses, urban transportation, and other complex environments, MAPF has evolved from a theoretical challenge to a critical enabler of real-world multi-robot coordination. This comprehensive survey bridges the long-standing divide between classical algorithmic approaches and emerging learning-based methods in MAPF research. We present a unified framework that encompasses search-based methods (including Conflict-Based Search, Priority-Based Search, and Large Neighborhood Search), compilation-based approaches (SAT, SMT, CSP, ASP, and MIP formulations), and data-driven techniques (reinforcement learning, supervised learning, and hybrid strategies). Through systematic analysis of experimental practices across 200+ papers, we uncover significant disparities in evaluation methodologies, with classical methods typically tested on larger-scale instances (up to 200 by 200 grids with 1000+ agents) compared to learning-based approaches (predominantly 10-100 agents). We provide a comprehensive taxonomy of evaluation metrics, environment types, and baseline selections, highlighting the need for standardized benchmarking protocols. Finally, we outline promising future directions including mixed-motive MAPF with game-theoretic considerations, language-grounded planning with large language models, and neural solver architectures that combine the rigor of classical methods with the flexibility of deep learning. This survey serves as both a comprehensive reference for researchers and a practical guide for deploying MAPF solutions in increasingly complex real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Spectral selections, commutativity preservation and Coxeter-Lipschitz maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(W,S)$ be a Coxeter system whose graph is connected, with no infinite edges. A self-map $\tau$ of $W$ such that $\tau_{\sigma\theta}\in \{\tau_{\theta},\ \sigma\tau_{\theta}\}$ for all $\theta\in W$ and all reflections $\sigma$ (analogous to being 1-Lipschitz with respect to the Bruhat order on $W$) is either constant or a right translation. A somewhat stronger version holds for $S_n$, where it suffices that $\sigma$ range over smaller, $\theta$-dependent sets of reflections.
  These combinatorial results have a number of consequences concerning continuous spectrum- and commutativity-preserving maps $\mathrm{SU}(n)\to M_n$ defined on special unitary groups: every such map is a conjugation composed with (a) the identity; (b) transposition, or (c) a continuous diagonal spectrum selection. This parallels and recovers Petek's analogous statement for self-maps of the space $H_n\le M_n$ of self-adjoint matrices, strengthening it slightly by expanding the codomain to $M_n$.</description>

      <title>Bounding Width on Graph Classes of Constant Diameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine if the width of a graph class ${\cal G}$ changes from unbounded to bounded if we consider only those graphs from ${\cal G}$ whose diameter is bounded. As parameters we consider treedepth, pathwidth, treewidth and clique-width, and as graph classes we consider classes defined by forbidding some specific graph $F$ as a minor, induced subgraph or subgraph, respectively. Our main focus is on treedepth for $F$-subgraph-free graphs of diameter at most~$d$ for some fixed integer $d$. We give classifications of boundedness of treedepth for $d\in \{4,5,\ldots\}$ and partial classifications for $d=2$ and $d=3$.</description>

      <title>Homological algebra of Nakayama algebras and 321-avoiding permutations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.13764v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear Nakayama algebras over a field $K$ are in natural bijection to Dyck paths and Dyck paths are in natural bijection to 321-avoiding bijections via the Billey-Jockusch-Stanley bijection. Thus to every 321-avoiding permutation $\pi$ we can associate in a natural way a linear Nakayama algebra $A_{\pi}$. We give a homological interpretation of the fixed points statistic of 321-avoiding permutations using Nakayama algebras with a linear quiver. We furthermore show that the space of self-extension for the Jacobson radical of a linear Nakayama algebra $A_{\pi}$ is isomorphic to $K^{\mathfrak{s}(\pi)}$, where $\mathfrak{s}(\pi)$ is defined as the cardinality $k$ such that $\pi$ is the minimal product of transpositions of the form $s_i=(i,i+1)$ and $k$ is the number of distinct $s_i$ that appear.</description>

      <title>Embeddable of hieroglyphs into torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.08692v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are interested in finding combinatorial criteria for embedding graphs into two-dimensional torus and using them in the embedding check algorithm. It is a well-known fact that any connected graph can be reduced to a one-vertex graph with loops and is homotopy equivalent to such a graph. If a connected graph has intersection of some edges, then some loops of one-vertex graph will also intersect. Therefore the problem of embedding graphs in some surface is equivalent to the question of embedding one-vertex graph in given surface. This paper considers a graph with rotation structure (not necessarily geometric) or rotation graph called hieroglyph. The equivalence of four conditions is proved: (1) embedding hieroglyph in the torus; (2) the absence of forbidden subgraphs in a hieroglyph; (3) some condition for the graph of loops; (4) the existence of a reduction of hieroglyph to one of the list of hieroglyphs. We also prove the existence of an algorithm with complexity $\mathcal{O}(n)$ that recognizes embedding hieroglyph in the torus.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe how previously known methods for determining the number of decimation classes of density $\delta$ binary vectors can be extended to nonnegative integer vectors, where the vectors are indexed by a finite abelian group $G$ of size $\ell$ and exponent $\ell^*$ such that $\delta$ is relatively prime to $\ell^*$. We extend the previously discovered theory of multipliers for arbitrary subsets of finite abelian groups, to arbitrary multisubsets of finite abelian groups. Moreover, this developed theory provides information on the number of distinct translates fixed by each member of the multiplier group as well as sufficient conditions for each member of the multiplier group to be translate fixing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06513v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Combining Carver's variant of the Farkas' lemma with the Flow Decomposition Theorem we show that the regions of any deformation of a graphical arrangement may be bijectively labeled with a set of weighted digraphs containing directed cycles of negative weight only. Bounded regions correspond to strongly connected digraphs. The study of the resulting labelings allows us to add the omitted details in Stanley's proof on the injectivity of the Pak-Stanley labeling of the regions of the extended Shi arrangement, to generalize the ceiling diagrams in the deleted Shi and Ish arrangements studied by Armstrong and Rhoades and to introduce a new labeling of the regions in the Fuss-Catalan arrangement. We also point out that Athanasiadis-Linusson labelings may be used to directly count regions in a class of arrangements properly containing the extended Shi arrangement and the Fuss-Catalan arrangement.</description>

      <title>Coloring Grids Avoiding Bicolored Paths</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12919v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The vertex-coloring problem on graphs avoiding bicolored members of a family of subgraphs has been widely studied. Most well-known examples are star coloring and acyclic coloring of graphs (Gr\"unbaum, 1973) where bicolored copies of $P_4$ and cycles are not allowed, respectively. In this paper, we study a variation of this problem, by considering vertex coloring on grids forbidding bicolored paths. We let $P_k$-chromatic number of a graph be the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertex set properly avoiding a bicolored $P_k.$ We show that in any 3-coloring of the cartesian product of paths, $P_{k-2}\square P_{k-2}$, there is a bicolored $P_k.$ With our result, the problem of finding the $P_k$-chromatic number of product of two paths (2-dimensional grid) is settled for all $k.$</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we show that the Bruhat order on any sect of a symmetric variety of type $AIII$ is lexicographically shellable. Our proof proceeds from a description of these posets as rook placements in a partition shape which fits in a $p \times q$ rectangle. This allows us to extend an EL-labeling of the rook monoid given by Can to an arbitrary sect. As a special case, our result implies that the Bruhat order on matrix Schubert varieties is lexicographically shellable.</description>

Abstract: For a graph G, the spectral radius \r{ho}(G) of G is the largest eigenvalue of its adjacency matrix. In this paper, we seek the relationship between \r{ho}(G) and the walks of the subgraphs of G. Especially, if G contains a complete multi-partite graph as a spanning subgraph, we give a formula for \r{ho}(G) by using an infinite series on walks of the subgraphs of G. These results are useful for the current popular spectral extremal problem.</description>

      <title>A generalization of conjugation of integer partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We exhibit, for any positive integer parameter $s$, an involution on the set of integer partitions of $n$. These involutions show the joint symmetry of the distributions of the following two statistics. The first counts the number of parts of a partition divisible by $s$, whereas the second counts the number of cells in the Ferrers diagram of a partition whose leg length is zero and whose arm length has remainder $s-1$ when dividing by $s$. In particular, for $s=1$ this involution is just conjugation. Additionally, we provide explicit expressions for the bivariate generating functions.
  Our primary motivation to construct these involutions is that we know only of two other "natural" bijections on integer partitions of a given size, one of which is the Glaisher-Franklin bijection sending the set of parts divisible by $s$, each divided by $s$, to the set of parts occurring at least $s$ times.</description>

      <title>Uniform generation of large traces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an algorithm for the uniform generation of infinite traces, i.e., infinite words up to commutation of some letters. The algorithm outputs on-the-fly approximations of a theoretical infinite trace, the latter being distributed according to the exact uniform probability measure. The average size of the approximation grows linearly with the time of execution of the algorithm, hence its output can be effectively used while running.
  Two versions of the algorithm are given. A version without rejection has a good production speed, provided that some precomputations have been done, but these may be costly. A version with rejection requires much fewer computations, at the expense of a production speed that can be small.
  We also show that, for some particular trace monoids, one or the other version of the algorithm can actually be very good: few computations for a good production speed.</description>

Abstract: The set of sums of two squares plays an important role in the elementary number theory. Di Nasso investigated several infinite monochromatic patterns in integers considering operations induced from affine maps and asked whether one can find different sets of infinite monochromatic configurations in natural numbers with the structure induced from the set of sums of two squares. This article investigates Nasso's question and along the way proves several classical Ramsey-type theorems in this new setting.</description>

Abstract: Chernyshev, Rauch, and Rautenbach proved that every connected graph on $n$ vertices with less than $\frac{11}{5}n-\frac{18}{5}$ edges has a vertex cut that induces a forest, and conjectured that the same remains true if the graph has less than $3n-6$ edges. We improve their result by proving that every connected graph on $n$ vertices with less than $\frac{9}{4}n$ edges has a vertex cut that induces a forest. We also study weaker versions of the problem that might lead to an improvement on the bound obtained.</description>

      <title>A Spectral Lower Bound on Chromatic Numbers using $p$-Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01295v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $A_G $ be the adjacency matrix of a simple graph $ G $, and let $ \chi(G) $, $ \chi_f(G) $, $ \chi_q(G) $, $ \xi(G) $ and $ \xi_f(G) $ denote its chromatic number, fractional chromatic number, quantum chromatic number, orthogonal rank and projective rank, respectively. For $ p \geq 0 $, we define the positive and negative $ p $-energies of $ G $ by $$ \mathcal{E}_p^+(G) = \sum_{\lambda_i &gt; 0} \lambda_i^p, \quad \mathcal{E}_p^-(G) = \sum_{\lambda_i &lt; 0} |\lambda_i|^p, $$ where $ \lambda_1 \geq \cdots \geq \lambda_n $ are the eigenvalues of $A_G $. We prove that for all $ p \geq 0 $, $$ \chi(G) \geq \left\{\chi_f(G), \chi_q(G), \xi(G) \right\} \geq \xi_f(G) \geq 1 + \max\left\{ \frac{\mathcal{E}_p^+(G)}{\mathcal{E}_p^-(G)}, \frac{\mathcal{E}_p^-(G)}{\mathcal{E}_p^+(G)} \right\}^{\frac{1}{|p - 1|}}. $$ This result unifies and strengthens a series of existing bounds corresponding to the cases $ p \in \{0, 2, \infty\} $. In particular, the case $ p = 0 $ yields the inertia bound $$ \chi_f(G) \geq \xi_f(G) \geq1 + \max\left\{\frac{n^+}{n^-}, \frac{n^-}{n^+}\right\}, $$ where $ n^+ $ and $ n^- $ denote the number of positive and negative eigenvalues of $ A_G $, respectively. This resolves two conjectures of Elphick and Wocjan.
  We also demonstrate that for certain graphs, non-integer values of $ p $ provide sharper lower bounds than existing spectral bounds. As an example, we determine $ \chi_q $ for the Tilley graph, which cannot be achieved using existing (unweighted) $p$-energy bounds. Our proof employs a novel synthesis of linear algebra and measure-theoretic tools, which allows us to surpass existing spectral bounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A $q$-rank function is a real-valued function defined on the subspace lattice that is non-negative, upper bounded by the dimension function, non-drecreasing, and satisfies the submodularity law. Each such function corresponds to the rank function of a $q$-polymatroid. In this paper, we identify these functions with points in a polytope. We show that this polytope contains no interior lattice points, implying that the points corresponding to $q$-matroids are among its vertices. We investigate several properties of convex combinations of two lattice points in this polytope, particularly in terms of independence, flats, and cyclic flats. Special attention is given to the convex combinations of paving and uniform $q$-matroids.</description>

      <title>Rainbow triangles and the Erd\H{o}s-Hajnal problem in projective geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate a geometric version of the Erd\H{o}s-Hajnal conjecture that applies to finite projective geometries rather than graphs, in both its usual 'induced' form and the multicoloured form. The multicoloured conjecture states, roughly, that a colouring $c$ of the points of $\mathsf{PG}(n-1,q)$ containing no copy of a fixed colouring $c_0$ of $\mathsf{PG}(k-1,q)$ for small $k$ must contain a subspace of dimension polynomial in $n$ that avoids some colour.
  If $(k,q) = (2,2)$, then $c_0$ is a colouring of a three-element 'triangle', and there are three essentially different cases, all of which we resolve. We derive both the cases where $c_0$ assigns the same colour to two different elements from a recent breakthrough result in additive combinatorics due to Kelley and Meka. We handle the case that $c_0$ is a 'rainbow' colouring by proving that rainbow-triangle-free colourings of projective geometries are exactly those that admit a certain decomposition into two-coloured pieces. This is closely analogous to a theorem of Gallai on rainbow-triangle-free coloured complete graphs. We also show that existing structure theorems resolve certain two-coloured cases where $(k,q) = (2,3)$, and $(k,q) = (3,2)$.</description>

      <title>Uniform Tur\'an density -- palette classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the 1980s, Erd\H{o}s and S\'os initiated the study of Tur\'an hypergraph problems with a uniformity condition on the distribution of edges, i.e., determining density thresholds for the existence of a hypergraph H in a host hypergraph with edges uniformly distributed. In particular, Erd\H{o}s and S\'os asked to determine the uniform Tur\'an densities of the hypergraphs $K_4^{(3)-}$ and $K_4^{(3)}$. After more than 30 years, the former was solved by Glebov, Kr\'al' and Volec [Israel J. Math. 211 (2016), 349-366] and Reiher, R\"odl and Schacht [J. Eur. Math. Soc. 20 (2018), 1139-1159], while the latter still remains open. In these two cases and several additional cases, the tight lower bounds are provided by a so-called palette construction.
  Lamaison [arXiv:2408.09643] has recently showed that the uniform Tur\'an density of a 3-uniform hypergraph H is equal to the supremum of the densities of palettes that H is not colorable with. We give a necessary and sufficient condition, which is easy to verify, on the existence of a 3-uniform hypergraph colorable by a set of palettes and not colorable by another given set of palettes. We also demonstrate how our result can be used to prove the existence of 3-uniform hypergraphs with specific values of the uniform Tur\'an density.</description>

      <title>Graded Betti numbers of a hyperedge ideal associated to join of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07308v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite simple graph on the vertex set $V(G)$ and let $r$ be a positive integer. We consider the hypergraph $\mathrm{Con}_r(G)$ whose vertices are the vertices of $G$ and the (hyper)edges are all $A\subseteq V(G)$ such that $|A|=r+1$ and the induced subgraph $G[A]$ is connected. The (hyper)edge ideal $I_r(G)$ of $\mathrm{Con}_r(G)$ is also the Stanley-Reisner ideal of a generalisation of the independence complex of $G$, called the $r$-independence complex $\mathrm{Ind}_r(G)$. In this article we make extensive use of the Mayer-Vietoris sequence to find the graded Betti numbers of $I_r(G_1*G_2)$ in terms of the graded Betti numbers of $I_r(G_1)$ and $I_r(G_2)$, where $G_1*G_2$ is the join of $G_1$ and $G_2$. Moreover, we find formulas for all the graded Betti numbers of $I_r(G)$, when $G$ is a complete graph, complete multipartite graph, cycle graph and the wheel graph.</description>

      <title>The entries of the Sinkhorn limit of an $m \times n$ matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use a variety of computational tools to obtain a degree-$\binom{m + n - 2}{m - 1}$ polynomial equation conjecturally satisfied by the top-left entry of the Sinkhorn limit of a positive $m \times n$ matrix. The degree of this equation has a combinatorial interpretation as the number of minors of an $(m - 1) \times (n - 1)$ matrix, and the coefficients involve a determinant formula that reflects new combinatorial structure on sets of minor specifications. The tools we use include Gr\"obner bases, which produce equations for small matrices; the PSLQ algorithm, which produces equations for larger matrices as part of an interpolation effort that required 1.5 years of CPU time; and ChatGPT o3-mini-high, which identified the signs of the off-diagonal entries in the determinant formula.</description>

      <title>Algorithms and complexity for monitoring edge-geodetic sets in graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A monitoring edge-geodetic set of a graph is a subset $M$ of its vertices such that for every edge $e$ in the graph, deleting $e$ increases the distance between at least one pair of vertices in $M$. We study the following computational problem \textsc{MEG-set}: given a graph $G$ and an integer $k$, decide whether $G$ has a monitoring edge geodetic set of size at most $k$. We prove that the problem is NP-hard even for 2-apex 3-degenerate graphs, improving a result by Haslegrave (Discrete Applied Mathematics 2023). Additionally, we prove that the problem cannot be solved in subexponential-time, assuming the Exponential-Time Hypothesis, even for 3-degenerate graphs. Further, we prove that the optimization version of the problem is APX-hard, even for 4-degenerate graphs. Complementing these hardness results, we prove that the problem admits a polynomial-time algorithm for interval graphs, a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm for general graphs with clique-width plus diameter as the parameter, and a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm for chordal graphs with treewidth as the parameter. We also provide an approximation algorithm with factor $\ln m\cdot OPT$ and $\sqrt{n\ln m}$ for the optimization version of the problem, where $m$ is the number of edges, $n$ the number of vertices, and $OPT$ is the size of a minimum monitoring edge-geodetic set of the input graph.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a fast algorithm for computing discrete cubical homology of graphs over finite fields with an appropriate characteristic. This algorithm improves on several computational steps compared to constructions in the existing literature, with the key insights including: a faster way to generate all singular cubes, reducing the dimensions of vector spaces in the chain complex by taking a quotient over automorphisms of the cube, and preprocessing graphs using the axiomatic treatment of discrete cubical homology.</description>

      <title>Cohomology of type $B$ real permutohedral varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Type $A$ and type $B$ permutohedral varieties are classic examples of mathematics, and their topological invariants are well known. This naturally leads to the investigation of the topology of their real loci, known as type $A$ and type $B$ real permutohedral varieties.
  The rational cohomology rings of type $A$ real permutohedral varieties are fully described in terms of alternating permutations. Until now, only rational Betti numbers of type $B$ real permutohedral varieties have been described in terms of $B$-snakes. In this paper, we explicitly describe the multiplicative structure of the cohomology rings of type $B$ real permutohedral varieties in terms of $B$-snakes.</description>

      <title>Emergence of network communities driven by local rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17042v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Natural systems are modeled by networks with nodes and links. Often the nodes are segregated into communities with different connectivity patterns. Node heterogeneity such as political affiliation in social networks or biological function in gene networks are highlighted as key factors driving the segregation of nodes into communities. Here, by means of numerical simulations, I show that node heterogeneity is not a necessary requirement. To this end I introduce the Ramsey community number, $r_\kappa$, the minimum graph size that warranties the emergence of network communities with almost certainty. Using the stochastic block model for community detection with correction for degree sequence, I show that networks generated by local rules have finite $r_\kappa$ values while their randomized versions do not have emergent communities. I conjecture that network communities are an emergent property of networks evolving with local rules.</description>

      <title>Free line arrangements with low maximal multiplicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01733v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a free arrangement of $d$ lines in the complex projective plane, with exponents $d_1\leq d_2$. Let $m$ be the maximal multiplicity of points in $\mathcal{A}$. In this note, we describe first the simple cases $d_1 \leq m$. Then we study the case $d_1=m+1$, and describe which line arrangements can occur by deleting or adding a line to $\mathcal{A}$. When $d \leq 14$, there are only two free arrangements with $d_1=m+2$, namely one with degree $13$ and the other with degree $14$. We study their geometries in order to deepen our understanding of the structure of free line arrangements in general.</description>
