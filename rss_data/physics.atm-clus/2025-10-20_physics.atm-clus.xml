      <title>Evaluation of Quantum Offset in Velocity Imaging-Based Electron Spectrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Velocity-map imaging of electrons is a pivotal technique in chemical physics. A recent study reported a quantum offset as large as 0.2 cm-1 in velocity imaging-based electron spectrometry [Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 043001 (2025)]. In this work, we assess the existence this offset through a combination of simulations and experiments. Our simulations reveal that the velocity imaging results reconstructed using the maximum entropy velocity Legendre reconstruction (MEVELER) method exhibit no such offset. Furthermore, experimental measurements of the electron affinity of oxygen conducted at various imaging voltages show no discernible offset attributable to the electric field in the photodetachment region. Therefore, we conclude that there is no evidence for the claimed quantum offset in properly analyzed velocity imaging-based electron spectrometry.</description>

      <title>Double electron resonance with two ensembles of nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are widely used in the development of a number of sensors. The sensitivity of these devices is limited by both the number of centers used and their coherent properties. While the effects on the coherent properties of paramagnetic impurities such as carbon 13-isotopes and p1 centers are rather well understood, the mutual interaction of NV centers, which becomes especially important in relatively dense NV ensembles, is less well understood. Here, we provide a systematic study of NV-NV interaction using a dynamical double electron-electron resonance sequence, making it possible to directly observe the interaction of NV centers. Two types of dynamical DEER sequences were considered, consisting of 3 and 4 pulses. The nature of the phase jump in the 3-pulse sequence was attributed to the effect of non-commuting rotations within the sequence. Both the phase of the state vector rotation and its amplitude decay were studied, thus presenting a complete picture of decoherence due to NV-NV interaction. It was shown that the rate of the state vector decay differed significantly from predictions for a spin 1/2 system. However, the decay rate observed in the DEER sequence remained a reliable indicator of the concentration of bath spins and could be used to measure NV center concentration, provided that the magnetic transition of NV centers is saturated.</description>

      <title>Observation of modulation-induced Feshbach resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we observe a novel resonant mechanism, namely the modulation-induced Feshbach resonance. By applying a far-detuned laser to the cesium D2 transition with intensity modulation, we periodically shake the energy levels of atomic collisional states. This periodic shaking connects the free-scattering states to shallow molecular states. At specific frequencies, we observe significant atom loss, which corresponds to the resonant coupling between these two types of states. This precisely corresponds to a form of Feshbach resonance, yet in the frequency domain rather than the magnetic-field domain. Using this method, we can directly scan the energy spectrum of molecular bound states without synthesizing any molecules. In addition to these bound states, we can also probe the molecular states embedded in the continuum, which are typically very difficult to detect by the conventional methods based on molecular synthesis. Moreover, by using a far-detuned laser instead of a magnetic field coil, it enables spatially dependent control over atomic interactions, coupling multiple levels simultaneously, and inducing new Feshbach resonances for those atoms that do not have conventional magnetic resonances. Therefore, we believe that this new resonant mechanism offers new opportunities for controlling atomic and molecular interactions in quantum simulations.</description>
