      <title>Robust Inference in Locally Misspecified Bipartite Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a methodology to conduct robust inference in bipartite networks under local misspecification. We focus on a class of dyadic network models with misspecified conditional moment restrictions. The framework of misspecification is local, as the effect of misspecification varies with the sample size. We utilize this local asymptotic approach to construct a robust estimator that is minimax optimal for the mean square error within a neighborhood of misspecification. Additionally, we introduce bias-aware confidence intervals that account for the effect of the local misspecification. These confidence intervals have the correct asymptotic coverage for the true parameter of interest under sparse network asymptotics. Monte Carlo experiments demonstrate that the robust estimator performs well in finite samples and sparse networks. As an empirical illustration, we study the formation of a scientific collaboration network among economists.</description>

      <title>Policy Relevant Treatment Effects with Multidimensional Unobserved Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a framework for the policy relevant treatment effects using instrumental variables. In the framework, a treatment selection may or may not satisfy the classical monotonicity condition and can accommodate multidimensional unobserved heterogeneity. We can bound the target parameter by extracting information from identifiable estimands. We also provide a more conservative yet computationally simpler bound by applying a convex relaxation method. Linear shape restrictions can be easily incorporated to further improve the bounds. Numerical and simulation results illustrate the informativeness of our convex-relaxation bounds, i.e., that our bounds are sufficiently tight.</description>

      <title>Multifractal wavelet dynamic mode decomposition modeling for marketing time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Marketing is the way we ensure our sales are the best in the market, our prices the most accessible, and our clients satisfied, thus ensuring our brand has the widest distribution. This requires sophisticated and advanced understanding of the whole related network. Indeed, marketing data may exist in different forms such as qualitative and quantitative data. However, in the literature, it is easily noted that large bibliographies may be collected about qualitative studies, while only a few studies adopt a quantitative point of view. This is a major drawback that results in marketing science still focusing on design, although the market is strongly dependent on quantities such as money and time. Indeed, marketing data may form time series such as brand sales in specified periods, brand-related prices over specified periods, market shares, etc. The purpose of the present work is to investigate some marketing models based on time series for various brands. This paper aims to combine the dynamic mode decomposition and wavelet decomposition to study marketing series due to both prices, and volume sales in order to explore the effect of the time scale on the persistence of brand sales in the market and on the forecasting of such persistence, according to the characteristics of the brand and the related market competition or competitors. Our study is based on a sample of Saudi brands during the period 22 November 2017 to 30 December 2021.</description>

      <title>Prediction intervals for economic fixed-event forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.13562v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fixed-event forecasting setup is common in economic policy. It involves a sequence of forecasts of the same (`fixed') predictand, so that the difficulty of the forecasting problem decreases over time. Fixed-event point forecasts are typically published without a quantitative measure of uncertainty. To construct such a measure, we consider forecast postprocessing techniques tailored to the fixed-event case. We develop regression methods that impose constraints motivated by the problem at hand, and use these methods to construct prediction intervals for gross domestic product (GDP) growth in Germany and the US.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks for Causal Inference Under Network Confounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.07823v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies causal inference with observational network data. A challenging aspect of this setting is the possibility of interference in both potential outcomes and selection into treatment, for example due to peer effects in either stage. We therefore consider a nonparametric setup in which both stages are reduced forms of simultaneous-equations models. This results in high-dimensional network confounding, where the network and covariates of all units constitute sources of selection bias. The literature predominantly assumes that confounding can be summarized by a known, low-dimensional function of these objects, and it is unclear what selection models justify common choices of functions. We show that graph neural networks (GNNs) are well suited to adjust for high-dimensional network confounding. We establish a network analog of approximate sparsity under primitive conditions on interference. This demonstrates that the model has low-dimensional structure that makes estimation feasible and justifies the use of shallow GNN architectures.</description>

      <title>Causal Interpretation of Estimands Defined by Exposure Mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In settings with interference, researchers commonly define estimands using exposure mappings to summarize neighborhood variation in treatment assignments. This paper studies the causal interpretation of these estimands under weak restrictions on interference. We demonstrate that the estimands can exhibit unpalatable sign reversals under conventional identification conditions. This motivates the formulation of sign preservation criteria for causal interpretability. To satisfy preferred criteria, it is necessary to impose restrictions on interference, either in potential outcomes or selection into treatment. We provide sufficient conditions and show that they can be satisfied by nonparametric models with interference in both the outcome and selection stages.</description>
