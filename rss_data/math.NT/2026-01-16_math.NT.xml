      <title>Distortion maps for elliptic curves over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Weil pairing on elliptic curves has deep links with discrete logarithm problems. In practice, to better suit the functionalities of cryptosystems, one often needs to modify the original Weil pairing via what is called a distortion map. We propose a study on the question of the existence of distortion maps for elliptic curves over finite fields. We revisit results from the literature and provide detailed proofs. We also propose new perspectives at times.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic heterogeneous Stirling numbers and Bell polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let Y be a random variable satisfying specific moment conditions. This paper introduces and investigates probabilistic heterogeneous Stirling numbers of the second kind and probabilistic heterogeneous Bell polynomials. These structures unify several classical and probabilistic families, including those of Stirling, Lah, Bell and Lah-Bell. By integrating the heterogeneous framework of Kim and Kim with probabilistic extensions, we derive explicit formulas, Dobi\'nski-like identities, and recurrence relations. We further establish connections to partial Bell polynomials and provide applications for Poisson and Bernoulli distributions.</description>

      <title>A $p$-adic interpolation of the Cogdell lift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we obtain several results related to the $p$-adic interpolation of the classical Cogdell lift, mapping special cycles on Picard modular surfaces to elliptic modular forms. The results have a three-fold nature: in the first part of the paper, we $p$-adically interpolate the adjoint Kudla lift, exploiting the previously constructed $\Lambda$-adic Kudla lift. In the second part, we construct higher weight cycles in Kuga-Sato varieties attached to Picard modular surfaces, and show modularity of the generating series of these cycles, thus obtaining a higher weight analogue of the Cogdell lift. Finally, we apply the formalism introduced by Loeffler to construct $p$-adic analytic cohomology classes of special cycles, whose generating series is proved to be a Hida family interpolating the Cogdell lifts in the weight and level variables.</description>

      <title>Shifted bilinear sums of Sali\'e sums and the distribution of modular square roots of shifted primes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish various upper bounds on Type-I and Type-II shifted bilinear sums with Sali\'e sums modulo a large prime $q$. We use these bounds to study, for fixed integers $a,b\not \equiv 0 \bmod q$, the distribution ofsolutions to the congruence $x^2 \equiv ap+b \bmod q$, over primes $p\le P$. This is similar to the recently studied case of $b = 0$, however the case $b\not \equiv 0 \bmod q$ exhibits some new difficulties.</description>

      <title>Two dimensional covering systems and possible prime producing $a^m-b^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We exhibit a new application of two dimensional covering systems, examples of integer pairs $a,b$ for which $a^m-b^n$ has a prime divisor from some given finite set of primes, for every pair of integers $m,n\geq 0$. This leads us to conjecture what are the only possible obstructions to $|a^m-b^n|$ taking on infinitely many distinct prime values.</description>

      <title>Kummer-faithful fields with finitely generated absolute Galois group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the structure of the Mordell--Weil groups of semiabelian varieties over algebraic extensions of number fields whose absolute Galois group is finitely generated, with particular emphasis on that generated by a single element. A probabilistic argument using the Haar measure on the absolute Galois group of a number field shows that almost all such fields are Kummer-faithful, i.e., the Mordell--Weil group of any semiabelian variety over any finite extension of such a field has trivial divisible part. This result implies that there exists a Kummer-faithful field algebraic over a number field whose absolute Galois group is abelian.</description>

      <title>On refinements of two-term Machin-like formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a refinement process for two-term Machin-like formulas: $a_0 \arctan{u_0} + a_1 \arctan{u_1} = \frac{\pi}{4}$ (where $a_0 , a_1 \in \mathbb{Z}$, $u_0 , u_1 \in \mathbb{Q}_+^*$, $u_0 &gt; u_1$) by exploiting the continued fraction expansion of the ratio $\alpha := \frac{\arctan{u_0}}{\arctan{u_1}}$. This construction yields a sequence of derived two-term Machin-like formulas: $a_{- n} \arctan{u_n} + a_{- n + 1} \arctan{u_{n + 1}} = \frac{\pi}{4}$ ($n \in \mathbb{N}$) with positive rational arguments $u_n$ decreasing to zero and corresponding integer coefficients $a_{- n}$. We derive closed forms and estimates for $a_{-n}$ and $u_n$ in terms of the convergents of $\alpha$ and prove that the associated rational sequence $(a_{- n} u_n + a_{- n + 1} u_{n + 1})_n$ converges to $\pi/4$ with geometric decay. The method is illustrated using Euler's two-term Machin-like formula : $\arctan(1/2) + \arctan(1/3) = \pi/4$.</description>

      <title>Waring's problem for pseudo-polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Waring's problem has a long history in additive number theory. In its original form it deals with the representability of every positive integer as sum of $k$-th powers with integer $k$. Instead of these powers we deal with pseudo-polynomials in this paper. A pseudo-polynomial is a ``polynomial'' with at least one exponent not being an integer.
  Our work extends earlier results on the related problem of Waring for arbitrary real powers $k&gt;12$ by Deshouillers and Arkhipov and Zhitkov.</description>

      <title>Algebraic functional equation for big Galois representations over multiple $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general approach to establish algebraic functional equations for big Galois representations over multiple $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extensions. Our result is formulated in both Selmer group and Selmer complex settings, and encompasses a broad range of Iwasawa-theoretic scenarios. In particular, our result applies to the triple product of Hida families in both balanced and unbalanced cases, as well as the half-ordinary Rankin-Selberg universal deformations recently studied by the first named author and Loeffler. Our result also significantly generalizes many previously known cases of algebraic functional equations and answers a question of Greenberg.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine an infinite family of linear identities for the number $A_4(n)$ of partition pairs of $n$ with $4$-cores by employing elementary $q$-series techniques and certain $3$-dissection formulas. We then discover an infinite family of congruences for $A_4(n)$ as a consequence of these linear identities.</description>

      <title>On subradically sifted sums related to Alladi's higher order duality between prime factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, I utilize a variant of the Selberg--Delange method to find quantitative estimates of the sums \[M_{k,\omega}(x,y)=\sum_{\substack{p_{1}(n)&gt; y\\ n\leq x} } \mu(n) {\omega(n)-1\choose k-1},\] where $y$ can grow with $x$ but we must have $y\leq Y_0\exp(\mathscr{p}\frac{\log x}{(\log\log (x+1))^{1+\epsilon}})$ with $Y_0,\mathscr{p},\epsilon&gt;0$. Moreover, I give preliminary upper bounds for the general range $1.9\leq y\leq x^{\frac{1}{k}}$. In addition, I formalize the notions of subradical and radical dominance and discuss their relevance to the analytic approach of the study of arithmetic functions. Lastly, I give a fascinating formula related to the derivatives of the gamma function and the Hankel contour, which should be relevant for those employing the Selberg--Delange method to obtain higher-order terms.</description>

      <title>Vertex operator algebra bundles on modular curves and their associated modular forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes the vector bundle on the elliptic modular curve that is associated to a vertex operator algebra $V$ (VOA) or more generally a quasi-vertex operator algebra (QVOA), with a view towards future applications aimed at studying the characters of VOAs. We explain how the modes of sections of $V$ give rise naturally to $V$-valued quasi-modular forms. The space $Q(V)$ of $V$-valued quasi-modular forms is endowed with the structure of a doubled QVOA, and in particular the algebra $Q$ of quasi-modular forms is itself a doubled QVOA. $Q(V)$ also admits a natural derivative operator arising from the connection on the bundle defined by $V$ and the modular derivative, which we call the raising operator. We introduce an associated lowering operator $\Lambda$ on $Q(V)$ having the property that the $V$-valued modular forms $M(V)\subseteq Q(V)$ are the kernel of $\Lambda$. This extends the classical theory of scalar-valued quasi-modular forms. We exhibit an explicit isomorphism of $M(V)$ with $M \otimes V$. Finally, the coordinate invariance of vertex operators implies that $M(V)$ has a natural Hecke theory, and we use this isomorphism to fully describe the Hecke eigensystems: they are the same as the systems of eigenvalues that arise from scalar-valued quasi-modular forms.</description>

Abstract: This paper extends the affine Springer theory developed by Bouthier, Kazhdan, and the second author (see [BKV]) to the mixed characteristic case. In particular, we introduce a theory of perfectly placid perfect infinity stacks and establish their dimension theory. Furthermore, we prove that, in the Witt vector setting, the Chevalley morphism between arc spaces is flat.</description>

      <title>Polynomially effective equidistribution for unipotent orbits in products of $\mathrm{SL}_2$ factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We sketch the proof of an effective equidistribution theorem for one-parameter unipotent subgroups in $S$-arithmetic quotients arising from $\mathbf K$-forms of $\mathrm{SL}_2^{\mathsf n}$ where $\mathbf K$ is a number field. This gives an effective version of equidistribution results of Ratner and Shah with a polynomial rate.
  The key new phenomenon is the existence of many intermediate groups between the $\mathrm{SL}_2$ containing our unipotent and the ambient group, which introduces potential local and global obstruction to equidistribution.
  Our approach relies on a Bourgain-type projection theorem in the presence of obstructions, together with a careful analysis of these obstructions.</description>

      <title>Fano threefolds of genus 12 with large automorphism group in positive and mixed characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study prime Fano threefolds of genus 12 ($V_{22}$-varieties) with positive-dimensional automorphism groups in positive and mixed characteristic. We classify such varieties over any perfect field. In particular, we prove that $V_{22}$-varieties of Mukai-Umemura type over $k$ exist if and only if $\mathrm{char}\ k \neq 2$, $5$. We also prove the same result for $\mathbb{G}_a$-type. As arithmetic applications, we show that the Shafarevich conjecture holds for $V_{22}$-varieties of Mukai-Umemura type and of $\mathbb{G}_m$-type, while it fails for $V_{22}$-varieties of $\mathbb{G}_a$-type. Moreover, we prove that there exists $V_{22}$-varieties over $\mathbb{Z}$, whereas there do not exist $V_{22}$-varieties over $\mathbb{Z}$ whose generic fiber has a positive-dimensional automorphism group.</description>

      <title>The Wiener Wintner and Return Times Theorem Along the Primes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the following Return Times Theorem along the sequence of prime times, the first extension of the Return Times Theorem to arithmetic sequences:
  For every probability space, $(\Omega,\nu)$, equipped with a measure-preserving transformation, $T \colon \Omega \to \Omega$, and every $f \in L^\infty(\Omega)$, there exists a set of full probability, $\Omega_f \subset \Omega$ with $\nu(\Omega_f) =1$, so that for all $\omega \in \Omega_f$, for any other probability space $(X,\mu)$, equipped with a measure-preserving transformation $S : X \to X$, for any $g \in L^{\infty}(X)$,
  \begin{align}
  \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n \leq N} f(T^{p_n} \omega) g(S^{p_n} \cdot)
  \end{align}
  converges $\mu$-almost surely; above, $\{ 2=p_1 &lt; p_2 &lt; \dots \}$ are an enumeration of the primes. The Wiener-Wintner theorem along the primes
  is an immediate corollary.
  Our proof lives at the interface of classical Fourier analysis, combinatorial number theory, higher order Fourier analysis, and pointwise ergodic theory, with $U^3$ theory playing an important role; our $U^3$-estimates for \emph{Heath-Brown} models of the von Mangoldt function may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Euler Product Asymptotics for $L$-functions of Elliptic Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05236v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $E/\mathbb Q$ be an elliptic curve and for each prime $p$, let $N_p$ denote the number of points of $E$ modulo $p$. The original version of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture asserts that $\prod \limits _{p \leq x} \frac{N_p}{p} \sim C (\log x) ^{\text{rank}(E(\mathbb Q))}$ as $x \to \infty$. Goldfeld (1982) showed that this conjecture implies both the Riemann Hypothesis for $L(E, s)$ and the modern formulation of the conjecture i.e. that $\text{ord}_{s=1} L(E, s)= \text{rank}(E(\mathbb Q))$. In this paper, we prove that if we let $r=\text{ord} _{s=1}L(E, s)$, then under the assumption of the Riemann Hypothesis for $L(E, s)$, we have that $\prod \limits _{p \leq x} \frac{N_p}{p} \sim C (\log x)^r$ for all $x$ outside a set of finite logarithmic measure. As corollaries, we recover not only Goldfeld's result, but we also prove a result in the direction of the converse. Our method of proof is based on establishing the asymptotic behaviour of partial Euler products of $L(E, s)$ in the right-half of the critical strip.</description>

      <title>Large sieve inequalities for exceptional Maass forms and the greatest prime factor of $n^2+1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04239v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove new large sieve inequalities for the Fourier coefficients $\rho_{j\mathfrak{a}}(n)$ of exceptional Maass forms of a given level, weighted by sequences $(a_n)$ with sparse Fourier transforms - including two key types of sequences that arise in the dispersion method. These give the first savings in the exceptional spectrum for the critical case of sequences as long as the level, and lead to improved bounds for various multilinear forms of Kloosterman sums.
  As an application, we show that the greatest prime factor of $n^2+1$ is infinitely often greater than $n^{1.3}$, improving Merikoski's previous threshold of $n^{1.279}$. We also announce applications to the exponents of distribution of primes and smooth numbers in arithmetic progressions.</description>

      <title>On the solutions of the generalized Fermat equation over totally real number fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09171v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a totally real number field and $\mathcal{O}_K$ be the ring of integers of $K$. In this article, we study the asymptotic solutions of the generalized Fermat equation $Ax^p+By^p+Cz^p=0$ over $K$ with prime exponent $p$, where $A,B,C \in \mathcal{O}_K \setminus \{0\}$ with $ABC$ is even. For certain class of fields $K$, we prove that the equation $Ax^p+By^p+Cz^p=0$ has no asymptotic solution $(a,b,c) \in \mathcal{O}_K^3$ with $2|abc$. Then, under some assumptions on $A,B,C$, we also prove that $Ax^p+By^p+Cz^p=0$ has no asymptotic solution in $K^3$. Finally, we give several purely local criteria of $K$ such that $Ax^p+By^p+Cz^p=0$ has no asymptotic solutions in $K^3$, and calculate the density of such fields $K$ when $K$ is a real quadratic field.</description>

Abstract: Let $I(b,d,k)$ be the subseries of the harmonic series keeping the integers having exactly $k$ occurrences of the digit $d$ in base $b$. We prove the existence of an asymptotic expansion to all orders in descending powers of $b$, for fixed $d$ and $k$, of $I(b,d,k)-b\log(b)$. We explicitly give, depending on cases, either four or five terms. The coefficients involve the values of the zeta function at the integers.</description>

Abstract: Let $K$ be a number field and $\mathcal{O}_K$ be the ring of integers of $K$. In this article, we study the solutions of the generalized fruit Diophantine equation $ax^d-y^2-z^2 +xyz-c=0$ over $K$, where $d \geq 3$ is an integer and $a,c\in \mathcal{O}_K\setminus \{0\}$. Subsequently, we provide explicit values of square-free integers $t$ such that the equation $ax^d-y^2-z^2 +xyz-c=0$ has no solution $(x_0, y_0, z_0) \in \mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{t})}^3$ with $2 | x_0$, and demonstrate that the set of all such square-free integers $t$ with $t \geq 2$ has density exactly $\frac{1}{6}$. As an application, we construct infinitely many elliptic curves $E$ defined over number fields $K$ having no integral point $(x_0,y_0) \in \mathcal{O}_K^2$ with $2|x_0$.</description>

Abstract: The Kudla lift studied in this article is a classical version for Picard modular forms of the automorphic theta lift between $\text{GU}(2)$ and $\text{GU}(3)$. We construct an explicit $p$-adic analytic family of Picard modular forms varying with respect to the weight and level, which interpolates a so-called $p$-modification of the lift at arithmetic weights, by exploiting a formula of Finis for the Fourier-Jacobi coefficients of a lifted form.</description>

      <title>Counting the number of integral fixed points of a discrete dynamical system with applications from arithmetic statistics, I</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04026v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this first article of a multi-part series, we inspect a surprising relationship between the set of fixed points of a polynomial map $\varphi_{d, c}$ defined by $\varphi_{d, c}(z) = z^d + c$ for all $c, z \in \mathbb{Z}$ and the coefficient $c$, where $d &gt; 2$ is an integer. Inspired greatly by the elegant counting problems along with the very striking results of Bhargava-Shankar-Tsimerman and their collaborators in arithmetic statistics, and also by interesting point-counting result of Narkiewicz on rational periodic points of any odd degree map $\varphi_{d, c}$ in arithmetic dynamics, we then first prove that for any prime $p\geq 3$, the average number of distinct integral fixed points of any $\varphi_{p, c}$ modulo $p$ is $3$ or $0$ as $c$ tends to infinity. Inspired further by a conjecture of Hutz on rational periodic points of $\varphi_{p-1, c}$ for any prime $p\geq 5$ in arithmetic dynamics, we then also prove that the average number of distinct integral fixed points of any $\varphi_{p-1, c}$ modulo $p$ is $1$ or $2$ or $0$ as $c\to \infty$. Finally, we then apply density and number field-counting results from arithmetic statistics, and as a result obtain counting and statistical results on the irreducible integer polynomials and number fields arising naturally in our polynomial discrete dynamical settings.</description>

      <title>Counting the number of $\mathcal{O}_{K}$-fixed points of a discrete dynamical system with applications from arithmetic statistics, II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11393v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this follow-up paper, we again inspect a surprising connection between the set of fixed points of a polynomial map $\varphi_{d,c}$ defined by $\varphi_{d,c}(z) = z^d + c$ for all $c, z \in \mathcal{O}_{K}$ and the coefficient $c$, where $K$ is any number field of degree $n &gt; 1$ and $d &gt; 2$ is an integer. As before, we wish to study counting problems which are inspired by exciting advances in arithmetic statistics, and again partly by point-counting result of Narkiewicz on real $K$-rational periodic points of any odd degree map $\varphi_{d,c}$ in arithmetic dynamics. In doing so, we then first prove that for any real algebraic number field $K$ of degree $n \geq 2$, and for any prime $p \geq 3$ and integer $\ell \geq 1$, the average number of distinct integral fixed points of any $\varphi_{p^{\ell},c}$ modulo prime ideal $p\mathcal{O}_{K}$ is $3$ or $0$ as $c\to \infty$. Motivated further by $K$-rational periodic point-counting result of Benedetto on any $\varphi_{(p-1)^{\ell},c}$ for any prime $p \geq 5$ and integer $\ell \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1}$ in arithmetic dynamics, we then also prove unconditionally that for any number field (not necessarily real) $K$ of degree $n \geq 2$, the average number of distinct integral fixed points of any $\varphi_{(p-1)^{\ell},c}$ modulo prime $p\mathcal{O}_{K}$ is $1$ or $2$ or $0$ as $c\to \infty$. Finally, we then apply density and number field-counting results from arithmetic statistics, and as a result obtain counting and statistical results on irreducible polynomials and number fields arising naturally in our polynomial discrete dynamical settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Chebyshev's bias for the signs of Fourier coefficients of cuspidal newforms on $\Gamma_0(N)$. Our main result shows that the bias towards either sign is completely determined by the order of vanishing of the $L$-function $L(s, f)$ at the central point of the critical strip. We then give several examples of modular forms where we explicitly compute the order of vanishing of $L(s, f)$ at the central point and as a by-product, verify the super-positivity property, in the sense of Yun--Zhang (2017), for these examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore a method, going back to Landau and developed by Pintz, for connecting sums of arithmetic functions with zero-free regions for $L$-functions. In particular, we make explicit a general result of Pintz of this form; showing how one can use arithmetical information to deduce information about zeroes of $L$-functions, rather than the other way around. As a prototype, we work through an example with the Riemann zeta-function and sums of the M\"obius function, but we also outline the utility of this method in general.</description>

      <title>Exceptions to the Erd\H os--Straus--Schinzel conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A famous conjecture of Erd\H os and Straus is that for every integer $n\ge2$, $4/n$ can be represented as $1/x+1/y+1/z$, where $x,y,z$ are positive integers. This conjecture was generalized to $5/n$ by Sierpi\'nski, and then Schinzel conjectured that for every integer $m\ge4$ there is a bound $n_m$ such that the fraction $m/n$ is the sum of 3 unit fractions for all integers $n\ge n_m$. Leveraging and generalizing work of Elsholtz and Tao, we show that if $n_m$ exists it must be at least $\exp(m^{1/3+o(1)})$; that is, there are numbers $n$ this large for which $m/n$ is not the sum of 3 unit fractions. We prove a weaker, but numerically explicit version of this theorem, showing that for $m\ge 6.52\times10^9$ there is a prime $p\in(m^2,2m^2)$ with $m/p$ not the sum of 3 unit fractions, and report on some extensive numerical calculations that support this assertion with the much smaller bound $m\ge20$. A result of Vaughan is that for each $m$, most $n$'s have $m/n$ representable; we make the dependence on $m$ in this result explicit. In addition, we prove a result generalizing the problem to the sum of $j$ unit fractions.</description>

      <title>Chamber zeta function and closed galleries in the standard non-uniform complex from $\operatorname{PGL}_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the \emph{chamber zeta function} for a complex of groups, defined via an Euler product over primitive tailless chamber galleries, extending the Ihara--Bass framework from weighted graphs to higher-rank settings. Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the Bruhat--Tits building of $\mathrm{PGL}_{3}(F)$ for a non-archimedean local field $F$ with residue field $\mathbb{F}_{q}$. For the standard arithmetic quotient $\Gamma\backslash\mathcal{B}$ with $\Gamma=\mathrm{PGL}_{3}(\mathbb{F}_{q}[t])$, we prove an Ihara--Bass type \emph{determinant formula} expressing the chamber zeta function as the reciprocal of a characteristic polynomial of a naturally defined chamber transfer operator. In particular, the chamber zeta function is \emph{rational} in its complex parameter. As an application of the determinant formula, we obtain explicit counting results for closed gallery classes arising from tailless galleries in $\mathcal{B}$, including exact identities and spectral asymptotics governed by the chamber operator.</description>

      <title>Explicit bounds for the graphicality of the prime gap sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish explicit unconditional results on the graphic properties of the prime gap sequence. Let $p_n$ denote the $n$-th prime number (with $p_0=1$) and $\mathrm{PD}_n = (p_\ell - p_{\ell-1})_{\ell=1}^n$ be the sequence of the first $n$ prime gaps. Building upon the recent work by Erd\H{o}s \emph{et al}, which proved the graphic nature of $\mathrm{PD}_n$ for large $n$ unconditionally, and for all $n$ under RH, we provide the first explicit unconditional threshold such that: (1) For all $n \geq \exp\exp(30.5)$, $\mathrm{PD}_n$ is graphic. (2) For all $n \geq \exp\exp(34.5)$, every realization $G_n$ of $\mathrm{PD}_n$ satisfies that $(G_n, p_{n+1}-p_n)$ is DPG-graphic.
  Our proofs utilize a more refined criterion for when a sequence is graphic, and better estimates for the first moment of large prime gaps proven through an explicit zero-free region and explicit zero-density estimate for the Riemann zeta function.</description>

      <title>Rational Angle Bisection Problem in Higher Dimensional Spaces and Incenters of Simplices over Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24660v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we generalize the following problem, which is called the rational angle bisection problem, to the $n$-dimensional space $k^n$ over a subfield $k$ of $\mathbb R$: in the coordinate plane, for which rational numbers $a$ and $b$ are the slopes of the angle bisectors between two lines with slopes $a$ and $b$ rational? First, we give a few characterizations of when the angle bisectors between two lines with direction vectors in $k^n$ have direction vectors in $k^n.$ To find solutions to the problem in the case when $k = \mathbb Q,$ we also give a formula for the integral solutions of $x_1{}^2+\dots +x_n{}^2 = dx_{n+1}{}^2,$ which is a generalization of the negative Pell's equation $x^2-dy^2 = -1,$ where $d$ is a square-free positive integer. Second, by applying the above characterizations, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for the incenter of a given $n$-simplex with $k$-rational vertices to be $k$-rational. In the coordinate plane, we prove that every triangle with $k$-rational vertices and incenter can be obtained by scaling a triangle with $k$-rational side lengths and area, which is a generalization of a Heronian triangle. We also state certain fundamental properties of a few centers of a given triangle with $k$-rational vertices.</description>

      <title>Resolution of Erd\H{o}s Problem #728: a writeup of Aristotle's Lean proof</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07421v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a writeup of a resolution of Erd\H{o}s Problem #728; this is the first Erd\H{o}s problem (a problem proposed by Paul Erd\H{o}s which has been collected in the Erd\H{o}s Problems website) regarded as fully resolved autonomously by an AI system. The system in question is a combination of GPT-5.2 Pro by OpenAI and Aristotle by Harmonic, operated by Kevin Barreto. The final result of the system is a formal proof written in Lean, which we translate to informal mathematics in the present writeup for wider accessibility.
  The proved result is as follows. We show a logarithmic-gap phenomenon regarding factorial divisibility: For any constants $0&lt;C_1&lt;C_2$ and $0 &lt; \varepsilon &lt; 1/2$ there exist infinitely many triples $(a,b,n)\in\mathbb N^3$ with $\varepsilon n \le a,b \le (1-\varepsilon)n$ such that \[ a!\,b!\mid n!\,(a+b-n)!\qquad\text{and}\qquad C_1\log n &lt; a+b-n &lt; C_2\log n. \] The argument reduces this to a binomial divisibility $\binom{m+k}{k}\mid\binom{2m}{m}$ and studies it prime-by-prime. By Kummer's theorem, $\nu_p\binom{2m}{m}$ translates into a carry count for doubling $m$ in base $p$. We then employ a counting argument to find, in each scale $[M,2M]$, an integer $m$ whose base-$p$ expansions simultaneously force many carries when doubling $m$, for every prime $p\le 2k$, while avoiding the rare event that one of $m+1,\dots,m+k$ is divisible by an unusually high power of $p$. These "carry-rich but spike-free" choices of $m$ force the needed $p$-adic inequalities and the divisibility. The overall strategy is similar to results regarding divisors of $\binom{2n}{n}$ studied earlier by Erd\H{o}s and by Pomerance.</description>

      <title>$\mathfrak{B}$-free integers in number fields and dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.00855</link>
      <description>arXiv:1507.00855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2010, Sarnak initiated the study of the dynamics of the system determined by the square of the M\"obius function (the characteristic function of the square-free integers). We deal with his program in the more general context of $\mathfrak{B}$-free integers in number fields, suggested 5 years later by Baake and Huck. This setting encompasses the classical square-free case and its generalizations. Given a number field $K$, let $\mathfrak{B}$ be a family of pairwise coprime ideals in its ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_K$, such that $\sum_{\mathfrak{b}\in\mathfrak{B}}1/|\mathcal{O}_K / \mathfrak{b}|&lt;\infty$. We study the dynamical system determined by the set $\mathcal{F}_\mathfrak{B}=\mathcal{O}_K\setminus \bigcup_{\mathfrak{b}\in\mathfrak{B}}\mathfrak{b}$ of $\mathfrak{B}$-free integers in $\mathcal{O}_K$. We show that the characteristic function $\mathbb{1}_{\mathcal{F}_\mathfrak{B}}$ of $\mathcal{F}_\mathfrak{B}$ is generic along the natural F\o{}lner sequence for a probability measure on $\{0,1\}^{\mathcal{O}_K}$, invariant under the multidimensional shift. The corresponding measure-theoretical dynamical system is proved to be isomorphic to an ergodic rotation on a compact Abelian group. In particular, it is of zero Kolmogorov entropy. Moreover, we provide a description of ``patterns'' appearing in $\mathcal{F}_\mathfrak{B}$ and compute the topological entropy of the orbit closure of $\mathbb{1}_{\mathcal{F}_\mathfrak{B}}$. Finally, we show that this topological dynamical system has a non-trivial topological joining with an ergodic rotation on a compact Abelian group.</description>

      <title>Higher-dimensional multifractal analysis for the cusp winding process on hyperbolic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16418v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a multifractal analysis of the growth rate of the number of cusp windings for the geodesic flow on hyperbolic surfaces with $m \geq 1$ cusps. Our main theorem establishes a conditional variational principle for the Hausdorff dimension spectrum of the multi-cusp winding process. Moreover, we show that the dimension spectrum defined on $\mathbb{R}_{&gt;0}^m$ is real analytic. To prove the main theorem we use a countable Markov shift with a finitely primitive transition matrix and thermodynamic formalism.</description>

      <title>The five-color hypercube Adinkra and the Jacobian of a generalized Fermat curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11137v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adinkras are highly structured graphs developed to study 1-dimensional supersymmetry algebras. A cyclic ordering of the edge colors of an Adinkra, or rainbow, determines a Riemann surface and a height function on the vertices of the Adinkra determines a divisor on this surface. We study the induced map from height functions to divisors on the Jacobian of the Riemann surface. In the first nontrivial case, a 5-dimensional hypercube corresponding to a Jacobian given by a product of 5 elliptic curves each with $j$-invariant 2048, we develop and characterize a purely combinatorial algorithm to compute height function images. We show that when restricted to a single elliptic curve, every height function is a multiple of a specified generating divisor, and raising and lowering vertices corresponds to adding or subtracting this generator. We also give strict bounds on the coefficients of this generator that appear in the collection of all divisors of height functions.</description>

      <title>The Greedy Algorithm for Dissociated Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A set $\mathcal S\subset \mathbb N$ is said to be a subset-sum-distinct or dissociated if all of its finite subsets have different sums. Alternately, an equivalent classification is if any equality of the form $$\sum_{s\in \mathcal S} \varepsilon_s \cdot s =0$$ where $\varepsilon_s \in \{-1,0,+1\}$ implies that all the $\varepsilon_s$'s are $0$. For a dissociated set $\mathcal S$, we prove that for $c_\ast = \frac 12 \log_2 \left(\frac \pi 2\right)$ and any $c_\ast-1&lt;C&lt;c_\ast$, we have $$\mathcal S(n) \,:=\, \mathcal S\cap [1,n] \,\le\, \log_2 n +\frac 12 \log_2\log_2 n + C$$ for all $n\in \mathcal N_C$ with asymptotic density $\mathbf d\left(\mathcal N_C\right)=2-2^{c_\ast-C}$. Further, we consider the greedy algorithm for generating these sets and prove that this algorithm always eventually doubles. Finally, we also consider some generalizations of dissociated sets and prove similar results about them.</description>
