      <title>Digging for Decision Trees: A Case Study in Strategy Sampling and Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a formal model of transportation in an open-pit mine for the purpose of optimising the mine's operations. The model is a network of Markov automata (MA); the optimisation goal corresponds to maximising a time-bounded expected reward property. Today's model checking algorithms exacerbate the state space explosion problem by applying a discretisation approach to such properties on MA. We show that model checking is infeasible even for small mine instances. Instead, we propose statistical model checking with lightweight strategy sampling or table-based Q-learning over untimed strategies as an alternative to approach the optimisation task, using the Modest Toolset's modes tool. We add support for partial observability to modes so that strategies can be based on carefully selected model features, and we implement a connection from modes to the dtControl tool to convert sampled or learned strategies into decision trees. We experimentally evaluate the adequacy of our new tooling on the open-pit mine case study. Our experiments demonstrate the limitations of Q-learning, the impact of feature selection, and the usefulness of decision trees as an explainable representation.</description>

      <title>A lower bound on the state complexity of transforming two-way nondeterministic finite automata to unambiguous finite automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes a lower bound on the number of states necessary in the worst case to simulate an $n$-state two-way nondeterministic finite automaton (2NFA) by a one-way unambiguous finite automaton (UFA). It is proved that for every $n$, there is a language recognized by an $n$-state 2NFA that requires a UFA with at least $\sum_{k=1}^{n} (k - 1)! \cdot k! \cdot \mathrm{stirling2}(n, k) \cdot \mathrm{stirling2}(n+1, k)$ = $\Omega \big( n^{2n+2} / e^{2n} \big)$ states, where $\mathrm{stirling2}(n, k)$ denotes Stirling's numbers of the second kind. This result is proved by estimating the rank of a certain matrix, which is constructed for the universal language for $n$-state 2NFAs, and describes every possible behaviour of these automata during their computation.</description>

      <title>Measuring Grammatical Diversity from Small Corpora: Derivational Entropy Rates, Mean Length of Utterances, and Annotation Invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many fields, such as language acquisition, neuropsychology of language, the study of aging, and historical linguistics, corpora are used for estimating the diversity of grammatical structures that are produced during a period by an individual, community, or type of speakers. In these cases, treebanks are taken as representative samples of the syntactic structures that might be encountered. Generalizing the potential syntactic diversity from the structures documented in a small corpus requires careful extrapolation whose accuracy is constrained by the limited size of representative sub-corpora. In this article, I demonstrate -- theoretically, and empirically -- that a grammar's derivational entropy and the mean length of the utterances (MLU) it generates are fundamentally linked, giving rise to a new measure, the derivational entropy rate. The mean length of utterances becomes the most practical index of syntactic complexity; I demonstrate that MLU is not a mere proxy, but a fundamental measure of syntactic diversity. In combination with the new derivational entropy rate measure, it provides a theory-free assessment of grammatical complexity. The derivational entropy rate indexes the rate at which different grammatical annotation frameworks determine the grammatical complexity of treebanks. I introduce the Smoothed Induced Treebank Entropy (SITE) as a tool for estimating these measures accurately, even from very small treebanks. I conclude by discussing important implications of these results for both NLP and human language processing.</description>

      <title>Reasoning about Strategic Abilities in Stochastic Multi-agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reasoning about strategic abilities is key to AI systems comprising multiple agents, which provide a unified framework for formalizing various problems in game theory, social choice theory, etc. In this work, we propose a probabilistic extension of the alternating-time $\mu$-calculus (AMC), named PAMC, for reasoning about the strategic abilities of agents in stochastic multi-agent systems. We show that PAMC subsumes two existing logics AMC and P$\mu$TL (a probabilistic extension of the modal $\mu$-calculus), but is incomparable with the probabilistic alternating-time temporal logic (PATL). We study the problems of model checking and satisfiability checking for PAMC. We first give a model checking algorithm by leveraging algorithms for solving normal-form games and AMC model checking. We establish that the model checking problem of PAMC remains in UP$\cap$co-UP, the same complexity class as the model checking problem for AMC and P$\mu$TL. We also provide a new reduction from the satisfiability problem of PAMC to solving parity games, by which we obtain an EXPTIME decision procedure, as well as the small model property which allows us to construct a model for each satisfiable PAMC formula. Satisfiability in PAMC has the same complexity as in the modal $\mu$-calculus, unlike PCTL and PATL whose satisfiability checking problems remain open. We have implemented both the model checking and satisfiability checking algorithms as open-source tools. Experimental results are reported, showcasing the practical applications and effectiveness of our approaches.</description>

      <title>Probability and Angelic Nondeterminism with Multiset Semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a version of probabilistic Kleene algebra with angelic nondeterminism and a corresponding class of automata. Our approach implements semantics via distributions over multisets in order to overcome theoretical barriers arising from the lack of a distributive law between the powerset and Giry monads. We produce a full Kleene theorem and a coalgebraic theory, as well as both operational and denotational semantics and equational reasoning principles.</description>

      <title>Combinatorics on words and generating Dirichlet series of automatic sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13524v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generating series are crucial in enumerative combinatorics, analytic combinatorics, and combinatorics on words. Though it might seem at first view that generating Dirichlet series are less used in these fields than ordinary and exponential generating series, there are many notable papers where they play a fundamental role, as can be seen in particular in the work of Flajolet and several of his co-authors. In this paper, we study Dirichlet series of integers with missing digits or blocks of digits in some integer base $b$; i.e., where the summation ranges over the integers whose expansions form some language strictly included in the set of all words over the alphabet $\{0, 1, \dots, b-1\}$ that do not begin with a $0$. We show how to unify and extend results proved by Nathanson in 2021 and by K\"ohler and Spilker in 2009. En route, we encounter several sequences from Sloane's On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences, as well as some famous $b$-automatic sequences or $b$-regular sequences. We also consider a specific sequence that is not $b$-regular.</description>

      <title>Implicit automata in {\lambda}-calculi III: affine planar string-to-string functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03985v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a characterization of first-order string-to-string transduction via $\lambda$-terms typed in non-commutative affine logic that compute with Church encoding, extending the analogous known characterization of star-free languages. We show that every first-order transduction can be computed by a $\lambda$-term using a known Krohn-Rhodes-style decomposition lemma. The converse direction is given by compiling $\lambda$-terms into two-way reversible planar transducers. The soundness of this translation involves showing that the transition functions of those transducers live in a monoidal closed category of diagrams in which we can interpret purely affine $\lambda$-terms. One challenge is that the unit of the tensor of the category in question is not a terminal object. As a result, our interpretation does not identify $\beta$-equivalent terms, but it does turn $\beta$-reductions into inequalities in a poset-enrichment of the category of diagrams.</description>
