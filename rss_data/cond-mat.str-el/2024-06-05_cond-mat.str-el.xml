      <title>Gross-Neveu-Yukawa theory of $\text{SO}(2N)\rightarrow \text{SO}(N) \times \text{SO}(N)$ spontaneous symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct and study the relativistic Gross-Neveu-Yukawa field theory for the $\text{SO}(2N)$ real symmetric second-rank tensor order parameter coupled to $N_f$ flavors of $4N$-component Majorana fermions in 2+1 dimensions. Such a tensor order parameter unifies all Lorentz-invariant mass-gap orders for $N$ two-component Dirac fermions in two dimensions except for the $\text{SO}(2N)$-singlet anomalous quantum Hall state. The value $N_f=1$ corresponds to the canonical Gross-Neveu model. Within the leading-order $\epsilon$-expansion around the upper critical dimension of $3+1$ the field theory exhibits a critical fixed point in its renormalization group flow which describes spontaneous symmetry breaking to $\text{SO}(N)\times \text{SO}(N)$ for the number of flavors of Majorana fermions higher than a critical value $N_{f,c2}\approx 2N$. For $N_{f, c1}&lt; N_f &lt; N_{f,c2}$ , with $N_{f,c1} \approx 1.080 N$ the critical fixed point resides in the unstable region of the theory where the effective potential is unbounded from below, whereas for $N_f &lt; N_{f,c1}$ there is no real critical fixed point, and the flow runs away. In either case, for $N_f &lt; N_{f,c2}$ the transition should become fluctuation-induced first-order, and we discuss the dependence of its size on the parameters in the theory. One-loop critical exponents for the new universality class at $N_{f, c2}&lt; N_f $ are computed and the flow diagram in various regimes is discussed.</description>

      <title>Ferromagnetic semimetal and charge-density wave phases of interacting electrons in a honeycomb moir\'e potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exploration of quantum phases in moir\'e systems has drawn intense experimental and theoretical efforts. The realization of honeycomb symmetry has been a recent focus. The combination of strong interaction and honeycomb symmetry can lead to exotic electronic states such as fractional Chern insulator, unconventional superconductor, and quantum spin liquid. Accurate computations in such systems, with reliable treatment of strong long-ranged Coulomb interaction and approaching the large system sizes to extract thermodynamic phases, are mostly missing. We study the two-dimensional electron gas on a honeycomb moir\'e lattice at quarter filling, using fixed-phase diffusion Monte Carlo. The ground state phases of this important model are determined in the parameter regime relevant to current experiments. With increasing moir\'e potential, the systems transitions from a paramagnetic metal to an itinerant ferromagnetic semimetal and then a charge-density-wave insulator.</description>

      <title>Phase diagram and topology of the XXZ chain with alternating bonds and staggered magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The XXZ spin-half chain has Heisenberg exchange interactions $J_z$ ($J_\perp$) in the $z$ ($x,y$) direction. The model has a transition from the spin-fluid phase for $-J_\perp &lt; J_z &lt; J_\perp$ to the N\'{e}el phase for $J_z &gt; J_\perp &gt;0$. When bond alternation $\delta$ is included, the N\'{e}el phase transitions to the dimer phase for a finite value of $\delta$. We determine the phase diagram using simple topological indicators related to the polarization of both spins. When a staggered magnetic field $B$ is included, a contour plot of these indicators as a function of $\delta$ and $B$ determine the amount of topological quantized spin pumping around closed circuits in the $(\delta,B)$ plane.</description>

      <title>Fermion-fermion interaction driven phase transitions in the rhombohedral trilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effects of short-range fermion-fermion interactions on the low-energy properties of the rhombohedral trilayer graphene are comprehensively investigated by virtue of the momentum-shell renormalization group method. We take into account all one-loop corrections and establish the energy-dependent coupled evolutions of independent fermionic couplings that carry the physical information stemming from the interplay of various fermion-fermion interactions. With the help of the detailed numerical analysis, we notice that the ferocious competition among all fermion-fermion interactions can drive fermionic couplings to four distinct kinds of fixed points, dubbed $\textrm{FP}_{1}$, $\textrm{FP}_{2}$, $\textrm{FP}_{3}$ and $\textrm{FP}_{4}$, in the interaction-parameter space. Such fixed points principally dictate the fate of the system in the low-energy regime, which are always associated with some instabilities with specific symmetry breakings and thus accompanied by certain phase transitions. In order to judge the favorable states arising from the potential phase transitions, we bring out a number of fermion-bilinear source terms to characterize the underlying candidate states. By comparing their related susceptibilities, it is determined that the dominant states correspond to a spin-singlet superconductivity, a spin-triplet pair-density-wave, and a spin-triplet superconductivity for approaching the fixed points $\textrm{FP}_{1,3}$, $\textrm{FP}_{2}$, and $\textrm{FP}_{4}$, respectively. These results would be helpful to further reveal the low-energy properties of the rhombohedral trilayer graphene and analogous materials.</description>

      <title>Gifts from long-range interaction: Emergent gapless topological behaviors in quantum spin chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topology in condensed matter physics is typically associated with a bulk energy gap. However, recent research has shifted focus to topological phases without a bulk energy gap, exhibiting nontrivial gapless topological behaviors. In this letter, we explore a cluster Ising chain with long-range antiferromagnetic interactions that decay as a power law with the distance. Using complementary numerical and analytical techniques, we demonstrate that long-range interactions can unambiguously induce an algebraic topological phase and a topological Gaussian universality, both of which exhibit nontrivial gapless topological behaviors. Our study not only provides a platform to investigate the fundamental physics of quantum many-body systems but also offers a novel route toward searching for gapless topological phases in realistic quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Quantum colored strings in the hole-doped $t$-$J_z$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stripe phase, an intertwined order observed in high-temperature superconductors, is regarded as playing a key role in elucidating the underlying mechanism of superconductivity, especially in cuprates. Following Jan Zaanen's early scenario, the full-filled charge stripe can be taken as the interactive elastic quantum strings of holes, stabilized by $\pi$-phase shifts between neighboring magnetic domains. However, this scenario is challenging to explain, particularly in terms of electron pairing, which necessitates hole pairs. In this work, we propose a new effective model for describing the stripe phase in the hole-doped $t$-$J_z$ model. With respect to the antiferromagnetic background, the model comprises three types of color-labeled point-defects coupling to {an effective} spin field. Comparing with numerical results from large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we find semi-quantitative agreement in local hole density, magnetic moment, and the newly proposed spectrum features of the {effective} spin field. By systematically analyzing the hole-density distribution and the scaling of groundstate energy at different system sizes, we determine the effective core radius and the effective hopping amplitude of the quantum string. Furthermore, the local pinning field can be finely adjusted to drag the quantum string, offering a potential method for detecting it in optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-Governed Dynamics of Magnetic Skyrmions Under Field Pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological magnetic solitons, such as skyrmions, exhibit intriguing particle-like properties that make them attractive for fundamental research and practical applications. While many magnetic systems can host skyrmions as statically stable configurations, chiral magnets stand out for their ability to accommodate a wide diversity of skyrmions with arbitrary topological charges and varied morphologies. Despite extensive investigation, a complete understanding of chiral magnetic skyrmions has remained elusive. We present a classification of all chiral skyrmions, demonstrating three classes based on their response to external magnetic field pulses: stationary, translating, and rotating. We highlight the role of magnetic texture symmetry in this classification. Skyrmions with varied dynamics offer avenues for exploring phenomena like skyrmion-skyrmion scattering that might be crucial for future applications.</description>

      <title>Anomalous 4$f$ fine structure in TmSe$_{1-x}$Te$_x$ across the metal-insulator transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybridization between localized 4$f$ and itinerant 5$d$6$s$ states in heavy fermion compounds is a well-studied phenomenon and commonly captured by the paradigmatic Anderson model. However, the investigation of additional electronic interactions, beyond the standard Anderson model, has been limited, despite their predicted important role in the exotic quasiparticle formation in mixed-valence systems. We investigate the 4$f$ states in TmSe$_{1-x}$Te$_x$ throughout a semimetal-insulator phase transition, which drastically varies the interactions related to the 4$f$ states. Using synchrotron-based hard x-ray and extreme ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy, we resolve subtle peak splitting in the 4$f$ peaks near the Fermi level in the mixed-valent semimetal phase. The separation is enhanced by several tens of meV by increasing the lattice parameter by a few percent. Our results elucidate the evolving nature of the 4$f$ state across the phase transition, and provide direct experimental evidence for electronic interactions beyond the standard Anderson model in mixed-valence systems.</description>

      <title>Tunable $t-t'-U$ Hubbard models in twisted square homobilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Square lattice Hubbard models with tunable hopping ratio $t'/t$ are highly promising for realizing a variety of quantum phases and for shedding light on key puzzles in correlated quantum materials, including higher-temperature superconductivity. We show that twisted square lattice homo-bilayers generically offer such tunability when the flat bands originate from the corner of the Brillouin zone. We reveal an emergent symmetry at low twist-angles, absent in single layers, that necessitates the vanishing of nearest neighbor hopping ($t=0$). This symmetry can be lifted by an inter-layer displacement field or by an in-plane magnetic field, introducing tunable $t$ and anisotropy, allowing access to a wide range of $t'/t$ ratios for correlated electrons on a moir\'e square lattice.</description>

      <title>Toeplitz non-liquids and Toeplitz braiding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of $3$D non-liquid states called ``Toeplitz non-liquids''. These states consist of a stack of $2$D twisted $\mathbb{Z}_N$ topologically ordered layers along the $z$-direction; nearby layers are coupled while keeping translational symmetry along $z$. The effective field theory is described by infinite Chern-Simons (iCS) theory, with a coefficient matrix called ``$K$-matrix'' that is of block-tridiagonal Toeplitz matrix-type. With open boundary conditions (OBC) along the $z$-direction, certain $K$-matrices exhibit an exotic phenomenon called ``Toeplitz braiding'', where the mutual braiding statistical phase between two anyons at opposite boundaries oscillates and remains non-zero in the thermodynamic limit. As a necessary condition, this requires boundary zero modes in the $K$-matrix spectrum under OBC. A key example is the $K$-matrix resembling the Hamiltonian of the $1$D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger insulator. Since the gauge invariance of Chern-Simons theory guarantees integer quantized entries for $K$-matrices, no usual global symmetries are needed to protect these zero modes or Toeplitz braiding. In order to obtain the general theory, we categorize $K$-matrices that support Toeplitz braiding into three types and analyze the conditions for each. We further numerically study the analytical results for all types of $K$-matrices. For comparison, a trivial case is numerically shown, where the mutual statistical phase angle decays exponentially to zero in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>Helimagnetism in CrBr$_2$ and CrIBr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In CrX$_2$ (X=Br, I), a Jahn-Teller effect distorts the octahedral configuration of the anions about Cr, resulting in a "ribbon chain" structure. We previously observed helimagnetism in CrI$_2$ propagating along the ribbon chains, with an 80-90$^{\circ}$ rotation per Cr ion. Via neutron scattering, we report that CrBr$_2$ and the solid solution CrIBr are also helimagnetic, with N\'{e}el temperatures of 17 and 12 K, respectively, and signs of intermediate magnetic transitions in both compounds. The helical angle between spins on consecutive Cr ions along the ribbon chains increases with increasing Br substitution, from 89.7$^{\circ}$ (CrI$_2$) to 116$^{\circ}$ (CrIBr) to 147$^{\circ}$ (CrBr$_2$), possibly as a result of decreasing longer-range intrachain spin interactions with the increased electron localization of the lighter anions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The field of molecular electronics has emerged from efforts to understand electron propagation through single molecules and to use them in electronic circuits. Serving as a testbed for advanced theoretical methods, it reveals a significant discrepancy between the operational time scales of experiments (static to GHz frequencies) and theoretical models (femtoseconds). Utilizing a recently developed time-linear nonequilibrium Green's functions formalism, we model molecular junctions on experimentally accessible timescales. Our study focuses on the quantum pump effect in a Benzenedithiol molecule connected to two copper electrodes and coupled with cavity photons. By calculating both electric and photonic current responses to an ac bias voltage, we observe pronounced electroluminescence and high harmonic generation in this setup. The mechanism of the latter effect is more analogous to that from solids than from isolated molecules, with even harmonics being suppressed or enhanced depending on the symmetry of the driving field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Onsager algebra, invented to solve the two-dimensional Ising model, can be used to construct conserved charges for a family of integrable $N$-state chiral clock models. We show how it naturally gives rise to a "pivot" procedure for this family of chiral Hamiltonians. These Hamiltonians have an anti-unitary CPT symmetry that when combined with the usual $\mathbb{Z}_N$ clock symmetry gives a non-abelian dihedral symmetry group $D_{2N}$. We show that this symmetry gives rise to symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order in this family for all even $N$, and representation-SPT (RSPT) physics for all odd $N$. The simplest such example is a next-nearest-neighbour chain generalising the spin-1/2 cluster model, an SPT phase of matter. We derive a matrix-product state representation of its fixed-point ground state along with the ensuing entanglement spectrum and symmetry fractionalisation. We analyse a rich phase diagram combining this model with the Onsager-integrable chiral Potts chain, and find trivial, symmetry-breaking and (R)SPT orders, as well as extended gapless regions. For odd $N$, the phase transitions are "unnecessarily" critical from the SPT point of view.</description>

      <title>Bosonization of 2+1 dimensional fermions on the surface of topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional topological insulators can be described by an effective field theory involving two `hydrodynamic' Abelian gauge fields. The action contains a bulk topological BF term and a surface term, called loop model. This describes the massless 2+1 dimensional excitations and provides them with a semiclassical, yet non-trivial conformal invariant dynamics. Given that topological insulators are originally fermionic, this physical setting is ideal for realizing the bosonization of massless fermions in terms of gauge fields. Building on earlier analyses of the loop model, we find that fermions belong to the solitonic spectrum and can be described by Wilson lines, through the generalization of 1+1 dimensional vertex operators. Their correlation functions agree with conformal invariance. The bosonic loop model is then mapped into a fermionic theory by using the general construction of fermionic topological phases described in the literature. It requires the identification of the characteristic one-form $Z_2$ symmetry of the bosonic theory and its gauging, which originates the fermion number $(-1)^F$, the spin sectors and the time reversal symmetry obeying ${\cal T}^2=(-1)^F$. These results are detailed for the effective action and the partition function on the geometry $S^2\times S^1$.</description>

      <title>High-temperature magnetic anomaly via suppression of antisite disorder through synthesis route modification in a Kitaev candidate Cu$_2$IrO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By incorporating inert KCl into the Na$_2$IrO$_3$ + 2CuCl $\to$ Cu$_2$IrO$_3$ + 2NaCl topochemical reaction, we significantly reduced the synthesis temperature of Cu$_2$IrO$_3$ from the 350$^\circ$C reported in previous studies to 170$^\circ$C. This adjustment decreased the Cu/Ir antisite disorder concentration in Cu$_2$IrO$_3$ from $\sim$19$\%$ to $\sim$5$\%$. Furthermore, magnetic susceptibility measurements of the present Cu$_2$IrO$_3$ sample revealed a weak ferromagnetic-like anomaly with hysteresis at a magnetic transition temperature of $\sim$70 K. Our research indicates that the spin-disordered ground state reported in chemically disordered Cu$_2$IrO$_3$ is an extrinsic phenomenon, rather than an intrinsic one, underscoring the pivotal role of synthetic chemistry in understanding the application of Kitaev model to realistic materials.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-transition between antiferromagnetic and charge orders in a minimal spin-pseudospin model of one-dimensional cuprates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study rigorously investigates the phenomenon of a pseudo-transition in a minimal spinpseudospin model, serving as a simplified model of one-dimensional cuprate chains [CuO]n, by making use of the transfer-matrix method. The studied spin-pseudospin model of one-dimensional cuprate chains [CuO]n reveals a peculiar pseudo-transition between a charged-ordered phase and an antiferromagnetic phase, which is accompanied with anomalous behavior of magnetic and thermodynamic quantities. While the entropy and short-range correlations undergo near the pseudo-transition steep continuous changes reminiscent of a discontinuous phase transition, the specific heat displays a sizable sharp peak akin to a continuous phase transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dissipative systems with decoherence free subspaces, a.k.a. dark spaces (DSs), can be used to protect quantum information. At the same time, dissipation is expected to give rise to coherent information degradation outside the DS. Employed to support quantum information platforms, DSs can be adiabatically modified in a way that resembles adiabatic control of coherent systems. Here we study the slow evolution of a purely dissipative system with a spectral gap $\gamma$, characterized by a strong symmetry, under a cyclic protocol with period $T$. Non-adiabatic corrections to the state evolution give rise to decoherence: the evolution within the instantaneous DS is described by a time-local effective Liouvillian operator that leads to purity degradation over a period, of order $1/\gamma T$. We obtain a closed form of the latter to order $1/(\gamma T)^2$. Our analysis underlines speed limitations in quantum information processing in the absence of corrective measures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present here a method of probing the wave functions of a degenerate shell in a triangular graphene quantum dot, triangulene, using a localized substitutional impurity. We demonstrate its applicability to the example of aza-triangulenes. Using the analytical solution for degenerate states of an all-carbon triangulene as a basis for a triangulene containing a nitrogen impurity, we predict the structure of the zero energy shell in the presence of this impurity. We show that the impurity allows probing of the wave functions of a degenerate shell on a carbon site where it is located. We confirm our predictions by a comparison with the tight-binding and ab-initio calculation as well as with experiment.</description>

      <title>Electronic properties of magnetic semiconductor $\textrm{CuMnO}_{2}$ : a first principles study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geometrically frustrated magnetic semiconductor $\textrm{CuMnO}_{2}$ has potential applications as photo-catalyst, in photochemical cells and multi-ferroic devices. Electronic band structure in the antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic phases of $\textrm{CuMnO}_{2}$ were calculated using first principle density functional theory (DFT) as implemented in VASP. Electronic band structure in the antiferromagnetic state shows indirect band gap ($\sim 0.53$ eV) where as in the ferromagnetic state it shows half-metallic state with 100\% spin polarization. The half-metallic state arises due to \textit{double exchange} mechanism. In the half-metallic state the density of states for the up spin channel shows asymmetric power law behaviour near the Fermi level while the down spin channel shows fully gapped behaviour. The calculated magnetic moment of Mn atom in the ferromagnetic (3.70 $\mu_{B}$) and antiferromagnetic (3.57 $\mu_{B}$) states are consistent with experimental values. Our calculation predicts potential application of $\textrm{CuMnO}_{2}$ in spintronic devices especially in the ferromagnetic state, as a spin injector for spin valves in spintronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The simulation of high-temperature superconducting materials by implementing strongly correlated fermionic models in optical lattices is one of the major objectives in the field of analog quantum simulation. Here we show that local control and optical bilayer capabilities create a versatile toolbox to study both nickelate and cuprate high-temperature superconductors. On the one hand, we present a scheme to implement a mixed-dimensional (mixD) bilayer model that has been proposed to capture the essential pairing physics of pressurized bilayer nickelates. This allows for the long-sought realization of a state with long-range superconducting order in current lattice quantum simulation machines. In particular, we show how coherent pairing correlations can be accessed in a partially particle-hole transformed and rotated basis. On the other hand, we demonstrate that control of local gates enables the observation of $d$-wave pairing order in the two-dimensional (single-layer) repulsive Fermi-Hubbard model through the simulation of a system with attractive interactions. Lastly, we introduce a scheme to measure momentum-resolved dopant densities, providing access to observables complementary to solid-state experiments -- which is of particular interest for future studies of the enigmatic pseudogap phase appearing in cuprates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.05278v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The magnetic interactions that determine magnetic order and magnon energies typically involve only two spins. While rare, multi-spin interactions can also appear in quantum magnets and be the driving force in the ground state selection and in the nature of its excitations. By performing time-domain terahertz and magneto-Raman spectroscopy measurements combined with theoretical modeling, we determine the origin of the magnon excitation gap in Dirac antiferromagnet CoTiO$_3$. By adding a ring-exchange interaction in a hexagonal plaquette of the honeycomb lattice to both an XXZ spin model and to a low energy spin-orbital flavor wave model, a gap is generated in the magnon spectrum at the Brillouin zone center. With this addition, the flavor wave model reproduces a large swath of experimental results including terahertz, Raman, inelastic neutron scattering, and magnetization experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05758v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stability of fractional Chern insulators is widely believed to be predicted by the resemblance of their single-particle spectra to Landau levels. We investigate the scope of this geometric stability hypothesis by analyzing the stability of a set of fractional Chern insulators that explicitly do not have a Landau level continuum limit. By computing the many-body spectra of Laughlin states in a generalized Hofstadter model, we analyze the relationship between single-particle metrics, such as trace inequality saturation, and many-body metrics, such as the magnitude of the many-body and entanglement gaps. We show numerically that the geometric stability hypothesis holds for Chern bands that are not continuously connected to Landau levels, as well as conventional Chern bands, albeit often requiring larger system sizes to converge for these configurations.</description>

      <title>Two dimensional quantum lattice models via mode optimized hybrid CPU-GPU density matrix renormalization group method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a hybrid numerical approach to simulate quantum many body problems on two spatial dimensional quantum lattice models via the non-Abelian ab initio version of the density matrix renormalization group method on state-of-the-art high performance computing infrastructures. We demonstrate for the two dimensional spinless fermion model and for the Hubbard model on torus geometry that altogether several orders of magnitude in computational time can be saved by performing calculations on an optimized basis and by utilizing hybrid CPU-multiGPU parallelization. At least an order of magnitude reduction in computational complexity results from mode optimization, while a further order of reduction in wall time is achieved by massive parallelization. Our results are measured directly in FLOP and seconds. A detailed scaling analysis of the obtained performance as a function of matrix ranks and as a function of system size up to $12\times 12$ lattice topology is discussed. Our CPU-multiGPU model also tremendously accelerates the calculation of the one- and two-particle reduced density matrices, which can be used to construct various order parameters and trace quantum phase transitions with high fidelity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09502v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a SU(2) lattice gauge theory on the square lattice, with a single fundamental complex fermion and a single fundamental complex boson on each lattice site. Projective symmetries of the gauge-charged fermions are chosen so that they match with those of the spinons of the $\pi$-flux spin liquid. Global symmetries of all gauge-invariant observables are chosen to match with those of the particle-hole symmetric electronic Hubbard model at half-filling. Consequently, both the fundamental fermion and fundamental boson move in an average background $\pi$-flux, their gauge-invariant composite is the physical electron, and eliminating gauge fields in a strong gauge-coupling expansion yields an effective extended Hubbard model for the electrons. The SU(2) gauge theory displays several confining/Higgs phases: a nodal $d$-wave superconductor, and states with N\'eel, valence-bond solid, charge, or staggered current orders. There are also a number of quantum phase transitions between these phases which are very likely described by 2+1 dimensional deconfined conformal gauge theories, and we present large flavor expansions for such theories. These include the phenomenologically attractive case of a transition between a conventional insulator with a charge gap and N\'eel order, and a conventional $d$-wave superconductor with gapless Bogoliubov quasiparticles at 4 nodal points in the Brillouin zone. We also apply our approach to the honeycomb lattice, where we find a bicritical point at the junction of N\'eel, valence bond solid (Kekul\'e), and Dirac semi-metal phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent x-ray spectroscopic studies have revealed spin excitations and charge density waves in thin films of infinite-layer (IL) nickelates. However, clarifying whether the origin of these phenomena is intrinsic to the material class or attributable to impurity phases in the films has presented a major challenge. Here we utilize topotactic methods to synthesize bulk crystals of the IL nickelate LaNiO$_2$ with crystallographically oriented surfaces. We examine these crystals using resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) at the Ni $L_3$-edge to elucidate the spin and charge correlations in the bulk of the material. While we detect the presence of prominent spin excitations in the crystals, fingerprints of charge order are absent at the ordering vectors identified in previous in thin-film studies. These results contribute to the understanding of the bulk properties of LaNiO$_2$ and establish topotactically synthesized crystals as viable complementary specimens for spectroscopic investigations.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the recent observations of electronic correlation effect [M. Corasaniti \textit{et al}., Phys. Rev. B \textbf{104}, L121112 (2021)] and topology-stabilized magnetic fluctuations [N. Drucker \textit{et al}., Nat. Commun. \textbf{14}, 5182 (2023)] in the noncentrosymmetric magnetic Weyl semimetal candidate CeAlGe, we performed systematic studies on the local static and dynamic spin susceptibilities by $^{27}$Al nuclear magnetic resonance. Due to the large spin susceptibility from Ce-$4f$ electrons, the theoretically predicted responses from Weyl fermions are overwhelmed. A Knight-shift anomaly is observed below $T^*\sim50$ K, a signature of the onset of coherent Kondo coupling. In addition, an anomalous peak is found in $1/T_1T$ near 15 K, well above the magnetic ordering temperature $T_N \approx 5$ K, which probably is a consequence of topology-stabilized magnetic fluctuations. These results highlight the interplay among electronic correlation, magnetism and band topology in this family of Kondo Weyl semimetals.</description>

Abstract: There is currently significant interest in emulating the essential characteristics of black holes, such as their Hawking radiation or their optimal scrambling behavior, using condensed matter models. In this article, we investigate a chiral spin-chain, whose mean field theory effectively captures the behavior of Dirac fermions in the curved spacetime geometry of a black hole. We find that within the region of the chain that describe the interior of the black hole, strong correlations prevail giving rise to many-body chaotic dynamics. Employing out-of-time-order correlations as a diagnostic tool, we numerically compute the associated Lyapunov exponent. Intriguingly, we observe a linear increase in the Lyapunov exponent with temperature within the black hole's interior at low temperatures, indicative of optimal scrambling behavior. This contrasts with the quadratic temperature dependence exhibited by the spin-chain on the region outside the black hole. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the interplay between black hole geometry and quantum chaos, offering insights into fundamental aspects of quantum gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is considerable evidence that the heavy fermion material UTe$_2$ is a spin-triplet superconductor, possibly manifesting time-reversal symmetry breaking, as measured by Kerr effect and muon spin resonance experiments below the critical temperature, in some samples. Such signals can arise due to a chiral orbital state, or possible nonunitary pairing. Although experiments at low $T$ appear to be consistent with point nodes in the spectral gap, the detailed form of the order parameter and even the nodal positions are not yet determined. Thermal conductivity measurements can extend to quite low temperatures, with varying heat current direction can therefore provide information on the order parameter structure. Here we derive a general expression for the thermal conductivity of a spin triplet superconductor, and use it to compare the low-temperature behavior of various states proposed for UTe$_2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a Hamiltonian formalism for simulating interacting chiral fermions on the lattice while preserving unitarity and locality and without breaking the chiral symmetry. The fermion doubling problem is circumvented by constructing a Fock space endowed with a semi-definite norm. When projecting our theory on the the single-particle sector, we recover the framework of Stacey fermions, and we demonstrate that the scaling limit of the free model recovers the chiral fermion field. Technically, we make use of a matrix product operator norm to mimick the boundary of a higher dimensional topological theory. As a proof of principle, we consider a single Weyl fermion on a periodic ring with Hubbard-type nearest-neighbor interactions and construct a variational generalized DMRG code to demonstrate that the ground state for large system sizes can be determined efficiently. As our tensor network approach does not exhibit any sign problem, we can add a chemical potential and study real-time evolution.</description>

Abstract: Learning faithful representations of quantum states is crucial to fully characterizing the variety of many-body states created on quantum processors. While various tomographic methods such as classical shadow and MPS tomography have shown promise in characterizing a wide class of quantum states, they face unique limitations in detecting topologically ordered two-dimensional states. To address this problem, we implement and study a heuristic tomographic method that combines variational optimization on tensor networks with randomized measurement techniques. Using this approach, we demonstrate its ability to learn the ground state of the surface code Hamiltonian as well as an experimentally realizable quantum spin liquid state. In particular, we perform numerical experiments using MPS ans\"atze and systematically investigate the sample complexity required to achieve high fidelities for systems of sizes up to $48$ qubits. In addition, we provide theoretical insights into the scaling of our learning algorithm by analyzing the statistical properties of maximum likelihood estimation. Notably, our method is sample-efficient and experimentally friendly, only requiring snapshots of the quantum state measured randomly in the $X$ or $Z$ bases. Using this subset of measurements, our approach can effectively learn any real pure states represented by tensor networks, and we rigorously prove that random-$XZ$ measurements are tomographically complete for such states.</description>
