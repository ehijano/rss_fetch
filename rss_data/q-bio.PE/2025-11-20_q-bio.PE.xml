      <title>The role of antibody-mediated immunity in shaping the seasonality of respiratory viruses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In temperate regions, respiratory virus epidemics recur on a yearly basis, primarily during the winter season. This is believed to be induced by seasonal forcing, where the rate at which the virus can be transmitted varies cyclically across the course of each year. Seasonal epidemics can place substantial burden upon the healthcare system, with large numbers of infections and hospitalisations occurring across a short time period. However, the interactions between seasonal forcing and the factors necessary for epidemic resurgence - such as waning immunity, antigenic variation or demography - remain poorly understood. In this manuscript, we examine how the dynamics of antibody waning and antigenic variation can shape the seasonal recurrence of epidemics. We develop a susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS) immuno-epidemiological model of respiratory virus spread, where the susceptible population is stratified by their antibody level against the currently circulating strain of the virus, with this decaying as both antibody waning and antigenic drift occur. In the absence of seasonal forcing, we demonstrate the existence of two Hopf bifurcations over the effective antibody decay rate, with associated periodic model solutions. When seasonal forcing is introduced, we identify complex interactions between the strength of forcing and the effective antibody decay rate, yielding myriad dynamics including multi-year periodicity, quasiperiodicity and chaos. The timing and magnitude of seasonal epidemics is highly sensitive to this interaction, with the distribution of infection timing (by time of year) varying substantially across the parameter space. Finally, we show that seasonal forcing can produce resonant amplification (or damping) resulting in a cumulative infection burdens that is greater (or lesser) than would otherwise be observed.</description>

      <title>Kinetic and mean-field modeling of muscular dystrophies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new class of models for assessing the cell dynamics characterising muscular dystrophies. The proposed approach comprises a system of integro-differential equations for the statistical distributions, over a large patient cohort, of the densities of muscle fibers and immune cells implicated in muscle inflammation, degeneration, and regeneration, which underpin disease development. Considering an appropriately scaled version of this model, we formally derive, as the corresponding mean-field limit, a system of Fokker-Planck equations, from which we subsequently derive, as a macroscopic model counterpart, a system of differential equations for the mean densities of muscle and immune cells in the cohort of patients and the related variances. Then, we study long-time asymptotics for the mean-field model by determining the quasi-equilibrium cell distribution functions, which are in the form of probability density functions of inverse Gamma distributions, and proving the long-time convergence to such quasi-equilibrium distributions. The analytical results obtained are illustrated by means of a sample of results of numerical simulations. The modeling approach presented here has the potential to offer new insights into the balance between degeneration and regeneration mechanisms in the progression of muscular dystrophies, and provides a basis for future extensions, including the modeling of therapeutic interventions.</description>

      <title>Eco-evolutionary constraints for the endemicity of rapidly evolving viruses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02097</link>

Abstract: Antigenic escape constitutes the main mechanism allowing rapidly evolving viruses to achieve endemicity. Beyond granting immune escape, empirical evidence also suggests that mutations of viruses might increase their inter-host infectiousness. While both mechanisms are well-studied individually, their combined effects on viral endemicity remain to be explored. Here we propose a minimal eco-evolutionary framework to simulate epidemic outbreaks generated by pathogens evolving both their infectiousness and immune escape. Our results reveal that the main driver of viral evolution shifts over time: from intrinsic selection for infectiousness at early stages of the outbreak to antigenic diversification in the transition to the endemic phase. We find that the evolution in both traits during the first epidemic wave plays a critical role in determining long-term viral persistence. Evolution in infectiousness enhances the endemicity of viruses, especially in viruses with lower baseline infectiousness due to the longer duration of their first epidemic wave. Likewise, control policies flattening epidemic curves might increase viral endemicity as a result of the greater antigenic diversity generated in the prolonged epidemic waves. Our results thus prove that the long-term behavior of epidemic trajectories hinges on the complex interplay between both evolutionary pathways and the underlying contagion dynamics.</description>

      <title>Explicit modeling of density dependence in spatial capture-recapture models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Density dependence occurs at the individual level and thus is greatly influenced by spatial local heterogeneity in habitat conditions. However, density dependence is often evaluated at the population level, leading to difficulties or even controversies in detecting such a process. Bayesian individual-based models such as spatial capture-recapture (SCR) models provide opportunities to study density dependence at the individual level, but such an approach remains to be developed and evaluated. In this study, we developed a SCR model that links habitat use to apparent survival and recruitment through density dependent processes at the individual level. Using simulations, we found that the model can properly inform habitat use, but tends to underestimate the effect of density dependence on apparent survival and recruitment. The reason for such underestimations is likely due to the difficulties of the current model in identifying the locations of unobserved individuals without using environmental covariates to inform these locations. How to accurately estimate the locations of unobserved individuals, and thus density dependence, remains a challenging topic in spatial statistics and statistical ecology.</description>

      <title>Guided rewiring of social networks reduces polarization and accelerates collective action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Global social and ecological challenges represent collective action problems requiring rapid and sufficient cooperation with pro-mitigation norms. Sociopolitical polarization hinders such cooperation. Prior agent-based models showed polarization emerges naturally in structured social networks and polarized cluster dissolution rate limits consensus formation rate. Here we study how guided link rewiring affects depolarization dynamics across synthetic and empirical (Facebook, Twitter) network topologies. We compare heuristic rewiring algorithms representing random meetings, mutual acquaintance introductions, and community bridging, alongside topology-based link recommender algorithms (Who to Follow and node2vec). Our heuristic algorithms all outperform Who to Follow in generating cooperative consensus. Homophilic rewiring generates cooperative consensus when agents can easily change opinions. However, heterophilic rewiring achieves this over broader conditions and can accelerate cooperative consensus formation by ~20%, including where up to 33% of the population experiences backfiring interactions. Heterophilic rewiring also vastly outperforms topology-based recommender algorithms. Random rewiring performed consistently well, achieving higher steady-state cooperation than seven out of eight more complex algorithms. Large disparities in steady-state cooperation for topology-based recommender systems highlight their volatility across network structures. Overall, our work reveals a subtle interplay between topology, rewiring algorithm and social depolarization, suggesting strong potential for carefully redesigning social networking technologies for social good.</description>
