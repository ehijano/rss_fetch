      <title>Denoising Improves Cross-Scanner and Cross-Protocol Test-Retest Reproducibility of Higher-Order Diffusion Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The clinical translation of diffusion MRI (dMRI)-derived quantitative contrasts hinges on robust reproducibility, minimizing both same-scanner and cross-scanner variability. This study evaluates the reproducibility of higher-order diffusion metrics (beyond conventional diffusion tensor imaging), at the voxel and region-of-interest levels on magnitude and complex-valued dMRI data, using denoising with and without harmonization. We compared same-scanner, cross-scanner, and cross-protocol variability for a multi-shell dMRI protocol in 20 subjects. We first evaluated the effectiveness of denoising strategies for both magnitude and complex data to mitigate noise-induced bias and variance, to improve dMRI parametric maps and reproducibility. We examined the impact of denoising under different analysis approaches, comparing voxel-wise and region of interest (ROI)-based methods. We also evaluated the role of denoising when harmonizing dMRI across scanners and protocols. DTI and DKI maps visually improve after MPPCA denoising, with noticeably fewer outliers in kurtosis maps. Denoising enhances voxel-wise reproducibility, with test-retest variability of kurtosis indices reduced from 15-20% to 5-10% after denoising. Complex dMRI denoising reduces the noise floor by up to 60%. In ROI-analyses, denoising also increased statistical power, with reduction in sample size requirements by up to 40% for detecting differences across populations. Combining denoising with linear-RISH harmonization, in voxel-wise assessments, improved intra-scanner intraclass correlation coefficients for FA from moderate to excellent repeatability over harmonization alone. The enhancement in data quality and precision due to denoising facilitates the broader application and acceptance of these advanced imaging techniques in both clinical practice and large-scale neuroimaging studies.</description>

      <title>Direct3{\gamma} PET: A Pipeline for Direct Three-gamma PET Image Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct3{\gamma}PET is a novel, comprehensive pipelinefor direct estimation of emission points in three-gamma (3-{\gamma})positron emission tomography (PET) imaging using \b{eta}+ and {\gamma}emitters. This approach addresses limitations in existing directreconstruction methods for 3-{\gamma} PET, which often struggle withdetector imperfections and uncertainties in estimated intersectionpoints. The pipeline begins by processing raw data, managingprompt photon order in detectors, and propagating energy andspatial uncertainties on the line of response (LOR). It thenconstructs histo-images backprojecting non-symmetric Gaussianprobability density functions (PDFs) in the histo-image, withattenuation correction applied when such data is available. Athree-dimensional (3-D) convolutional neural network (CNN)performs image translation, mapping the histo-image to radioac-tivity image. This architecture is trained using both supervisedand adversarial approaches. Our evaluation demonstrates thesuperior performance of this method in balancing event inclu-sion and accuracy. For image reconstruction, we compare bothsupervised and adversarial neural network (NN) approaches.The adversarial approach shows better structural preservation,while the supervised approach provides slightly improved noisereduction.</description>

      <title>How To Segment in 3D Using 2D Models: Automated 3D Segmentation of Prostate Cancer Metastatic Lesions on PET Volumes Using Multi-Angle Maximum Intensity Projections and Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging provides a tremendously exciting frontier in visualization of prostate cancer (PCa) metastatic lesions. However, accurate segmentation of metastatic lesions is challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratios and variable sizes, shapes, and locations of the lesions. This study proposes a novel approach for automated segmentation of metastatic lesions in PSMA PET/CT 3D volumetric images using 2D denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs). Instead of 2D trans-axial slices or 3D volumes, the proposed approach segments the lesions on generated multi-angle maximum intensity projections (MA-MIPs) of the PSMA PET images, then obtains the final 3D segmentation masks from 3D ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) reconstruction of 2D MA-MIPs segmentations. Our proposed method achieved superior performance compared to state-of-the-art 3D segmentation approaches in terms of accuracy and robustness in detecting and segmenting small metastatic PCa lesions. The proposed method has significant potential as a tool for quantitative analysis of metastatic burden in PCa patients.</description>

      <title>Towards Robust Hemolysis Modeling with Uncertainty Quantification: A Universal Approach to Address Experimental Variance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: The purpose of this study is to address the lack of uncertainty quantification in numerical hemolysis models, which are critical for medical device evaluations. Specifically, we aim to incorporate experimental variability into these models using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to enhance predictive accuracy and robustness.
  Methods: We applied the MCMC method to an experimental hemolysis dataset to derive detailed stochastic distributions for the hemolysis Power Law model parameters $C$, $\alpha$ and $\beta$. These distributions were then propagated through a reduced order model of the FDA benchmark pump to quantify the experimental uncertainty in hemolysis measurements with respect to the predicted pump hemolysis.
  Results: The MCMC analysis revealed multiple local minima in the sum of squared errors, highlighting the non-uniqueness of traditional Power Law model fitting. The MCMC results showed a constant optimal $C=3.515x10-5$ and log normal distributions of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ with means of 0.614 and 1.795, respectively. The MCMC model closely matched the mean and variance of experimental data. In comparison, conventional deterministic models are not able to describe experimental variation.
  Conclusion: Incorporating Uncertainty quantification through MCMC enhances the robustness and predictive accuracy of hemolysis models. This method allows for better comparison of simulated hemolysis outcomes with in-vivo experiments and can integrate additional datasets, potentially setting a new standard in hemolysis modeling.</description>

      <title>Immunity to Increasing Condition Numbers of Linear Superiorization versus Linear Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a family of linear constraints and a linear objective function one can consider whether to apply a Linear Programming (LP) algorithm or use a Linear Superiorization (LinSup) algorithm on this data. In the LP methodology one aims at finding a point that fulfills the constraints and has the minimal value of the objective function over these constraints. The Linear Superiorization approach considers the same data as linear programming problems but instead of attempting to solve those with linear optimization methods it employs perturbation resilient feasibility-seeking algorithms and steers them toward feasible points with reduced (not necessarily minimal) objective function values. Previous studies compared LP and LinSup in terms of their respective outputs and the resources they use. In this paper we investigate these two approaches in terms of their sensitivity to condition numbers of the system of linear constraints. Condition numbers are a measure for the impact of deviations in the input data on the output of a problem and, in particular, they describe the factor of error propagation when given wrong or erroneous data. Therefore, the ability of LP and LinSup to cope with increased condition numbers, thus with ill-posed problems, is an important matter to consider which was not studied until now. We investigate experimentally the advantages and disadvantages of both LP and LinSup on examplary problems of linear programming with multiple condition numbers and different problem dimensions.</description>

      <title>Nanodosimetric investigation of the track structure of therapeutic carbon ion radiation. Part 1: Measurement of ionization cluster size distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At the Heidelberg Ion-Beam Therapy Center, the track structure of carbon ions of therapeutic energy after penetrating layers of simulated tissue was investigated for the first time. Measurements were conducted with primary carbon ion beams of different energies and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) absorbers of different thicknesses to realize different depths in the phantom along the pristine Bragg peak. Ionization cluster size (ICS) distributions resulting from the mixed radiation field behind the PMMA absorbers were measured using an ion-counting nanodosimeter. Two different measurements were carried out: (i) variation of the PMMA absorber thickness with constant primary carbon ion energy and (ii) combined variation of PMMA absorber thickness and primary carbon ion energy such that the primary carbon ion's energy in the target volume is constant. The data analysis revealed unexpectedly high mean ICS values compared to stopping power calculations and the data measured at lower energies in earlier work. This suggests that in the measurements the primary carbon ion energies behind the PMMA absorber may have deviated considerably from the expected values obtained by the calculations. In addition, the results indicate the presence of a marked contribution of nuclear fragments to the measured ICS distributions, especially if the carbon ion does not cross the target volume.</description>

      <title>Total-Body Parametric Imaging Using Relative Patlak Plot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Standard Patlak plot is widely used to describe FDG kinetics for dynamic PET imaging. Whole-body Patlak parametric imaging remains constrained due to the need for a full-time input function. Here, we demonstrate the Relative Patlak (RP) plot, which eliminates the need for the early-time input function, for total-body parametric imaging and its application to clinical 20-min scan acquired in list-mode. We demonstrated that the RP intercept b' is equivalent to a ratio of standardized uptake value relative to the blood, while the RP slope Ki' is equal to the standard Patlak Ki multiplied by a global scaling factor for each subject. One challenge in applying RP to a short scan duration (20 min) is the high noise in parametric images. We applied a deep kernel method for noise reduction. Using the standard Patlak plot as the reference, the RP method was evaluated for lesion quantification, lesion-to-background contrast, and myocardial visualization in total-body parametric imaging with uEXPLORER in 22 human subjects who underwent a 1-h dynamic 18F-FDG scan. The RP method was also applied to the dynamic data regenerated from a clinical standard 20-min scan either at 1-h or 2-h post-injection for two cancer patients. We demonstrated that it is feasible to obtain high-quality parametric images from 20-min dynamic scans using the RP plot with a self-supervised deep-kernel noise reduction strategy. The RP Ki' highly correlated with Ki in lesions and major organs, demonstrating its quantitative potential across subjects. Compared to conventional SUVs, the Ki' images significantly improved lesion contrast and enabled visualization of the myocardium for potential cardiac assessment. The application of RP parametric imaging to two clinical scans also showed similar benefits. Total-body PET with the RP plot is feasible to generate parametric images from the dynamic data of a 20-min clinical scan.</description>
