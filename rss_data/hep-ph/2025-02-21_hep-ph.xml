      <title>Nuclear effects in proton decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proton decay detection could put in evidence physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM). In this context, multiple projects are searching for such events. We focused our work on two of the expected decay modes, $p \rightarrow \pi^+ + \bar{\nu}$ and $p \rightarrow K^+ + \bar{\nu}$. Neutrinos are particles that interact very weakly with matter, so they are not of interest in our work. The detector materials investigated in this study include liquid argon (LAr), liquid xenon (LXe), and water (H$_2$O). Our analysis focuses on two key effects relevant to this decay process: the Fermi motion of nucleons and final state interactions. In addition to these effects, we have also examined the nuclear interaction of particles with the nuclei of the medium. This paper presents values for nucleon energy distribution, cross sections, mean free paths and interaction probabilities.</description>

      <title>Testing New Physics in Oscillations at a Neutrino Factory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A neutrino factory is a potential successor to the upcoming generation of neutrino oscillation experiments and a possible precursor to next-generation muon colliders. Such a machine would provide a well characterized beam of $\nu_\mu$, $\bar\nu_\mu$, $\nu_e$, and $\bar\nu_e$ neutrinos with comparable statistics. Here we show the sensitivity of a neutrino factory to new oscillation physics scenarios such as vector neutrino non-standard interactions and CPT violation. We study two different potential setups for a neutrino factory with different assumptions on charge identification in the far detector. We find that a neutrino factory can improve over most of the current constraints on these scenarios and over forecasted constraints by DUNE, even when doubling DUNE's statistics. Additionally, we find that a neutrino factory can break degeneracies between the standard oscillation parameters and neutrino non-standard interaction parameters present at DUNE.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Dimension of a General Effective Gauge Theory I: Bosonic Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify the physical operators of the most general bosonic effective gauge theory up to dimension six using on-shell methods. Based on this classification, we compute the complete one-loop anomalous dimension employing both on-shell unitarity-based and geometric techniques. Our analysis fully accounts for the mixing of operators with different dimensions. The results broadly apply to any Effective Field Theory with arbitrary gauge symmetry and bosonic degrees of freedom. To illustrate their utility, we perform a complete cross-check of results on the renormalization of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), $O(n)$ scalar theory, and the SMEFT extended with an axion-like particle. Additionally, we present new results for axion-like particles with CP-violating interactions.</description>

      <title>Isolating Unisolated Upsilons with Anomaly Detection in CMS Open Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first study of anti-isolated Upsilon decays to two muons ($\Upsilon \to \mu^+ \mu^-$) in proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. Using a machine learning (ML)-based anomaly detection strategy, we "rediscover" the $\Upsilon$ in 13 TeV CMS Open Data from 2016, despite overwhelming anti-isolated backgrounds. We elevate the signal significance to $6.4 \sigma$ using these methods, starting from $1.6 \sigma$ using the dimuon mass spectrum alone. Moreover, we demonstrate improved sensitivity from using an ML-based estimate of the multi-feature likelihood compared to traditional "cut-and-count" methods. Our work demonstrates that it is possible and practical to find real signals in experimental collider data using ML-based anomaly detection, and we distill a readily-accessible benchmark dataset from the CMS Open Data to facilitate future anomaly detection developments.</description>

      <title>Maximizing the Azimuthal-Angle Correlation in the Decay of Vector Boson Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin correlation observables of particles produced at colliders generally depend on the coordinate basis. While spin correlations and their associated basis dependence have been studied in top-quark pair production, the basis dependence of spin correlations of a $W^\pm$ pair has not been studied. In this work, we focus on the azimuthal-angle correlation in the decay of a $W^\pm$ pair, which encodes spin information in the direction transverse to the rotational axis. We quantitatively describe the basis dependence of the relative azimuthal angle. We further present the optimal coordinate direction to define the azimuthal angle between the decay products of $W^\pm$ bosons to achieve the maximal spin correlation based on symmetry considerations. The results can be used to optimize the measurement of the CP-even and CP-odd interactions, and have applications to quantum information observables in the vector boson pair system.</description>

      <title>Spin Squeezing of Macroscopic Nuclear Spin Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin squeezing has been explored in atomic systems as a tool for quantum sensing, improving experimental sensitivity beyond the spin standard quantum limit for certain measurements. To optimize absolute metrological sensitivity, it is beneficial to consider macroscopic spin ensembles, such as nuclear spins in solids and liquids. Coupling a macroscopic spin ensemble to a parametrically-modulated resonant circuit can create collective spin squeezing by generating spin correlations mediated by the circuit. We analyze the squeezing dynamics in the presence of decoherence and finite spin polarization, showing that achieving 7 dB spin squeezing is feasible in several nuclear spin systems. The metrological benefit of squeezing a macroscopic spin ensemble lies in the suppression of technical noise sources in the spin detection system relative to the spin projection noise. This expands the experimental sensitivity bandwidth when searching for signals of unknown frequency and can improve the resonant signal-to-noise ratio. Squeezing macroscopic spin ensembles may prove to be a useful technique for fundamental physics experiments aimed at detecting spin interactions with oscillating background fields, such as ultralight dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collisions of particles at the energy frontier can reveal new particles and forces via localized excesses. However, the initial observation may be consistent with a large variety of theoretical models, especially in sectors with new top quark partners, which feature a rich set of possible underlying interactions. We explore the power of the LHC dataset to distinguish between models of the singly produced heavy top-like quark which interacts with the Standard Model through an electromagnetic form factor. We study the heavy top decay to a top quark and a virtual photon which produces a pair of fermions, propose a technique to disentangle the models, and calculate the expected statistical significance to distinguish between various hypotheses.</description>

      <title>Coordinate Light-Cone-Ordered Perturbation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the development of light-cone-ordered perturbation theory in coordinate space (C-LCOPT). Compared to light-cone-ordered perturbation theory in momentum space (LCOPT), the role of intermediate states in LCOPT is played in C-LCOPT by paths, which are ordered sequences of lines and vertices that connect pairs of external points. Each path denominator of C-LCOPT equals the difference between the separation of the minus coordinates of the beginning and ending points of the path and the sum of the light-cone minus momenta of all lines along the path computed from their plus and transverse coordinates. We observe that this formalism, originally applied to amplitudes, can be extended to cross sections, which are given in terms of closed paths reminiscent of Schwinger-Keldysh formalisms.</description>

      <title>Baryon-number-violating nucleon decays in sterile neutrino effective field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for baryon-number-violating (BNV) nucleon decay provides an intriguing probe of new physics beyond the Standard Model (SM). Future neutrino experiments will improve the sensitivity to BNV nucleon decays and can serve to search for dark particles. In this work, we study the sterile neutrino effective field theories (EFTs) with baryon number violation and the impact of light sterile neutrino on BNV nucleon decays. We revisit the dimension-6 and dimension-7 EFT operator bases with $|\Delta (B-L)|=2$ or $|\Delta (B-L)|=0$. They are then matched to the baryon chiral perturbation theory. We obtain the effective chiral Lagrangian at low energies and the BNV interactions between the sterile neutrino and baryons and mesons. The rates of nucleon decay to SM neutrinos or a sterile neutrino are calculated. We then show the constraints on the ultraviolet scale from nucleon decay search at Super-K. The correlation of two EFT operators and the dependence on the sterile neutrino mass are also investigated.</description>

      <title>Analysis of $q_\mathrm{rec}^2$-distribution for $B\to K M_X$ and $B\to K^* M_X$ decays in a scalar-mediator dark-matter scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the scalar-mediator dark-matter scenario is consistent with the experimental data on the decay $B\to K M_X$ and provides a good description of the shape of the observed excess. Within this scenario, the interaction with dark-matter particles leads to approximately the same excess in $\Gamma(B\to K^* M_X)$ and $\Gamma(B\to K M_X)$ compared to the Standard Model; also the differential distributions of the excess events are similar in shape in the variable $q_\mathrm{rec}^2$ measured by experiment.</description>

      <title>To investigate event-by-event fluctuations of mean transverse momentum in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV with PYTHIA8 and HERWIG7 models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimations of event-by-event mean transverse momentum ($\langle p_{\rm T} \rangle$) fluctuations are reported in terms of the integral correlator, $\langle \Delta p_{\rm T} \Delta p_{\rm T}\rangle$, and the skewness of event-wise $\langle p_{\rm T} \rangle$ distribution in proton$-$proton (pp) collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV with the Monte Carlo event generators PYTHIA8 and HERWIG7. The final-state charged particles with transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) and pseudorapidity ($\eta$) ranges $0.15 \leq p_{\rm T}\leq 2.0$ GeV/$c$ and $|\eta| \leq 0.8$ were considered for the investigation. The correlator, $\langle \Delta p_{\rm T} \Delta p_{\rm T}\rangle$, is observed to follow distinct decreasing trends with average charged particle multiplicity ($\langle N_{\rm ch} \rangle$) for the models. Furthermore, both models yield positive finite skewness in low-multiplicity events. The fluctuations are additionally studied using the transverse spherocity estimator ($S_{\rm 0}$) to comprehend the relative contributions from hard scattering (jets) and other soft processes to the observed fluctuations. Comparing the model predictions would enhance our understanding of fluctuation dynamics in pp collisions, establishing a crucial baseline for studying non-trivial fluctuations in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Four-quark scatterings in QCD III</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the full infrared dynamics of 2+1 flavour QCD with the functional renormalisation group approach. We resolve self-consistently the glue dynamics as well as the dynamics of chiral symmetry breaking. The computation hosts no phenomenological parameter or external input. The only ultraviolet input parameters are the physical ones in QCD: the light and strange quark masses. They are adjusted to the physical ratios of the pion and kaon masses, divided by the pion decay constant. The results for other observables of current first-principles computations are in quantitative agreement with the physical ones. This work completes the series of papers, initiated and furthered in [1,2], on dynamical chiral symmetry breaking and the emergence of mesonic bound states within the functional renormalisation group. As a first application we discuss the formation of light mesonic bound states. Amongst other applications such as the phase structure of QCD, the current work paves the way for studying QCD parton distribution functions within the functional renormalisation group approach to first-principles QCD.</description>

      <title>Net-Strangeness Fluctuations and Their Experimental Implications in the SU(3) PNJL Model Using the Subensemble Acceptance Method for the search of QCD Critical Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The critical end point (CEP) is a key feature of the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) phase diagram, where critical phenomena cause higher-order moments of conserved charges net-baryon ($\Delta B$), net-charge ($\Delta Q$), and net-strangeness ($\Delta S$) to exhibit non-monotonic behavior. These moments and their volume-independent products are sensitive to the correlation length, making them crucial observables in the search for the CEP. In this study, we investigate net-strangeness fluctuations using the finite-volume Polyakov-loop extended Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (PNJL) model, incorporating six-quark and eight-quark interactions at energy scales relevant to the RHIC beam energy scan. Our results are compared to STAR net-kaon data and the Hadron Resonance Gas (HRG) model to assess the CEP's existence. Since direct measurement of conserved charges is experimentally challenging, net-proton, net-pion, and net-kaon are used as proxies for $\Delta B$, $\Delta Q$, and $\Delta S$. We employ the Subensemble Acceptance Method (SAM) to analyze the acceptance dependence of $\kappa\sigma^{2}$ for net-strangeness fluctuations. Our findings establish a direct mapping between the subvolume (particle fraction) and the total volume (conserved quantities), providing insights into the role of experimental acceptance in fluctuation measurements.</description>

      <title>Two-loop corrections to QCD $\theta$ angle from evanescent operator in the BMHV scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the radiatively-induced QCD $\theta$ angle at two-loop level using dimensional regularization with the BMHV scheme in order to investigate $CP$-violating contributions of evanescent operators. When one considers the Lagrangian in $d$-dimensional space-time instead of four dimensions in dimensional regularization, evanescent operators that break the chiral symmetry are induced. Consequently, $T$-odd and $P$-odd fermion loops in the BMHV scheme generates evanescent contributions to the QCD $\theta$ angle. We carefully classify the evanescent contributions into two types: one originating from the evanescent operators at one-loop level and the other directly produced by two-loop calculations. We show that re-parameterizing the fundamental parameters can remove these unphysical contributions from the renormalization-group equation for the QCD $\theta$ angle. We also discuss the rephasing invariance of the radiative correction to the QCD $\theta$ angle in the BMHV scheme.</description>

      <title>Beyond Freeze-Out: A Novel Freeze-in Mechanism for Dark Matter via Supercooled Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a novel freeze-in mechanism for Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), facilitated by a supercooled first-order phase transition (FOPT) in the early universe. Unlike the conventional freeze-out and freeze-in scenarios, this mechanism allows WIMPs to acquire their relic abundance through a non-equilibrium production process following a rapid entropy injection. We explore multiple dark matter (DM) candidates, including vector, fermionic, and scalar-mediated models, and identify fermionic DM with a pseudoscalar mediator as the most viable candidate for this mechanism. The study demonstrates that FOPT dilutes preexisting DM density and simultaneously induces a rapid mass increase, preventing thermal re-equilibration and enabling DM production via freeze-in. Additionally, we analyze the gravitational wave (GW) signals associated with FOPT, identifying parameter regions detectable by future GW observatories such as LISA and UDECIGO.

      <title>Accommodating scalar resonances in the HEFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Loss of unitarity in an effective field theory is often cured by the appearance of dynamical resonances, revealing the presence of new degrees of freedom. These resonances may manifest themselves when suitable unitarization techniques are implemented in the effective theory, which in the scalar-isoscalar channel require using the coupled-channel formalism. Experimental detection of a resonance would provide precious information on the couplings and constants of the relevant effective theory. Conversely, the absence of a resonance where the unitarized effective theory predicts it should be allows us to rule out a certaing range of couplings that would otherwise be allowed. Likewise, the appearence of unphysical (e.g. acausal) resonances is telling us that no UV completion could give rise to the corresponding couplings in the effective theory. In this talk we summarize the systematical procedure we have implemented in order to confront the effective theory with the absence or presence of resonances in the vector boson fusion channel at the LHC.</description>

      <title>A Method to Simultaneously Facilitate All Jet Physics Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning has become an essential tool in jet physics. Due to their complex, high-dimensional nature, jets can be explored holistically by neural networks in ways that are not possible manually. However, innovations in all areas of jet physics are proceeding in parallel. We show that specially constructed machine learning models trained for a specific jet classification task can improve the accuracy, precision, or speed of all other jet physics tasks. This is demonstrated by training on a particular multiclass generation and classification task and then using the learned representation for different generation and classification tasks, for datasets with a different (full) detector simulation, for jets from a different collision system (pp versus ep), for generative models, for likelihood ratio estimation, and for anomaly detection. We consider, our OmniLearn approach thus as a jet-physics foundation model. It is made publicly available for use in any area where state-of-the-art precision is required for analyses involving jets and their substructure.</description>

      <title>Status of $\mathbb{Z}_3$-NMSSM featuring a light bino-dominated LSP and a light singlet-like scalar under the LZ Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the presence of a light singlet-like scalar state, the Bino-dominated dark matter (DM) candidate in the $\mathbb{Z}_3$-NMSSM exhibits significant differences from its counterpart in the MSSM, both in terms of intrinsic properties and mechanisms governing DM relic density and detection. Motivated by recent advancements in particle physics experiments, we systematically analyzed the implications of these developments for the $\mathbb{Z}_3$-NMSSM framework featuring a light bino-dominated DM candidate and a light singlet-like scalar, ensuring theoretical consistency with empirical observations. Of paramount relevance are the latest direct detection constraints from the LZ experiment, SUSY searches at the LHC, and precision measurements of the Muon g-2 anomaly at Fermilab, which collectively impose complementary constraints on the model's parameter space. Our investigation utilized the MultiNest algorithm to perform a rigorous parameter space scan, informed by the LZ(2022) experimental limits, while incorporating constraints from LHC Higgs analyses, Muon g-2 data, and B-physics observables. The results demonstrate that current experimental bounds, particularly stringent limits on SI and SD DM-nucleus scattering cross-sections, coupled with LHC exclusion limits on electroweakinos, strongly disfavor this scenario. Nonetheless, the model retains the capacity to naturally reproduce the Z boson mass and Standard Model-like Higgs boson mass, explain the Muon Anomalous Magnetic Moment, and generate substantial corrections to the W boson mass. These findings exclusively manifest within the NMSSM framework, arising from the interplay between bino-dominated DM and singlino components, mediated through indispensable higgsino participation.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Quantum Kinetic Theory: Higher order contributions in assisted Schwinger pair production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum kinetic theory is an important tool for studying non-equilibrium, non-perturbative and non-linear interactions within an open quantum system, and as such is able to provide an unprecedented view on particle production in the relativistic, ultra-high intensity regime of quantum electrodynamics. By re-organising the relativistic quantum transport equations for Abelian plasmas and integrating them with a perturbative expansion, we significantly expand the scope for kinetic theories to further elucidate the peculiarities of particle production at a spectral level.
  Keywords: Assisted Schwinger effect, Strong-field quantum electrodynamics, relativistic quantum transport, quantum kinetic theory, non-equilibrium quantum many-body physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the method of the differential equations for the evaluation of multi-loop Feynman integrals. In particular, we focus on the series expansion approach for solving the system of differential equation and we discuss how to perform the analytical continuation of the result to entire (complex) phase-space. This approach allow us to consider arbitrary internal complex masses. This review is based on a lecture given by the author at the "Advanced School and Workshop on Multiloop Scattering Amplitudes" held in NISER, Bhubaneswar (India) in January 2024.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preserving the unique role of the one Higgs doublet of the standard model, it is proposed that quark and lepton mass patterns, often ascribed to the Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism using nonrenormalizable higher-dimensional terms, may be enforced in a renormalizable theory of just one Higgs doublet by the scotogenic mechanism with soft symmetry breaking in the dark sector. A revised version of the original $A_4$ model of charged leptons and neutrinos is discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation is a rapidly evolving tool with great potential for research at the frontiers of physics, and is particularly suited to be used in computationally intensive lattice simulations, such as problems with non-equilibrium. In this work, a basic scenario, namely free fermions in an expanding universe, is considered and quantum simulations are used to perform the evolution and study the phenomena involved. Using digital quantum simulations with the Jordan-Wigner transformation and Trotter expansion, the evolutions of fermion number density, correlation functions, polarization, and chiral condensation are analyzed. A spread out phenomenon can be observed in the simulation, which is a consequence of momentum redshift. This work also demonstrates the simplicity and convenience of using quantum simulations when studying time-evolution problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the effective field theory approach to systematically study the dynamics of classical and quantum systems in an oscillating magnetic field. We find that the fast field oscillations give rise to an effective interaction which is able to confine charged particles as well as neutral particles with a spin magnetic moment. The effect is reminiscent of the renown dynamical stabilization of charges by the oscillating electric field and provides a foundation for a new class of magnetic traps. The properties characteristic to the dynamical magnetic confinement are reviewed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unveiling hidden symmetries within Feynman diagrams is crucial for achieving more efficient computations in high-energy physics. In this paper, we study the symmetries underlying the causal Loop-Tree Duality (LTD) representations through a geometric analysis. Focusing on the integrand-level representations of $N$-point functions at one loop, we examine their degenerations and discover that different causal representations are interconnected through specific transformations arising from the symmetries of cut diagrams. Furthermore, the degeneration is linked to algebraic constraints among the different causal thresholds. Our findings shed new light on the deeper structures of Feynman integrals and pave the way for significantly accelerating their calculation by interrelating different approaches.</description>

      <title>Thermal and baryon density modifications to the $\sigma$-boson propagator: A road to describe the transfer of vorticity to spin in a nuclear environment in relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of the description of how the vortical motion, produced in peripheral heavy-ion collisions, is transferred to the spin of hadrons, we compute the $\sigma$-meson propagator at finite temperature and baryon density. This propagator encodes the properties of a medium consisting mainly of nucleons{, and can be used to model the main interactions between hadrons} in the corona region of the reaction. We compute the one-loop $\sigma$ self-energy in an approximation that accounts for the large nucleon mass. From the real part of the self-energy, we find the dispersion relation and show that the $\sigma$-mass receives a non-negligible thermal and baryon chemical dependent {contribution}. From the imaginary part, we also compute the spectral density, which we show to contain a piece coming from the branch cut associated with Landau damping. We also present approximations for the dispersion relation and the residue at the pole in the small- and large-momentum regimes and complement the calculation, providing the sum rules satisfied by the propagator. This study aims to determine one of the elements needed to compute how the vortical motion in the corona region of the reaction is transferred to the spin of $\Lambda$ hyperons that can interact with nucleons by $\sigma$-meson exchange.</description>

      <title>Super light-by-light scattering in vacuum induced by intense vortex lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collision of ultra-intense optical laser and X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) pulses is a promising approach to detecting nonlinear vacuum polarization (VP), a long-standing prediction of quantum electrodynamics remaining to be tested. Identifying the signals induced by polarized vacuum relies on purifying the X-ray polarization and poses significant challenges due to strongly reduced signal and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Here we propose an approach that allows one to directly detect VP signals without the need for an X-ray polarizer. We identify a new VP effect in collision of an X-ray probe with an intense laser in a vortex mode, which we call the super light-by-light scattering (super-LBL), through which signal photons are kicked out of the X-ray background with large tangential momentum. Super-LBL originates from the gradient force of the vortical vacuum current in azimuthal direction and induces momentum exchange beyond the transverse momentum of laser-photon. This effect efficiently sets the scattered signal photons apart from the X-ray background, producing observable signals with both the strength and SNR more than two orders of magnitude higher than those from the known VP effects. This finding paves the way for single-shot detection of nonlinear VP phenomena with current ultra-intense laser and XFEL technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use lattice QCD calculations of the finite-volume spectra of systems of two and three mesons to determine, for the first time, three-particle scattering amplitudes with physical quark masses. Our results are for combinations of $\pi^+$ and $K^+$, at a lattice spacing $a=0.063\;$fm, and in the isospin-symmetric limit. We also obtain accurate results for maximal-isospin two-meson amplitudes, with those for $\pi^+ K^+$ and $2K^+$ being the first determinations at the physical point. Dense lattice spectra are obtained using the stochastic Laplacian-Heaviside method, and the analysis leading to scattering amplitudes is done using the relativistic finite-volume formalism. Results are compared to chiral perturbation theory and to phenomenological fits to experimental data, finding good agreement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A. Parkhomov reported in the past the detection of strong, short, sporadic, nearly everyday decay rate increases in $\beta$-isotopes placed at the focus of a concave mirror directed at a clear sky. He interpreted this effect as neutrino-induced decay. These neutrinos were assumed to be slow and arrive from space in the form of gravitationally collimated beams. We precisely replicated this experiment for the purpose of independent verification. We recorded about 50 days of data employing Geiger-counter-based signal and control detectors, $^{40}$K and $^{90}$Sr/$^{90}$Y isotopes as $\beta$-sources. We did not detect any significant difference between the data from signal and control detectors, both datasets obeyed the standard Poissonian process. Thus, we robustly excluded the hypothesized new effect. We suspect that A. Parkhomov was just misled by a trivial electromagnetic instability of his setup.</description>

      <title>PREFACE: A search for long-lived particles at the Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Standard Model (SM) fails to explain many problems (neutrino masses, dark matter, and matter-antimatter asymmetry, among others) that may be resolved with new particles beyond the Standard model (BSM). The fact that such new particles are not yet observed may be explained either by their too high mass or by very small coupling to SM particles. The latter case implies long lifetimes. Such long-lived particles (LLPs) would have signatures different from those of SM particles. Searches in the ``central region" are covered by the LHC general purpose experiments. The forward small angle region far from the interaction point (IP) is unexplored. Such particles would have large energy $E$ = $\mathcal{O}$(1~TeV) and Lorentz time dilation factor $\gamma = E/m \approx 10^2 - 10^{3}$, hence long decay distances. A new class of specialized LHC detectors dedicated to LLP searches has been proposed for the forward regions. Among these experiments, FASER is already operational, and FACET is under consideration at a location 100 meters from IP5 (the CMS intersection). However, some features of FACET require a specially enlarged beam pipe, which cannot be implemented for Run 4. In this study, we explore a simplified version of the proposed detector, PREFACE, compatible with the standard LHC beam pipe in the HL-LHC in Run 4. Realistic \textsc{Geant4} simulations are performed and the background is evaluated. A preliminary analysis of the physics potential with the PREFACE geometry indicates that several significant channels could be accessible with sensitivities comparable to FACET and other LLP searches.</description>

      <title>Dynamical dark energy with AdS-to-dS and dS-to-dS transitions: Implications for the $H_0$ tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics and cosmological implications of dark energy (DE), modeled as a scalar field with a hyperbolic tangent potential that induces a smooth shift in the effective cosmological constant (CC), encompassing transitions such as AdS-dS, 0-dS, and dS-dS, with the mirror AdS-dS as a particular case aligned with the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM scenario. In our construction, a phantom scalar field with a negative kinetic term drives a bottom-up transition from an AdS-like vacuum at high redshifts to a dS-like vacuum at low redshifts, thereby providing a physical underpinning for the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM scenario. Despite the negative kinetic term, the step-like form of the potential prevents pathologies such as unbounded energy growth, Big Rip, and violations of the WEC. Our numerical integration of the equations of motion shows that the model is consistent with both CMB data and the SH0ES determination of $H_0$, thereby addressing the $H_0$ tension, with all key kinematical parameters-$H(z)$, $\dot{H}(z)$, and $q(z)$-evolving smoothly. The total energy density of the phantom and matter system remains positive at all times, and the effective EoS stays above -1, ensuring that the WEC is satisfied. While the phantom field's energy density and pressure remain finite throughout, its EoS exhibits a safe singularity as its energy density smoothly crosses zero. We perform analysis of the transition period, demonstrating that the evolution of the DE density from a negative CC-like regime to a positive one does not exactly mirror the behavior of the potential-e.g., it lasts longer-as it also involves the kinetic term. We also show that analogous quintessence models featuring dS-dS transitions predict an $H_0$ value lower than $\Lambda$CDM, thereby failing to address the $H_0$ tension. Our results establish a robust theoretical foundation for the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM scenario.</description>

      <title>Long-Term Multidimensional Models of Core-Collapse Supernovae: Progress and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-consistent, multidimensional core-collapse supernova (SN) simulations, especially in 3D, have achieved tremendous progress over the past 10 years. They are now able to follow the entire evolution from core collapse through bounce, neutrino-triggered shock revival, shock breakout at the stellar surface to the electromagnetic SN outburst and the subsequent SN remnant phase. Thus they provide general support for the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism by reproducing observed SN energies, neutron-star (NS) kicks, and diagnostically relevant radioactive isotope yields; they allow to predict neutrino and gravitational-wave signals for many seconds of proto-NS cooling; they confirm correlations between explosion and progenitor or remnant properties already expected from previous spherically symmetric (1D) and 2D models; and they carve out various scenarios for stellar-mass black-hole (BH) formation. Despite these successes it is currently unclear which stars explode or form BHs, because different modeling approaches disagree and suggest the possible importance of the 3D nature of the progenitors and of magnetic fields. The role of neutrino flavor conversion in SN cores still needs to be better understood, the nuclear equation of state including potential phase transitions implies major uncertainties, the SN 1987A neutrino measurements raise new puzzles, and tracing a possible correlation of NS spins and kicks requires still more refined SN simulations.</description>

      <title>Universal Anomaly Detection at the LHC: Transforming Optimal Classifiers and the DDD Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18469v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present a novel approach to transform supervised classifiers into effective unsupervised anomaly detectors. The method we have developed, termed Discriminatory Detection of Distortions (DDD), enhances anomaly detection by training a discriminator model on both original and artificially modified datasets. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of our models on the Dark Machines Anomaly Score Challenge channels and a search for 4-top quark events, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach across various final states and beyond the Standard Model scenarios.
  We compare the performance of the DDD method with the Deep Robust One-Class Classification method (DROCC), which incorporates signals in the training process, and the Deep Support Vector Data Description (DeepSVDD) method, a well-established and well-performing method for anomaly detection. Results show that the effectiveness of each model varies by signal and channel, with DDD proving to be a very effective anomaly detector. We recommend the combined use of DeepSVDD and DDD for purely unsupervised applications, with the addition of flow models for improved performance when resources allow.
  Findings suggest that network architectures that excel in supervised contexts, such as the particle transformer with standard model interactions, also perform well as unsupervised anomaly detectors. We also show that with these methods, it is likely possible to recognize 4-top quark production as an anomaly without prior knowledge of the process. We argue that the Large Hadron Collider community can transform supervised classifiers into anomaly detectors to uncover potential new physical phenomena in each search.</description>

      <title>Flavor-Specific Dark Matter Signatures through the Lens of Neutrino Oscillations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the flavor-specific properties of leptophilic dark matter in neutrino mass models, where dark matter signals are directly correlated with the neutrino oscillation data, providing complementary insights into the neutrino mass hierarchy and CP phases. Notably, this can be accomplished without introducing a flavor-specific portal to dark matter, imposing any new flavor symmetry, or involving flavon fields. As a case study, we analyze the correlation between the flavor-philic nature of dark matter and neutrino oscillation data in the type-II seesaw and Zee-Babu models, and extend this discussion to other neutrino mass models. We analyze the indirect signatures of such leptophilic dark matter, specifically examining the spectrum of the cosmic ray electron/positron flux resulting from the pair annihilation of dark matter in the Galactic halo, and explore correlated lepton-specific signals at collider experiments sensitive to neutrino oscillation data.</description>

Abstract: We report an exploratory study of the $\mathcal{O}(\alpha)$ structure-dependent electromagnetic radiative corrections to unique first-forbidden nuclear beta decays. We show that the insertion of angular momentum into the nuclear matrix element by the virtual/real photon exchange opens up the decay at vanishing nuclear recoil momentum which was forbidden at tree level, leading to a dramatic change in the decay spectrum not anticipated in existing studies. We discuss its implications for precision tests on the Standard Model and searches for new physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The memory burden effect is an explicit resolution to the information paradox by which an evaporating black hole acquires quantum hair, which then suppresses its rate of mass loss with respect to the semi-classical Hawking rate. We show that this has significant implications for particle dark matter that captures in neutron stars and forms black holes that go on to consume the host star. In particular, we show that constraints on the nucleon scattering cross section and mass of spin-0 and spin-1/2 dark matter would be extended by several orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Towards a precision determination of the $X(6200)$ parameters from data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent paper, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 126}, 132001 (2021), the LHCb data on the di-$J/\psi$ production in proton-proton collisions were analysed in a coupled-channel framework based on double-vector-charmonium channels. This investigation identified a robust pole near the $J/\psi J/\psi$ threshold, tagged $X(6200)$, suggesting it as a new state. The present work extends that investigation by incorporating recent di-$J/\psi$ production data from the CMS and ATLAS Collaborations and performing a combined analysis of all three datasets. This study confirms the existence of the $X(6200)$, and its pole position is now determined with a higher precision than in the previous study, where only a single dataset was employed. The pole corresponding to the $X(6900)$ is also extracted, though its actual position and residue depend on a particular coupled-channel model employed and deviate from values reported in the experimental investigations. Moreover, we demonstrate that the currently available data do not allow one to determine whether there is an additional pole in the studied mass range. The di-electron width of the $X(6200)$ is estimated under different conjectures on its quantum numbers, and the number of such states that can be annually produced at the future Super $\tau$-Charm Facility is estimated. The line shape in the complimentary $J/\psi\psi(2S)$ channel is discussed, and a good agreement with the ATLAS data is found.</description>

      <title>Dispersion relation for hadronic light-by-light scattering: subleading contributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present an evaluation of subleading effects in the hadronic light-by-light contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. Using a recently derived optimized basis, we first study the matching of axial-vector contributions to short-distance constraints at the level of the scalar basis functions, finding that also the tails of the pseudoscalar poles and tensor mesons play a role. We then develop a matching strategy that allows for a combined evaluation of axial-vector and short-distance constraints, supplemented by an estimate of tensor-meson contributions based on simplified assumptions for their transition form factors. Uncertainties are primarily propagated from the axial-vector transition form factors and the variation of the matching scale, but we also consider estimates of the low-energy effect of hadronic states not explicitly included. In total, we obtain $a_\mu^\text{HLbL}\big|_\text{subleading}=33.2(7.2)\times 10^{-11}$, which in combination with previously evaluated contributions in the dispersive approach leads to $a_\mu^\text{HLbL}\big|_\text{total}=101.9(7.9)\times 10^{-11}$.</description>

Abstract: It has long been understood that the inclusion of temperature in the perturbative treatment of quantum field theories leads to complications that are not present at zero temperature. In these proceedings we report on the non-perturbative obstructions that arise, and how these lead to deviations in the predictions of lattice scalar correlation functions in massive $\phi^{4}$ theory. Using the known non-perturbative spectral constraints satisfied by finite-temperature correlation functions we outline why the presence of distinct particle-like excitations could provide a resolution to these issues.</description>

      <title>Influence of a nontrivial Polyakov loop on the quarkonium states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using a hybrid approach based on a phenomenological heavy-quark potential model and the background field effective theory, we assess the influence of a nontrivial Polyakov loop on the in-medium properties of the heavy quarkonium states. Without resorting to any temperature-dependent parameter, the lattice simulations on the complex heavy-quark potential are well reproduced with the potential model in which the screening masses are determined by the background field effective theory. Due to the reduced screening strength near the deconfining temperature, a nontrivial Polyakov loop leads to a dramatic increase in the binding energies, together with a moderate decrease in the decay widths. In general, a more tightly bounded quarkonium state can be expected, although the increase in the dissociation temperatures is significant only for relatively large-size bounded states. Our results indicate that the background field modification on the binding and decay of the quarkonium states may have a notable impact on the density evolution of quarkonia during the expansion of the fireball, and thus on the final observed quarkonium spectra.</description>

      <title>Possible scenario of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in the instanton liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on simulations of the interacting instanton liquid model (IILM) with three-flavor quarks, we compute the free energy density of the QCD vacuum as a function of the quark condensate. We then evaluate the second derivative of the free energy density with respect to the quark condensate at the origin. This evaluation allows us to investigate whether chiral symmetry breaking in the IILM occurs in an anomaly-driven way. Such a breaking pattern of chiral symmetry has been proposed in a previous study to connect the QCD vacuum structure with meson properties, such as the mass of the sigma meson. We also perform the quenched simulations, in which no dynamical quarks interact with instantons. Comparing these results with the full calculations provides a better understanding of the pattern of chiral symmetry breaking in the IILM. We find that in the full IILM, chiral symmetry is dynamically broken in anomaly-driven way, whereas in the quenched IILM, it is broken through the ordinary mechanism. Based on these results, we suggest that chiral symmetry breaking in real QCD could also occur in an anomaly-driven way. Consequently, in phenomena where chiral symmetry breaking plays a crucial role, the anomaly effect may also have significant influence.</description>

      <title>Baryon number violating hydrogen decay</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20774v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most studies on baryon number violating (BNV) processes in the literature focus on free or bound nucleons in nuclei, with limited attention given to the decay of bound atoms. Given that hydrogen is the most abundant atom in the universe, it is particularly intriguing to investigate the decay of hydrogen atom as a means to probe BNV interactions. In this study, for the first time, we employ a robust effective field theory (EFT) approach to estimate the decay widths of two-body decays of hydrogen atom into standard model particles, by utilizing the constraints on the EFT cutoff scale derived from conventional nucleon decay processes. We integrate low energy effective field theory (LEFT), chiral perturbation theory (ChPT), and standard model effective field theory (SMEFT) to formulate the decay widths in terms of the LEFT and SMEFT Wilson coefficients (WCs), respectively. By applying the bounds on the WCs from conventional nucleon decays, we provide a conservative estimate on hydrogen BNV decays. Our findings indicate that the bounds on the inverse partial widths of all dominant two-body decays exceed $10^{44}$ years. Among these modes, the least constrained diphoton decay $\Hy\to \gamma\gamma$ might be astrophysically interesting, although the monochromatic photon signal from our Sun is difficult to detect with current near-Earth telescopes.</description>

Abstract: We derive the scheme of NLO computations of generic observables in high-energy hadron-hadron collisions within the framework of high-energy factorization (HEF) with one off-shell initial-state parton, by taking a high-energy limit of the NLO computation in collinear factorization (CF). The NLO terms belonging to the projectile and target are identified and the ambiguity of projectile-target separation is related with the Collins-Soper scale ($\mu_Y$). The NLO unintegrated PDF(UPDF) is constructed in terms of the usual PDFs, and its $\mu_Y$-evolution reproduces the Collins-Soper-Sterman equation in the TMD limit ($|k_\perp|\ll \mu_Y$). The resummation of high-energy logarithms is taken care of by the BFKL-Collins-Ellis evolution of the Green's function in the UPDF.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04449v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assuming isospin conservation, the decay of a $c\bar c$ vector meson into the $\Lambda\bar\Sigma^0+\mathrm{c.c.}$ final state is purely electromagnetic. At the leading order, the $c\bar c$ vector meson first converts into a virtual photon that, then produces the $\Lambda\bar\Sigma^0+\mathrm{c.c.}$ final state. Moreover, such a mechanism, i.e., the virtual photon coupling to $\Lambda\bar\Sigma^0+\mathrm{c.c.}$, is the solely intermediate process through which, in Born approximation, the reaction $e^+e^-\to\Lambda\bar\Sigma^0+\mathrm{c.c.}$ does proceed. It follows that any significant difference between the amplitudes of the processes $c\bar c\to\Lambda\bar\Sigma^0+\mathrm{c.c.}$ and $e^+e^-\to\Lambda\bar\Sigma^0+\mathrm{c.c.}$ at the $c\bar c$ mass must be ascribed to an isospin-violating contribution in the $c\bar c$ decay. In Eur. Phys. J. C $\boldsymbol{80}$, 903 (2020) we studied the decay of the $\psi(2S)$ vector meson into $\Lambda\bar\Sigma^0+\mathrm{c.c.}$ and, on the light of the large branching fraction ${\rm BR}_{18}(\psi(2S)\to\Lambda\bar\Sigma^0+\mathrm{c.c.})=(1.23\pm0.24)\times 10^{-5}$, published in the 2018 edition of the Review of Particle Physics Phys. Rev. D $\boldsymbol{98}$, 030001 (2018), we claimed either the presence of a significant isospin-violating contribution or, with a lesser emphasis, a "not complete reliability of the only available datum". In any case, we propose a new measurement. Apparently, our second and considered less serious hypothesis was the right one, indeed the branching fraction published in the 2024 edition of the Review of Particle Physics Phys. Rev. D $\boldsymbol{110}$, 030001 (2024) is $ {\rm BR}(\psi(2S)\to\Lambda\bar\Sigma^0+\mathrm{c.c.})=(1.6\pm0.7)\times 10^{-6}$, more than seven times lower with the error that increased from $\sim 20\%$ to $\sim 45\%$.</description>

First, analyzing the partonic amplitudes of $W_LW_L\rightarrow t\bar t h/Z_L$ and simulating the full processes of $\nu\nu tth/z$ without decaying, we find they are highly sensitive to the anomalous top Yukawa $\delta y_t$. This sensitivity is enhanced by selecting helicities of the final $t\bar t$ and $Z$ to be $t_L\bar t_L+t_R\bar t_R$ and $Z_L$, which serves as the default and core setting of our analysis. We then obtain the limits on $\delta y_t$ with this setting, giving $[-1.0\%, 1.1\%]$ for $\nu\nu tth$ only and $[-0.36\%, 0.92\%]$ for $\nu\nu tth$ and $\nu\nu ttz$ combined at $30$ TeV and $1\sigma$. Second, we proceed to analyze the processes after decaying and with background processes. To enhance the sensitivity to $\delta y_t$, our settings include selecting the helicities of the final particles, as well as applying suitable cuts. However, we don't do bin-by-bin analysis. We obtain the limits on $\delta y_t$ for those channels at $10/30$ TeV and $1\sigma/2 \sigma$. The best limit is from the semi-lepton channel of $\nu\nu tth$. With spin tagging efficiency at $\epsilon_s=0.9$, it gives $[-1.6\% , 1.8\%]$ at $1\sigma$ and $ [-2.4\%, 2.7\% ]$ at $2\sigma$ at $30$ TeV; $[-7.0\%, 6.7\%]$ at $1\sigma$ and $[-9.8\%, 9.8\%]$ at $2\sigma$ at $10$ TeV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.07331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This report provides Green's functions (classical propagators) of gravitational fields appearing in general relativity. The existence of Green's function of the wave equation in curved space with an indefinite metric is ensured owing to the Hodge harmonic analysis. The analyticity of Green's function is determined intrinsically to keep a causality. This report proposed a novel definition of momentum space in curved space-time and the linearisation of the Einstein equation as a free field consistent with that of the Yang-Mills gauge field. The proposed linearisation does not utilize the weak-field approximation; thus, the method applies to highly caved space-time. We gave two examples of Green's function of gravitational fields: the plane wave solution and the Schwarzschild solution.</description>

      <title>The footprint of nuclear saturation properties on the neutron star $f$ mode oscillation frequencies: a machine learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the intricate relationships between the non-radial \(f\) mode oscillation frequencies of neutron stars (NS)s and the corresponding nuclear matter equation of state (EOS) using a machine learning (ML) approach within the ambit of the relativistic mean field (RMF) framework for nuclear matter. With two distinct parameterizations of the Walecka model, namely, (1) with non-linear self interactions of the scalar field (NL) and, (2) a density dependent Bayesian model (DDB), we perform a thorough examination of the \(f\) mode frequency in relation to various nuclear saturation properties. The correlations between the \(f\) mode frequencies and nuclear saturation properties reveal, through various analytical and ML methods, the complex nature of NSs and their potential as the cosmic laboratory for studying extreme states of matter. A principal component analysis (PCA) has been performed using mixed datasets from DDB and NL models to discriminate the relative importance of the different components of the EOS on the $f$ mode frequencies. Additionally, a {\it Random forest feature importance} analysis also elucidates the distinct roles of these properties in determining the \(f\) mode frequency across a spectrum of NS masses. Our findings are further supported by symbolic regression searches, yielding high-accuracy relations with strong Pearson coefficients and minimal errors. These relations suggest new methodologies for probing NS core characteristics, such as energy density, pressure, and speed of sound from observations of non-radial \(f\) mode oscillations of NSs.</description>

      <title>Thermal production of charm quarks in relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00425v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the thermal production of charm quarks in the strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma (sQGP) created in heavy-ion collisions at relativistic energies. Our study is based on the off-shell parton-hadron-string dynamics (PHSD) transport approach describing the full time evolution of heavy-ion collisions on a microscopic basis with hadronic and partonic degrees of freedom. The sQGP is realized within the effective dynamical quasi-particle model (DQPM) which is adjusted to reproduce the lattice QCD results for the thermodynamic observables of the sQGP. Relying on the fact that the DQPM successfully describes the spatial diffusion coefficients $D_s$ from the lQCD, which control the interaction of charm quarks with thermal partons (expressed in terms of strongly interacting off-shell quasiparticles), we evaluate the production of charm quark pairs through the rotation of Feynman diagrams such that the incoming charm quark and outgoing light parton in elastic scattering diagrams are exchanged. The charm quark annihilation is realized by detailed balance. We find that the number of produced thermal charm quark pairs strongly depends on the charm quark mass in the QGP. While for the heavy charm quarks of mass $m_c=1.8$ GeV it is subdominant compared to the primary charm production by binary nucleon-nucleon collisions at RHIC and LHC energies, the numbers of primary and thermal charm quarks become comparable for a smaller (bare) $m_c=1.2$ GeV. Compared with the experimental data on the $R_{\rm AA}$ of $D$-mesons in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC energies, it is more favorable for charm quarks in the QGP to gain additional mass due to thermal effects rather than to have a low bare mass.</description>

      <title>Key drivers of the preference for dynamic dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03983v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Joint analysis of the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) measurement by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) first data release, Type Ia supernovae (SNe) of the Dark Energy Survey Year 5 (DES5YR) release and cosmic microwave background (CMB) data favors a quintom-like dynamic dark energy model over the standard Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model at $3.9\sigma$ level (Adame et al. 2024). We confirm the previous finding in the literature that the preference for dynamic dark energy does not rely on the detailed modeling of CMB physics and remains at a similar significance level ($3.2\sigma$) when the full CMB likelihood is replaced by a CMB acoustic-oscillation angle ($\theta_\star$) prior and a baryon abundance ($\Omega_bh^2$) prior. The computationally efficient $\theta_\star$ and $\Omega_bh^2$ priors allow us to take a frequentist approach by comparing DES5YR SNe and DESI BAO with a large number ($\gtrsim 10^4$) of Planck-constrained $\Lambda$CDM simulations. We find that $\geq 3.2\sigma$ preference for dynamic dark energy is very rare (occurrence rate = $0.28\%$) in simulations. When we combine DESI BAO with SN simulations or combine DES5YR SNe with BAO simulations, the occurrence rate of $\geq 3.2\sigma$ preference for dynamic dark energy increases to $1.2\%$ and $4.8\%$, respectively. These results indicate an internal inconsistency, i.e., a significant tension between DESI BAO + DES5YR SNe and Planck-constrained $\Lambda$CDM models in both Bayesian and frequentist points of view. Although both DESI BAO and DES5YR SNe contribute to the preference for dynamic dark energy, the contribution from DES5YR SNe is more significant. In the frequentist point of view, even DES5YR SNe alone is in tension with Planck-constrained $\Lambda$CDM models, though in Bayesian point of view this tension is prior dependent and inconclusive.</description>

      <title>Fundamental physics with the Lyman-alpha forest: constraints on the growth of structure and neutrino masses from SDSS with effective field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an effective field theory (EFT) approach to extract fundamental cosmological parameters from the Lyman-alpha forest flux fluctuations as an alternative to the standard simulation-based techniques. As a first application, we re-analyze the publicly available one-dimensional Lyman-alpha flux power spectrum data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Our analysis relies on informative priors on EFT parameters which we extract from a combination of public hydrodynamic simulation and emulator data. Assuming the concordance cosmological model, our one-parameter analysis yields a $2\%$ measurement of the late time mass fluctuation amplitude $\sigma_8 = 0.841\pm 0.017$, or equivalently, the structure growth parameter $S_8 = 0.852\pm 0.017$, consistent with the standard cosmology. This result is obtained assuming that non-linear EFT parameters are cosmology-independent functions of the linear bias parameter. When this assumption is loosened, the limit degrades by a factor of 3, suggesting that informative priors are necessary for competitive constraints. Combining our EFT likelihood with Planck + baryon acoustic oscillation data, we find a new constraint on the total neutrino mass, $\sum m_\nu&lt;$ 0.08 eV (at 95\% CL). Our study defines priorities for the development of EFT methods and sets the benchmark for cosmological analyses of the Lyman-alpha forest data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument.</description>

      <title>Fast Bayesian Inference for Neutrino Non-Standard Interactions at Dark Matter Direct Detection Experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-dimensional parameter spaces are commonly encountered in physics theories that go beyond the Standard Model. However, they often possess complicated posterior geometries that are expensive to traverse using techniques traditional to astroparticle physics. Several recent innovations, which are only beginning to make their way into this field, have made navigating such complex posteriors possible. These include GPU acceleration, automatic differentiation, and neural-network-guided reparameterization. We apply these advancements to dark matter direct detection experiments in the context of non-standard neutrino interactions and benchmark their performances against traditional nested sampling techniques when conducting Bayesian inference. Compared to nested sampling alone, we find that these techniques increase performance for both nested sampling and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, accelerating inference by factors of $\sim 100$ and $\sim 60$, respectively. As nested sampling also evaluates the Bayesian evidence, these advancements can be exploited to improve model comparison performance while retaining compatibility with existing implementations that are widely used in the natural sciences. Using these techniques, we perform the first scan in the neutrino non-standard interactions parameter space for direct detection experiments whereby all parameters are allowed to vary simultaneously. We expect that these advancements are broadly applicable to other areas of astroparticle physics featuring multi-dimensional parameter spaces.</description>

      <title>On the mass distribution of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA events</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The merging black hole binaries detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) gravitational-wave observatories, may help us shed light on how such binaries form. In addition, these detections can help us probe the hypothesized primordial black holes, a candidate for the observed abundance of dark matter. In this work, we study the black-hole mass distribution obtained from the LVK binary black hole merger events. We obtain that distribution by first associating a skewed normal distribution to each event detected with a signal to noise ratio (SNR) $&gt;$ 8 and then summing all such distributions. We also simulate black hole binaries from two separate populations of merging binaries. One of these is a stellar-origin population that follows a mass-distribution similar to the zero-age mass function of stars. The second population of black holes follows a Gaussian mass-distribution. Such a distribution could approximate a population of black hole binaries formed from earlier black hole mergers in dense stellar environments, or binaries of primordial black holes. For those populations, we evaluate the number of detectable events and fit their combination to the LVK observations. In our work, we rely on a wide range of stellar-origin black-hole mass distributions. We find that the observed LVK events can be fitted much better by the combination of such a stellar-origin mass distribution and a Gaussian distribution, than by the stellar-origin mass distribution alone.</description>

      <title>History of a Particle Bounded to the Cosmological LTB Black Hole Surrounded by the Quintom Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we derived the complete set of time-dependent geodesic equations for an LTB black hole surrounded by a Quintom field and investigated the evolution of effective potential and photon orbits across cosmic epochs. Our findings demonstrate that in an accelerated universe, the peak of an effective potential decreases in height and shifts toward smaller radii. Additionally, the probability of stable orbit formation decreases as cosmic expansion progresses. We classified the possible trajectories into four types: terminating bound orbits, stable orbits, scattering flyby orbits, and terminating escape orbits. The results indicate that stable bound orbits are more prevalent in the early universe, whereas at late time epochs, flyby orbits become dominant due to the expansion-driven weakening of gravitational potential. We further analyzed the impact of angular momentum on the evolution of orbits, showing that as it increases, the ISCO radius decreases while the peak of the effective potential shifts outward. This suggests that particles with higher angular momentum follow extended bound orbits, and more energetic photons are more likely to be captured by the black hole. Conversely, an increase in angular momentum reduces the probability of flyby orbits while increasing the likelihood of direct fall into the black hole. Our study provides new insights into how cosmic acceleration influences black hole geodesics, revealing that the progressive shrinking of ISCO and stable orbits eventually disappear as the universe approaches the Big Rip singularity. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the dynamical nature of cosmological black holes and may offer new perspectives for observational tests through gravitational lensing, accretion disk evolution, and quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in evolving black hole spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present the transverse momentum spectra of prompt and decay photons in Au-Au collisions for $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 200 GeV, 62.4 GeV, 39 GeV, and 27 GeV. The major sources of the photons in Angantyr include hard processes, Parton showers, and resonance decay. The multiparton interactions and hadronic rescatterings significantly increase the photon yield. The model shows a good match with the available experimental data at high $p_T$. The difference in yield at low $p_T $ suggests that Quark Gluon Plasma of $T_{eff}$ = 0.167 GeV/c in central Au-Au collision at 200 GeV is formed, the new effective temperature is less than the ones extracted without removing background photons. At low $p_T$ the decay photon spectra scales with $(\frac{dN_{ch}}{d\eta})^{1.25}$, the scaling is independent of collision energy and system size. The scaling no longer holds at high $p_T$ and the spectra become beam energy dependent. The scaled $p_T$ spectra of p-p and d-Au collisions show an opposite trend at high $p_T$, their scaled yield is greater than the Au-Au collision at the same energy.</description>

      <title>Gamma-ray bursts and kilonovae from the accretion-induced collapse of white dwarfs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10938v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first seconds-long 2D general relativistic neutrino magnetohydrodynamic simulations of accretion-induced collapse (AIC) in rapidly rotating, strongly magnetized white dwarfs (WDs), which might originate as remnants of double-WD mergers. This study examines extreme combinations of magnetic fields and rotation rates, motivated both by the need to address the limitations of 2D axisymmetric simulations and to explore the physics of AIC under rare conditions that, while yet to be observationally confirmed, may be consistent with current theoretical models and account for unusual events. Under these assumptions, our results demonstrate that, if realizable, such systems can generate relativistic jets and neutron-rich outflows with properties consistent with long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) accompanied by kilonovae, such as GRB 211211A and GRB 230307A. These findings highlight the potential role of AIC in heavy $r$-process element production and offer a framework for understanding rare LGRBs associated with kilonova emission. Longer-duration 3D simulations are needed to fully capture magnetic field amplification, resolve instabilities, and determine the fate of the energy retained by the magnetar at the end of the simulations.</description>

Abstract: Heavy quark mass in QGP is related to the heavy quark potential at a large distance. In this study we test three different heavy quark potentials, namely, the free energy, the internal energy of the heavy quark pair in QGP, and the unscreened potential, which was recently proposed by the HotQCD Collaboration, through the thermal production of charm quarks in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC. We find that the free energy potential overestimates charm production in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC, while the unscreened potential produces results closest to the experimental data from the ALICE Collaboration among the three potentials.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Scattering Enhancement from the Aharonov-Bohm Effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of a charged particle scattering off of an Aharonov-Bohm cosmic string. A classic computation gave an infinite total scattering cross section, leading to a Callan-Rubakov-like enhancement which can have important implications on baryon number asymmetry in the early universe. However, unlike the Callan-Rubakov effect, the Aharonov-Bohm interaction is topological and thus it is surprising that it leads to such a dramatic dynamical effect for single particle scattering. We reexamine this old problem through the modern lens of generalized global symmetries by embedding Aharanov-Bohm strings in a discrete gauge theory. We show that the scattering cross section is suppressed by the core size and there is thus no Callan-Rubakov-like enhancement.</description>

Abstract: We characterize magnetic fields produced during electroweak symmetry breaking by non-dynamical numerical simulations based on the Kibble mechanism. The generated magnetic fields were thought to have an energy spectrum $\propto k^3$ for small wavenumbers $k$, but here we show that it is actually a spectrum $\propto k^4$ along with characteristic fluctuations in the magnetic helicity. Using scaling results from MHD simulations for the evolution and assuming that the initial magnetic field is coherent on the electroweak Hubble scale, we estimate the magnetic field strength to be $\sim 10^{-13}\, \rmG$ on kpc scales at the present epoch for non-helical fields. For maximally helical fields we obtain $\sim 10^{-10}\, \rmG$ on Mpc scales. We also give scalings of these estimates for partially helical fields.</description>

      <title>Dense and magnetized QCD from imaginary chemical potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we computed the equation of state of dense QCD in the presence of background magnetic fields using lattice QCD simulations at imaginary baryon chemical potential. Our simulations include 2+1+1 flavors of stout-smeared staggered fermions with masses at the physical point and a tree-level Symanzik-improved gauge action. Using several expansion schemes, we tuned our simulation parameters such that the equation of state satisfies strangeness neutrality and isospin asymmetry constraints, which are relevant to the phenomenology of heavy-ion collisions. Our results suggest a strong change in the equation of state due to the magnetic field, in particular, around the crossover temperature. A continuum extrapolation of our data is still needed for future applications of our equation of state to heavy-ion-collision phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Oscillations of Massive Boson Stars and Distinguishability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Massive Boson Stars are self-gravitating configurations of self-interacting scalar fields. The equation of state of massive boson stars and their masses, radii, modeled by a self-interacting scalar field with potential of the form $V(\phi) = \frac{1}{2}m^2|\phi|^2 + \frac{1}{4}\lambda |\phi|^4$ are known to follow scaling relations. The non-radial fundamental oscillations of such massive BSs have been studied only for a few select model parameters so far. In this work, we demonstrate for the first time that the $f$-mode characteristics also follow a scaling in the strong interaction limit ($\lambda \gg m^2/M_{Pl}^2$). This opens up the outstanding prospect of studying the $f$-modes of massive BSs throughout the scalar DM parameter space. We study the implications of this finding by carrying out a detailed study of massive BS $f$-modes in a separate work. Here, having introduced this scaling, we use it to compare boson star oscillations with the neutron star and black hole quasinormal modes, thus providing a smoking gun for the distinguishability of BSs using gravitational waves.</description>
