      <title>Singular solutions of the matrix Bochner problem: the $N$-dimensional cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the theory of matrix-valued orthogonal polynomials, there exists a longstanding problem known as the Matrix Bochner Problem: the classification of all $N \times N$ weight matrices $W(x)$ such that the associated orthogonal polynomials are eigenfunctions of a second-order differential operator. In [4], Casper and Yakimov made an important breakthrough in this area, proving that, under certain hypotheses, every solution to this problem can be obtained as a bispectral Darboux transformation of a direct sum of classical scalar weights.
  In the present paper, we construct three families of weight matrices $W(x)$ of size $N \times N$, associated with Hermite, Laguerre, and Jacobi weights, which can be considered 'singular' solutions to the Matrix Bochner Problem because they cannot be obtained as a Darboux transformation of classical scalar weights.</description>

      <title>The Nikiforov-Uvarov method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the so-called Nikiforov-Uvarov method along with some basic results about classical orthogonal polynomials and hypergeometric functions related to the hypergeometric differential equation. The method is employed to address certain eigenvalue problems that appear in quantum mechanics, namely, time-independent Schr\"odinger equation, paying special attention to properly and completely characterising its spectrum. Finally, some potentials are discussed and solved.</description>

      <title>Balayage, equilibrium measure, and Deny's principle of positivity of mass for $\alpha$-Green potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the theory of $g_\alpha$-potentials on a domain $D\subset\mathbb R^n$, $n\geqslant2$, $g_\alpha$ being the $\alpha$-Green kernel associated with the $\alpha$-Riesz kernel $|x-y|^{\alpha-n}$ of order $\alpha\in(0,n)$, $\alpha\leqslant2$, we establish the existence and uniqueness of the $g_\alpha$-balayage $\mu^F$ of a positive Radon measure $\mu$ onto a relatively closed set $F\subset D$, we analyze its alternative characterizations, and we provide necessary and/or sufficient conditions for $\mu^F(D)=\mu(D)$ to hold, given in terms of the $\alpha$-harmonic measure of suitable Borel subsets of $\overline{\mathbb R^n}$, the one-point compactification of $\mathbb R^n$. As a by-product, we find necessary and/or sufficient conditions for the existence of the $g_\alpha$-equilibrium measure $\gamma_F$, $\gamma_F$ being understood in an extended sense where $\gamma_F(D)$ might be infinite. We also discover quite a surprising version of Deny's principle of positivity of mass for $g_\alpha$-potentials, thereby significantly improving a previous result by Fuglede and Zorii (Ann. Acad. Sci. Fenn. Math., 2018). The results thus obtained are sharp, which is illustrated by means of a number of examples. Some open questions are also posed.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we study weighted estimates for a general class of lacunary maximal functions on homogeneous groups. As an application we derive improved weighted estimates for the lacunary maximal function associated to the Kor\'anyi spherical means as well as for the lacunary maximal function associated to codimension two spheres in the Heisenberg group.</description>

      <title>What do sin$(x)$ and arcsinh$(x)$ have in Common?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: N. G. de Bruijn (1958) studied the asymptotic expansion of iterates of sin$(x)$ with $0 &lt; x \leq \pi/2$. Bencherif &amp; Robin (1994) generalized this result to increasing analytic functions $f(x)$ with an attractive fixed point at 0 and $x &gt; 0$ suitably small. Mavecha &amp; Laohakosol (2013) formulated an algorithm for explicitly deriving required parameters. We review their method, testing it initally on the logistic function $\ell(x)$, a certain radical function $r(x)$, and later on several transcendental functions. Along the way, we show how $\ell(x)$ and $r(x)$ are kindred functions; the same is also true for sin$(x)$ and arcsinh$(x)$.</description>

      <title>On a Carleson-Radon Transform (the non-resonant setting)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a curve $\vec{\gamma}=(t^{\alpha_1}, t^{\alpha_2}, t^{\alpha_3})$ with $\vec{\alpha}=(\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\alpha_3)\in \mathbb{R}_{+}^3$, we define the Carleson-Radon transform along $\vec{\gamma}$ by the formula $$ C_{[\vec{\alpha}]}f(x,y):=\sup_{a\in \mathbb{R}}\left|p.v.\,\int_{\mathbb{R}} f (x-t^{\alpha_1},y-t^{\alpha_2})\,e^{i\,a\,t^{\alpha_3}}\,\frac{dt}{t}\right|\,.$$ We show that in the \emph{non-resonant} case, that is, when the coordinates of $\vec{\alpha}$ are pairwise disjoint, our operator $ C_{[\vec{\alpha}]}$ is $L^p$ bounded for any $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$. Our proof relies on the (Rank I) LGC-methodology introduced in arXiv:1902.03807 and employs three key elements:
  1) a partition of the time-frequency plane with a linearizing effect on both the argument of the input function and on the phase of the kernel;
  2) a sparse-uniform dichotomy analysis of the Gabor coefficients associated with the input/output function;
  3) a level set analysis of the time-frequency correlation set.</description>

      <title>On $d$ and $M$ problems for Newtonian potentials in Euclidean $ n $ space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we first make and discuss a conjecture concerning Newtonian potentials in Euclidean n space which have all their mass on the unit sphere about the origin, and are normalized to be one at the origin. The conjecture essentially divides these potentials into subclasses whose criteria for membership is that a given member have its maximum on the closed unit ball at most M and its minimum at least d. It then lists the extremal potential in each subclass which is conjectured to solve certain extremal problems. In Theorem 1.1 we show existence of these extremal potentials. In Theorem 1.2 we prove an integral inequality on spheres about the origin, involving so called extremal potentials, which lends credence to the conjecture.</description>

      <title>Convex body domination for rough singular integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convex body domination is a technique, where operators acting on vector-valued functions are estimated via certain convex body averages of the input functions. This domination lets one deduce various matrix weighted bounds for these operators and their commutators. In this paper, we extend the sparse domination results for rough singular integrals due to Conde-Alonso, Culiuc, Di Plinio and Ou to the convex body setting. In particular, our methods apply to homogeneous rough singular integrals with unbounded angular part. We also note that convex body domination implies new two weight commutator bounds even in the scalar case.</description>

      <title>Refined $L^p$ restriction estimate for eigenfunctions on Riemannian surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We refine the $L^p$ restriction estimates for Laplace eigenfunctions on a Riemannian surface, originally established by Burq, G\'erard, and Tzvetkov. First, we establish estimates for the restriction of eigenfunctions to arbitrary Borel sets on the surface, following the formulation of Eswarathasan and Pramanik. We achieve this by proving a variable coefficient version of a weighted Fourier extension estimate of Du and Zhang. Our results naturally unify the $L^p(M)$ estimates of Sogge and the $L^p(\gamma)$ restriction bounds of Burq, G\'erard, and Tzvetkov, and are sharp for all $p \geq 2$, up to a $\lambda^\varepsilon$ loss. Second, we derive sharp estimates for the restriction of eigenfunctions to tubular neighborhoods of a curve with non-vanishing geodesic curvature. These estimates are closely related to a variable coefficient version of the Mizohata--Takeuchi conjecture, providing new insights into eigenfunction concentration phenomena.</description>

      <title>Functions of self-adjoint operators under relatively bounded and relatively trace class perturbations. Relatively operator Lipschitz functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the behaviour of functions of self-adjoint operators under relatively bounded and relatively trace class perturbation We introduce and study the class of relatively operator Lipschitz functions. An essential role is played by double operator integrals. We also consider study the class of resolvent Lipschitz functions. Then we obtain a trace formula in the case of relatively trace class perturbations and show that the maximal class of function for which the trace formula holds in the case of relatively trace class perturbations coincides with the class of relatively operator Lipschitz functions. Our methods also gives us a new approach to the inequality $\int|\boldsymbol{\xi}(t)|(1+|t|)^{-1}\,{\rm d}t&lt;\infty$ for the spectral shift function $\boldsymbol{\xi}$ in the case of relatively trace class perturbations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $f$ be an entire function of finite exponential type less than or equal to $\sigma$ which is bounded by $1$ on the real axis and satisfies $f(0) = 1$. Under these assumptions H\"ormander showed that $f$ cannot decay faster than $\cos(\sigma x)$ on the interval $(-\pi/\sigma,\pi/\sigma)$. We extend this result to the setting of de Branges spaces with cosine replaced by the real part of the associated Hermite-Biehler function. We apply this result to study the point evaluation functional and associated extremal functions in de Branges spaces (equivalently in model spaces generated by meromorphic inner functions) generalizing some recent results of Brevig, Chirre, Ortega-Cerd\`a, and Seip.</description>

Abstract: We prove that, for every norm on $\mathbb{R}^d$ and every $E \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$, the Hausdorff dimension of the distance set of $E$ with respect to that norm is at least $\dim_{\mathrm{H}} E - (d-1)$. An explicit construction follows, demonstrating that this bound is sharp for every polyhedral norm on $\mathbb{R}^d$. The techniques of algorithmic complexity theory underlie both the computations and the construction.</description>

      <title>Hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials of Jacobi type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14715v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the theory of hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials, we consider quasi-orthogonal polynomial families - those that are orthogonal with respect to a non-degenerate bilinear form defined by a linear functional - in which the ratio of successive coefficients is given by a rational function $f(u,s)$ which is polynomial in $u$. We call this a family of Jacobi type.
  Our main result is that, up to rescaling and renormalization, there are only five families of Jacobi type. These are the classical families of Jacobi, Laguerre and Bessel polynomials, and two more one parameter families $E_n^{(c)},F_n^{(c)}$. Each family arises as a specialization of some hypergeometric series. The last two families can also be expressed through Lommel polynomials, and they are orthogonal with respect to a positive measure on $\mathbb{R}$ for $c&gt;0$ and $c&gt;-1$ respectively.
  We also consider the more general rational families, i.e. quasi-orthogonal families in which the ratio $f(u,s)$ of successive coefficients is allowed to be rational in $u$ as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06956v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove explicit uniform two-sided bounds for the phase functions of Bessel functions and of their derivatives. As a consequence, we obtain new enclosures for the zeros of Bessel functions and their derivatives in terms of inverse values of some elementary functions. These bounds are valid, with a few exceptions, for all zeros and all Bessel functions with non-negative indices. We provide numerical evidence showing that our bounds either improve or closely match the best previously known ones.</description>

      <title>Sequences with identical autocorrelation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aperiodic autocorrelation is an important indicator of performance of sequences used in communications, remote sensing, and scientific instrumentation. Knowing a sequence's autocorrelation function, which reports the autocorrelation at every possible translation, is equivalent to knowing the magnitude of the sequence's Fourier transform. The phase problem is the difficulty in resolving this lack of phase information. We say that two sequences are equicorrelational to mean that they have the same aperiodic autocorrelation function. Sequences used in technological applications often have restrictions on their terms: they are not arbitrary complex numbers, but come from a more restricted alphabet. For example, binary sequences involve terms equal to only $+1$ and $-1$. We investigate the necessary and sufficient conditions for two sequences to be equicorrelational, where we take their alphabet into consideration. There are trivial forms of equicorrelationality arising from modifications that predictably preserve the autocorrelation, for example, negating a binary sequence or reversing the order of its terms. By a search of binary sequences up to length $44$, we find that nontrivial equicorrelationality among binary sequences does occur, but is rare. An integer $n$ is said to be equivocal when there are binary sequences of length $n$ that are nontrivially equicorrelational; otherwise $n$ is unequivocal. For $n \leq 44$, we found that the unequivocal lengths are $1$--$8$, $10$, $11$, $13$, $14$, $19$, $22$, $23$, $26$, $29$, $37$, and $38$. We pose open questions about the finitude of unequivocal numbers and the probability of nontrivial equicorrelationality occurring among binary sequences.</description>

Abstract: The spectral zeta functions have been found many application in several branches of modern physics, including the quantum field theory, the string theory and the cosmology. In this paper, we shall consider the spectral zeta functions and their functional determinants in the $p$-adic field. Our approach for the constructions of $p$-adic spectral zeta functions is to apply the $p$-adic Mellin transforms with respect to locally analytic functions $f$, where $f$ interpolates the spectrum for the Hamiltonian of a quantum model.</description>

Abstract: We prove sharp spectral projection estimates for tori in all dimensions at the exponent $p_c=\frac{2(n+1)}{n-1}$ for shrinking windows of width $1$ down to windows of length $\lambda^{-1+\kappa}$ for fixed $\kappa&gt;0$. This improves and slightly generalizes the work of Blair-Huang-Sogge who proved sharp results for windows of width $\lambda^{-\frac{1}{n+3}}$, and the work of Hickman, Germain-Myerson, and Demeter-Germain who proved results for windows of all widths but incurred a sub-polynomial loss. Our work uses the approaches of these two groups of authors, combining the bilinear decomposition and microlocal techniques of Blair-Huang-Sogge with the decoupling theory and explicit lattice point lemmas used by Hickman, Germain-Myerson, and Demeter-Germain to remove these losses.</description>
