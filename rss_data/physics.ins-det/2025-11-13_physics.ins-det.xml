      <title>Commissioning the Resonance ionization Spectroscopy Experiment at FRIB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This manuscript reports on the commissioning of the Resonance ionization Spectroscopy Experiment (RISE) at the BECOLA facility at FRIB. The new instrument implements the collinear resonance ionization spectroscopy technique for sensitive measurements of isotope shifts and hyperfine structure of short-lived isotopes produced at FRIB. The existing BECOLA beamline was extended to integrate an electrostatic ion-beam bender and an ion detector at ultra-high vacuum. An injection-seeded Ti:Sapphire laser, as well as a multi-harmonic pulsed Nd:YAG laser were installed to perform resonant excitation and selective ionization. Commissioning tests were performed to demonstrate the capabilities of the new instrument by measuring the hyperfine structure of stable $^{27}$Al produced in an offline ion source. The RISE instrument is ready and operational for future studies of short-lived isotopes at FRIB.</description>

      <title>Progress on the ALETHEIA project and new approaches to events overlap mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ALETHEIA project aims to search for low-mass dark matter using liquid helium (LHe)-filled time projection chambers (TPCs). While liquid argon and liquid xenon TPCs have been extensively employed in the field of direct dark matter detection, successful development of LHe TPCs has not yet been achieved. Launched in 2020, our project has made significant progress since then. These advancements have convinced us that a single-phase LHe TPC is technologically feasible. Compared to liquid xenon and liquid argon TPCs, one of the unique challenges for LHe TPCs is event overlap caused by the 13-second lifetime scintillation. We will demonstrate that this overlap can be entirely mitigated when the LHe temperature is maintained near 1.0 K. At this temperature, electron mobility is three orders of magnitude higher than at approximately 4.0 K, which is the temperature we initially proposed for the LHe TPC.</description>

      <title>Towards low-cost lead screening with transmission XRF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human exposure to lead (Pb) is a global health concern, yet existing technologies for detecting lead in our environment remain prohibitively expensive for widespread deployment. Here we present a new concept towards lead screening using X-ray fluorescence (XRF) in an unconventional geometry we coin transmission XRF in which the sample is placed between the source and detector. For cost reduction, we then show that $^{241}$Am found in ionizing smoke detectors is spectrally suitable for Pb L-shell XRF generation and can thus replace X-ray tubes used in conventional XRF devices. Exploring soil screening as the first application, we demonstrate with Monte Carlo simulations that a configuration with 7$\times$ $^{241}$Am sources and a standard silicon drift detector can enable screening-relevant detection limits (100 ppm Pb) in soil within practical measurement times (&lt;30 min). We believe this concept opens a route toward low-cost and scalable XRF instrumentation for democratizing lead screening across a wide range of samples.</description>

      <title>An ultrafast plenoptic-camera system for high-resolution 3D particle tracking in unsegmented scintillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detectors deployed in high-resolution neutrino experiments, particle calorimetry, or dark matter candidate searches require dense and massive active materials and, in some cases, extremely fine segmentation. This is essential for achieving precise three-dimensional tracking of the interaction products and enabling accurate particle-flow reconstruction. Organic scintillator detectors, for example, in the form of scintillating fibres, offer sub-millimetre spatial and sub-nanosecond temporal resolution. However, such systems introduce significant challenges in construction and demand a large number of readout electronics channels, leading to extremely high costs that are difficult to mitigate. In this article, we propose a paradigm shift in the detection of elementary particles that leads to ultrafast three-dimensional high-resolution imaging in large volumes of unsegmented scintillator. The key enabling technologies are plenoptic systems and time-resolving single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array imaging sensors. Together, they allow us, for the first time ever with a plenoptic camera, the reconstruction of the origin of single photons in the scintillator, thereby facilitating an event-by-event analysis. A case study focused on neutrino detection demonstrates the unique potential of this approach, achieving full event reconstruction with a spatial resolution on the order of two hundred micrometres. This work paves the way for a new class of particle scintillator-based detectors, whose capabilities should be further enhanced through future developments and expanded to Cherenkov light detection and calorimetry at collider neutrino experiments, searches for neutrinoless double beta decay, as well as applications such as medical imaging and fast neutron detection.</description>

      <title>Photothermal resistivity alignment of optical fibers to SNSPD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a straightforward optoelectronic fiber alignment technique for superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) that exploits the temperature-dependent resistance of the nanowire under optical absorption. The target nanowire is illuminated via the fiber, and the local absorption of light heats the wire, causing a change in its resistivity. Scanning the fiber over the nanowire, the change in its resistivity is monitored by lock-in amplifier, mapping the spatial photothermal response correlated to absorption and coupling efficiency. The maximum of the response corresponds to optimal fiber-SNSPD alignment. This method allows for aligning the fiber to the center of the meander with sub-micron precision. The response is robust to variations in the angle and height of the fiber, providing an alternative or complement to fiber-to-chip alignment methods based on the back-reflection or transmission measurement.</description>

      <title>Improved Modeling of Quasi-Static Thermal and Optical Response of Lumped-Element Aluminum Manganese KIDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the optical characterization of the AlMn kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs) in development for use in the Next-generation Extended Wavelength-MUltiband Sub/millimeter Inductance Camera (NEW-MUSIC) on the Leighton Chajnantor Telescope (LCT). NEW-MUSIC will cover 80-420 GHz, split into six spectral bands, with polarimetry. This broad spectral coverage will enable study of a range of scientific topics such as the accretion and feedback in galaxies and galaxy cluster evolution via the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect, the transient synchrotron emission from the explosive deaths of massive stars and other time-domain phenomena, and dusty sources from low to high redshift (with polarization). Al KIDs have already been demonstrated for bands 2-5. AlMn KIDs will be used for the 90~GHz band, as Al's pair-breaking energy is too high. However, AlMn has only barely been explored as a KID material. To this end, we first improved the modeling techniques used for Al KIDs within BCS theory by eliminating the use of analytical approximations for the expressions of the complex conductivity and found these changes reduced fit parameter degeneracy in the analysis of AlMn. Then, we tested the addition of a gap smearing parameter, a standard extension to BCS theory in use for high kinetic inductance materials, and found it did not improve the fits.</description>

      <title>Design of a Six-band, 2.4-Octave (80--420 GHz) Hierarchically Summed Phased-Array Slot-Dipole Antenna Array for NEW-MUSIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Next-generation Extended Wavelength Multi-band Sub/millimeter Inductance Camera (NEW-MUSIC), located on the Leighton Chajnantor Telescope (LCT), will be the first six-band trans-millimeter wave polarimeter. This paper proposes a broadband, hierarchical phased-array antenna with integrated band-defining filters necessary to realize NEW-MUSIC. It covers a spectral bandwidth of 2.4 octaves from 80~GHz to 420~GHz, a frequency range ideal for studying trans-millimeter emission from a range of time-domain sources, using the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effects to study hot plasmas in galaxy clusters and galaxies, and to observe dusty sources, from star-forming regions in our galaxy to high-redshift dusty, star-forming galaxies. To achieve these goals, three groups of superconducting lumped-element on-chip low-pass/band-pass filter-banks were designed to hierarchically sum the superconducting, broadband, non-resonant, slot-dipole antenna arrays and band-pass filter the trans-mm light before outputting it on microstripline to detectors (KIDs in the case of NEW-MUSIC).</description>

      <title>Depth-enhanced molecular imaging with two-photon oblique plane microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-numerical-aperture (NA) oblique plane microscopy enables noninvasive fluorescence imaging of subcellular dynamics without requiring radical sample modification. However, performance degrades at depth in multicellular specimens as scattering and refractive-index heterogeneity raise out-of-focus background. We report a two-photon oblique plane microscope that improves resolution at depth by combining high-NA single-objective detection with multiphoton plane illumination. The microscope achieves $\sim\!300$ nm lateral and $\sim\!650$ nm axial resolution, with single-molecule sensitivity in vivo. Compared with two-photon point scanning, the lower illumination NA delivers an order of magnitude lower peak intensity, enabling $&gt;\!5\times$ faster volumetric acquisition (up to $3.25 \times 10^6$ voxels s$^{-1}$) with reduced photodamage. In multicellular contexts, near-infrared nonlinear excitation enhances contrast throughout the illumination depth by $\sim\!2\times$ and restores volumetric resolving power by $&gt;\!2\times$ relative to linear excitation. We demonstrate these capabilities through molecular imaging of epithelial tissue, stem-cell-derived gastruloids, and living fruit fly embryos, including multicolor transcription-factor dynamics, optogenetic subcellular control, and single-mRNA tracking, all using standard glass-based mounting.</description>

      <title>Bayesian network 3D event reconstruction in the Cygno optical TPC for dark matter direct detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The CYGNO experiment is developing a high-resolution gaseous Time Projection Chamber with optical readout for directional dark matter searches. The detector uses a helium-tetrafluoromethane (He:CF$_4$ 60:40) gas mixture at atmospheric pressure and a triple Gas Electron Multiplier amplification stage, coupled with a scientific camera for high-resolution 2D imaging and fast photomultipliers for time-resolved scintillation light detection. This setup enables 3D event reconstruction: photomultipliers signals provide depth information, while the camera delivers high-precision transverse resolution. In this work, we present a Bayesian Network-based algorithm designed to reconstruct the events using only the photomultipliers signals, yielding a full 3D description of the particle trajectories. The algorithm models the light collection process probabilistically and estimates spatial and intensity parameters on the Gas Electron Multiplier plane, where light emission occurs. It is implemented within the Bayesian Analysis Toolkit and uses Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling for posterior inference. Validation using data from the CYGNO LIME prototype shows accurate reconstruction of localized and extended tracks. Results demonstrate that the Bayesian approach enables robust 3D description and, when combined with camera data, further improves the precision of track reconstruction. This methodology represents a significant step forward in directional dark matter detection, enhancing the identification of nuclear recoil tracks with high spatial resolution.</description>

      <title>Burnup Measurement using Bent Crystal Diffraction Spectrometers for Pebble Bed Reactors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Burnup measurement is essential for monitoring and controlling pebble bed reactors (PBRs), where fuel pebbles circulate rapidly through the core. However, conventional gamma spectroscopy using high purity germanium (HPGe) detectors is difficult due to high activity levels in discharge pebbles, leading to excessive dead time and Compton scattering. This study explores the use of bent crystal diffraction (BCD) spectrometers to filter the emitted gamma spectrum and isolate key peaks for improved measurement accuracy and speed. Pebble wise depletion calculations were performed and the resulting spectra were analyzed using ray tracing (SHADOW3) and gamma response modeling (GADRAS). Key isotopes, $^{137m}$Ba/$^{137}$Cs, $^{239}$Pu, $^{144}$Ce, $^{148m}$Pm, and $^{140}$La, were found to strongly correlate with burnup, residence time, core passes, plutonium production, and fluence. Machine learning regression models applied to simulated spectra achieved a coefficient of determination ($R^2$) as high as 0.995 for burnup prediction. Among various BCD configurations, mosaic silicon crystals in the (440) orientation combined with an HPGe detector provided optimal performance for $^{137m}$Ba, while (220) and (440) configurations paired with scintillators were effective for the remaining isotopes.</description>
