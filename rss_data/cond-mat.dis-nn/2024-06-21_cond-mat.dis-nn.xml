      <title>Free energy equivalence between mean-field models and nonsparsely diluted mean-field models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We studied nonsparsely diluted mean-field models that differ from sparsely diluted mean-field models, such as the Viana--Bray model. We prove that the free energy of nonsparsely diluted mean-field models coincides exactly with that of the corresponding mean-field models with different parameters in ferromagnetic and spin-glass models composed of any discrete spin $S$ in the thermodynamic limit. Our results are a broad generalization of the results of a previous study [Bovier and Gayrard, J. Stat. Phys. 72, 643 (1993)], where the densely diluted mean-field ferromagnetic Ising model (diluted Curie--Weiss model) was analyzed rigorously, and it was proven that its free energy was exactly equivalent to that of the corresponding mean-field model (Curie--Weiss model) with different parameters.</description>

      <title>Reentrant localisation transitions and anomalous spectral properties in off-diagonal quasiperiodic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the localisation properties of quasiperiodic tight-binding chains with hopping terms modulated by the interpolating Aubry-Andr\'e-Fibonacci (IAAF) function. This off-diagonal IAAF model allows for a smooth and controllable interpolation between two paradigmatic quasiperiodic models: the Aubry-Andr\'e and the Fibonacci model. Our analysis shows that the spectrum of this model can be divided into three principal bands, namely, two molecular bands at the edge of the spectrum and one atomic band in the middle, for all values of the interpolating parameter. We reveal that the states in the molecular bands undergo multiple re-entrant localisation transitions, a behaviour previously reported in the diagonal IAAF model. We link the emergence of these reentrant phenomena to symmetry points of the quasiperiodic modulation and, with that, explain the main ground state properties of the system. The atomic states in the middle band show no traces of localised phases and remain either extended or critical for any value of the interpolating parameter. Using a renormalisation group approach, adapted from the Fibonacci model, we explain the extended nature of the middle band. These findings expand our knowledge of phase transitions within quasiperiodic systems and highlight the interplay between extended, critical, and localised states.</description>

      <title>Gaussian approximation of dynamic cavity equations for linearly-coupled stochastic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic dynamics on sparse graphs and disordered systems often lead to complex behaviors characterized by heterogeneity in time and spatial scales, slow relaxation, localization, and aging phenomena. The mathematical tools and approximation techniques required to analyze these complex systems are still under development, posing significant technical challenges and resulting in a reliance on numerical simulations. We introduce a novel computational framework for investigating the dynamics of sparse disordered systems with continuous degrees of freedom. Starting with a graphical model representation of the dynamic partition function for a system of linearly-coupled stochastic differential equations, we use dynamic cavity equations on locally tree-like factor graphs to approximate the stochastic measure. Here, cavity marginals are identified with local functionals of single-site trajectories. Our primary approximation involves a second-order truncation of a small-coupling expansion, leading to a Gaussian form for the cavity marginals. For linear dynamics with additive noise, this method yields a closed set of causal integro-differential equations for cavity versions of one-time and two-time averages. These equations provide an exact dynamical description within the local tree-like approximation, retrieving classical results for the spectral density of sparse random matrices. Global constraints, non-linear forces, and state-dependent noise terms can be addressed using a self-consistent perturbative closure technique. The resulting equations resemble those of dynamical mean-field theory in the mode-coupling approximation used for fully-connected models. However, due to their cavity formulation, the present method can also be applied to ensembles of sparse random graphs and employed as a message-passing algorithm on specific graph instances.</description>

      <title>Temporal Complexity of a Hopfield-Type Neural Model in Random and Scale-Free Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hopfield network model and its generalizations were introduced as a model of associative, or content-addressable, memory. They were widely investigated both as a unsupervised learning method in artificial intelligence and as a model of biological neural dynamics in computational neuroscience. The complexity features of biological neural networks are attracting the interest of scientific community since the last two decades. More recently, concepts and tools borrowed from complex network theory were applied to artificial neural networks and learning, thus focusing on the topological aspects. However, the temporal structure is also a crucial property displayed by biological neural networks and investigated in the framework of systems displaying complex intermittency. The Intermittency-Driven Complexity (IDC) approach indeed focuses on the metastability of self-organized states, whose signature is a power-decay in the inter-event time distribution or a scaling behavior in the related event-driven diffusion processes. The investigation of IDC in neural dynamics and its relationship with network topology is still in its early stages. In this work we present the preliminary results of a IDC analysis carried out on a bio-inspired Hopfield-type neural network comparing two different connectivities, i.e., scale-free vs. random network topology. We found that random networks can trigger complexity features similar to that of scale-free networks, even if with some differences and for different parameter values, in particular for different noise levels.</description>

      <title>Opening the Black Box: predicting the trainability of deep neural networks with reconstruction entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An important challenge in machine learning is to predict the initial conditions under which a given neural network will be trainable. We present a method for predicting the trainable regime in parameter space for deep feedforward neural networks, based on reconstructing the input from subsequent activation layers via a cascade of single-layer auxiliary networks. For both MNIST and CIFAR10, we show that a single epoch of training of the shallow cascade networks is sufficient to predict the trainability of the deep feedforward network, thereby providing a significant reduction in overall training time. We achieve this by computing the relative entropy between reconstructed images and the original inputs, and show that this probe of information loss is sensitive to the phase behaviour of the network. Our results provide a concrete link between the flow of information and the trainability of deep neural networks, further elucidating the role of criticality in these systems.</description>

      <title>Weak Superfluidity in Twisted Optical Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A controlled twist between different underlying lattices allows one to interpolate, under a unified framework, across ordered and (quasi-)disordered matter while drastically changing quantum transport properties. Here, we use quantum Monte Carlo simulations to determine the unique phase diagrams of strongly-correlated ultracold bosons in twisted optical potentials. We show that at commensurate twisting angles, spectral gaps govern the formation of insulating patterns, separated by thin superfluid domains. The latter form weak superfluids, which are very sensitive to thermal fluctuations, but can be stabilized under appropriate parameter control. In contrast, slightly changing the twisting angle to a incommensurate value destroys most spectral gaps, leaving behind a prominent Bose glass phase. Our results are directly applicable to current generation experiments that quantum simulate moir\'e physics.</description>

      <title>A fractal geometry immersed in a hierarchical magnetic flux distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fractal geometry presents us with a self-similarity in their pattern at various length scales that is prevalent in our natural world. We present theoretical model of a Sierpinski gasket (SPG) fractal geometry with a deterministic perturbation in the form of a hierarchical distribution of magnetic flux. Such flux configuration induces a deterministic disorder in the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) phases picked up by the electron wavefunction. Using the tight-binding formalism, we show that by tunning the strength of the hierarchy parameter of those AB phases, one can systematically engineer quantum states in a SPG fractal lattice. In addition to this, we have also observed that by controlling the strength of this hierarchy parameter in the magnetic flux, one can effectively regulate the persistent current in the SPG fractal structure. This characteristic is found to be true for various filling factors. Our results could be useful for designing nanoelectronic devices using molecular fractal structures fabricated by chemical synthesis technique.</description>

      <title>Structural analysis of Gibbs states and metastates in short-range classical spin glasses: indecomposable metastates, dynamically-frozen states, and metasymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider short-range classical spin glasses, or other disordered systems, consisting of Ising spins. For a low-temperature Gibbs state in infinite size in such a system, for given random bonds, it is controversial whether its decomposition into pure states will be trivial or non-trivial. We undertake a general study of the overall structure of this problem, based on metastates, which are essential to prove the existence of a thermodynamic limit. A metastate is a probability distribution on Gibbs states, for given disorder, that satisfies certain covariance properties. First, we prove that any metastate can be decomposed as a mixture of indecomposable metastates, and that all Gibbs states drawn from an indecomposable metastate are alike macroscopically. Next, we consider stochastic stability of a metastate under random perturbations of the disorder, and prove that any metastate is stochastically stable. Dynamically-frozen states play a role in the analysis of Gibbs states drawn from a metastate, either as states or as parts of states. Using a mapping into real Hilbert space, we prove results about Gibbs states, and classify them into six types. Any indecomposable metastate has a compact symmetry group, though it may be trivial; we call this a metasymmetry. Metastate-average states are studied, and can be related to states arising dynamically at long times after a quench from high temperature, under some conditions. Many features that are permitted by general results are already present in replica symmetry breaking (RSB). Our results are for cases both with and without spin-flip symmetry of the Hamiltonian and, technically, we use mixed $p$-spin--interaction models.</description>

      <title>Protect Measurement-Induced Phase Transition from Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT) is a novel non-equilibrium phase transition characterized by entanglement entropy. The scrambling dynamics induced by random unitary gates can protect information from low-rate measurements. However, common decoherence noises, such as dephasing, are detrimental to the volume law phase, posing a significant challenge for observing MIPT in current noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Here, we demonstrate that incorporating quantum-enhanced operations can effectively protect MIPT from environmental noise. The conditional entanglement entropy is associated with a statistical mechanics model wherein noise and quantum-enhanced operations act as two competing external random fields. Then we show that an average apparatus-environment exchange symmetry ensures the conditional entanglement entropy is a valid probe of entanglement. Furthermore, we provide numerical evidence on a (2+1)-d quantum circuit under dephasing noise, demonstrating that MIPT can indeed be observed with the aid of quantum-enhanced operations. This result not only serves as a concrete example of the power of quantum enhancement in combating noise but also holds experimental relevance, as the protocol is straightforward to implement in practice.</description>

      <title>Predicting and Interpreting Energy Barriers of Metallic Glasses with Graph Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metallic Glasses (MGs) are widely used materials that are stronger than steel while being shapeable as plastic. While understanding the structure-property relationship of MGs remains a challenge in materials science, studying their energy barriers (EBs) as an intermediary step shows promise. In this work, we utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model MGs and study EBs. We contribute a new dataset for EB prediction and a novel Symmetrized GNN (SymGNN) model that is E(3)-invariant in expectation. SymGNN handles invariance by aggregating over orthogonal transformations of the graph structure. When applied to EB prediction, SymGNN are more accurate than molecular dynamics (MD) local-sampling methods and other machine-learning models. Compared to precise MD simulations, SymGNN reduces the inference time on new MGs from roughly 41 days to less than one second. We apply explanation algorithms to reveal the relationship between structures and EBs. The structures that we identify through explanations match the medium-range order (MRO) hypothesis and possess unique topological properties. Our work enables effective prediction and interpretation of MG EBs, bolstering material science research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At asymptotically late times ultrametricity can emerge from the persistent slow aging dynamics of the glass phase. We show that this suffices to recover the breaking of replica symmetry in mean-field spin glasses from the late time limit of the time evolution using the Keldysh path integral. This provides an alternative approach to replica symmetry breaking by connecting it rigorously to the dynamic formulation. Stationary spin glasses are thereby understood to spontaneously break thermal symmetry, or the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger relation of a state in global thermal equilibrium. We demonstrate our general statements for the spherical quantum $p$-spin model and the quantum Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model in the presence of transverse and longitudinal fields. In doing so, we also derive their dynamical Ginzburg-Landau effective Keldysh actions starting from microscopic quantum models.</description>

      <title>Toward mean-field bound for critical temperature on Nishimori line</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The critical inverse temperature of the mean-field approximation gives a lower bound of the true critical inverse temperature in a broad class of ferromagnetic spin models, which is called the mean-field bound for the critical temperature. In this study, we explore the possibility of a corresponding mean-field bound for the critical temperature in Ising spin-glass models with Gaussian randomness on the Nishimori line. On the Nishimori line, the critical inverse temperature of the mean-field approximation is given by $\beta_{MF}^{NL}=\sqrt{1/z}$, where $z$ denotes the coordination number. Using the Griffiths inequalities on the Nishimori line, we prove that there is zero spontaneous magnetization in the high-temperature region $\beta &lt; \beta_{MF}^{NL}/2$. In other words, the true critical inverse temperature $\beta_c^{NL}$ of the Nishimori line is always bounded by $\beta_c^{NL} \ge \beta_{MF}^{NL}/2$. Unfortunately, we did not succeed in obtaining the corresponding mean-field bound $\beta_c^{NL} \ge \beta_{MF}^{NL}$ on the Nishimori line.</description>

      <title>Tensor formalism for predicting synaptic connections with ensemble modeling or optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Theoretical neuroscientists often try to understand how the structure of a neural network relates to its function by focusing on structural features that would either follow from optimization or occur consistently across possible implementations. Both optimization theories and ensemble modeling approaches have repeatedly proven their worth, and it would simplify theory building considerably if predictions from both theory types could be derived and tested simultaneously. Here we show how tensor formalism from theoretical physics can be used to unify and solve many optimization and ensemble modeling approaches to predicting synaptic connectivity from neuronal responses. We specifically focus on analyzing the solution space of synaptic weights that allow a threshold-linear neural network to respond in a prescribed way to a limited number of input conditions. For optimization purposes, we compute the synaptic weight vector that minimizes an arbitrary quadratic loss function. For ensemble modeling, we identify synaptic weight features that occur consistently across all solutions bounded by an arbitrary ellipsoid. We derive a common solution to this suite of nonlinear problems by showing how each of them reduces to an equivalent linear problem that can be solved analytically. Although identifying the equivalent linear problem is nontrivial, our tensor formalism provides an elegant geometrical perspective that allows us to solve the problem approximately in an analytical way or exactly using numeric methods. The final algorithm is applicable to a wide range of interesting neuroscience problems, and the associated geometric insights may carry over to other scientific problems that require constrained optimization.</description>

      <title>Universality classes for purification in nonunitary quantum processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider universal aspects of two problems: (i) the slow purification of a large number of qubits by repeated quantum measurements, and (ii) the singular value structure of a product ${m_t m_{t-1}\ldots m_1}$ of many large random matrices. Each kind of process is associated with the decay of natural measures of entropy as a function of time or of the number of matrices in the product. We argue that, for a broad class of models, each process is described by universal scaling forms for purification, and that (i) and (ii) represent distinct ``universality classes'' with distinct scaling functions. Using the replica trick, these universality classes correspond to one-dimensional effective statistical mechanics models for a gas of ``kinks'', representing domain walls between elements of the permutation group. (This is an instructive low-dimensional limit of the effective statistical mechanics models for random circuits and tensor networks.) These results apply to long-time purification in spatially local monitored circuit models on the entangled side of the measurement phase transition.</description>
