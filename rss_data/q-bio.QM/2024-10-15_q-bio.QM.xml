      <title>Fake it till you predict it: data augmentation strategies to detect initiation and termination of oncology treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At the hospital, the dispersion of information regarding anti-cancer treatment makes it difficult to extract. We proposed a solution capable of identifying dates, drugs and their temporal relationship within free-text oncology reports with very few manual annotations. We used pattern recognition for dates, dictionaries for drugs and transformer language models for the relationship, combined with a data augmentation strategy. Our models achieved good prediction F1-scores, reaching 0.872. The performance of models with data augmentation outperforms those of models without. By inferring such models, we can now identify and structure thousands of previously unavailable treatment events to better apprehend solutions and patient response.</description>

      <title>QueST: Querying Functional and Structural Niches on Spatial Transcriptomics Data via Contrastive Subgraph Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The functional or structural spatial regions within tissues, referred to as spatial niches, are elements for illustrating the spatial contexts of multicellular organisms. A key challenge is querying shared niches across diverse tissues, which is crucial for achieving a comprehensive understanding of the organization and phenotypes of cell populations. However, current data analysis methods predominantly focus on creating spatial-aware embeddings for cells, neglecting the development of niche-level representations for effective querying. To address this gap, we introduce QueST, a novel niche representation learning model designed for querying spatial niches across multiple samples. QueST utilizes a novel subgraph contrastive learning approach to explicitly capture niche-level characteristics and incorporates adversarial training to mitigate batch effects. We evaluate QueST on established benchmarks using human and mouse datasets, demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art graph representation learning methods in accurate niche queries. Overall, QueST offers a specialized model for spatial niche queries, paving the way for deeper insights into the patterns and mechanisms of cell spatial organization across tissues.

      <title>Transcriptome and Redox Proteome Reveal Temporal Scales of Carbon Metabolism Regulation in Model Cyanobacteria Under Light Disturbance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a systems approach based on an energy-landscape concept to differentiate interactions involving redox activities and conformational changes of proteins and nucleic acids interactions in multi-layered protein-DNA regulatory networks under light disturbance. Our approach is a data-driven modeling workflow using a physics-informed machine learning algorithm to train a non-linear mathematical model for interpreting gene expression dynamics and to lead discovery for protein regulators using redox proteome analysis. We distinguish light-responsive elements within central carbon metabolism pathways from independent variables like circadian time using the publicly available transcriptome datasets of Synechococcus elongatus over diel cycles responding to light perturbations. Our approach provides interpretable de novo models for elucidating events of reactions in complex regulatory pathways in response to stressful disturbance from the environment. We discovered protein regulators in response to light disturbance in the proteome analysis involving shifts in protein abundance as well as cysteine redox states under constant illumination and after two hours of darkness. We discovered significant shifts in cysteine redox states in regulatory proteins such as transcription sigma factors and metabolic enzymes in the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway and the Calvin-Benson cycle, while the changes in their protein abundance were minimal. These results indicate that regulatory dynamics in reductant generation link photo-induced electron transport pathways and redox metabolic pathways with circadian rhythms through fast redox-induced conformational changes or slow expression regulations across networks.</description>

      <title>Examining the Link Between Peroxiredoxin Proteins and Mutually Exclusive Transcription Factor Activation With a Mathematical Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Oxidative stress is a fundamental stimulus to which eukaryotic cells respond via many channels. Among these channels are both protein systems that process oxidative stress, such as the 2-Cys peroxiredoxin-thioredoxin system (PTRS), as well as changes in transcriptional activity that target outcomes such as growth, damage control and repair, or cell death. Recent work has revealed connections between the PTRS and temporal phases of transcriptional activity involving famous transcription factors like p53 and FOXO1. To examine potential mechanisms for these connections, we implement an existing dynamical systems mathematical model for the PTRS. We hypothesize that dose-dependent hyperoxidation events enact ultrasensitive switches by which the PTRS can categorize stress severity and activate appropriate transcriptional responses. Using numerical simulations of the PTRS in human cells, we provide a proof of principle for staggered, switchlike hyperoxidation of peroxiredoxins (Prx) as well as an underlying mechanism requiring simultaneous signaling by Prx I and II. Then, we use our model to make testable predictions about individual Prx knockouts as well as the affinity for hydrogen peroxide of Prx across oxidation states. This study provides direction for future experimental work and sheds light into the mechanisms underlying oxidative stress response in human cells.</description>

      <title>Data informed epidemiological-behavioural modelling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Augmenting classical epidemiological models with information from the social sciences helps unveil the interplay between contagion dynamics and social responses. However, multidisciplinary integration of social analysis and epidemiological modelling is often challenging, due to scarcity of vast and reliable data sources and because ad hoc modelling assumptions may not reproduce empirically observed patters. Here, we test the hypothesis that awareness and information spreading straightforwardly translates into behavioural responses, analysing empirical data to generate insights about their dynamics and relationships. We employ such results to build a data-informed behavioural-epidemiological model that elucidates the impact of compliant behaviours and the role of centralised regulations in mitigating epidemics. We investigate model properties and its benefits in integrating theoretical modelling and data.</description>

      <title>ALNSynergy: a graph convolutional network with multi-representation alignment for drug synergy prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Drug combination refers to the use of two or more drugs to treat a specific disease at the same time. It is currently the mainstream way to treat complex diseases. Compared with single drugs, drug combinations have better efficacy and can better inhibit toxicity and drug resistance. The computational model based on deep learning concatenates the representation of multiple drugs and the corresponding cell line feature as input, and the output is whether the drug combination can have an inhibitory effect on the cell line. However, this strategy of concatenating multiple representations has the following defects: the alignment of drug representation and cell line representation is ignored, resulting in the synergistic relationship not being reflected positionally in the embedding space. Moreover, the alignment measurement function in deep learning cannot be suitable for drug synergy prediction tasks due to differences in input types. Therefore, in this work, we propose ALNSynergy, a graph convolutional network with multi-representation alignment for predicting drug synergy. In the ALNSynergy model, we designed a multi-representation alignment function suitable for the drug synergy prediction task so that the positional relationship between drug representations and cell line representation is reflected in the embedding space. In addition, the vector modulus of drug representations and cell line representation is considered to improve the accuracy of calculation results and accelerate model convergence. Finally, many relevant experiments were run on multiple drug synergy datasets to verify the effectiveness of the above innovative elements and the excellence of the ALNSynergy model.</description>

      <title>Compression-based inference of network motif sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physical and functional constraints on biological networks lead to complex topological patterns across multiple scales in their organization. A particular type of higher-order network feature that has received considerable interest is network motifs, defined as statistically regular subgraphs. These may implement fundamental logical and computational circuits and are referred as "building blocks of complex networks". Their well-defined structures and small sizes also enables the testing of their functions in synthetic and natural biological experiments. The statistical inference of network motifs is however fraught with difficulties, from defining and sampling the right null model to accounting for the large number of possible motifs and their potential correlations in statistical testing. Here we develop a framework for motif mining based on lossless network compression using subgraph contractions. The minimum description length principle allows us to select the most significant set of motifs as well as other prominent network features in terms of their combined compression of the network. The approach inherently accounts for multiple testing and correlations between subgraphs and does not rely on a priori specification of an appropriate null model. This provides an alternative definition of motif significance which guarantees more robust statistical inference. Our approach overcomes the common problems in classic testing-based motif analysis. We apply our methodology to perform comparative connectomics by evaluating the compressibility and the circuit motifs of a range of synaptic-resolution neural connectomes.</description>

      <title>How to Build the Virtual Cell with Artificial Intelligence: Priorities and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cell is arguably the most fundamental unit of life and is central to understanding biology. Accurate modeling of cells is important for this understanding as well as for determining the root causes of disease. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), combined with the ability to generate large-scale experimental data, present novel opportunities to model cells. Here we propose a vision of leveraging advances in AI to construct virtual cells, high-fidelity simulations of cells and cellular systems under different conditions that are directly learned from biological data across measurements and scales. We discuss desired capabilities of such AI Virtual Cells, including generating universal representations of biological entities across scales, and facilitating interpretable in silico experiments to predict and understand their behavior using virtual instruments. We further address the challenges, opportunities and requirements to realize this vision including data needs, evaluation strategies, and community standards and engagement to ensure biological accuracy and broad utility. We envision a future where AI Virtual Cells help identify new drug targets, predict cellular responses to perturbations, as well as scale hypothesis exploration. With open science collaborations across the biomedical ecosystem that includes academia, philanthropy, and the biopharma and AI industries, a comprehensive predictive understanding of cell mechanisms and interactions has come into reach.</description>
