      <title>Weighted Schreier-type Sets and the Fibonacci Sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a finite set $A\subset\mathbb{N}$ and $k\in \mathbb{N}$, let $\omega_k(A) = \sum_{i\in A, i\neq k}1$. For each $n\in \mathbb{N}$, define $$a_{k, n}\ =\ |\{E\subset \mathbb{N}\,:\, E = \emptyset\mbox{ or } \omega_k(E) &lt; \min E\leqslant \max E\leqslant n\}|.$$ First, we prove that $$a_{k,k+\ell} \ =\ 2F_{k+\ell},\mbox{ for all }\ell\geqslant 0\mbox{ and }k\geqslant \ell+2,$$ where $F_n$ is the $n$th Fibonacci number. Second, we show that $$|\{E\subset \mathbb{N}\,:\, \max E = n+1, \min E &gt; \omega_{2,3}(E), \mbox{ and }|E|\neq 2\}|\ =\ F_{n},$$ where $\omega_{2,3}(E) = \sum_{i\in E, i\neq 2, 3}1$.</description>

      <title>Putatively optimal projective spherical designs with little apparent symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give some new explicit examples of putatively optimal projective spherical designs. i.e., ones for which there is numerical evidence that they are of minimal size. These form continuous families, and so have little apparent symmetry in general, which requires the introduction of new techniques for their construction. New examples of interest include an 11-point spherical (3, 3)-design for R 3 , and a 12-point spherical (2, 2)-design for R 4 given by four Mercedes-Benz frames that lie on equi-isoclinic planes. We also give results of an extensive numerical study to determine the nature of the real algebraic variety of optimal projective real spherical designs, and in particular when it is a single point (a unique design) or corresponds to an infinite family of designs.</description>

      <title>Coloring minimal Cayley graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that any minimal Cayley graph of a (finitely generated) generalized dihedral or nilpotent group has chromatic number at most 3, while 4 colors are sometimes necessary for soluble groups. On the other hand we construct graphs of unbounded chromatic number that admit a proper edge coloring such that each cycle has some color at least twice. The latter disproves a conjecture of Babai'78 that would have implied that all minimal Cayley graphs have bounded chromatic number -- a problem that remains open.</description>

      <title>Knights are 24/13 times faster than the king</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On an infinite chess board, how much faster can the knight reach a square when compared to the king, in average? More generally, for coprime $b&gt;a \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1}$ such that $a+b$ is odd, define the $(a,b)$-knight and the king as
  \[ \mathrm{N}_{a,b}= \{(a,b), (b,a), (-a,b), (-b,a), (-b,-a), (-a,-b), (a,-b), (b, -a)\}, \]
  \[ \mathrm{K}=\{(1,0), (1,1), (0,1), (-1,1), (-1,0), (-1,-1), (0,-1), (1,-1)\} \subseteq \mathbb{Z}^2, \]
  respectively. One way to formulate this question is by asking for the average ratio, for $\mathbf{p}\in \mathbb{Z}^2$ in a box, between $\min\{h\in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1} ~|~ \mathbf{p}\in h\mathrm{N}\}$ and $\min\{h\in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1} ~|~ \mathbf{p}\in h\mathrm{K}\}$, where $hA = \{\mathbf{a}_1+\cdots+\mathbf{a}_h ~|~ \mathbf{a}_1,\ldots, \mathbf{a}_h \in A\}$ is the $h$-fold sumset of $A$. We show that this ratio equals $2(a+b)b^2/(a^2+3b^2)$.</description>

      <title>On sequences arising from randomizing subtraction games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the behavior of a broad family of real sequences derived from randomized one-pile subtraction games. For any subtraction set $S$, we allow any valid number of chips $s\in S$ to be removed at equal probability at any given position and we study the sequences $(a_n^S)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ representing the probability of winning the game from a position with $n$ chips. We characterize these sequences in terms of linear recurrence relations and examine their behavior as $n\rightarrow\infty$ for all finite $S$. We fully solve the cases for subtraction sets of fewer than 3 elements and partially complete the general case for arbitrary $S$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Both Morse theory and Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory link algebra, topology and analysis in a geometric setting. The two theories can be formulated in finite geometries like graph theory or within finite abstract simplicial complexes. We work here mostly in graph theory and review the Morse inequalities b(k)-b(k-1) + ... + b(0) less of equal than c(k)-c(k-1) + ... + c(0) for the Betti numbers b(k) and the minimal number c(k) of Morse critical points of index k and the Lusternik-Schnirelmann inequalities cup+1 less or equal than cat less or equal than cri, between the algebraic cup length cup, the topological category cat and the analytic number cri counting the minimal number of critical points of a function.</description>

      <title>Rainbow cycles through specified vertices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An edge-coloured cycle is rainbow if the edges have distinct colours. Let $G$ be a graph such that any $k$ vertices lie in a cycle of $G$. The $k$-rainbow cycle index of $G$, denoted by $crx_k(G)$, is the minimum number of colours required to colour the edges of $G$ such that, for every set $S$ of $k$ vertices in $G$, there exists a rainbow cycle in $G$ containing $S$. In this paper, we will first prove some results about the parameter $crx_k(G)$ for general graphs $G$. One of the results is a classification of all graphs $G$ such that $crx_k(G)=e(G)$, for $k=1,2$. We will also determine $crx_k(G)$ for some specific graphs $G$, including wheels, complete graphs, complete bipartite and multipartite graphs, and discrete cubes.</description>

      <title>On minimal presentations of numerical monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the classical problem of determining the largest possible cardinality of a minimal presentation of a numerical monoid with given embedding dimension and multiplicity. Very few values of this cardinality are known. In addressing this problem, we apply tools from Hilbert functions and free resolutions of artinian standard graded algebras. This approach allows us to solve the problem in many cases and, at the same time, identify subtle difficulties in the remaining cases. As a by-product of our analysis, we deduce results for the corresponding problem for the type of a numerical monoid.</description>

      <title>Monochromatic graph decompositions inspired by anti-Ramsey colorings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider coloring problems inspired by the theory of anti-Ramsey / rainbow colorings that we generalize to a far extent.
  Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a hereditary family of graphs; i.e., if $H\in \mathcal{F}$ and $H'\subset H$ then also $H'\subset \mathcal{F}$. For a graph $G$ and any integer $n \geq |G|$, let $f(n,G|\mathcal{F})$ denote the smallest number $k$ of colors such that any edge coloring of $K_n$ with at least $k$ colors forces a copy of $G$ in which each color class induces a member of $\mathcal{F}$.
  The case $\mathcal{F} = \{K_2\}$ is the notorious anti-Ramsey / rainbow coloring problem introduced by Erd\H{o}s, Simonovits and S\'os in 1973.
  Using the $\mathcal{F}$-deck of $G$, $D(G|\mathcal{F}) = \{ H : H = G - D, \, D \in \mathcal{F}\}$, we define $\chi_\mathcal{F}(G) = \min \{ \chi(H) : H \in D(G|\mathcal{F}) \}$.
  The main theorem we prove is: Suppose $\mathcal{F}$ is a hereditary family of graphs, and let $G$ be a graph not a member of $\mathcal{F}$.
  (1) If $\chi_\mathcal{F}(G) \geq 3$, then $f(n, G |\mathcal{F}) = (1+o(1)) \, ex(n, K_{\chi_\mathcal{F}(G)})$.
  (2) Otherwise $f(n, G |\mathcal{F}) = o(n^2)$.
  Among the families covered by this theorem are: matchings, acyclic graphs, planar and outerplanar graphs, $d$-degenerate graphs, graphs with chromatic number at most $k$, graphs with bounded maximum degree, and many more.
  We supply many concrete examples to demonstrate the wide range of applications of the main theorem; the next result is a representative of these examples.
  For $p \geq 5$ and $\mathcal{F} = \{ tK_2 : t \geq 1 \}$, we have $f(n,K_p |\mathcal{F}) = (1+o(1)) \, ex(n, K_{\lceil p/2 \rceil})$; this means a properly colored copy of $K_p$. In other words, a certain number of colors forces nearly twice as large properly edge-colored complete subgraphs as rainbow ones.</description>

      <title>A bijection related to Bressoud's conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bressoud introduced the partition function $B(\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_\lambda;\eta,k,r;n)$, which counts the number of partitions with certain difference conditions. Bressoud posed a conjecture on the generating function for the partition function $B(\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_\lambda;\eta,k,r;n)$ in multi-summation form. In this article, we introduce a bijection related to Bressoud's conjecture. As an application, we give a new companion to the G\"ollnitz-Gordon identities.</description>

      <title>A weighted Murnaghan-Nakayama rule for $(P, w)$-partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $(P, w)$-partition generating function $K_{(P,w)}(x)$ is a quasisymmetric function obtained from a labeled poset. Recently, Liu and Weselcouch gave a formula for the coefficients of $K_{(P,w)}(x)$ when expanded in the quasisymmetric power sum function basis. This formula generalizes the classical Murnaghan--Nakayama rule for Schur functions.
  We extend this result to weighted $(P, w)$-partitions and provide a short combinatorial proof, avoiding the Hopf algebra machinery used by Liu-Weselcouch.</description>

      <title>Regular bipartite multigraphs have many (but not too many) symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $k$ and $l$ be integers, both at least 2. A $(k,l)$-bipartite graph is an $l$-regular bipartite multigraph with coloured bipartite sets of size $k$. Define $\chi(k,l)$ and $\mu(k,l)$ to be the minimum and maximum order of automorphism groups of $(k,l)$-bipartite graphs, respectively. We determine $\chi(k,l)$ and $\mu(k,l)$ for $k\geq 8$, and analyse the generic situation when $k$ is fixed and $l$ is large. In particular, we show that almost all such graphs have automorphism groups which fix the vertices pointwise and have order far less than $\mu(k,l)$. These graphs are intimately connected with both integer doubly-stochastic matrices and uniform set partitions; we examine the uniform distribution on the set of $k\times k$ integer doubly-stochastic matrices with all line sums $l$, showing that with high probability all entries stray far from the mean. We also show that the symmetric group acting on uniform set partitions is non-synchronizing.</description>

      <title>On the Random Minimum Spanning Subgraph Problem for Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The weight of the minimum spanning tree in a complete weighted graph with random edge weights is a well-known problem. For various classes of distributions, it is proved that the weight of the minimum spanning tree tends to a constant, which can be calculated depending on the distribution. In this paper, we generalise this result to the hypergraphs setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this survey we revisit {\sc finite subtraction}, one-heap subtraction games on finite rulesets. The main purpose is to give a general overview of the development, and specifically to draw attention to Flammenkamp's thesis (1997), where he, contrary to other studies, experimentally observes exponential eventual period length of the outcomes, for a carefully selected subclass of games. In addition, we contribute an appendix on {\sc finite excluded subtraction} by Suetsugu.</description>

      <title>Extremal spectral radius in h-extra r-component (edge)-connected graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For two integers $r\geq 2$ and $h\geq 0$, a subset $S\subseteq V$ is called an $h$-extra $r$-component cut of $G$ such that there are at least $r$ connected components in $G\!-\!S$ and each component has at least $h+1$ vertices. The minimum size of any $h$-extra $r$-component cut of $G$, if it exists, is the $h$-extra $r$-component connectivity of $G$, denoted as $\kappa^h_r(G)$. Denote by $\mathcal{G}_{n,\delta}^{\kappa_r^h}$ the set of $\kappa^h_r$-connected graphs of order $n$ with minimum degree $\delta$. What are the corresponding extremal graphs in $\mathcal{G}_{n,\delta}^{\kappa_r^h}$ with the maximum spectral radius for $r\geq 2$ and $h\geq 0$? Fan, Gu and Lin [$l$-connectivity, $l$-edge-connectivity and spectral radius of graphs, \emph{arXiv}:2309.05247] give the answer to $r\geq 2$ and $h=0$. In this paper, we provide a solution for $r\geq 2$ and $h\geq1$. Moreover, we also investigate analogous problems for the edge version. Our results can imply some previous results, specifically those of Lu and Lin [\emph{J. Discrete Algorithms} 31 (2015) 113--119] in connectivity, and for the work of Fan, Gu, and Lin[\emph{J. Graph Theory} (2023) 1--15], as well as Liu, Lu, and Tian[\emph{Linear Algebra Appl.} 389 (2004) 139--145], concerning edge connectivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characteristic quasi-polynomials are the enumerative functions counting the number of elements in the complement of hyperplane arrangements modulo positive integers.In this paper, we compute the characteristic quasi-polynomials of the restriction of the Shi arrangement of type B by one given hyperplane. As a corollary, we determine whether period collapse occurs in the characteristic quasi-polynomial of the deletion of the Shi arrangement of type B. This implies the complete solution for the conjecture posed by Higashtiani, Tran and Yoshinaga.</description>

Abstract: Let us consider an infinite word and $k\geq 1$ an integer. By steps of $k$, we substitute a letter ofthis infinite word by the power of an external letter. The new word obtaining by this process is called $k$ to $k$ substitution of a power letter. After the application of this new notion on modulo-reccurent words and in particular on Sturmian words. We establish the complexity function of those words.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the theory of smooth approximations, we give a new and algebraic proof that for any set F of finite tournaments, the problem of orienting a finite graph whilst avoiding all members of F is either in P or NP-complete. We characterize both cases by algebraic conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice geometries and random walks on them are of great interest for their applications in different fields such as physics, chemistry, and computer science. In this work, we focus on multi-headed lattices and study properties of the Green functions for these lattices such as the associated differential equations and the P\'olya numbers. In particular, we complete the analysis of three missing cases in dimensions no larger than five. Our results are built upon an automatic machinery of creative telescoping.</description>

      <title>Sublinear Cuts are the Exception in BDF-GIRGs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The introduction of geometry has proven instrumental in the efforts towards more realistic models for real-world networks. In Geometric Inhomogeneous Random Graphs (GIRGs), Euclidean Geometry induces clustering of the vertices, which is widely observed in networks in the wild. Euclidean Geometry in multiple dimensions however restricts proximity of vertices to those cases where vertices are close in each coordinate. We introduce a large class of GIRG extensions, called BDF-GIRGs, which capture arbitrary hierarchies of the coordinates within the distance function of the vertex feature space. These distance functions have the potential to allow more realistic modeling of the complex formation of social ties in real-world networks, where similarities between people lead to connections. Here, similarity with respect to certain features, such as familial kinship or a shared workplace, suffices for the formation of ties. It is known that - while many key properties of GIRGs, such as log-log average distance and sparsity, are independent of the distance function - the Euclidean metric induces small separators, i.e. sublinear cuts of the unique giant component in GIRGs, whereas no such sublinear separators exist under the component-wise minimum distance. Building on work of Lengler and Todorovi\'{c}, we give a complete classification for the existence of small separators in BDF-GIRGs. We further show that BDF-GIRGs all fulfill a stochastic triangle inequality and thus also exhibit clustering.</description>

      <title>Bounding the softwired parsimony score of a phylogenetic network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In comparison to phylogenetic trees, phylogenetic networks are more suitable to represent complex evolutionary histories of species whose past includes reticulation such as hybridisation or lateral gene transfer. However, the reconstruction of phylogenetic networks remains challenging and computationally expensive due to their intricate structural properties. For example, the small parsimony problem that is solvable in polynomial time for phylogenetic trees, becomes NP-hard on phylogenetic networks under softwired and parental parsimony, even for a single binary character and structurally constrained networks. To calculate the parsimony score of a phylogenetic network $N$, these two parsimony notions consider different exponential-size sets of phylogenetic trees that can be extracted from $N$ and infer the minimum parsimony score over all trees in the set. In this paper, we ask: What is the maximum difference between the parsimony score of any phylogenetic tree that is contained in the set of considered trees and a phylogenetic tree whose parsimony score equates to the parsimony score of $N$? Given a gap-free sequence alignment of multi-state characters and a rooted binary level-$k$ phylogenetic network, we use the novel concept of an informative blob to show that this difference is bounded by $k+1$ times the softwired parsimony score of $N$. In particular, the difference is independent of the alignment length and the number of character states. We show that an analogous bound can be obtained for the softwired parsimony score of semi-directed networks, while under parental parsimony on the other hand, such a bound does not hold.</description>

      <title>On shortest products for nonnegative matrix mortality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a finite set of matrices with integer entries, the matrix mortality problem asks if there exists a product of these matrices equal to the zero matrix. We consider a special case of this problem where all entries of the matrices are nonnegative. This case is equivalent to the NFA mortality problem, which, given an NFA, asks for a word $w$ such that the image of every state under $w$ is the empty set. The size of the alphabet of the NFA is then equal to the number of matrices in the set. We study the length of shortest such words depending on the size of the alphabet. We show that this length for an NFA with $n$ states can be at least $2^n - 1$, $2^{(n - 4)/2}$ and $2^{(n - 2)/3}$ if the size of the alphabet is, respectively, equal to $n$, three and two.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a linear Hamming metric code of length n over a finite field, the number of distinct weights of its codewords is at most n. The codes achieving the equality in the above bound were called full weight spectrum codes. In this paper we will focus on the analogous class of codes within the framework of cyclic subspace codes. Cyclic subspace codes have garnered significant attention, particularly for their applications in random network coding to correct errors and erasures. We investigate one-orbit cyclic subspace codes that are full weight spectrum in this context. Utilizing number theoretical results and combinatorial arguments, we provide a complete classification of full weight spectrum one-orbit cyclic subspace codes.</description>

Abstract: Cosmological observables in perturbation theory turn out to be plagued with infrared divergences, which represents both a conceptual and computational challenge. In this paper we present a proof of concept for a systematic procedure to remove these divergences in a large class of scalar cosmological integrals and consistently define an infrared safe computable in perturbation theory. We provide diagrammatic rules which are based on the nestohedra underlying the asymptotic structure of such integrals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of locally consistent system of half-spaces for a real hyperplane arrangement. We embed a sphere in the complexified complement by shifting the real unit sphere into the imaginary direction indicated by the half-spaces. We then prove that the sphere is homotopically trivial if and only if the system of half-spaces is globally consistent. To prove its non-triviality, we compute the twisted intersection number of the sphere with a specific, explicitly constructed twisted Borel-Moore cycle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we initiate the study of constant dimension subspace codes restricted to Schubert varieties, which we call Schubert subspace codes. These codes have a very natural geometric description, as objects that we call intersecting sets with respect to a fixed subspace. We provide a geometric construction of maximum size constant dimension subspace codes in some Schubert varieties with the largest possible value for the minimum subspace distance. Finally, we generalize the problem to different values of the minimum distance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jukes-Cantor model is one of the most meaningful statistical models from a biological perspective. We are interested in computing the algebraic degrees for phylogenetic varieties, which we call phylogenetic degrees, associated to the Jukes-Cantor model and any tree. As these varieties are toric, their geometry is hidden in the associated polytopes. For this reason, we provide two different combinatorial approaches to compute the volume for these polytopes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the dimer model on the Aztec diamond with Fock's weights, which is gauge equivalent to the model with any choice of positive weight function. We prove an explicit, compact formula for the inverse Kasteleyn matrix, thus extending numerous results in the case of periodic graphs. We also show an explicit product formula for the partition function; as a specific instance of the genus 0 case, we recover Stanley's formula. We then use our explicit formula for the inverse Kasteleyn matrix to recover, in a simple way, limit shape results; we also obtain new ones. In doing so, we extend the correspondence between the limit shape and the amoeba of the corresponding spectral curve of arXiv:2306.07482 to the case of non-generic weights.</description>

Abstract: Let $M$ be an $n\times n$ matrix with iid subgaussian entries with mean $0$ and variance $1$ and let $\sigma_n(M)$ denote the least singular value of $M$. We prove that \[\mathbb{P}\big( \sigma_{n}(M) \leq \varepsilon n^{-1/2} \big) = (1+o(1)) \varepsilon + e^{-\Omega(n)}\] for all $0 \leq \varepsilon \ll 1$. This resolves, up to a $1+o(1)$ factor, a seminal conjecture of Spielman and Teng.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1912.07722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that every $n$-vertex tournament $G$ has an acyclic subgraph with chromatic number at least $n^{5/9-o(1)}$, while there exists an $n$-vertex tournament $G$ whose every acyclic subgraph has chromatic number at most $n^{3/4+o(1)}$. This establishes in a strong form a conjecture of Nassar and Yuster and improves on another result of theirs. Our proof combines probabilistic and spectral techniques together with some additional ideas. In particular, we prove a lemma showing that every tournament with many transitive subtournaments has a large subtournament that is almost transitive. This may be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.03788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the number of linear spaces on a set of $n$ points and the number of rank-3 matroids on a ground set of size $n$ are both of the form $(cn+o(n))^{n^2/6}$, where $c=e^{\sqrt 3/2-3}(1+\sqrt 3)/2$. This is the final piece of the puzzle for enumerating fixed-rank matroids at this level of accuracy: the numbers of rank-1 and rank-2 matroids on a ground set of size $n$ have exact representations in terms of well-known combinatorial functions, and it was recently proved by van der Hofstad, Pendavingh, and van der Pol that for constant $r\ge 4$ there are $(e^{1-r}n+o(n))^{n^{r-1}/r!}$ rank-$r$ matroids on a ground set of size $n$. In our proof, we introduce a new approach for bounding the number of clique decompositions of a complete graph, using quasirandomness instead of the so-called entropy method that is common in this area.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.05998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $W$ be a Coxeter group and let $\Phi^+$ be its positive roots. A subset $B$ of $\Phi^+$ is called biclosed if, whenever we have roots $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$ with $\gamma \in \mathbb{R}_{&gt;0} \alpha + \mathbb{R}_{&gt;0} \beta$, if $\alpha$ and $\beta \in B$ then $\gamma \in B$ and, if $\alpha$ and $\beta \not\in B$, then $\gamma \not\in B$. The finite biclosed sets are the inversion sets of the elements of $W$, and the containment between finite inversion sets is the weak order on $W$. Matthew Dyer suggested studying the poset of all biclosed subsets of $\Phi^+$, ordered by containment, and conjectured that it is a complete lattice. As progress towards Dyer's conjecture, we classify all biclosed sets in the affine root systems. We provide both a type uniform description, and concrete models in the classical types $\widetilde{A}$, $\widetilde{B}$, $\widetilde{C}$, $\widetilde{D}$. We use our models to prove that biclosed sets form a complete lattice in types $\widetilde{A}$ and $\widetilde{C}$.</description>

Abstract: We consider a tuple $\Phi = (\phi_1,\ldots,\phi_m)$ of commuting maps on a finitary matroid $X$. We show that if $\Phi$ satisfies certain conditions, then for any finite set $A\subseteq X$, the rank of $\{\phi_1^{r_1}\cdots\phi_m^{r_m}(a):a \in A\text{ and }r_1+\cdots+r_m = t\}$ is eventually a polynomial in $t$ (we also give a multivariate version of the polynomial). This allows us easily recover Khovanskii's theorem on the growth of sumsets, the existence of the classical Hilbert polynomial, and the existence of the Kolchin polynomial. We also prove some new Kolchin polynomial results for differential exponential fields and derivations on o-minimal fields, as well as a new result on the growth of Betti numbers in simplicial complexes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.02874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An $n$-vertex graph is called $C$-Ramsey if it has no clique or independent set of size $C\log_2 n$ (i.e., if it has near-optimal Ramsey behavior). In this paper, we study edge-statistics in Ramsey graphs, in particular obtaining very precise control of the distribution of the number of edges in a random vertex subset of a $C$-Ramsey graph. This brings together two ongoing lines of research: the study of "random-like" properties of Ramsey graphs and the study of small-ball probabilities for low-degree polynomials of independent random variables.
  The proof proceeds via an "additive structure" dichotomy on the degree sequence, and involves a wide range of different tools from Fourier analysis, random matrix theory, the theory of Boolean functions, probabilistic combinatorics, and low-rank approximation. One of the consequences of our result is the resolution of an old conjecture of Erd\H{o}s and McKay, for which Erd\H{o}s offered one of his notorious monetary prizes.</description>

Abstract: Given a graph $G$ and sets $\{\alpha_v~|~v \in V(G)\}$ and $\{\beta_v~|~v \in V(G)\}$ of non-negative integers, it is known that the decision problem whether $G$ contains a spanning tree $T$ such that $\alpha_v \le d_T (v) \le \beta_v $ for all $v \in V(G)$ is $NP$-complete. In this article, we relax the problem by demanding that the degree restrictions apply to vertices $v\in U$ only, where $U$ is a stable set of $G$. In this case, the problem becomes tractable.
  A. Frank presented a result characterizing the positive instances of that relaxed problem. Using matroid intersection developed by J. Edmonds, we give a new and short proof of Frank's result and show that if $U$ is stable and the edges of $G$ are weighted by arbitrary real numbers, then even a minimum-cost tree $T$ with $\alpha_v \le d_T (v) \le \beta_v $ for all $v \in U$ can be found in polynomial time if such a tree exists.</description>

      <title>Robust Recovery of Robinson Property in $L^p$-Graphons: A Cut-Norm Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.16598v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the Robinson graphon completion/recovery problem within the class of $L^p$-graphons, focusing on the range $5&lt;p\leq \infty$. A graphon $w$ is Robinson if it satisfies the Robinson property: if $x\leq y\leq z$, then $w(x,z)\leq \min\{w(x,y),w(y,z)\}$. We demonstrate that if a graphon possesses localized near-Robinson characteristics, it can be effectively approximated by a Robinson graphon in terms of cut-norm. To achieve this recovery result, we introduce a function $\Lambda$, defined on the space of $L^p$-graphons, which quantifies the degree to which a graphon $w$ adheres to the Robinson property. We prove that $\Lambda$ is a suitable gauge for measuring the Robinson property when proximity of graphons is understood in terms of cut-norm. Namely, we show that (1) $\Lambda(w)=0$ precisely when $w$ is Robinson; (2) $\Lambda$ is cut-norm continuous, in the sense that if two graphons are close in the cut-norm, then their $\Lambda$ values are close; and (3) for $p &gt; 5$, any $L^p$-graphon $w$ can be approximated by a Robinson graphon, with error of the approximation bounded in terms of $\Lambda(w)$. When viewing $w$ as a noisy version of a Robinson graphon, our method provides a concrete recipe for recovering a cut-norm approximation of a noiseless $w$. Given that any symmetric matrix is a special type of graphon, our results can be applicable to symmetric matrices of any size. Our work extends and improves previous results, where a similar question for the special case of $L^\infty$-graphons was answered.</description>

      <title>Avoiding intersections of given size in finite affine spaces AG(n,2)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.05632v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the set of intersection sizes of a k-dimensional affine subspace and a point set of size m \in [0, 2^n] of the n-dimensional binary affine space AG(n,2). Following the theme of Erd\H{o}s, F\"uredi, Rothschild and T. S\'os, we partially determine which local densities in k-dimensional affine subspaces are unavoidable in all $m$-element point sets in the n-dimensional affine space. We also show constructions of point sets for which the intersection sizes with $k$-dimensional affine subspaces takes values from a set of a small size compared to 2^k. These are built up from affine subspaces and so-called subspace evasive sets. Meanwhile, we improve the best known upper bounds on subspace evasive sets and apply results concerning the canonical signed-digit (CSD) representation of numbers.</description>

      <title>Towards Nash-Williams Orientation Conjecture for Infinite Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1960 Nash-Williams proved that an edge-connectivity of 2k is sufficient for a finite graph to have a k-arc-connected orientation. He then conjectured that the same is true for infinite graphs. In 2016, Thomassen, using his own results on the auxiliary lifting graph, proved that 8k-edge-connected infinite graphs admit a $k$-arc connected orientation. Here we improve this result for the class of $1$-ended locally-finite graphs and show that an edge-connectivity of 4k is enough in that case. Crucial to this improvement are results presented in a separate paper, by the same author of this paper, on the key concept of the lifting graph, extending results by Ok, Richter, and Thomassen.</description>

      <title>Dimensions of splines of degree two</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Splines are defined as piecewise polynomials on the faces of a polyhedral complex that agree on the intersections of two faces. Splines are used in approximation theory and numerical analysis, with applications in data interpolation, to create smooth curves in computer graphics and to find numerical solutions to partial differential equations. Gilbert, Tymoczko, and Viel generalized the classical splines combinatorially and algebraically: a generalized spline is a vertex labeling of a graph $G$ by elements of the ring so that the difference between the labels of any two adjacent vertices lies in the ideal generated by the corresponding edge label. We study the generalized splines on the planar graphs whose edges are labeled by two-variable polynomials of the form $(ax+by+c)^2$ and whose vertices are labeled by polynomials of degree at most two. In this paper we address the upper-bound conjecture for the dimension of degree-2 splines of smoothness 1. The dimension is expressed in terms of the rank of the extended cycle basis matrix. We also provide a combinatorial algorithm on graphs to compute the rank by contracting certain subgraphs.</description>

      <title>Affine extended weak order is a lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coxeter groups are equipped with a partial order known as the weak Bruhat order, such that $u \leq v$ if the inversions of $u$ are a subset of the inversions of $v$. In finite Coxeter groups, weak order is a complete lattice, but in infinite Coxeter groups it is only a meet semi-lattice. Motivated by questions in Kazhdan-Lusztig theory, Matthew Dyer introduced a larger poset, now known as extended weak order, which contains the weak Bruhat order as an order ideal and coincides with it for finite Coxeter groups. The extended weak order is the containment order on certain sets of positive roots: those which satisfy a geometric condition making them "biclosed". The finite biclosed sets are precisely the inversion sets of Coxeter group elements. Generalizing the result for finite Coxeter groups, Dyer conjectured that the extended weak order is always a complete lattice, even for infinite Coxeter groups.
  In this paper, we prove Dyer's conjecture for Coxeter groups of affine type. To do so, we introduce the notion of a clean arrangement, which is a hyperplane arrangement where the regions are in bijection with biclosed sets. We show that root poset order ideals in a finite or rank 3 untwisted affine root system are clean. We set up a general framework for reducing Dyer's conjecture to checking cleanliness of certain subarrangements. We conjecture this framework can be used to prove Dyer's conjecture for all Coxeter groups.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of $\mu$-signed and duplication signed graphs and shows that both are always structurally balanced. Using the duplication signed graph, we define the corona product of the duplication signed graph (Duplication add vertex corona product and duplication vertex corona product) and explore their structural properties. Additionally, we provide the adjacency spectrum of both the products for any $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$, and the Laplacian and signless Laplacian spectrum for regular $\Gamma_1$ and arbitrary $\Gamma_2$, in terms of the corresponding spectrum of $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$. Finally, we discuss its application in generating integral and equienergetic signed graphs.</description>

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to derive explicit formulas for two distinct values. The first is the total number of symmetric peaks in a set partition of $[n]$ with exactly $k$ blocks, and the second one is the total number of non-symmetric peaks in a set partition of $[n]$ with exactly $k$ blocks. We represent these results in two ways. First by using the theory of generating functions, and the second by using combinatorial tools.</description>

      <title>Induced Saturation for Complete Bipartite Posets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08651v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given $s,t\in\mathbb{N}$, a complete bipartite poset $\mathcal{K}_{s,t}$ is a poset, whose Hasse diagram consists of $s$ pairwise incomparable vertices in the upper layer and $t$ pairwise incomparable vertices in the lower layer, such that every vertex in the upper layer is larger than all vertices in the lower layer. A family $\mathcal{F}\subseteq2^{[n]}$ is called induced $\mathcal{K}_{s,t}$-saturated if $(\mathcal{F},\subseteq)$ contains no induced copy of $\mathcal{K}_{s,t}$, whereas adding any set from $2^{[n]}\backslash\mathcal{F}$ to $\mathcal{F}$ creates an induced $\mathcal{K}_{s,t}$. Let $\mathrm{sat}^{*}(n,\mathcal{K}_{s,t})$ denote the smallest size of an induced $\mathcal{K}_{s,t}$-saturated family $\mathcal{F}\subseteq2^{[n]}$. We show that $\mathrm{sat}^{*}(n,\mathcal{K}_{s,t})=O(n)$ for all fixed $s,t\in\mathbb{N}$. Moreover, we prove a linear lower bound on $\mathrm{sat}^{*}(n,\mathcal{P})$ for a large class of posets $\mathcal{P}$, particularly for $\mathcal{K}_{s,2}$ with $s\in\mathbb{N}$.</description>

Abstract: Improving a 2003 result of Bohman and Holzman, we show that for $n \geq 1$, the Shannon capacity of the complement of the $2n+1$-cycle is at least $(2^{r_n} + 1)^{1/r_n} = 2 + \Omega(2^{-r_n}/r_n)$, where $r_n = \exp(O((\log n)^2))$ is the number of partitions of $2(n-1)$ into powers of $2$. We also discuss a connection between this result and work by Day and Johnson in the context of graph Ramsey numbers.</description>

      <title>Note on the union-closed sets conjecture and Reimer's average set size theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Union-Closed Sets Conjecture, often attributed to P\'eter Frankl in 1979, remains an open problem in discrete mathematics. It posits that for any finite family of sets $S\neq\{\emptyset\}$, if the union of any two sets in the family is also in the family, then $\underline{\text{there must exist an element that belongs to at least half of the member sets}}$. We will refer to the underlined text as the abundance condition. In 2001, David Reimer proved that the average set size of a union-closed family $S$ must be at least $\frac{1}{2}\log_{2}|S|$. When proving this result, he showed that a family being union-closed implies that the family satisfies certain conditions, which we will refer to as the Reimer's conditions. Therefore, as seen in the context of Tim Gowers' polymath project on the Union-Closed Sets Conjecture, it is natural to ask if all families that satisfy Reimer's conditions meet the abundance condition. A minimal counterexample to this question was offered by Raz in 2017. In this paper, we will discuss a general method to construct infinitely many such counterexamples with any fixed lower bound on the size of the member sets. Furthermore, we will discuss some properties related to these counterexamples, especially those focusing on how far these counterexamples are from being union-closed.</description>

The construction uses asymptotics for harmonic numbers, the precise nature of the continued fraction expansion of $e$ and a suitable rescaling of a subsequence of convergents.</description>

We particularly focus on contributions from Kahn, Zhao, and Sah et al. in incrementally proving stronger and more general versions of the upper bound. We reproduce the main results of these works, particularly focusing on the unweighted special case (with fugacity $\lambda = 1$), which allows us to provide more intuitive and clear explanations of the key ideas that have been developed in the field over three decades.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.06626v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that, for any given set of networks satisfying suitable conditions, the net-oudegree network solution, the net-indegree network solution, and the total network solution are the unique network solutions on that set satisfying neutrality, consistency and cancellation. The generality of the result obtained allows to get an analogous result for social choice correspondences: for any given set of preference profiles satisfying suitable conditions, the net-oudegree social choice correspondence, the net-indegree social choice correspondence and the total social choice correspondence are the unique social choice correspondences on that set satisfying neutrality, consistency and cancellation. Using the notable fact that several well-known voting rules coincide with the restriction of net-oudegree social choice correspondence to appropriate sets of preference profiles, we are able to deduce a variety of new and known characterization theorems for the Borda rule, the Partial Borda rule, the Averaged Borda rule, the Approval Voting, the Plurality rule and the anti-Plurality rule, among which Young's characterization of the Borda rule and Fishburn's characterization of the Approval Voting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.06404v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an arbitrary choice of two sets of nonzero Boltzmann weights for $n$-color lattice models, we provide explicit algebraic conditions on these Boltzmann weights which guarantee a solution (i.e., a third set of weights) to the Yang-Baxter equation. Furthermore we provide an explicit one-dimensional parametrization of all solutions in this case. These $n$-color lattice models are so named because their admissible vertices have adjacent edges labeled by one of $n$ colors with additional restrictions. The two-colored case specializes to the six-vertex model, in which case our results recover the familiar quadric condition of Baxter for solvability. The general $n$-color case includes important solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation like the evaluation modules for the quantum affine Lie algebra $U_q(\hat{\mathfrak{sl}}_n)$. Finally, we demonstrate the invariance of this class of solutions under natural transformations, including those associated with Drinfeld twisting.</description>

      <title>On a Hierarchy of Spectral Invariants for Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04391v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a hierarchy of graph invariants that naturally extends the spectral invariants defined by F\"urer (Lin. Alg. Appl. 2010) based on the angles formed by the set of standard basis vectors and their projections onto eigenspaces of the adjacency matrix. We provide a purely combinatorial characterization of this hierarchy in terms of the walk counts. This allows us to give a complete answer to F\"urer's question about the strength of his invariants in distinguishing non-isomorphic graphs in comparison to the 2-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm, extending the recent work of Rattan and Seppelt (SODA 2023). As another application of the characterization, we prove that almost all graphs are determined up to isomorphism in terms of the spectrum and the angles, which is of interest in view of the long-standing open problem whether almost all graphs are determined by their eigenvalues alone. Finally, we describe the exact relationship between the hierarchy and the Weisfeiler-Leman algorithms for small dimensions, as also some other important spectral characteristics of a graph such as the generalized and the main spectra.</description>

Abstract: Fractions $\frac{p}{q} \in [0,1)$ with prime denominator $q$ written in decimal have a curious property described by Midy's Theorem, namely that two halves of their period (if it is of even length $2n$) sum up to $10^n-1$. A number of results generalise Midy's theorem to expansions of $\frac{p}{q}$ in different integer bases, considering non-prime denominators, or dividing the period into more than two parts. We show that a similar phenomena can be studied even in the context of numeration systems with non-integer bases, as introduced by R\'enyi. First we define the Midy property for a general real base $\beta &gt;1$ and derive a necessary condition for validity of the Midy property. For $\beta =\frac12(1+\sqrt5)$ we characterize prime denominators $q$, which satisfy the property.</description>
