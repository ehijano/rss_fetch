      <title>Some Constructions on Quantum Principal Bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to prove four statements in the theory of quantum principal bundles: 1) The universal differential envelope $\ast$--calculus of a matrix (compact) Lie group, for the classical bicovariant $\ast$--First Order Differential Calculus, is the algebra of differential forms. 2) An example of a quantum principal bundle in which the space of base forms is not generated by the base space. 3) The group isomorphism between convolution-invertible maps and covariant left module isomorphisms at the level of differential calculus 4) The way the maps $\{T^V_k \}$ from Remark 3.1 look in differential geometry.</description>

      <title>Frobenius subalgebra lattices in tensor categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates Frobenius subalgebra lattices within tensor categories and extends Watatani's theorem on the finiteness of intermediate subfactors to this setting, under certain positivity conditions encompassing the pseudo-unitary fusion categories. The primary tools employed in this study are semisimplification and a concept of formal angle. Additionally, we have broadened several intermediate results, such as the exchange relation theorem and Landau's theorem, to apply to abelian monoidal categories.
  Key applications of our findings include a stronger version of the Ino-Watatani result: we show that the finiteness of intermediate C*-algebras holds in a finite index unital irreducible inclusion of C*-algebras without requiring the simple assumption. Moreover, for a finite-dimensional semisimple Hopf algebra H, we demonstrate that H* contains a finite number of Frobenius subalgebra objects in Rep(H). Finally, we explore a range of applications, including abstract spin chains, vertex operator algebras, and speculations on quantum arithmetic involving the generalization of Ore's theorem, Euler's totient and sigma functions, and RH.</description>

      <title>Cohomological Hall algebras of one-dimensional sheaves on surfaces and Yangians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We begin the systematic study of cohomological Hecke operators of modifications of coherent sheaves on a smooth surface $X$, along a fixed proper curve $Z \subset X$. We develop the necessary geometric foundations in order to define the $T$-equivariant cohomological Hall algebra $\mathbf{HA}^{\mathbf{D}, T}_{X,Z}$ of the moduli stack of coherent sheaves on $X$ with set-theoretic support on $Z$, in the setting of a general motivic formalism $\mathbf{D}$. The algebra $\mathbf{HA}^{\mathbf{D}, A}_{X,Z}$ is functorial with respect to closed immersions $Z' \subset Z$ and transformations of the motivic formalism $\mathbf{D}$, and only depends on the formal neighborhood $\widehat{X}_Z$ of $Z$ in $X$.
  Assume $\mathbf{D}$ gives rise to Borel-Moore homology. When $X$ is a resolution of a Kleinian singularity and $Z$ is the exceptional divisor, we explicitly identify $\mathbf{HA}^T_{X,Z}$ with a completed nonstandard positive half $\mathbb{Y}^+_\infty(\mathfrak{g})$ of the affine Yangian $\mathbb{Y}(\mathfrak{g})$ of the corresponding affine ADE type Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. Let $Z_1,Z_2 \subset X$ be curves with $Z_1\cap Z_2$ being zero-dimensional. We conjecture a PBW type theorem relating the COHAs of the pairs $(X, Z_1\cup Z_2), (X, Z_1)$, and $(X, Z_2)$ and partially prove it in several interesting cases, including all Kleinian resolutions of singularities and elliptic surfaces of types $D$ and $E$.
  Our main tools are: (i) a continuity theorem describing the behavior of COHAs of objects in the heart of $t$-structures $\tau_n$ when the sequence $(\tau_n)_n$ converges in an appropriate sense to a fixed $t$-structure $\tau_\infty$; (ii) a theorem relating the action of the braid group $B_Q$ by derived autoequivalences on the preprojective algebra of a quiver $Q$ with the algebraic action of $B_Q$ on the associated COHA $\mathbf{HA}^T_Q$.</description>

      <title>Bialgebras, Manin triples of Malcev-Poisson algebras and post-Malcev-Poisson algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Malcev-Poisson algebra is a Malcev algebra together with a commutative associative algebra structure related by a Leibniz rule. In this paper, we introduce the notion of Malcev-Poisson bialgebra as an analogue of a Malcev bialgebra and establish the equivalence between matched pairs, Manin triples and Malcev-Poisson bialgebras. Moreover, we introduce a new algebraic structure, called post-Malcev-Poisson algebras. Post-Malcev-Poisson algebras can be viewed as the underlying algebraic structures of weighted relative Rota-Baxter operators on Malcev-Poisson algebras.</description>

      <title>Infinitesimal 2-braidings from 2-shifted Poisson structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that every $2$-shifted Poisson structure on a finitely generated semi-free commutative differential graded algebra $A$ defines a very explicit infinitesimal $2$-braiding on the homotopy $2$-category of the symmetric monoidal dg-category of finitely generated semi-free $A$-dg-modules. This provides a concrete realization, to first order in the deformation parameter $\hbar$, of the abstract deformation quantization results in derived algebraic geometry due to Calaque, Pantev, To\"en, Vaqui\'e and Vezzosi. Of particular interest is the case when $A$ is the Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra of a Lie $N$-algebra, where the braided monoidal deformations developed in this paper may be interpreted as candidates for representation categories of `higher quantum groups'.</description>

      <title>Deformed Boson Algebras and $\mathcal{W}_{\alpha,\beta,\nu}$-Coherent States: A New Quantum Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel class of coherent states, termed $\mathcal{W}^{(\bar{\alpha},\bar{\nu})}(z)$-coherent states, constructed using a deformed boson algebra based on the generalized factorial $[n]_{\alpha,\beta,\nu}!$. This algebra extends conventional factorials, incorporating advanced special functions such as the Mittag-Leffler and Wright functions, enabling the exploration of a broader class of quantum states. The mathematical properties of these states, including their continuity, completeness, and quantum fluctuations, are analyzed. A key aspect of this work is the resolution of the Stieltjes moment problem associated with these states, achieved through the inverse Mellin transformation method. The framework provides insights into the interplay between classical and quantum regimes, with potential applications in quantum optics and fractional quantum mechanics. By extending the theoretical landscape of coherent states, this study opens avenues for further exploration in mathematical physics and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>A proof of the Naito--Sagaki conjecture via the branching rule for $\imath$quantum groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Naito--Sagaki conjecture asserts that the branching rule for the restriction of finite-dimensional, irreducible polynomial representations of $GL_{2n}(\mathbb{C})$ to $Sp_{2n}(\mathbb{C})$ amounts to the enumeration of certain ``rational paths'' satisfying specific conditions. This conjecture can be thought of as a non-Levi type analog of the Levi type branching rule, stated in terms of the path model due to Littelmann, and was proved combinatorially in 2018 by Schumann--Torres. In this paper, we give a new proof of the Naito--Sagaki conjecture independently of Schumann--Torres, using the branching rule based on the crystal basis theory for $\imath$quantum groups of type $\mathrm{AII}_{2n-1}$. Here, note that $\imath$quantum groups are certain coideal subalgebras of a quantized universal enveloping algebra obtained by $q$-deforming symmetric pairs, and also regarded as a generalization of quantized universal enveloping algebras; these were defined by Letzter in 1999, and since then their representation theory has become an active area of research. The main ingredients of our approach are certain combinatorial operations, such as promotion operators and Kashiwara operators, which are well-suited to the representation theory of complex semisimple Lie algebras.</description>
