      <title>Unmasking Deepfakes: Leveraging Augmentations and Features Variability for Deepfake Speech Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of deepfake speech has become increasingly challenging with the rapid evolution of deepfake technologies. In this paper, we propose a hybrid architecture for deepfake speech detection, combining a self-supervised learning framework for feature extraction with a classifier head to form an end-to-end model. Our approach incorporates both audio-level and feature-level augmentation techniques. Specifically, we introduce and analyze various masking strategies for augmenting raw audio spectrograms and for enhancing feature representations during training. We incorporate compression augmentations during the pretraining phase of the feature extractor to address the limitations of small, single-language datasets. We evaluate the model on the ASVSpoof5 (ASVSpoof 2024) challenge, achieving state-of-the-art results in Track 1 under closed conditions with an Equal Error Rate of 4.37%. By employing different pretrained feature extractors, the model achieves an enhanced EER of 3.39%. Our model demonstrates robust performance against unseen deepfake attacks and exhibits strong generalization across different codecs.</description>

      <title>FreeSVC: Towards Zero-shot Multilingual Singing Voice Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents FreeSVC, a promising multilingual singing voice conversion approach that leverages an enhanced VITS model with Speaker-invariant Clustering (SPIN) for better content representation and the State-of-the-Art (SOTA) speaker encoder ECAPA2. FreeSVC incorporates trainable language embeddings to handle multiple languages and employs an advanced speaker encoder to disentangle speaker characteristics from linguistic content. Designed for zero-shot learning, FreeSVC enables cross-lingual singing voice conversion without extensive language-specific training. We demonstrate that a multilingual content extractor is crucial for optimal cross-language conversion. Our source code and models are publicly available.</description>

      <title>ExPO: Explainable Phonetic Trait-Oriented Network for Speaker Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In speaker verification, we use computational method to verify if an utterance matches the identity of an enrolled speaker. This task is similar to the manual task of forensic voice comparison, where linguistic analysis is combined with auditory measurements to compare and evaluate voice samples. Despite much success, we have yet to develop a speaker verification system that offers explainable results comparable to those from manual forensic voice comparison. A novel approach, Explainable Phonetic Trait-Oriented (ExPO) network, is proposed in this paper to introduce the speaker's phonetic trait which describes the speaker's characteristics at the phonetic level, resembling what forensic comparison does. ExPO not only generates utterance-level speaker embeddings but also allows for fine-grained analysis and visualization of phonetic traits, offering an explainable speaker verification process. Furthermore, we investigate phonetic traits from within-speaker and between-speaker variation perspectives to determine which trait is most effective for speaker verification, marking an important step towards explainable speaker verification. Our code is available at https://github.com/mmmmayi/ExPO.</description>

      <title>CognoSpeak: an automatic, remote assessment of early cognitive decline in real-world conversational speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The early signs of cognitive decline are often noticeable in conversational speech, and identifying those signs is crucial in dealing with later and more serious stages of neurodegenerative diseases. Clinical detection is costly and time-consuming and although there has been recent progress in the automatic detection of speech-based cues, those systems are trained on relatively small databases, lacking detailed metadata and demographic information. This paper presents CognoSpeak and its associated data collection efforts. CognoSpeak asks memory-probing long and short-term questions and administers standard cognitive tasks such as verbal and semantic fluency and picture description using a virtual agent on a mobile or web platform. In addition, it collects multimodal data such as audio and video along with a rich set of metadata from primary and secondary care, memory clinics and remote settings like people's homes. Here, we present results from 126 subjects whose audio was manually transcribed. Several classic classifiers, as well as large language model-based classifiers, have been investigated and evaluated across the different types of prompts. We demonstrate a high level of performance; in particular, we achieved an F1-score of 0.873 using a DistilBERT model to discriminate people with cognitive impairment (dementia and people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)) from healthy volunteers using the memory responses, fluency tasks and cookie theft picture description. CognoSpeak is an automatic, remote, low-cost, repeatable, non-invasive and less stressful alternative to existing clinical cognitive assessments.</description>

      <title>Towards Early Prediction of Self-Supervised Speech Model Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), pre-training and evaluation are resource intensive. In the speech domain, current indicators of the quality of SSL models during pre-training, such as the loss, do not correlate well with downstream performance. Consequently, it is often difficult to gauge the final downstream performance in a cost efficient manner during pre-training. In this work, we propose unsupervised efficient methods that give insights into the quality of the pre-training of SSL speech models, namely, measuring the cluster quality and rank of the embeddings of the SSL model. Results show that measures of cluster quality and rank correlate better with downstream performance than the pre-training loss with only one hour of unlabeled audio, reducing the need for GPU hours and labeled data in SSL model evaluation.</description>

      <title>xLSTM-SENet: xLSTM for Single-Channel Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While attention-based architectures, such as Conformers, excel in speech enhancement, they face challenges such as scalability with respect to input sequence length. In contrast, the recently proposed Extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) architecture offers linear scalability. However, xLSTM-based models remain unexplored for speech enhancement. This paper introduces xLSTM-SENet, the first xLSTM-based single-channel speech enhancement system. A comparative analysis reveals that xLSTM-and notably, even LSTM-can match or outperform state-of-the-art Mamba- and Conformer-based systems across various model sizes in speech enhancement on the VoiceBank+Demand dataset. Through ablation studies, we identify key architectural design choices such as exponential gating and bidirectionality contributing to its effectiveness. Our best xLSTM-based model, xLSTM-SENet2, outperforms state-of-the-art Mamba- and Conformer-based systems on the Voicebank+DEMAND dataset.</description>

      <title>Modality-Invariant Bidirectional Temporal Representation Distillation Network for Missing Multimodal Sentiment Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) integrates diverse modalities(text, audio, and video) to comprehensively analyze and understand individuals' emotional states. However, the real-world prevalence of incomplete data poses significant challenges to MSA, mainly due to the randomness of modality missing. Moreover, the heterogeneity issue in multimodal data has yet to be effectively addressed. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the Modality-Invariant Bidirectional Temporal Representation Distillation Network (MITR-DNet) for Missing Multimodal Sentiment Analysis. MITR-DNet employs a distillation approach, wherein a complete modality teacher model guides a missing modality student model, ensuring robustness in the presence of modality missing. Simultaneously, we developed the Modality-Invariant Bidirectional Temporal Representation Learning Module (MIB-TRL) to mitigate heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>Mel-Spectrogram Inversion via Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Signal reconstruction from its mel-spectrogram is known as mel-spectrogram inversion and has many applications, including speech and foley sound synthesis. In this paper, we propose a mel-spectrogram inversion method based on a rigorous optimization algorithm. To reconstruct a time-domain signal with inverse short-time Fourier transform (STFT), both full-band STFT magnitude and phase should be predicted from a given mel-spectrogram. Their joint estimation has outperformed the cascaded full-band magnitude prediction and phase reconstruction by preventing error accumulation. However, the existing joint estimation method requires many iterations, and there remains room for performance improvement. We present an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based joint estimation method motivated by its success in various nonconvex optimization problems including phase reconstruction. An efficient update of each variable is derived by exploiting the conditional independence among the variables. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on speech and foley sounds.</description>

      <title>MacST: Multi-Accent Speech Synthesis via Text Transliteration for Accent Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In accented voice conversion or accent conversion, we seek to convert the accent in speech from one another while preserving speaker identity and semantic content. In this study, we formulate a novel method for creating multi-accented speech samples, thus pairs of accented speech samples by the same speaker, through text transliteration for training accent conversion systems. We begin by generating transliterated text with Large Language Models (LLMs), which is then fed into multilingual TTS models to synthesize accented English speech. As a reference system, we built a sequence-to-sequence model on the synthetic parallel corpus for accent conversion. We validated the proposed method for both native and non-native English speakers. Subjective and objective evaluations further validate our dataset's effectiveness in accent conversion studies.</description>

      <title>Takin-VC: Expressive Zero-Shot Voice Conversion via Adaptive Hybrid Content Encoding and Enhanced Timbre Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Expressive zero-shot voice conversion (VC) is a critical and challenging task that aims to transform the source timbre into an arbitrary unseen speaker while preserving the original content and expressive qualities. Despite recent progress in zero-shot VC, there remains considerable potential for improvements in speaker similarity and speech naturalness. Moreover, existing zero-shot VC systems struggle to fully reproduce paralinguistic information in highly expressive speech, such as breathing, crying, and emotional nuances, limiting their practical applicability. To address these issues, we propose Takin-VC, a novel expressive zero-shot VC framework via adaptive hybrid content encoding and memory-augmented context-aware timbre modeling. Specifically, we introduce an innovative hybrid content encoder that incorporates an adaptive fusion module, capable of effectively integrating quantized features of the pre-trained WavLM and HybridFormer in an implicit manner, so as to extract precise linguistic features while enriching paralinguistic elements. For timbre modeling, we propose advanced memory-augmented and context-aware modules to generate high-quality target timbre features and fused representations that seamlessly align source content with target timbre. To enhance real-time performance, we advocate a conditional flow matching model to reconstruct the Mel-spectrogram of the source speech. Experimental results show that our Takin-VC consistently surpasses state-of-the-art VC systems, achieving notable improvements in terms of speech naturalness, speech expressiveness, and speaker similarity, while offering enhanced inference speed.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Control of Emotion Rendering in Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emotional text-to-speech synthesis (TTS) aims to generate realistic emotional speech from input text. However, quantitatively controlling multi-level emotion rendering remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a diffusion-based emotional TTS framework with a novel approach for emotion intensity modeling to facilitate fine-grained control over emotion rendering at the phoneme, word, and utterance levels. We introduce a hierarchical emotion distribution (ED) extractor that captures a quantifiable ED embedding across different speech segment levels. Additionally, we explore various acoustic features and assess their impact on emotion intensity modeling. During TTS training, the hierarchical ED embedding effectively captures the variance in emotion intensity from the reference audio and correlates it with linguistic and speaker information. The TTS model not only generates emotional speech during inference, but also quantitatively controls the emotion rendering over the speech constituents. Both objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in terms of speech quality, emotional expressiveness, and hierarchical emotion control.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Based Audio Inpainting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15266v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Audio inpainting aims to reconstruct missing segments in corrupted recordings. Most of existing methods produce plausible reconstructions when the gap lengths are short, but struggle to reconstruct gaps larger than about 100 ms. This paper explores recent advancements in deep learning and, particularly, diffusion models, for the task of audio inpainting. The proposed method uses an unconditionally trained generative model, which can be conditioned in a zero-shot fashion for audio inpainting, and is able to regenerate gaps of any size. An improved deep neural network architecture based on the constant-Q transform, which allows the model to exploit pitch-equivariant symmetries in audio, is also presented. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated through objective and subjective metrics for the task of reconstructing short to mid-sized gaps, up to 300 ms. The results of a formal listening test show that the proposed method delivers comparable performance against the compared baselines for short gaps, such as 50 ms, while retaining a good audio quality and outperforming the baselines for wider gaps that are up to 300 ms long. The method presented in this paper can be applied to restoring sound recordings that suffer from severe local disturbances or dropouts, which must be reconstructed.</description>

      <title>Exploring Text-Queried Sound Event Detection with Audio Source Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In sound event detection (SED), overlapping sound events pose a significant challenge, as certain events can be easily masked by background noise or other events, resulting in poor detection performance. To address this issue, we propose the text-queried SED (TQ-SED) framework. Specifically, we first pre-train a language-queried audio source separation (LASS) model to separate the audio tracks corresponding to different events from the input audio. Then, multiple target SED branches are employed to detect individual events. AudioSep is a state-of-the-art LASS model, but has limitations in extracting dynamic audio information because of its pure convolutional structure for separation. To address this, we integrate a dual-path recurrent neural network block into the model. We refer to this structure as AudioSep-DP, which achieves the first place in DCASE 2024 Task 9 on language-queried audio source separation (objective single model track). Experimental results show that TQ-SED can significantly improve the SED performance, with an improvement of 7.22\% on F1 score over the conventional framework. Additionally, we setup comprehensive experiments to explore the impact of model complexity. The source code and pre-trained model are released at https://github.com/apple-yinhan/TQ-SED.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Audio Compression Through Entropy-Controlled Dithering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores entropy-controlled dithering techniques in audio compression, examining the application of standard and modified TPDFs, combined with noise shaping and entropy-controlled parameters, across various audio contexts, including pitch, loudness, rhythm, and instrumentation variations. Perceptual quality metrics such as VISQOL and STOI were used to evaluate performance. The results demonstrate that TPDF-based dithering consistently outperforms RPDF, particularly under optimal alpha conditions, while highlighting performance variability based on signal characteristics. These findings suggest the situational appropriateness of using various TPDF distributions. This work emphasizes the trade-off between entropy and perceptual fidelity, offering insights into the potential of entropy-controlled dithering as a foundation for enhanced audio compression algorithms. A practical implementation as a Digital Audio Workstation plugin introduces customizable dithering controls, laying the groundwork for future advancements in audio compression algorithms.</description>
