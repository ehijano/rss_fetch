      <title>Epitaxial Electrodeposition of Fe with Controlled In-Plane Variants for Reversible Metal Anode in Aqueous Electrolyte</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of reversible metal anodes is a key challenge for advancing aqueous battery technologies, particularly for scalable and safe stationary energy storage applications. Here we demonstrate a strategy to realize epitaxial electrodeposition of iron (Fe) on single-crystal copper (Cu) substrates in aqueous electrolytes. We compare the electrodeposition behavior of Fe on polycrystalline and single-crystalline Cu substrates, revealing that the latter enables highly uniform, dense, and crystallographically aligned Fe growth. Comprehensive electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis confirms the formation of Fe with specific out-of-plane and in-plane orientations, including well-defined rotational variants. Our findings highlight that epitaxial electrodeposition of Fe can suppress dendritic growth and significantly enhance Coulombic efficiency during plating/stripping cycles. This approach bridges fundamental crystallography with practical electrochemical performance, providing a pathway toward high-efficiency aqueous batteries utilizing Earth-abundant materials.</description>

      <title>Bond-resolved STM with density-based methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bond-resolved STM (BRSTM) is a recent technique that combines the advantages of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) with the outstanding intramolecular resolution provided by non-contact atomic force microscopy (ncAFM) using a CO-functionalized tips, offering unique insights into molecular interactions at surfaces. In this work, we present a novel and easily implementable approach for simulating BRSTM images, which we have applied to reproduce new experimental BRSTM data of Perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) on Ag(111), obtained with unprecedented control of tip-sample separation ($\sim$10~pm). Our method integrates the Full-Density-Based Model (FDBM) developed for High-Resolution Atomic Force Microscopy (HRAFM) with Chen's derivative approximation for tunneling channels, effectively capturing the contributions of both $\sigma$ and $\pi$ channels, while accounting for the CO-tip deflection induced by probe-sample interactions. This approach accurately reproduces the experimental results for both PTCDA/Ag(111) and 1,5,9-trioxo-13-azatriangulene (TOAT)/Cu(111) systems, including intricate tip-sample distance-dependent features. Furthermore, we also demonstrate the important role of substrate-induced effects, which can modify molecular orbital occupation and the relaxation of the CO probe, resulting in distinct BRSTM image characteristics.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy of Sm$^{3+}$ Ions in the C$_{\rm s}$ Symmetry Centres of Hydrothermally Prepared K$_2$YF$_5$ Microcrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the synthesis and spectroscopic characterization of Sm$^{3+}$-doped K$_2$YF$_5$ microparticles. The particles were synthesized via the hydrothermal technique, yielding a particle size of approximately 20 $\mu$m in length. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses confirmed their orthorhombic crystal structure. A combination of absorption and laser excited fluorescence performed on samples cooled to 10~K, allow for the determination of {56} experimental crystal-field levels. A parametrised crystal-field analysis for Sm$^{3+}$ in the C$_{\rm s}$ point group symmetry centres of K$_2$YF$_5$ yields good approximation to the data.</description>

      <title>Thermal transport in GaN/AlN HEMTs on 4H-SiC: Role of layer thickness and hetero-interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal transport in high-electron-mobility-transistor (HEMT) structures grown on 4H-SiC substrates by metalorganic-vapour-phase epitaxy (MOCVD) is systematically investigated. The thermal conductivity of the GaN channel and AlN buffer layers is measured by thermoreflectance (TTR). A pronounced thickness dependence of thermal conductivity as a result of phonon-boundary scattering is observed at low temperatures, while this effect becomes significantly weaker at elevated temperatures. The thermal boundary resistance (TBR) at the AlN/4H-SiC and GaN/AlN interfaces is also examined, showing a substantial reduction and eventual saturation with increasing temperature, indicating elastic phonon transport as the dominant mechanism. Reliable simulations of the temperature profile across the structures based on the measured thermal metrics highlight the critical role of TBR in thin-channel device and the advantage of thicker channel and buffer layers for efficient heat dissipation in the HEMTs.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a technique for partitioning the total energy from a semi-local density functional theory calculation into contributions from individual electronic states in a localized Wannier basis. We use our technique to reveal the key role played by the $s$ and $p$ orbitals of the apical oxygen atoms in a curious elastic anomaly exhibited by ferroelectric PbTiO$_3$ under applied stress, which has so far gone unexplained. Our technique enables new insights into the chemical origins of the mechanical properties of materials, or any property given by an energy derivative.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Intricacies of Self-Healing in Halide Perovskite-Charge Transport Layer Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stability and performance of halide perovskite photovoltaic devices are critically limited by progressive defect generation and associated local non-radiative losses during operation. Self-healing of defects provides a promising pathway to prolong device functionality, yet the underlying microscopic mechanisms remain poorly understood, particularly the role of interfacial chemistry on trap dynamics and healing kinetics. Here, we elucidate self-healing and defect evolution in triple-cation mixed halide (TCMH) perovskite films and their device-relevant charge transport layer heterostructures subjected to photo-induced damage. Using correlation clustering imaging (CLIM), our recently developed local functional imaging tool, we map spatiotemporal photoluminescence heterogeneity to track defect dynamics in pristine and heterostructure films. The defect healing follows bi-phasic kinetics, with an initial electronic relaxation (tens of minutes) and a subsequent slower phase (~ hours) associated to ionic and lattice rearrangement. Most importantly, our results demonstrate that the chemical nature of charge-transport layers modulates trap activity, healing kinetics, and halide redistribution, with heterostructures exhibiting faster recovery than pristine films, a boon for device resilience. These findings provide new insights into the dynamic interaction between defects, interfaces, and ion migration, and establish a framework for rational design of durable, next-generation perovskite optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>The Comparison of Colloidal PbS QD Photoconductors and Hybrid Phototransistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simplicity in the fabrication of photoconductors makes them a valuable choice to investigate optoelectronic properties of colloidal quantum dot (cQD) films. Lateral photoconductors generally require a large size, in the mm2, and are limited in operation speed due to the presence of trapping sites. In contrast, hybrid phototransistors are fabricated in the um2 scale and benefit from such trapping sites, allowing the measurement of low light levels in the nW/cm2. The question, however, arises whether high responsivity values are required for the detection of low light levels or the compatible detectivity of photoconductors is sufficient. Here, we directly compare photoconductors and hybrid phototransistors with an identical EDT-treated PbS cQD film. We highlight that a comparable D* is not enough for the purpose of measuring low light levels, as the resulting photocurrents need to be readily accessible. Furthermore, we also showcase temperature-activated photocurrent dynamics resulting in a negative photocurrent (NPC) effect. This NPC simultaneously improves the frequency bandwidth and photocurrent, enabling operation speeds up to 100 kHz.</description>

      <title>Metalorganic Chemical Vapor Deposition of AlScN Thin Films and AlScN/AlN/GaN Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AlScN thin films were grown via metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), showing controllable incorporation of scandium (Sc) into the AlN lattices. Systematic variation of growth parameters demonstrated an obvious influence on Sc incorporation, with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis indicating Sc composition up to $\sim$13\% when (MCp)$_2$ScCl was used as the precursor. AlScN/AlN/GaN heterostructures grown on GaN templates exhibited the formation of a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) channel at the AlScN/AlN--GaN interface, confirming their potential use in high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) device technologies. Variation in AlScN/AlN barrier thickness within the heterostructures showed that thicker barriers yield higher sheet charge densities from both Hall and capacitance-voltage (C--V) measurements. With an AlScN/AlN barrier thickness of $\sim$30~nm, a sheet charge density of $5.22\times10^{12}$~cm$^{-2}$ was extracted from C--V. High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (S/TEM) further confirmed Sc incorporation and revealed the wurtzite crystalline structure of the films and heterostructures. These results establish MOCVD growth of AlScN as a promising and compatible material for advancing III-nitride heterostructures in high-performance electronics and potentially ferroelectrics.</description>

      <title>Chern-Selective multi-valley Flat Bands in Twisted Mono-Bilayer and Mono-Trilayer MoTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between moir\'e flat bands originating from different valleys can give rise to a variety of exotic quantum phases. In this work, we investigate the electronic properties of twisted mono-bilayer (A-AB) and mono-trilayer (A-ABA) MoTe$_2$ using first-principles calculations and continuum models. Unlike previous studies on twisted bilayer systems, in which low-energy flat bands originate solely from the $K/K'$ valleys, in A-AB and A-ABA twisted MoTe$_2$ (\tmt) the moir\'e bands at low energies arise from both the $\Gamma$ and $K/K'$ valleys, with spin Chern numbers $C_s=0$ (for $\Gamma$) and $C_{\uparrow/\downarrow}=\pm1$ (for $K/K'$), respectively. We show that the multi-valley moir\'e flat bands are governed by interlayer-hybridization effects, and that different stacking configurations and thicknesses tune the relative energy alignment between the $\Gamma$ and $K$ valley moir\'e flat bands. By constructing valley-resolved continuum models and performing Wannierization for the low-energy moir\'e bands, we further uncover that the Berry curvature and quantum metric distributions can be effectively tuned by the layer number and stacking configuration. Unlike other moir\'e systems, where only one kind of valley influenced the low energy physics, the simultaneous appearance of two distinct types of valleys, with different symmetries, establish A-AB and A-ABA \tmt\ as ideal platforms for studying layer-controlled multi-valley physics.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale surface morphology controls charge storage at stepped Pt-water interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Platinum step edges dominate electrocatalytic activity in fuel cells and electrolysers, yet their atomistic electrochemical behaviour remains poorly understood. Here, we employ \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics under controlled electrode potentials to model a realistic stepped Pt--water interface incorporating experimentally observed (111)$\times$(111) and (111)$\times$(100) edge motifs. This allows us to resolve, for the first time, the site-specific structure, charge distribution, and electrostatics of the electric double layer at a nanostructured Pt surface. We find that differential capacitance near the potential of zero charge (PZC) arises almost entirely from potential-dependent chemisorption of water on flat (111) terraces. In contrast, step edges are saturated with chemisorbed water even below the PZC and thus do not contribute to the capacitance. Instead, edges accumulate excess positive charge and exhibit a locally elevated electrostatic potential, as revealed by spatially resolved macroscopic potential profiles. This electrostatic asymmetry implies a greater barrier for electron accumulation at step sites compared to terraces, consistent with enhanced charge localisation and reactivity. Finally, the higher-in-energy d-band centre and sharper projected density of states at edge atoms further support their role as active, positively charged centres. Together, these results provide a mechanistic explanation for the observed experimental shift of the PZC with step density and establish a predictive framework for understanding and optimising interfacial charging in nanostructured Pt electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Determination of Site-Selective Ligand Binding on Single Anisotropic Nanocrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organic surface ligands are integral components of nanocrystals and nanoparticles that have a strong influence on their physicochemical properties, their interaction with the environment, and their ability to self-assemble and order into higher-order structures. These hybrid nanomaterials are tunable with applications in catalysis, directed self-assembly, next-generation optoelectronics, and chemical and quantum sensing. Critically, future advances depend on our ability to rationally engineer their surface chemistry. However, fundamental knowledge of ligand-nanoparticle behavior is limited by uncertainty in where and how these ligands bind to surfaces. For nanoparticles, in particular, few characterization techniques offer both the high spatial resolution and the precise chemical mapping needed to identify specific ligand binding sites. In this study, we utilized synchrotron infrared nanospectroscopy (SINS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) together with first-principles computer simulations to validate the site-selective adsorption of organic ligands on a shaped nanocrystal surface. Specifically, we demonstrate that the sterically encumbered isocyanide ligands (CNAr^{Mes2}) preferentially bind to the high curvature features of Ag nanocubes (NCs), where low-coordinate Ag atoms are present. In contrast, isocyanide ligands that do not exhibit these steric properties show no surface selectivity. SINS serves as an effective tool to validate these surface binding interactions at the near-single molecule level. These results indicate that steric effects can be successfully harnessed to design bespoke organic ligands for fine-tuning nanocrystal surface chemistry and the properties of the nanocrystal ligand shell.</description>

      <title>Room temperature control of axial and basal antiferromagnetic anisotropies using strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic materials are promising platforms for the development of ultra-fast spintronics and magnonics due to their robust magnetism, high-frequency relativistic dynamics, low-loss transport, and the ability to support topological textures. However, achieving deterministic control over antiferromagnetic order in thin films is a major challenge, due to the formation of multi-domain states stabilised by competing magnetic and destressing interactions. Thus, the successful implementation of antiferromagnetic materials necessitates careful engineering of their anisotropy. Here, we demonstrate strain-based robust control over multiple antiferromagnetic anisotropies and nanoscale domains in the promising spintronic candidate a-Fe2O3, at room temperature. By applying isotropic and anisotropic in-plane strains across a broad temperature-strain phase space, we systematically tune the interplay between magneto-crystalline and magneto-elastic interactions. We discover that strain-driven control steers the system towards an aligned antiferromagnetic state, whilst preserving topological spin textures, such as merons, antimerons and bimerons. We directly map the nanoscale antiferromagnetic order using linear dichroic scanning transmission X-ray microscopy integrated with in situ strain and temperature control. A Landau model and micromagnetic simulations reveal how strain reshapes the magnetic energy landscape. These findings suggest that strain could serve as a versatile control mechanism to reconfigure equilibrium or dynamic antiferromagnetic states on demand in a-Fe2O3, paving the way for next-generation spintronic and magnonic devices.</description>

      <title>Generative Diffusion Model DiffCrysGen Discovers Rare Earth-Free Magnetic Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient exploration of the vast chemical space is a fundamental challenge in materials discovery, particularly for designing functional inorganic crystalline materials with targeted properties. Diffusion-based generative models have emerged as a powerful route, but most existing approaches require domain-specific constraints and separate diffusion processes for atom types, atomic positions, and lattice parameters, adding complexity and limiting efficiency. Here, we present DiffCrysGen, a fully data-driven, score-based diffusion model that generates complete crystal structures in a single, end-to-end diffusion process. This unified framework simplifies the model architecture and accelerates sampling by two to three orders of magnitude compared to existing methods without compromising chemical and structural diversity of the generated materials. In order to demonstrate the efficacy of DiffCrysGen in generating valid and useful materials, using density functional theory (DFT), we validate a number of newly generated rare earth-free magnetic materials that are energetically and dynamically stable, and are potentially synthesizable. These include ferromagnets with high saturation magnetization and large magnetocrystalline anisotropy, as also metallic antiferromagnets. These results establish DiffCrysGen as a general platform for accelerated functional materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Two-Dimensional Altermagnetism in Epitaxial CrSb Ultrathin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets constitute an emerging class of collinear magnets that exhibit zero net magnetization yet host spin-split electronic bands arising from non-relativistic spin-space-group symmetries. Realization of altermagnetism in the two-dimensional (2D) limit remains an outstanding challenge because dimensional reduction suppresses kZ dispersion and destabilizes the symmetry operations essential for spin compensation. Here, we demonstrate genuine 2D altermagnetism in epitaxial unit-cell-thin films of CrSb grown on Bi2Te3. It reveals a thickness-driven transition from a ferrimagnetic state in 1-unit-cell films to an altermagnetic state above a critical thickness of 7/4 unit cell. The transition originates from interfacial symmetry breaking at the Cr-terminated layer that induces local moment imbalance. With increasing thickness the key spin-space-group symmetries [C2||C6Zt] and [C2||MZ] restores, which leads to altermagnetism with zero net magnetization and momentum-dependent spin splitting. Our results provide the first experimental realization of altermagnetism in the 2D regime and establish a route for integrating stray-field-free spin order into nanoscale spintronic architectures.</description>

      <title>Controlling Magnetism in the 2D van der Waals Antiferromagnet CrPS$_4$ via Ion Intercalation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) magnetic materials are versatile platforms for tailoring electronic and magnetic properties, in which the insertion of chemical species into their interlayer gaps offers a powerful route to engineer magnetism. Here, we focus on the A-type antiferromagnetic semiconductor CrPS$_4$ (T$_N$ = 38 K) and investigate its electronic and magnetic properties upon intercalation of lithium (Li$^+$) and organic tetrabutylammonium (TBA$^+$) ions using first-principles calculations. Our results show that Li$^+$ incorporation induces a semiconductor-to-metal transition in CrPS$_4$ and selectively modifies its magnetic behaviour: switching from out-of-plane to in-plane antiferromagnetism, followed by an in-plane ferromagnetic ground state at higher intercalation levels. This is accompanied by a continuous increase of the ordering temperature, reaching a fivefold enhancement for Li$_{0.5}$CrPS$_4$. Similarly, TBA$^+$ intercalation expands the vdW gap, decoupling CrPS$_4$ layers and stabilising in-plane ferromagnetism with a T$_C$ above 100 K. Furthermore, it also modifies magnon propagation, leading to enhanced group velocities and a more isotropic magnon transport. This work highlights intercalation as a powerful and versatile approach for controlling magnetic behaviour and spin dynamics, paving the way for the design of tunable 2D layered magnetic materials for spintronic and magnonic applications.</description>

      <title>Defect Passivation and F\"orster-Type Energy Exchange in H2Pc-TMD Organic-Inorganic Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organic - inorganic heterostructures (HS) combine the strong light absorption and exciton generation capabilities of organic molecules with the unique excitonic properties of layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), where the interfacial band alignment dictates the optical response. In this work, we investigate the influence of H2Pc molecules on CVD-grown MoS2 and WS2 monolayers using correlative microscopy techniques - Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM), photoluminescence (PL), and Raman spectroscopy. Comprehensive analysis of both electronic and optical properties provides detailed insights into the energy band alignment in these two HS. Despite their similar band alignments, the heterostructures exhibit strikingly different optical signatures. In the case of H2Pc/MoS2 HS, the effect of defect healing is more pronounced, while for the H2Pc/WS2 HS, strong indications of F\"orster energy transfer are observed. These findings highlight the critical role of transition dipole moment in addition to spectral overlap between donor emission and acceptor absorption in the design of optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Self-attention enabled quantum path analysis of high-harmonic generation in solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12443v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-harmonic generation (HHG) in solids provides a powerful platform to probe ultrafast electron dynamics and interband--intraband coupling. However, disentangling the complex many-body contributions in the HHG spectrum remains challenging. Here we introduce a machine-learning approach based on a Transformer encoder to analyze and reconstruct HHG signals computed from a one-dimensional Kronig--Penney model. The self-attention mechanism inherently highlights correlations between temporal dipole dynamics and high-frequency spectral components, allowing us to identify signatures of nonadiabatic band coupling that are otherwise obscured in standard Fourier analysis. By combining attention maps with Gabor time--frequency analysis, we extract and amplify weak coupling channels that contribute to even-order harmonics and anomalous spectral features. Our results demonstrate that multi-head self-attention acts as a selective filter for strong-coupling events in the time domain, enabling a physics-informed interpretation of high-dimensional quantum dynamics. This work establishes Transformer-based attention as a versatile tool for solid-state strong-field physics, opening new possibilities for interpretable machine learning in attosecond spectroscopy and nonlinear photonics.</description>

      <title>Two-Dimensional Na2LiAlP2 crystal for high-performance field-effect transistors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-performance, low-power transistors are core components of advanced integrated circuits, and the ultimate limitation of Moore's law has made the search for new alternative pathways an urgent priority. Two-dimensional (2D) materials have become the most promising exploration target due to their exceptional electronic properties and scalability. In this work, we conducted device transport research on the previously proposed 2D quaternary semiconductor Na2LiAlP2 using the non-equilibrium Green's function method. The results demonstrate that even with a channel length of 5.7 nm, Na2LiAlP2 still exhibits excellent n-type transistor characteristics, fully meeting and surpassing the technical specifications outlined in the International Roadmap for Devices and Systems (IRDS). Encouragingly, the device can easily achieve the required on-state current of 900 {\mu}A/{\mu}m under low operating voltages of 0.1 V and 0.2 V. Moreover, at 0.1 V operating voltage, the device's subthreshold swing breaks through the theoretical limit of 60 mV/dec, reaching an astonishing value 30.33 mV/dec. Additionally, its p-type transistor performance also stands out with a subthreshold swing of ~50 mV/dec when the channel length is 7.9 nm. Our research not only showcases the exceptional transistor properties of Na2LiAlP2 but also further expands the research scope of 2D high-performance transistors.</description>

      <title>Anharmonic Effects in Ge2Sb2Te5 and Consequences on Thermodynamic Stability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chalcogenide materials are an important class of phase change material (PCMs) owing to their employment in digital memory solutions. Chalgogenide materials have applications in phase change random access memory (PCRAM) due to their ability to reversibly cycle between crystalline and amorphous states, and of these materials Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST) is of particular interest due to its speed, stability and low crystallisation temperatures. GST possesses two stable crystalline polymorphs, cubic and hexagonal (trigonal system). Studies show that phenomena such as heat transport and thermal lattice expansion drive the phase-change nature of these materials. These phenomena are not incorporated in the harmonic approximation, which is a popular model for describing vibrations in solids. Through ab initio density functional theory (DFT), we computationally investigate the anharmonic behaviour of pristine GST, without vacancies or defects, while considering the various stacking models that exist and inclusion of van der Waals (vdW) interactions in our modelling. We present the vibrational analysis of different stacking models in GST; Petrov and Kooi-De Hosson (KDH) models and the quantification anharmonic behaviour. Our results demonstrate the importance of incorporating anharmonic and dispersion effects when modelling GST, especially in the choice of stacking models, along with implications for phenomena relating to phase-change behaviour.</description>

      <title>Escape-Induced Temporally Correlated Noise Driven Universality Crossover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Universal behavior in far-from-equilibrium systems is driven by interactions between transport processes and noise structure. The Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) framework predicts that extensions incorporating conserved currents or temporally correlated noise give rise to distinct growth morphologies and universality classes, yet direct experimental realization has remained elusive. Here, we report atomically resolved Sn thin-film growth on Sb-doped MnBi$_2$Te$_4$, revealing a sharp dynamical crossover between two fundamentally different regimes. Early stage growth follows conserved KPZ scaling, forming two-dimensional islands and stanene layers. Beyond a critical deposition time, temporally correlated noise dominates, driving the nucleation of $\alpha$ -Sn clusters, their evolution into faceted grains, and coexistence with faceted $\beta$-Sn. Molecular dynamics simulation and Auger electron spectroscopy show adatom escape as the microscopic origin of temporally correlated noise, providing a microscopic mechanism for the universality crossover. These findings establish, for the first time, that temporal noise correlations can fundamentally alter the scaling class of a growing interface, linking atomistic kinetics to emergent universal behavior.</description>

      <title>Formation of C-centers in Si-based systems by light ion irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic-scale crystal defects in Si are quantum-light sources offering tantalizing integration with existing photonic technologies. Yet, the controlled creation of near-infrared color centers for long- haul quantum communication and information still remains a challenge. In this work, we utilize light ions, such as H+ and He+, to gently generate quantum emitters in a crystalline Si matrix. Temperature-dependent photoluminescence measurements demonstrate the presence of optically-active defects, whose fluorescence matches the primary telecom window around 1550 nm. In addition, time-resolved investigations unveil long-lived excitonic states in the {\mu}s regime, thus confirming the formation of interstitial oxygen-carbon complexes, termed C-centers. Finally, we explored controlled ion irradiation strategies to seamlessly generate C-centers also in Ge-on-Si heterostructures, which offer an advanced technological platform for the future realization of integrated quantum photonics. This analysis, informed by practical color center synthesis and proof-of-principle experiments in epitaxial architectures, indicates intriguing prospects and profitable strategies to advance the burgeoning field of light-based quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Oxygen-vacancy-induced Raman softening in the catalyst Fe$_2$(MoO$_4$)$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although iron molybdate (Fe$_2$(MoO$_4$)$_3$) has been commercially utilized for the production of formaldehyde from methanol via oxidative dehydrogenation, the detailed mechanism during the catalytic process remains unclear. Recent operando Raman and impedance measurements of the reaction suggested that the bulk region of Fe$_2$(MoO$_4$)$_3$ acts as a reservoir of oxygen atoms that can migrate to the surface to participate in catalysis. This conclusion was drawn from the observed significant reduction in Raman intensity during the catalytic process which implies the formation of atomic defects. However, the microscopic origin of this reduction remains to be clarified. In this work, we performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations to elucidate the origin of the experimentally observed Raman intensity variation. Our phonon analysis reveals that oxygen-dominated vibrational modes, with a small Mo contribution, occur near 782 cm$^{-1}$-the same frequency region where the Raman intensity reduction was measured. Using an effective frozen-phonon approach, we further demonstrate that oxygen vibrations are primarily responsible for the decrease in calculated Raman intensity. Moreover, structural relaxation of Fe$_2$(MoO$_4$)$_3$ including an oxygen vacancy suggests that oxygen diffusion from the bulk to the surface should occur without significant alteration of the local symmetry, consistent with the absence of measurable peak shifts or broadening in the experimental Raman spectra.</description>

      <title>Two-Dimensional Altermagnetic Iron Oxyhalides: Real Chern topology and Valley-Spin-Lattice coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12748v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets, a novel class of collinear magnetic materials, exhibit unique spin-split band structures, yet topological insulating states in intrinsic altermagnetic systems are rare. Here, we identify monolayer Fe$_2X_2$O ($X$ = Cl, Br, I) as a new family of 2D altermagnetic real Chern insulators. These materials display robust $d$-wave altermagnetic ordering, semiconducting band gaps, and nontrivial real Chern numbers per spin channel, yielding spin-polarized topological corner modes. They also feature spin-polarized valleys with strong altermagnetism-valley-spin-lattice coupling, enabling valley-selective excitation via linear dichroism and strain-induced valley polarization. In multiferroic Fe$_2$Cl$_2$O, magnetism coexists with ferroelasticity, and an applied strain can switche the N\'eel vector. These findings position 2D iron oxyhalides as a promising platform for exploring altermagnetism and magnetic topological states for spintronics and valleytronics.</description>

      <title>Multi-objective Bayesian Optimization with Human-in-the-Loop for Flexible Neuromorphic Electronics Fabrication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing hardware enables edge computing and can be implemented in flexible electronics for novel applications. Metal oxide materials are promising candidates for fabricating flexible neuromorphic electronics, but suffer from processing constraints due to the incompatibilities between oxides and polymer substrates. In this work, we use photonic curing to fabricate flexible metal-insulator-metal capacitors with solution-processible aluminum oxide dielectric tailored for neuromorphic applications. Because photonic curing outcomes depend on many input parameters, identifying an optimal processing condition through a traditional grid-search approach is unfeasible. Here, we apply multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) to determine photonic curing conditions that optimize the trade-off between desired electrical properties of large capacitance-frequency dispersion and low leakage current. Furthermore, we develop a human-in-the-loop (HITL) framework for incorporating failed experiments into the MOBO machine learning workflow, demonstrating that this framework accelerates optimization by reducing the number of experimental rounds required. Once optimization is concluded, we analyze different Pareto-optimal conditions to tune the dielectrics properties and provide insight into the importance of different inputs through Shapley Additive exPlanations analysis. The demonstrated framework of combining MOBO with HITL feedback can be adapted to a wide range of multi-objective experimental problems that have interconnected inputs and high experimental failure rates to generate usable results for machine learning models.</description>

      <title>Wireless Sensing of Temperature, Strain and Crack Growth in 3D-Printed Metal Structures via Magnetoelastic and Thermomagnetic Inclusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we demonstrate the first realization of wireless strain and temperature sensing within 3D-printed metallic structures using standard electromagnetic inspection hardware. This establishes a path toward need-based parts maintenance driven by accurate damage assessments instead of relying on regularly scheduled maintenance teardowns, extending the service intervals of structures operating in harsh environments. To this end, we encapsulate magnetoelastic and thermomagnetic materials inside microtubes and embed the sensing elements during additive manufacturing. Mechanical and thermal stimuli affect the magnetic permeability of the embedded materials, which modulates the impedance of a coil placed on or near the surface of the printed part. We demonstrate strain sensing accurate to +/-27x10-6 over at least a 6x10-4 strain range, and temperature sensing accurate to +/-0.75oC over a 70oC range, both to a 95% confidence interval. We highlight these sensors' capabilities by detecting the onset of plasticity and fatigue-driven crack growth thousands of cycles before critical failure. This extends non-destructive eddy-current damage detection to accurate, real-time strain and temperature monitoring within metallic structures.</description>

      <title>Advanced creep modelling for polymers: A variable-order fractional calculus approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polymer-based plastics exhibit time-dependent deformation under constant stress, known as creep, which can lead to rupture or static fatigue. A common misconception is that materials under tolerable static loads remain unaffected over time. Accurate long-term deformation predictions require experimental creep data, but conventional models based on simple rheological elements like springs and dampers often fall short, lacking the flexibility to capture the power-law behaviour intrinsic to creep processes. The springpot, a fractional calculus-based element, has been used to provide a power-law relationship; however, its fixed-order nature limits its accuracy, particularly when the deformation rate evolves over time. This article introduces a variable-order (VO) springpot model that dynamically adapts to the evolving viscoelastic properties of polymeric materials during creep, capturing changes between glassy, transition and rubbery phases. Model parameters are calibrated using a robust procedure for model identification based on the cross-entropy (CE) method, resulting in physically consistent and accurate predictions. This advanced modelling framework not only overcomes the limitations of the fixed-order models but also establishes a foundation for applying VO mechanics to other viscoelastic materials, providing a valuable tool for predicting long-term material performance in structural applications.</description>

Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy centers in nanodiamond offer a microwave-free, noninvasive platform for probing superconductors via near zero-field cross-relaxation magnetometry. We demonstrate this by depositing nanodiamonds on YBCO thin films to measure critical parameters: transition temperature and penetration field. This method leverages nanodiamond fluorescence modulation as a result of magnetic field variation with 1mT amplitude to observe the Meissner effect and field scans to measure the penetration field. The approach is minimally invasive and can be applied to superconducting samples with rough surfaces, facilitating the study of flux vortices and critical phenomena in complex geometries.</description>

      <title>Quantification of Electrolyte Degradation in Lithium-ion Batteries with Neutron Imaging Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-destructive characterization of lithium-ion batteries provides critical insights for optimizing performance and lifespan while preserving structural integrity. Optimizing electrolyte design in commercial LIBs requires consideration of composition, electrolyte-to-capacity ratio, spatial distribution, and associated degradation pathways. However, existing non-destructive methods for studying electrolyte infiltration, distribution, and degradation in LIBs lack the spatiotemporal resolution required for precise observation and quantification of the electrolyte. In this study, we employ neutron imaging with sufficient spatial resolution ~150 um and large field of view 20x20 cm2 to quantitatively resolve the electrolyte inventory and distribution within LiFePO4/graphite pouch cells under high-temperature accelerated aging. Quantitative standard curves based on neutron transmission attenuation reveal a clear electrolyte dry-out threshold at 3.18 g Ah-1 and the two stages evolutions of EI during cell aging were quantified. By integrating non-destructive electrochemical diagnostics, accelerated graphite material loss and liquid phase Li+ diffusion degradation is observed during pore-drying. Further analysis, including operando cyclic aging, reveals that the neutron transmission below the saturation reference is due to the enrichment of hydrogen nuclei within the solid-electrolyte interphase. Assumed pore-drying does not occur, the SEI signal of the electrodes can be quantitatively decoupled during ageing. Combined analyses with NI, TOF-SIMS, and SEM reveal that high EI cells exhibit uniform SEI growth and reduced degradation, while low EI cells show uneven SEI formation, accelerating capacity loss. This study unveils a dynamic electrolyte infiltration-consumption-dry-out process in LIBs, offering non-destructive and quantitative insights to guide sustainable and durable battery development.</description>

      <title>ToPolyAgent: AI Agents for Coarse-Grained Topological Polymer Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce ToPolyAgent, a multi-agent AI framework for performing coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of topological polymers through natural language instructions. By integrating large language models (LLMs) with domain-specific computational tools, ToPolyAgent supports both interactive and autonomous simulation workflows across diverse polymer architectures, including linear, ring, brush, and star polymers, as well as dendrimers. The system consists of four LLM-powered agents: a Config Agent for generating initial polymer-solvent configurations, a Simulation Agent for executing LAMMPS-based MD simulations and conformational analyses, a Report Agent for compiling markdown reports, and a Workflow Agent for streamlined autonomous operations. Interactive mode incorporates user feedback loops for iterative refinements, while autonomous mode enables end-to-end task execution from detailed prompts. We demonstrate ToPolyAgent's versatility through case studies involving diverse polymer architectures under varying solvent condition, thermostats, and simulation lengths. Furthermore, we highlight its potential as a research assistant by directing it to investigate the effect of interaction parameters on the linear polymer conformation, and the influence of grafting density on the persistence length of the brush polymer. By coupling natural language interfaces with rigorous simulation tools, ToPolyAgent lowers barriers to complex computational workflows and advances AI-driven materials discovery in polymer science. It lays the foundation for autonomous and extensible multi-agent scientific research ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Trembling motion of electrons driven by Larmor spin precession</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the initialization of an ensemble of electrons in the same spin state in strained n-InGaAs subject to a perpendicular magnetic field triggers an AC electric current at GHz frequencies. The AC current emerges in the absence of any driving force and survives until the coherent precession of the electron spins is lost. The current amplitude increases linearly with both the spin-orbit coupling strength and the external magnetic field. The generation mechanism of the observed oscillatory charge motion can be fruitfully described in terms of the periodic trembling motion of spin-polarized electrons, which is a solid-state analog to the Zitterbewegung of free Dirac electrons. Our results demonstrate that the hidden consequence of relativistic quantum mechanics is realized and can be studied in a rather simple solid-state system at moderate temperatures. Furthermore, the large amplitude of the AC current at high magnetic fields enables ultra-fast spin sensitive electric read-out in solids.</description>

      <title>Continuous Uniqueness and Novelty Metrics for Generative Modeling of Inorganic Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To address pressing scientific challenges such as climate change, increasingly sophisticated generative artificial intelligence models are being developed that can efficiently sample the large chemical space of possible functional materials. These models can quickly sample new chemical compositions paired with crystal structures. They are typically evaluated using uniqueness and novelty metrics, which depend on a chosen crystal distance function. However, the most prevalent distance function has four limitations: it fails to quantify the degree of similarity between compounds, cannot distinguish compositional difference and structural difference, lacks Lipschitz continuity against shifts in atomic coordinates, and results in a uniqueness metric that is not invariant against the permutation of generated samples. In this work, we propose using two continuous distance functions to evaluate uniqueness and novelty, which theoretically overcome these limitations. Our experiments show that these distances reveal insights missed by traditional distance functions, providing a more reliable basis for evaluating and comparing generative models for inorganic crystals.</description>

      <title>Lattice Instabilities Along the Transformation from Hexagonal to Cuboidal Structures in Hard- and Soft-Sphere Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09635v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The diffusionless Burgers-Bain phase transition from a hcp arrangement to a cuboidal lattice (fcc and bcc) is analysed in great detail for Lennard-Jones solids. From the lattice vectors of an underlying bi-lattice smoothly connecting these phases, we are able to express the corresponding lattice sums for inverse power potentials in terms of fast converging Bessel function expansions resulting in an efficient evaluation to computer accuracy for cohesive energies. From the kissing hard-sphere limit we derive exact analytical expressions for the lattice parameters varying along the minimum energy path of the phase transition. This simple model suggests that for the Burgers-Bain transformation of a LJ solid requires a minimum of four lattice parameters, $(a,\alpha,\beta,\gamma=c/a)$, describing the change in the base lattice lengths $a$ and $c$, the shear force acting on the hexagonal base plane ($\alpha$), the sliding force of the middle layer of the original hexagonal packing arrangement($\beta$), and the cuboidal transformation ($\gamma=c/a$). This choice results in a two-step process: hcp$\to$fcc$\to$bcc. However, a further extension of the parameter space including an additional slide parameter for the middle layer, one suddenly observes a distinct symmetry-breaking effect along the hcp$\rightarrow$fcc transition path with a bifurcation point appearing joining the original Burgers with the Bain path of the bcc$\rightarrow$fcc cuboidal transition. Furthermore, for soft LJ potentials the bcc phase appears as a local minimum along the Burgers hcp$\rightarrow$fcc path with two transition states to either the hcp or fcc phase. The underlying topology of the Burgers-Bain phase transition also incorporates the rhombohedral distortion of the bcc phase, which is analyzed in detail.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic probe of ultrafast magnetization dynamics in the extreme ultraviolet spectral range</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18312v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of spectroscopic techniques in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) spectral range has significantly advanced the understanding of ultrafast interactions in magnetic systems triggered by optical excitation. In this work, we introduce a previously missing geometry that facilitates the observation of the ultrafast magnetization dynamics of magnetic systems with an out-of-plane magnetization grown on XUV opaque substrates. This approach to probing ultrafast magnetization dynamics combines the magneto-optical Kerr effect with the strong dependence of a sample's reflectance near its Brewster angle. It therefore works with linearly polarized light and does not require any additional polarizing optics. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the technique by presenting both simulations and experimental data as a function of the energy and the polarization of the XUV probe radiation as well as of the delay time after optical excitation.</description>

      <title>Record negative photoconductivity in N-polar AlGaN/GaN quantum-well heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The AlGaN/GaN quantum-well heterostructures typically exhibit a positive photoconductivity (PPC) during the light illumination. Surprisingly, we found that introducing the GaN/AlN superlattice (SL) back barrier into N-polar AlGaN/GaN quantum-well heterostructures induces a transition in these heterostructures from PPC to negativie photoconductivity (NPC) as the SL period number increased at room temperature. This transition occurred under an infrared light illumination and can be well explained in terms of the excitation of hot electrons from the two-dimensional electron gas and subsequent trapping them in a SL structure. The NPC effect observed in N-polar AlGaN/GaN heterostructures with SL back barrier exhibits photoconductivity yield exceeding 85 % and thus is the largest ones reported so far for semiconductors. In addition, NPC signal remains relatively stable at high temperatures up to 400 K. The obtained results can be interesting for the development of NPC related devices such as photoelectric logic gates, photoelectronic memory and infrared photodetectors.</description>

      <title>Theoretical approaches to Fr\"ohlich excitonic polarons in polar semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Short abstract: The paper reviews the physics of Fr\"ohlich excitonic polarons from the viewpoint of empirical approaches with some original developments. Models for excitonic polarons in ionic semiconductors in the spirit of the Lee Low and Pines (LLP) model for free polarons were initiated by Toyozawa and Hermanson and extended by Pollman and Buttner (PB). The dominant electron-hole interaction with the lattice introduced by Frohlich is represented by a long-range effective interaction with a single longitudinal optical polar mode. The properties of the excitonic polarons are characterized by various physical quantities such as effective dielectric constants, effective masses, virtual phonon populations, carrier self-energies and binding energies, and effective electron-hole interactions mediated by the lattice. In 3D perovskites, the excitonic polarons deviate from the simplified picture of weakly interacting (almost free) polarons, with sizeable effects of electron-hole correlations on all the physical properties.</description>

      <title>Beyond-quasiparticle transport with vertex correction: self-consistent ladder formalism for electron-phonon interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a self-consistent many-body framework for computing phonon-limited electronic transport from first principles, incorporating both beyond-quasiparticle effects and vertex corrections. Using the recently developed first-principles scGD0 method, we calculate spectral functions with nonperturbative effects such as broadening, satellites, and energy-dependent renormalization. We show that the scGD0 spectral functions outperform one-shot G0D0 and cumulant approximations in model Hamiltonians and real materials, eliminating unphysical spectral kinks and correctly predicting the phonon emission continuum. Building on this, we introduce the self-consistent ladder formalism for transport, which captures vertex corrections due to electron-phonon interactions. This approach unifies and improves upon the two state-of-the-art approaches for first-principles phonon-limited transport: the bubble approximation and the Boltzmann transport equation. Moreover, as a charge-conserving approximation, it enables consistent calculations of the optical conductivity and dielectric function. We validate the developed method against numerically exact results for model Hamiltonians in the dilute polaronic limit and apply it to real materials. Our results show quantitative agreement with the experimental dc conductivities in intrinsic semiconductors Si and ZnO and the SrVO3 metal, as well as excellent agreement with the experimental THz optical and dielectric properties of Si and ZnO. This work unifies first-principles and many-body approaches for studying transport, opening new directions for applying many-body theory to materials with strong electron-phonon interactions.</description>

      <title>Molecular Beam Epitaxy of 2H-TaS$_2$ few-layers on GaN(0001)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 2H-TaS$_2$ few layers have been grown epitaxially onto GaN(0001). A high substrate growth temperature of 825$^{\circ}$C induces best structural properties of the overlayer, as revealed by in-situ electron diffraction (RHEED and LEED). The 2D-overlayer grows unstrained right after deposition of a monolayer. However, evidence of pits at the interface is provided by scanning transmission electron microscopy, most probably due to GaN thermal decomposition at the high growth temperature. In-situ x-ray photoemission spectroscopy shows core level shifts that are consistently related to electron transfer from the n-GaN(0001) to the 2H-TaS$_2$ epitaxial layer as well as the formation of a high concentration of nitrogen vacancies close to the interface. Further, no chemical reaction at the interface between the substrate and the grown TaS$_2$ overlayer is deduced from XPS, which corroborates the possibility of integration of 2D 2H-TaS$_2$ with an important 3D semiconducting material like GaN.</description>

Abstract: Novel antiferromagnets with broken time reversal symmetry (TRS) have launched a new direction in spintronics research, combining the advantageous dynamical properties of conventional antiferromagnets with the controllability typically associated with ferromagnets. However, antiferromagnetic domains are notoriously challenging to image in real-space. X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) offers a route to overcome this difficulty: XMCD contrast may be finite in TRS-breaking antiferromagnets with an appropriate magnetic space group. Here, we exploit this to image the octupole domains in a focused ion beam-fabricated device of the non-collinear antiferromagnet Mn$_3$Sn. Using scanning transmission x-ray microscopy, we spatially resolve the weak pre-edge XMCD contrast (of 0.2%) that is sensitive to $T_z$, achieving a contrast resolution better than 0.02%. We observe hysteretic switching of the octupole order through both the XMCD contrast and the corresponding anomalous Hall effect within the same device. These results confirm the bulk nature of this contrast, and establish XMCD-based microscopy as a powerful real space imaging method for TRS-breaking antiferromagnets, including altermagnets, enabling future studies of their dynamics, switching, and symmetry-tunable phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Davemaoite, as the third most abundant mineral in the lower mantle, constitutes significant amounts in pyrolite and mid-ocean ridge basalts. Due to its unquenchable nature, measurements by static compression techniques on physical properties of davemaoite at lower mantle conditions are rare and technically challenging, and those are essential to constrain compositions and properties of mineralogical models in the lower mantle. Here, we present Hugoniot equation of state and sound velocity of CaSiO3 glass under shock compression. The CaSiO3 glass transforms into the crystalline phase above 34 GPa and completely transforms into davemaoite above 120 GPa. Thermal equation of state and Hugoniot temperature of davemaoite have been derived from the shock wave data. The CaSiO3 glass under shcok compression has very high shock temperature. Shock wave experiments for sound velocity of CaSiO3 glass indicate that no melting is observed at Hugoniot pressure up to 117.6 GPa. We propose that the melting temperature of davemaoite should be higher than those reported theoretically by now.</description>

Abstract: This document summarizes the main concepts of the finite element (FE) theory and constitutive relations as implemented in the open-source code phase-field multiphysics materials simulator PHIMATS https://github.com/ahcomat/PHIMATS. PHIMATS is written in C++ and uses Python for pre- and post-processing. It provides tools for discretizing the weak form of partial differential equations (PDE), interfacing with PETSc data structures (Vec/Mat) and solvers (KSP/SNES). The framework supports both single-physics and coupled multiphysics problems primarily using staggered coupling schemes. Hands-on examples can be found in the CaseStudies directory on GitHub repository. Rather than detailing the derivations of specific models, this document focuses on the key mathematical formulations and numerical strategies used within the implementation. For in-depth theoretical discussions, the reader is encouraged to consult the references. For citing this document, please use: [Abdelrahman Hussein.
