      <title>Tessellation-based analysis of impurity clustering in the edge plasma of tokamaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Confinement quality in fusion plasma is significantly influenced by the presence of heavy impurities, which can lead to radiative heat loss and reduced confinement. This study explores the clustering of heavy impurity, \textit{i.e.}, Tungsten in edge plasma, using high-resolution direct numerical simulations of the Hasegawa--Wakatani equations. We use Stokes number to quantify the inertia of impurity particles. It is found that particle inertia will cause spatial intermittency in particle distribution and the formation of large-scale structures, \textit{i.e.}, the clustering of particles. The degrees of clustering are influenced by Stokes number. To quantify these observations, we apply a modified Voronoi tessellation, which assigns specific volumes to impurity particles. By determining time changes of these volumes, we can calculate the impurity velocity divergence, which allows to assess the clustering dynamics. To quantify the clustering statistically, several approaches are applied, such as probability density function (PDF) of impurity velocity divergence and joint PDF of volume and divergence.</description>

      <title>Improved algorithm for a two-dimensional Darwin particle-in-cell code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A two-dimensional particle-in-cell code for simulation of low-frequency electromagnetic processes in laboratory plasmas has been developed. The code uses the Darwin method omitting the electromagnetic wave propagation. The Darwin method separates the electric field into solenoidal and irrotational parts. The irrotational electric field is the electrostatic field calculated with the direct implicit algorithm. The solenoidal electric field is calculated with a new algorithm based on the equation for the electric field vorticity. The new algorithm is faster and more reliable than the Streamlined Darwin Field Formulation introduced decades ago. The system of linear equations in the new algorithm is solved using a standard iterative method. The code is applied to simulate an inductively coupled plasma with the driving current flowing around the plasma region.</description>

      <title>Spatial Fluctuation of the Electric Field within SF6 Streamer Channel in Highly Non-Uniform Fields: Phenomenon, Validation, and Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electric field within the streamer channel is a critical parameter in the calculation model for the nonlinear breakdown voltage of SF6, motivating the research presented in this paper. By using a 2D fluid model, we investigate the microscopic characteristics of the SF6 streamer channel in highly non-uniform fields and uncover a previously unexplained coherent structure: the spatial fluctuation of the electric field (SFEF). We validate the physical validity of SFEF by modifying model parameters that could potentially introduce non-physical effects. Further comparative analysis reveals that SFEF is driven by an ion-conducting channel formed due to the strong electronegativity of SF6. This ion-conducting channel exhibits local characteristics, which fundamentally arise from the slow response of charged species to local charge relaxation. We identify that some charge separation originates from the accumulation of negative ions at the rear edge of the streamer head due to strong electric field shielding in this region. As the streamer propagates, charge separation is continuously generated and passively carried into the streamer channel, ultimately forming the SFEF. Finally, we confirm that SFEF does not occur in uniform fields, indicating that it is a phenomenon exclusive to highly non-uniform fields. These findings provide a deep insight into the electric field within the SF6 streamer channel and offer a potential avenue for further investigation into the mechanisms of SF6 nonlinear breakdown voltage.</description>

      <title>Ion density waves driving the formation of filamentary dust structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The PlasmaKristall-4 experiment on the International Space Station allows for the study of the 3-dimensional interaction between plasma and dust particles. Previous simulations of the PK-4 environment have discovered fast moving ionization waves in the dc discharge[1]. These ionization waves vary the plasma parameters by up to an order of magnitude, which may affect the mechanisms responsible for the self-organization of chains seen in the PK-4 experiment. Here, we adapt a molecular dynamics simulation to employ temporally varying plasma conditions in order to investigate the effect on the dust charging and electrostatic potential. In order to describe the differences between the average of the plasma conditions and the time-varying plasma condition, we present a model to reproduce the potential that takes into account the negative potential from the dust grain and the positive potential from the ion wake.</description>

      <title>Knot-detection algorithm to measure viscosity in three-dimensional MHD plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This project explores the mathematical study of knots and links in topology, focusing on differentiating between the two-component Unlink and the Hopf Link using a computational tool named LINKAGE. LINKAGE employs the linking number, calculated through Barycentric Equations, Matrix Algebra, and basic topological principles, to quantify the degree of linking between two closed curves in three-dimensional space. This approach not only distinguishes between different knot structures but also has applications in understanding complex systems such as magnetic field lines in plasma physics. Additionally, this project includes an example where multiple interlinked loops were analyzed over different time stamps using the LINKAGE algorithm. By observing how these links break and evolve, the algorithm demonstrates its ability to track changes in the topological properties of the system. This dynamic analysis shows the versatility of the tool in studying evolving systems, where the topology of the components can change, providing valuable information about the underlying physical processes driving these changes.</description>

      <title>Simplified magnet design and manufacture based on patterning of wide conductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fabrication and assembly of High Temperature Superconducting (HTS) magnets can be significantly streamlined by (1) direct deposition of HTS onto modular components and (2) laser-ablated grooves to bound and guide the electric currents over the superconducting surfaces. "Coils" bounded by consecutive grooves can be individually powered, or connected in series, or in parallel. Applications include plasma-confinement devices such as stellarators and magnets for particle accelerators. On the way to HTS magnets generating more complicated three-dimensional fields, this paper validates the technique for two cylindrically symmetric magnets made of standard conductors. The optimized grooving pattern is considered as an inverse problem that is resolved using a least squares approach with Tikhonov regularization. This approach was first applied to design a magnet that replicates the magnetic field configuration of a microwave source of the gyrotron type. Gyrotrons require a particular profile of magnetic field, which our aluminium prototype successfully reproduced with 10$^{-1}$ precision. The second one, in copper, is a small-size, reduced-field magnet for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). This application requires highly uniform longitudinal fields. The achieved precision (about 50 ppm) is exceptional for an MRI magnet just getting out of the factory, and can easily meet hospital standards after minimal shimming or other error field correction. Future work and other potential applications of wide, patterned conductors or superconductors are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Methodologies for combining the accuracy of data-driven models with extrapolability of physics-based models are described and tested, for the task of building transport models of tokamak fusion reactors that extrapolate well to new operational regimes. Information from multiple physics simulations (the ASTRA transport code with gyro-Bohm and TGLF estimates for turbulent diffusion) as well as multiple distinct experiments (DIII-D and AUG tokamaks) are considered. Applications of the methodology to the task of commissioning and controlling a new reactor such as ITER are discussed.</description>

      <title>Near-axis description of stellarator-symmetric quasi-isodynamic stellarators to second order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The near-axis description of optimised stellarators, at second order in the expansion, provides important information about the field, both of physical and practical importance for stellarator optimisation. It however remains relatively underdeveloped for an important class of such stellarators, called quasi-isodynamic (QI). In this paper we develop the theoretical and numerical framework for the construction of such solutions. We find that the case of QI stellarators calls for the careful treatment of continuity, smoothness and periodicity of the various functions involved, especially for so-called half-helicity fields, which feature prominently in existing QI designs. The numerical implementation of necessary elements is described, and several examples are constructed and quantitatively verified in detail. This work establishes a basis for further systematic exploration of the space of QI stellarators, and the development of both theoretical and practical tools to facilitate effective optimisation of QI stellarators.</description>

      <title>Long-Wavelength Limit of the Two-Fluid Euler-Poisson System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasma is a medium filled with free electrons and positive ions. Each particle acts as a conducting fluid with a single velocity and temperature when electromagnetic fields are present. This distinction between the roles played by electrons and ions is what we refer to as the two$-$fluid description of plasma. In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of these particles in both hot and cold plasma using a collisionless ''Euler-Poisson'' system. Employing analytical and computational techniques from differential equations, we show this system is governed by the dynamics of the Korteweg$-$de Vries (KdV) equation in the long$-$wavelength limit.</description>

      <title>Quarks to Cosmos: Particles and Plasma in Cosmological evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe in the context of the particle physics (PP) standard model (SM) `PP-SM' the understanding of the primordial properties and composition of the Universe in the temperature range $130\GeV&gt;T&gt;20\keV$. The Universe evolution is described using FLRW cosmology. We present a global view on particle content across time and describe the different evolution eras using deceleration parameter $q$. We follow the arrow of time in the expanding and cooling Universe: After the PP-SM heavies $(t, h, W, Z)$ diminish in abundance below $T\simeq 50\GeV$, the PP-SM plasma in the Universe is governed by the strongly interacting Quark-Gluon content. Once the temperature drops below $T\simeq 150\MeV$, quarks and gluons hadronize into strongly interacting matter particles. Rapid disappearance of baryonic antimatter completes at $T_\mathrm{B}=38.2\MeV$. We study the ensuing disappearance of strangeness and mesons in general. We show that the different eras defined by particle populations are barely separated from each other with abundance of muons fading out just prior to $T=\mathcal{O}(2.5)\MeV$, the era of emergence of the free-streaming neutrinos. We discuss the two relevant fundamental constants controlling the decoupling of neutrinos. We subsequently follow the primordial Universe as it passes through the hot dense electron-positron plasma epoch. The high density of positron antimatter disappears near $T=20.3\keV$: Nuclear reactions occur in the presence of a highly mobile and relatively strongly interacting electron-positron plasma phase. We apply plasma theory methods to describe the strong screening effects between heavy dust particle (nucleons). We analyze the paramagnetic characteristics of the electron-positron plasma when exposed to an external primordial magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Towards a theory of hydromagnetic turbulence with higher order fluid moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, Chandrasekhar's deductive theory of turbulence is extended to the case of hydrodynamics and hydromagnetics, with higher order fluid moments. We include the contributions from correlation tensors at two different points of space and two different points in time to account for the energy transfer between Fourier modes with different $k$ values. We start with three governing equations using the first three moments of Vlasov equation, which gives us particle, momentum and energy conservation relations, respectively. We obtain the scalar representations of correlation tensors for hydrodynamics as well as hydromagnetics. Finally we pick an example from literature where the energy spectra alone was not capable of explaining the observations reported by the authors.</description>

      <title>Instant ZeV-ion-acceleration in Upset Magnetar Origin Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the energetics of bursting activity in a magnetar under the `Dzhanibekov effect,' described by the classical mechanics of rigid bodies. The magnetar's rotation axis suddenly flips due to this effect, resulting in a sudden rise of the Euler force. The outer layer of magnetar, called the crust, can plastically flow and eventually break due to the Euler force. Then, the degenerate electrons burst open from the braking region like a balloon burst. We find that the pair plasma formation can be ignited inside the crust, and its radiation can be similar to the observed bursts from soft gamma-ray repeaters. At the beginning of this bursting phenomenon, the self-discharge effect of the electron streaming may induce a strong resistive electric field, accelerating the ions. We also find that the maximum energy of the accelerated ions possibly reaches $\sim$ZeV within a timescale of $\sim1$~ps. If $\gtrsim2$~\% of magnetars in nearby galaxies are undergoing this scenario, the observed cosmic-ray flux at $&gt;100$~EeV can be explained.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional Simulation of Surface Charging in Meteorite Craters on Rotating Asteroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Meteorite craters on the asteroid surface obstruct the horizontal flow of solar wind, forming a plasma wake that modulates the particle fluxes and the electrostatic environment far downstream. In this study, surface charging properties of asteroids with nontrivial terrain are simulated based on neural network and the finite element method. Key factors such as the location, size and depth-to-width ratio of craters are all considered. Under normal conditions, as the latitude of the crater increases, the potential variation at its floor during a rotation gradually becomes smoother, finally stabilizing around -3V with minor fluctuations as the crater approaches the poles. For craters with a depth-to-width ratio greater than 0.5, because of the diverging motions of electrons and the less deflected trajectories of ions, completely different charging results are observed under parallel and perpendicular solar wind incidence, the potential around the crater floor decreases and increases with the rising depth-to-width ratio, respectively. While the surface potential appears indifferent to changes in crater size, only during solar storms, the floor of large-scale craters, such as those with a diameter of 800m, perform a 9.13V decrease in potential compared to small craters of 50m. Both studies of localized plasma flow field and the surface charging phenomenon of asteroids have substantial influence on the future safe landing and exploration missions.</description>

      <title>Residual Energy and Broken Symmetry in Reduced Magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alfv\'enic interactions which transfer energy from large to small spatial scales lie at the heart of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. An important feature of the turbulence is the generation of negative residual energy -- excess energy in magnetic fluctuations compared to velocity fluctuations. By contrast, an MHD Alfv\'en wave has equal amounts of energy in fluctuations of each type. Alfv\'enic quasimodes that do not satisfy the Alfv\'en wave dispersion relation and exist only in the presence of a nonlinear term can contain either positive or negative residual energy, but until now an intuitive physical explanation for why negative residual energy is preferred has remained elusive. This paper shows that the equations of reduced MHD are symmetric in that they have no intrinsic preference for one sign of the residual energy over the other. An initial state that is not an exact solution to the equations can break this symmetry in a way that leads to net-negative residual energy generation. Such a state leads to a solution with three distinct parts: nonresonant Alfv\'enic quasimodes, normal modes produced to satisfy initial conditions, and resonant normal modes that grow in time. The latter two parts strongly depend on initial conditions; the resulting symmetry breaking leads to net-negative residual energy both in Alfv\'enic quasimodes and $\omega=k_\parallel{V_A}=0$ modes. These modes have net-positive residual energy in the equivalent boundary value problem, suggesting that the initial value setup is a better match for solar wind turbulence.</description>

Abstract: To examine the robustness of the designed 5% $\beta$-limit for high-performance operation in the W7-X stellarator, we undertake nonlinear magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of pressure-driven instabilities using the M3D-$C^1$ code. Consistent with linear analyses, ideal ballooning instabilities occur as $\beta$ exceeds 5% in the standard configuration. Nonetheless, the modes saturate nonlinearly at relatively low levels without triggering large-scale crashes, even though confinement degradation worsens as $\beta$ increases. In contrast, in an alternative configuration with nearly zero magnetic shear, ideal interchange modes induce a pressure crash at $\beta= 1\%$. These results suggest that the standard W7-X configuration might have a soft $\beta$-limit that is fairly immune to major MHD events, which enhances the appeal of the stellarator approach to steady-state fusion reactors.</description>

Abstract: Plasma turbulence can enhance the diffusion of both magnetic fields and plasmas. But, any theory must be consistent with their evolution equations having the mathematical form of advection-diffusion equations. Advection-diffusion equations have a remarkable feature. When the diffusion is extremely weak but non-zero, its magnitude makes only a small difference even when varied over sixteen orders of magnitude. Nevertheless, diffusion causes the solutions to differ fundamentally from those given by advection alone on a timescale that is only an order of magnitude longer than the timescale defined by the advective flow. This is true when the advective velocity is chaotic -- the exponential separation of neighboring streamlines -- as natural flows generally are. In addition to eddies, even highly turbulent flows can have large-scale coherent flows, which dominate their transport effects on the longest scales. \color{black} Basic physics and easily understood mathematics place important constraints, which are explained.</description>

      <title>Melting of a vortex matter Wigner crystal</title>

Abstract: The two-dimensional One-Component Plasma (OCP) is a foundational model of the statistical mechanics of interacting particles, describing phenomena common to astrophysics, turbulence, and the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect (FQHE). Despite an extensive literature, the phase diagram of the 2D OCP is still a subject of some controversy. Here we develop a "vortex matter" simulator to realize the logarithmic-interaction OCP experimentally by exploiting the topological character of quantized vortices in a thin superfluid layer. Precision optical-tweezer control of the location of quantized vortices enables direct preparation of the OCP ground state with or without defects, and heating from acoustic excitations allows the observation of the melting transition from the solid Wigner crystal through the liquid phase. We present novel theoretical analysis that is in quantitative agreement with experimental observations, and demonstrates how equilibrium states are achieved through the system dynamics. This allows a precise measurement of the superfluid-thermal cloud mutual friction and heating coefficients. This platform provides a route towards solving a number of open problems in systems with long-range interactions. At equilibrium, it could distinguish between the competing scenarios of grain boundary melting and KTHNY theory. Dynamical simulators could test the existence of predicted edge-wave solitons which form a hydrodynamic analogue of topological edge states in the FQHE.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Alfv\'en-wave Dynamics and Premerger Emission from Crustal Oscillations in Neutron Star Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17026v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars have solid crusts threaded by strong magnetic fields. Perturbations in the crust can excite non-radial oscillations, which can in turn launch Alfven waves into the magnetosphere. In the case of a compact binary close to merger involving at least one neutron star, this can happen through tidal interactions causing resonant excitations that shatter the neutron star crust. We present the first numerical study that elucidates the dynamics of Alfven waves launched in a compact binary magnetosphere. We seed a magnetic field perturbation on the neutron star crust, which we then evolve in fully general-relativistic force-free electrodynamics using a GPU-based implementation. We show that Alfven waves steepen nonlinearly before reaching the orbital light cylinder, form flares, and dissipate energy in a transient current sheet. Our results predict radio and X-ray precursor emission from this process.</description>

      <title>Bayesian optimization of laser wakefield acceleration in the self-modulated regime (SM-LWFA) aiming to produce molybdenum-99 via photonuclear reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20087v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While laser wakefield acceleration (LWFA) in the bubble regime demands ultra-short, high-peak-power laser pulses, operation in the self-modulated regime (SM-LWFA) works with more relaxed pulse conditions, albeit at the cost of lower beam quality. Modern laser systems can deliver pulses with durations of a few tens of femtoseconds and peak powers on the order of a few terawatts, at kHz repetition rates. These systems are well-suited for developing SM-LWFA applications where high average energy and charge are prioritized over beam quality. Such beams could be used to generate high-energy bremsstrahlung photons, capable of triggering photonuclear reactions to produce radioisotopes like molybdenum-99. This isotope decays into technetium-99m, the most widely used medical radioisotope, with over 30 million applications worldwide per year. This work explores the use of Bayesian optimization to maximize the energy and charge of electron beams accelerated via SM-LWFA. Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations model a 5 TW, 15 fs-long Gaussian laser pulse, propagating through tailored hydrogen gas-density profiles. In these simulations, over multiple iterations, the algorithm optimizes a set of input parameters characterizing the gas-density profile and the laser focal position. Three distinct profiles, with total lengths ranging from 200 to 400 micrometers and combining ramps and plateaus, were investigated. Optimal configurations were found to produce electron beams with median energies ranging from 14 to 17 MeV and charges of 600 to 1300 pC, considering electrons with energies above 8 MeV. Preliminary estimates of the molybdenum-99 yields for the optimal beams were obtained by employing their phase spaces, retrieved from PIC simulations, as radiation source inputs in Monte Carlo simulations irradiating a combined tantalum and molybdenum target.</description>

      <title>Radiative hydrodynamic equations with nonequilibrium radiative transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01827v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a kinetic model for the coupled evolution of radiation, electrons, and ions in a radiation plasma system. The model is solved using two methods. The gas-kinetic scheme (GKS) for electron and ion hydrodynamics and the unified gas-kinetic scheme (UGKS) for non-equilibrium radiative transfer. The UGKS accurately captures multiscale photon transport from free streaming to diffusion across varying fluid opacities. This approach enables the scheme to model equilibrium plasma with non-equilibrium radiation transport. The model is validated through several test cases, including radiative transfer in kinetic and diffusion regimes, Marshak wave, Radiative shock, 3T(three-temperature) double lax shock tube problem, two-dimensional Sedov blast wave, and two-dimensional tophat based problem. These tests demonstrate the current scheme's capability to handle diverse radiation plasma scenarios.</description>
