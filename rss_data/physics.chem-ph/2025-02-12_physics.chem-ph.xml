      <title>Spin dependent fluorescence mediated by anti-symmetric exchange in triplet exciton pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Singlet fission and triplet-triplet annihilation (TTA) are spin-dependent phenomena critical to optoelectronics. The dynamics of spin populations during geminate triplet pair separation are crucial for controlling fission and TTA rates. We show that the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) induces level crossings between spin manifolds, affecting spin populations and TTA rates in crystalline fission semiconductors. By investigating spin-dependent fluorescence in a triplet exciton pair with the magnetic field aligned along the fine structure tensor, we isolate the effect of DMI, as the triplet wavefunctions remain unaffected by the field. Our results reveal that DMI introduces additional TTA pathways that are forbidden by spin conservation, explaining the observed evolution of optically detected magnetic resonance signals with varying magnetic field. This study highlights the significant impact of DMI on the optical properties of triplet excitons, advancing our understanding of spin dynamics in these systems.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of Machine Learning Potentials for Molecules, Reactions and Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the fast development of machine learning potentials (MLPs) and their widespread applications in chemistry, physics, and material science. By fitting discrete ab initio data faithfully to continuous and symmetry-preserving mathematical forms, MLPs have enabled accurate and efficient atomistic simulations in a large scale from first principles. In this review, we provide an overview of the evolution of MLPs in the past two decades and focus on the state-of-the-art MLPs proposed in the last a few years for molecules, reactions, and materials. We discuss some representative applications of MLPs and the trend of developing universal potentials across a variety of systems. Finally, we outline a list of open challenges and opportunities in the development and applications of MLPs.</description>

      <title>CO2 adsorption mechanisms in hydrated silica nanopores: Insights from grand canonical Monte Carlo to classical and ab initio molecular dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding interfacial phenomena in confined systems is important for optimizing CO2 capture technologies. Here, we present a comprehensive investigation of CO2 adsorption in hydrated amorphous silica nanopores through an integrated computational approach combining grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC), classical molecular dynamics (MD), and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. The excess adsorption isotherms reveal a marked hydration dependence, with CO2 uptake decreasing from 7.6 to 2.6 mmol/g as water content increases from 1 to 15 wt%. Analysis of adsorption kinetics demonstrates a distinctive bimodal process, characterized by rapid initial uptake followed by slower diffusion-limited adsorption, with the latter becoming increasingly dominant at higher hydration levels. Classical MD simulations reveal an inverse correlation between hydration and CO2 mobility, with self-diffusion coefficients decreasing across the studied hydration range. Density profile analysis indicates a hydration-induced transition in CO2 distribution from central pore regions to surface-proximate domains, accompanied by restructuring of interfacial water networks. Notably, AIMD simulations capture previously unrecognized chemical processes, including proton transfer mechanisms leading to surface silanol formation with characteristic O-O distances of 2.4-2.5 {\AA}, and spontaneous CO2 hydration yielding carbonate species through water-mediated reaction pathways. These findings demonstrate the dual role of confined water as both a spatial competitor and reaction medium for CO2 capture, providing molecular-level insights with quantum mechanical accuracy for design of carbon capture materials.</description>

      <title>Energy Window Augmented Plane Waves (EWAPW)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11926v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we present a new basis set for electronic structure calculations of crystalline solids aimed at applications to Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods. In this construction we take advantage of the fact that most DFT calculations use a convergence loop in order to obtain the eigenstates of a final Khon Sham (KS) Hamiltonian matrix - that is iterate till the eigenstates of the KS Hamiltonian matrix also give the appropriate electron density needed to obtain the KS potential needed for that KS Hamiltonian matrix. Here we propose that, for the basis used at each step of the iteration, we use the previous eigenstate basis, in the interstitial region, but augmented inside the MT sphere with the solution to the spherically averaged KS Hamiltonian for the energy window of the energy of that eigenstate. Indeed to reduce the number of times the KS potential needs to be solved inside the MT spheres it is advantageous to use energy windows and solve the KS Hamiltonian inside the MT region only once per window (at some energy inside the window) so that the KS Hamiltonian needs only be solved a small number of times per iteration, which for practical applications is on the order of ten to one hundred windows. This method combines the energy dependence of methods such as Projected Augmented Wave functions (PAW) with the ability of the basis set to adjust to the solid state (rather then atomic) environment which is similar to basis sets such as Linearized Augmented Plane Waves (LAPW).</description>

      <title>Fluid flow inside slit-shaped nanopores: the role of surface morphology at the molecular scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations of fluid flow have highlighted the peculiarities of nanoscale flows compared to classical fluid mechanics; in particular, boundary conditions can deviate from the no-slip behavior at macroscopic scales. For fluid flow in slit-shaped nanopores, we demonstrate that surface morphology provides an efficient control on the slip length, which approaches zero when matching the molecular structures of the pore wall and the fluid. Using boundary-driven, energy-conserving NEMD simulations with a pump-like driving mechanism, we examine two types of pore walls--mimicking a crystalline and an amorphous material--that exhibit markedly different surface resistances to flow. The resulting flow velocity profiles are consistent with Poiseuille theory for incompressible, Newtonian fluids when adjusted for surface slip. For the two pores, we observe partial slip and no-slip behavior, respectively. The hydrodynamic permeability corroborates that the simulated flows are in the Darcy regime. However, the confinement of the fluid gives rise to an effective viscosity below its bulk value; wide pores exhibit a crossover between boundary and bulk-like flows. Additionally, the thermal isolation of the flow causes a linear increase in fluid temperature along the flow, which we relate to strong viscous dissipation and heat convection, utilizing conservation laws of fluid mechanics. Noting that the investigated fluid model does not form droplets, our findings challenge the universality of previously reported correlations between slippage, solvophobicity, and a depletion zone. Furthermore, they underscore the need for molecular-scale modeling to accurately capture the fluid dynamics near boundaries and in nanoporous materials, where macroscopic models may not be applicable.</description>

      <title>Simulating Non-Markovian Quantum Dynamics on NISQ Computers Using the Hierarchical Equations of Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12049v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing offers promising new avenues for tackling the long-standing challenge of simulating the quantum dynamics of complex chemical systems, particularly open quantum systems coupled to external baths. However, simulating such non-unitary dynamics on quantum computers is challenging since quantum circuits are specifically designed to carry out unitary transformations. Furthermore, chemical systems are often strongly coupled to the surrounding environment, rendering the dynamics non-Markovian and beyond the scope of Markovian quantum master equations like Lindblad or Redfield. In this work, we introduce a quantum algorithm designed to simulate non-Markovian dynamics of open quantum systems. Our approach enables the implementation of arbitrary quantum master equations on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers. We illustrate the method as applied in conjunction with the numerically exact hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) method. The effectiveness of the resulting quantum HEOM algorithm is demonstrated as applied to simulations of the non-Lindbladian electronic energy and charge transfer dynamics in models of the carotenoid-porphyrin-\ce{C60} molecular triad dissolved in tetrahydrofuran and the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex.</description>
