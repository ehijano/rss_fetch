      <title>The Theory of Strategic Evolution: Games with Endogenous Players and Strategic Replicators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops the Theory of Strategic Evolution, a general model for systems in which the population of players, strategies, and institutional rules evolve together. The theory extends replicator dynamics to settings with endogenous players, multi level selection, innovation, constitutional change, and meta governance. The central mathematical object is a Poiesis stack: a hierarchy of strategic layers linked by cross level gain matrices. Under small gain conditions, the system admits a global Lyapunov function and satisfies selection, tracking, and stochastic stability results at every finite depth. We prove that the class is closed under block extension, innovation events, heterogeneous utilities, continuous strategy spaces, and constitutional evolution. The closure theorem shows that no new dynamics arise at higher levels and that unrestricted self modification cannot preserve Lyapunov structure. The theory unifies results from evolutionary game theory, institutional design, innovation dynamics, and constitutional political economy, providing a general mathematical model of long run strategic adaptation.</description>

      <title>Selling Privacy in Blockchain Transactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study methods to enhance privacy in blockchain transactions from an economic angle. We consider mechanisms for privacy-aware users whose utility depends not only on the outcome of the mechanism but also negatively on the exposure of their economic preferences. Specifically, we study two auction-theoretic settings with privacy-aware users. First, we analyze an order flow auction, where a user auctions off to specialized agents, called searchers, the right to execute her transaction while maintaining a degree of privacy. We examine how the degree of privacy affects the revenue of the auction and, broadly, the net utility of the privacy-aware user. In this new setting, we describe the optimal auction, which is a sealed-bid auction. Subsequently, we analyze a variant of a Dutch auction in which the user gradually decreases the price and the degree of privacy until the transaction is sold. We compare the revenue of this auction to that of the optimal one as a function of the number of communication rounds. Then, we introduce a two-sided market - a privacy marketplace - with multiple users selling their transactions under their privacy preferences to multiple searchers. We propose a posted-price mechanism for the two-sided market that guarantees constant approximation of the optimal social welfare while maintaining incentive compatibility (from both sides of the market) and budget balance. This work builds on the emerging line of research that attempts to improve the performance of economic mechanisms by appending cryptographic primitives to them.</description>

      <title>Beyond Revenue and Welfare: Counterfactual Analysis of Spectrum Auctions with Application to Canada's 3800MHz Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectrum auctions are the primary mechanism through which governments allocate scarce radio frequencies, with outcomes that shape competition, coverage, and innovation in telecommunications markets. While traditional models of spectrum auctions often rely on strong equilibrium assumptions, we take a more parsimonious approach by modeling bidders as myopic and straightforward: in each round, firms simply demand the bundle that maximizes their utility given current prices. Despite its simplicity, this model proves effective in predicting the outcomes of Canada's 2023 auction of 3800 MHz spectrum licenses. Using detailed round-by-round bidding data, we estimate bidders' valuations through a linear programming framework and validate that our model reproduces key features of the observed allocation and price evolution. We then use these estimated valuations to simulate a counterfactual auction under an alternative mechanism that incentivizes deployment in rural and remote regions, aligning with one of the key objectives set out in the Canadian Telecommunications Act. The results show that the proposed mechanism substantially improves population coverage in underserved areas. These findings demonstrate that a behavioral model with minimal assumptions is sufficient to generate reliable counterfactual predictions, making it a practical tool for policymakers to evaluate how alternative auction designs may influence future outcomes. In particular, our study demonstrates a method for counterfactual mechanism design, providing a framework to evaluate how alternative auction rules could advance policy goals such as equitable deployment across Canada.</description>

      <title>Multi-agent learning under uncertainty: Recurrence vs. concentration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the convergence landscape of multi-agent learning under uncertainty. Specifically, we analyze two stochastic models of regularized learning in continuous games -- one in continuous and one in discrete time with the aim of characterizing the long-run behavior of the induced sequence of play. In stark contrast to deterministic, full-information models of learning (or models with a vanishing learning rate), we show that the resulting dynamics do not converge in general. In lieu of this, we ask instead which actions are played more often in the long run, and by how much. We show that, in strongly monotone games, the dynamics of regularized learning may wander away from equilibrium infinitely often, but they always return to its vicinity in finite time (which we estimate), and their long-run distribution is sharply concentrated around a neighborhood thereof. We quantify the degree of this concentration, and we show that these favorable properties may all break down if the underlying game is not strongly monotone -- underscoring in this way the limits of regularized learning in the presence of persistent randomness and uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Robust equilibria in continuous games: From strategic to dynamic robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the robustness of Nash equilibria in continuous games, under both strategic and dynamic uncertainty. Starting with the former, we introduce the notion of a robust equilibrium as those equilibria that remain invariant to small -- but otherwise arbitrary -- perturbations to the game's payoff structure, and we provide a crisp geometric characterization thereof. Subsequently, we turn to the question of dynamic robustness, and we examine which equilibria may arise as stable limit points of the dynamics of "follow the regularized leader" (FTRL) in the presence of randomness and uncertainty. Despite their very distinct origins, we establish a structural correspondence between these two notions of robustness: strategic robustness implies dynamic robustness, and, conversely, the requirement of strategic robustness cannot be relaxed if dynamic robustness is to be maintained. Finally, we examine the rate of convergence to robust equilibria as a function of the underlying regularizer, and we show that entropically regularized learning converges at a geometric rate in games with affinely constrained action spaces.</description>

      <title>Proportional Justified Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09928</link>
      <description>arXiv:1611.09928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of multi-winner elections is to choose a fixed-size committee based on voters' preferences. An important concern in this setting is representation: large groups of voters with cohesive preferences should be adequately represented by the election winners. In an influential paper, Aziz et al. proposed two axioms that aim to capture this idea: justified representation (JR) and its strengthening extended justified representation (EJR). We observe that EJR is incompatible with the highly desirable Perfect Representation (PR) criterion, and propose a relaxation of EJR, which we call Proportional Justified Representation (PJR). PJR is more demanding than JR, but, unlike EJR, it is compatible with PR, as well as with a stronger variant of this axiom, which we term Fractional Perfect Representation (FPR). Moreover, just like EJR, PJR can be used to characterise the classic Proportional Approval Voting (PAV) rule in the class of weighted PAV rules. On the other hand, we show that EJR provides stronger guarantees with respect to average voter satisfaction than PJR does.</description>

      <title>Shift Bribery over Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In shift bribery, a briber seeks to promote his preferred candidate by paying voters to raise their ranking. Classical models of shift bribery assume voters act independently, overlooking the role of social influence. However, in reality, individuals are social beings and are often represented as part of a social network, where bribed voters may influence their neighbors, thereby amplifying the effect of persuasion. We study Shift bribery over Networks, where voters are modeled as nodes in a directed weighted graph, and arcs represent social influence between them. In this setting, bribery is not confined to directly targeted voters its effects can propagate through the network, influencing neighbors and amplifying persuasion. Given a budget and individual cost functions for shifting each voter's preference toward a designated candidate, the goal is to determine whether a shift strategy exists within budget that ensures the preferred candidate wins after both direct and network-propagated influence takes effect. We show that the problem is NP-Complete even with two candidates and unit costs, and W[2]-hard when parameterized by budget or maximum degree. On the positive side, we design polynomial-time algorithms for complete graphs under plurality and majority rules and path graphs for uniform edge weights, linear-time algorithms for transitive tournaments for two candidates, linear cost functions and uniform arc weights, and pseudo-polynomial algorithms for cluster graphs. We further prove the existence of fixed-parameter tractable algorithms with treewidth as parameter for two candidates, linear cost functions and uniform arc weights and pseudo-FPT with cluster vertex deletion number for two candidates and uniform arc weights. Together, these results give a detailed complexity landscape for shift bribery in social networks.</description>

      <title>Collusion-proof Auction Design using Side Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of auction design in the presence of bidder collusion. Specifically, we consider a multi-unit auction of identical items with single-minded bidders, where a subset of bidders may collude by coordinating bids and transferring payments and items among themselves. The classical Vickrey-Clarke-Groves(VCG) mechanism is highly vulnerable to collusion and fully collusion-proof mechanisms are limited to posted-price formats, which fail to guarantee even approximate efficiency. This paper aims to bridge this gap by designing auctions that achieve good welfare and revenue guarantees even when some bidders collude. We first characterize the strategic behavior of colluding bidders under VCG and prove that such bidders optimally bid shade: they never overbid or take additional items, but instead reduce the auction price. This characterization enables a Bulow-Klemperer type result: adding colluding bidders can only improve welfare and revenue relative to running VCG on the non-colluding group alone. We next consider a setting where black-box collusion detection algorithm is available to label bidders as being colluding or non-colluding, and we propose a VCG-Posted Price(V-PoP) mechanism that combines VCG applied to non-colluding bidders with a posted-price mechanism for colluding bidders. We show that V-PoP is ex-post dominant-strategy incentive compatible(DSIC) and derive probabilistic guarantees on expected welfare and revenue under both known and unknown valuation distributions. Numerical experiments across several distributions demonstrate that V-PoP consistently outperforms VCG restricted to non-colluding bidders and approaches the performance of the ideal VCG mechanism assuming universal truthfulness. Our results provide a principled framework for incorporating collusion detection into mechanism design, offering a step toward collusion-resistant auctions.</description>

      <title>Meta-Computing Enhanced Federated Learning in IIoT: Satisfaction-Aware Incentive Scheme via DRL-Based Stackelberg Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06909v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) leverages Federated Learning (FL) for distributed model training while preserving data privacy, and meta-computing enhances FL by optimizing and integrating distributed computing resources, improving efficiency and scalability. Efficient IIoT operations require a trade-off between model quality and training latency. Consequently, a primary challenge of FL in IIoT is to optimize overall system performance by balancing model quality and training latency. This paper designs a satisfaction function that accounts for data size, Age of Information (AoI), and training latency for meta-computing. Additionally, the satisfaction function is incorporated into the utility function to incentivize IIoT nodes to participate in model training. We model the utility functions of servers and nodes as a two-stage Stackelberg game and employ a deep reinforcement learning approach to learn the Stackelberg equilibrium. This approach ensures balanced rewards and enhances the applicability of the incentive scheme for IIoT. Simulation results demonstrate that, under the same budget constraints, the proposed incentive scheme improves utility by at least 23.7% compared to existing FL schemes without compromising model accuracy.</description>
