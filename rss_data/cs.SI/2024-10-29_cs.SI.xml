      <title>Maximizing User Engagement in Social Networks: A Game-Theoretic Approach to Network Participation and Resource Sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a game-theoretic framework to model and optimize user engagement in cooperative activities over social networks. While traditional diffusion models suggest that individuals are only influenced by their neighbors, empirical evidence shows that diffusion alone does not fully explain network evolution, and non-diffusion factors play a significant role in network growth. We model network participation and resource-sharing as strategic games involving boundedly rational players to address this gap between the analytical models and empirical evidence. Specifically, we employ Log-Linear Learning (LLL), a version of noisy best response, to capture players' decision-making strategies. By incorporating stochastic decision models like LLL, our framework integrates both diffusion and non-diffusion dynamics into network evolution dynamics. Through equilibrium analysis and simulations, we demonstrate that our model aligns with theoretical predictions from existing analytical frameworks and empirical observations across various initial network configurations. Our second contribution is a novel method for selecting anchor nodes to enhance user participation. This approach allows system designers to identify anchor nodes and compute their incentives in real time under a more realistic information requirement constraints as compared to the existing approaches. The proposed approach adapts to changing network conditions by reallocating resources from less impactful to more influential nodes. Furthermore, the method is resilient to anchor node failures, ensuring sustained and continuous network participation.</description>

      <title>hateUS -- Analysis, impact of Social media use and Hate speech over University Student platforms: Case study, Problems, and Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of social media applications, hate speech engagement, and public debates among teenagers, primarily by university and college students, is growing day by day. The feelings of tremendous stress, anxiety, and depression via social media among our youths have a direct impact on their daily lives and personal workspace apart from delayed sleep, social media addictions, and memory loss. The use of NO phone times and NO phone zones is now popular in workplaces and family cultures. The use of hate speech, negotiations, and toxic words can lead to verbal abuse and cybercrime. Growing concern of mobile device security, cyberbullying, ransomware attacks, and mental health issues are another serious impact of social media among university students. The future challenges including health issues of social media use and hate speech has a serious impact on livelihood, freedom, and diverse communities of university students. Our case study is related to social media use and hate speech related to public debates over university students. We have presented the analysis and impact of social media and hate speech with several conclusions, cybercrimes, and components. The use of questionnaires for collecting primary data over university students help in the analysis of case study. The conclusion of case study and future scope of the research is extremely important to counter negative impacts.</description>

      <title>Cyberbullying or just Sarcasm? Unmasking Coordinated Networks on Reddit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid growth of social media usage, a common trend has emerged where users often make sarcastic comments on posts. While sarcasm can sometimes be harmless, it can blur the line with cyberbullying, especially when used in negative or harmful contexts. This growing issue has been exacerbated by the anonymity and vast reach of the internet, making cyberbullying a significant concern on platforms like Reddit. Our research focuses on distinguishing cyberbullying from sarcasm, particularly where online language nuances make it difficult to discern harmful intent. This study proposes a framework using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to differentiate between the two, addressing the limitations of traditional sentiment analysis in detecting nuanced behaviors. By analyzing a custom dataset scraped from Reddit, we achieved a 95.15% accuracy in distinguishing harmful content from sarcasm. Our findings also reveal that teenagers and minority groups are particularly vulnerable to cyberbullying. Additionally, our research uncovers coordinated graphs of groups involved in cyberbullying, identifying common patterns in their behavior. This research contributes to improving detection capabilities for safer online communities.</description>

      <title>Beyond Trivial Edges: A Fractional Approach to Cohesive Subgraph Detection in Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hypergraphs serve as a powerful tool for modeling complex relationships across domains like social networks, transactions, and recommendation systems. The (k,g)-core model effectively identifies cohesive subgraphs by assessing internal connections and co-occurrence patterns, but it is susceptible to inflated cohesiveness due to trivial hyperedges. To address this, we propose the $(k,g,p)$-core model, which incorporates the relative importance of hyperedges for more accurate subgraph detection. We develop both Na\"ive and Advanced pruning algorithms, demonstrating through extensive experiments that our approach reduces the execution frequency of costly operations by 51.9% on real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Investigation into the Spread of Misinformation about UK Prime Ministers on Twitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Misinformation presents threats to societal mental well-being, public health initiatives, as well as satisfaction in democracy. Those who spread misinformation can leverage cognitive biases to make others more likely to believe and share their misinformation unquestioningly. For example, by sharing misinformation whilst claiming to be someone from a highly respectable profession, a propagandist may seek to increase the effectiveness of their campaign using authority bias. Using retweet data from the spread of misinformation about two former UK Prime Ministers (Boris Johnson and Theresa May), we find that 3.1% of those who retweeted such misinformation claimed to be teachers or lecturers (20.7% of those who claimed to have a profession in their Twitter bio field in our sample), despite such professions representing under 1.15% of the UK population. Whilst polling data shows teachers and healthcare workers are amongst the most trusted professions in society, these were amongst the most popular professions that those in our sample claimed to have.</description>

      <title>DHPrep: Deep Hawkes Process based Dynamic Network Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Networks representation aims to encode vertices into a low-dimensional space, while preserving the original network structures and properties. Most existing methods focus on static network structure without considering temporal dynamics. However, in real world, most networks (e.g., social and biological networks) are dynamic in nature and are constantly evolving over time. Such temporal dynamics are critical in representations learning, especially for predicting dynamic networks behaviors. To this end, a Deep Hawkes Process based Dynamic Networks Representation algorithm (DHPrep) is proposed in this paper, which is capable of capturing temporal dynamics of dynamic networks. Specifically, DHPrep incorporates both structural information and temporal dynamics to learn vertices representations that can model the edge formation process for a vertex pair, where the structural information is used to capture the historical impact from their neighborhood, and the temporal dynamics utilize this historical information and apply Hawkes point process to model the edges formation process. Moreover, a temporal smoother is further imposed to ensure the representations evolve smoothly over time. To evaluate the effectiveness of DHPrep, extensive experiments are carried out using four real-world datasets. Experimental results reveal that our DHPrep algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods in various tasks including link prediction and vertices recommendation.</description>

      <title>Leveraging AI and Sentiment Analysis for Forecasting Election Outcomes in Mauritius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the use of AI-driven sentiment analysis as a novel tool for forecasting election outcomes, focusing on Mauritius' 2024 elections. In the absence of reliable polling data, we analyze media sentiment toward two main political parties L'Alliance Lepep and L'Alliance Du Changement by classifying news articles from prominent Mauritian media outlets as positive, negative, or neutral. We employ a multilingual BERT-based model and a custom Sentiment Scoring Algorithm to quantify sentiment dynamics and apply the Sentiment Impact Score (SIS) for measuring sentiment influence over time. Our forecast model suggests L'Alliance Du Changement is likely to secure a minimum of 37 seats, while L'Alliance Lepep is predicted to obtain the remaining 23 seats out of the 60 available. Findings indicate that positive media sentiment strongly correlates with projected electoral gains, underscoring the role of media in shaping public perception. This approach not only mitigates media bias through adjusted scoring but also serves as a reliable alternative to traditional polling. The study offers a scalable methodology for political forecasting in regions with limited polling infrastructure and contributes to advancements in the field of political data science.</description>

      <title>Domain Specific Data Distillation and Multi-modal Embedding Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The challenge of creating domain-centric embeddings arises from the abundance of unstructured data and the scarcity of domain-specific structured data. Conventional embedding techniques often rely on either modality, limiting their applicability and efficacy. This paper introduces a novel modeling approach that leverages structured data to filter noise from unstructured data, resulting in embeddings with high precision and recall for domain-specific attribute prediction. The proposed model operates within a Hybrid Collaborative Filtering (HCF) framework, where generic entity representations are fine-tuned through relevant item prediction tasks. Our experiments, focusing on the cloud computing domain, demonstrate that HCF-based embeddings outperform AutoEncoder-based embeddings (using purely unstructured data), achieving a 28% lift in precision and an 11% lift in recall for domain-specific attribute prediction.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Reconstruction-based Graph-Level Anomaly Detection: Limitations and a Simple Remedy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph autoencoders (Graph-AEs) learn representations of given graphs by aiming to accurately reconstruct them. A notable application of Graph-AEs is graph-level anomaly detection (GLAD), whose objective is to identify graphs with anomalous topological structures and/or node features compared to the majority of the graph population. Graph-AEs for GLAD regard a graph with a high mean reconstruction error (i.e. mean of errors from all node pairs and/or nodes) as anomalies. Namely, the methods rest on the assumption that they would better reconstruct graphs with similar characteristics to the majority. We, however, report non-trivial counter-examples, a phenomenon we call reconstruction flip, and highlight the limitations of the existing Graph-AE-based GLAD methods. Specifically, we empirically and theoretically investigate when this assumption holds and when it fails. Through our analyses, we further argue that, while the reconstruction errors for a given graph are effective features for GLAD, leveraging the multifaceted summaries of the reconstruction errors, beyond just mean, can further strengthen the features. Thus, we propose a novel and simple GLAD method, named MUSE. The key innovation of MUSE involves taking multifaceted summaries of reconstruction errors as graph features for GLAD. This surprisingly simple method obtains SOTA performance in GLAD, performing best overall among 14 methods across 10 datasets.</description>

      <title>Evolving interdisciplinary contributions to global societal challenges: A 50-year overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Addressing global societal challenges necessitates insights and expertise that transcend the boundaries of individual disciplines. In recent decades, interdisciplinary collaboration has been recognised as a vital driver of innovation and effective problem-solving, with the potential to profoundly influence policy and practice worldwide. However, quantitative evidence remains limited regarding how cross-disciplinary efforts contribute to societal challenges, as well as the evolving roles and relevance of specific disciplines in addressing these issues. To fill this gap, this study examines the long-term evolution of interdisciplinary contributions to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), drawing on extensive bibliometric data from OpenAlex. By analysing publication and citation trends across 19 research fields from 1970 to 2022, we reveal how the relative presence of different disciplines in addressing particular SDGs has shifted over time. Our results also provide unique evidence of the increasing interconnection between fields since the 2000s, coinciding with the United Nations' initiative to tackle global societal challenges through interdisciplinary efforts. These insights will benefit policymakers and practitioners as they reflect on past progress and plan for future action, particularly with the SDG target deadline approaching in the next five years.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the intensification of climate change discussion, social media has become prominent in disseminating reliable and unreliable content. In this study, we present a cross-platform analysis on Youtube and Twitter, and examine the polarization and echo chambers in social media discussions in four datasets related to climate change: COP27, IPCC, Climate Refugees, and Do\~{n}ana. We have identified communities of users spreading misinformation on Twitter, although they remain relatively isolated from the rest of the network. The analysis by interaction type reveals that climate change sceptics use mentions to draw the attention of other communities. The YouTube posts referenced on Twitter reveal a strong correlation in the community organisation of social media, suggesting a platform alignment. Moreover, we report the presence of echo chambers in YouTube post-sharing related to mainstream and sceptical content.</description>

      <title>Seeding with Differentially Private Network Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16590v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In public health interventions such as distributing pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention, decision makers rely on seeding algorithms to identify key individuals who can amplify the impact of their interventions. In such cases, constructing a complete sexual activity network is often infeasible due to privacy concerns. Instead, contact tracing can provide influence samples, i.e., sequences of sexual contacts without requiring complete network information. This brings two challenges: protecting individual privacy in the contact data and adapting seeding algorithms to work effectively with incomplete network information. To solve these two problems, we study privacy guarantees for influence maximization algorithms when the social network is unknown and the inputs are samples of prior influence cascades that are collected at random and need privacy protection. Building on recent results that address seeding with costly network information, our privacy-preserving algorithms introduce randomization in the collected data or the algorithm output, and can bound the privacy loss of each node (or group of nodes) in deciding to include their data in the algorithm input. We provide theoretical guarantees of seeding performance with a limited sample size subject to differential privacy budgets in both central and local privacy regimes. Simulations on synthetic random graphs and empirically grounded sexual contacts of men who have sex with men reveal the diminishing value of network information with decreasing privacy budget in both regimes and graceful decrease in performance with decreasing privacy budget in the central regime. Achieving good performance with local privacy guarantees requires relatively higher privacy budgets that confirm our theoretical expectations.</description>

      <title>Line Graph Neural Networks for Link Weight Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In real-world networks, predicting the weight (strength) of links is as crucial as predicting the existence of the links themselves. Previous studies have primarily used shallow graph features for link weight prediction, limiting the prediction performance. In this paper, we propose a new link weight prediction method, namely Line Graph Neural Networks for Link Weight Prediction (LGLWP), which learns deeper graph features through deep learning. In our method, we first extract the enclosing subgraph around a target link and then employ a weighted graph labeling algorithm to label the subgraph nodes. Next, we transform the subgraph into the line graph and apply graph convolutional neural networks to learn the node embeddings in the line graph, which can represent the links in the original subgraph. Finally, the node embeddings are fed into a fully-connected neural network to predict the weight of the target link, treated as a regression problem. Our method directly learns link features, surpassing previous methods that splice node features for link weight prediction. Experimental results on six network datasets of various sizes and types demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Rank-Refining Seed Selection Methods for Budget Constrained Influence Maximisation in Multilayer Networks under Linear Threshold Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of selecting an optimal seed set to maximise influence in networks has been a subject of intense research in recent years. However, despite numerous works addressing this area, it remains a topic that requires further elaboration. Most often, it is considered within the scope of classically defined graphs with a spreading model in the form of Independent Cascades. In this work, we focus on the problem of budget-constrained influence maximisation in multilayer networks using a Linear Threshold Model. Both the graph model and the spreading process we employ are less prevalent in the literature, even though their application allows for a more precise representation of the opinion dynamics in social networks. This paper aims to answer which of the sixteen evaluated seed selection methods is the most effective and how similar they are. Additionally, we focus our analysis on the impact of spreading model parameters, network characteristics, a budget, and the seed selection methods on the diffusion effectiveness in multilayer networks. Our contribution also includes extending several centrality measures and heuristics to the case of such graphs. The results indicate that all the factors mentioned above collectively contribute to the effectiveness of influence maximisation. Moreover, there is no seed selection method which always provides the best results. However, the seeds chosen with VoteRank-based methods (especially with the $v-rnk-m$ variant we propose) usually provide the most extensive diffusion.</description>

Abstract: Social media platforms, particularly Telegram, play a pivotal role in shaping public perceptions and opinions on global and national issues. Unlike traditional news media, Telegram allows for the proliferation of user-generated content with minimal oversight, making it a significant venue for the spread of controversial and misinformative content. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Telegram's popularity surged in Singapore, a country with one of the highest rates of social media use globally. We leverage Singapore-based Telegram data to analyze information flows within groups focused on COVID-19 and climate change. Using k-means clustering, we identified distinct user archetypes, including Strategic Disruptor, Empirical Enthusiast, Inquisitive Moderate, and Critical Examiner, each contributing uniquely to the discourse. We developed a model to classify users into these clusters (Precision: Climate change: 0.99; COVID-19: 0.95).</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive survey of network analysis research on the film industry, aiming to evaluate its emergence as a field of study and identify potential areas for further research. Many foundational network studies made use of the abundant data from the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) to test network methodologies. This survey focuses more specifically on examining research that employs network analysis to evaluate the film industry itself, revealing the social and business relationships involved in film production, distribution, and consumption. The paper adopts a classification approach based on node type and summarizes the key contributions in relation to each. The review provides insights into the structure and interconnectedness of the field, highlighting clusters of debates and shedding light on the areas in need of further theoretical and methodological development. In addition, this survey contributes to understanding film industry network analysis and informs researchers interested in network methods within the film industry and related cultural sectors.</description>

      <title>CrediRAG: Network-Augmented Credibility-Based Retrieval for Misinformation Detection in Reddit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fake news threatens democracy and exacerbates the polarization and divisions in society; therefore, accurately detecting online misinformation is the foundation of addressing this issue. We present CrediRAG, the first fake news detection model that combines language models with access to a rich external political knowledge base with a dense social network to detect fake news across social media at scale. CrediRAG uses a news retriever to initially assign a misinformation score to each post based on the source credibility of similar news articles to the post title content. CrediRAG then improves the initial retrieval estimations through a novel weighted post-to-post network connected based on shared commenters and weighted by the average stance of all shared commenters across every pair of posts. We achieve 11% increase in the F1-score in detecting misinformative posts over state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments conducted on curated real-world Reddit data of over 200,000 posts demonstrate the superior performance of CrediRAG on existing baselines. Thus, our approach offers a more accurate and scalable solution to combat the spread of fake news across social media platforms.</description>

      <title>Sentiment-Driven Community Detection in a Network of Perfume Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Network analysis is increasingly important across various fields, including the fragrance industry, where perfumes are represented as nodes and shared user preferences as edges in perfume networks. Community detection can uncover clusters of similar perfumes, providing insights into consumer preferences, enhancing recommendation systems, and informing targeted marketing strategies.
  This study aims to apply community detection techniques to group perfumes favored by users into relevant clusters for better recommendations. We constructed a bipartite network from user reviews on the Persian retail platform "Atrafshan," with nodes representing users and perfumes, and edges formed by positive comments. This network was transformed into a Perfume Co-Preference Network, connecting perfumes liked by the same users. By applying community detection algorithms, we identified clusters based on shared preferences, enhancing our understanding of user sentiment in the fragrance market.
  To improve sentiment analysis, we integrated emojis and a user voting system for greater accuracy. Emojis, aligned with their Persian counterparts, captured the emotional tone of reviews, while user ratings for scent, longevity, and sillage refined sentiment classification. Edge weights were adjusted by combining adjacency values with user ratings in a 60:40 ratio, reflecting both connection strength and user preferences. These enhancements led to improved modularity of detected communities, resulting in more accurate perfume groupings.
  This research pioneers the use of community detection in perfume networks, offering new insights into consumer preferences. Our advancements in sentiment analysis and edge weight refinement provide actionable insights for optimizing product recommendations and marketing strategies in the fragrance industry.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Hodge Scattering Networks for Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10270v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose new scattering networks for signals measured on simplicial complexes, which we call \emph{Multiscale Hodge Scattering Networks} (MHSNs). Our construction is based on multiscale basis dictionaries on simplicial complexes, i.e., the $\kappa$-GHWT and $\kappa$-HGLET, which we recently developed for simplices of dimension $\kappa \in \mathbb{N}$ in a given simplicial complex by generalizing the node-based Generalized Haar-Walsh Transform (GHWT) and Hierarchical Graph Laplacian Eigen Transform (HGLET). The $\kappa$-GHWT and the $\kappa$-HGLET both form redundant sets (i.e., dictionaries) of multiscale basis vectors and the corresponding expansion coefficients of a given signal. Our MHSNs use a layered structure analogous to a convolutional neural network (CNN) to cascade the moments of the modulus of the dictionary coefficients. The resulting features are invariant to reordering of the simplices (i.e., node permutation of the underlying graphs). Importantly, the use of multiscale basis dictionaries in our MHSNs admits a natural pooling operation that is akin to local pooling in CNNs, and which may be performed either locally or per-scale. These pooling operations are harder to define in both traditional scattering networks based on Morlet wavelets, and geometric scattering networks based on Diffusion Wavelets. As a result, we are able to extract a rich set of descriptive yet robust features that can be used along with very simple machine learning methods (i.e., logistic regression or support vector machines) to achieve high-accuracy classification systems with far fewer parameters to train than most modern graph neural networks. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of our MHSNs in three distinct types of problems: signal classification, domain (i.e., graph/simplex) classification, and molecular dynamics prediction.</description>

      <title>SimMLP: Training MLPs on Graphs without Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08918v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated their effectiveness in various graph learning tasks, yet their reliance on neighborhood aggregation during inference poses challenges for deployment in latency-sensitive applications, such as real-time financial fraud detection. To address this limitation, recent studies have proposed distilling knowledge from teacher GNNs into student Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) trained on node content, aiming to accelerate inference. However, these approaches often inadequately explore structural information when inferring unseen nodes. To this end, we introduce SimMLP, a Self-supervised framework for learning MLPs on graphs, designed to fully integrate rich structural information into MLPs. Notably, SimMLP is the first MLP-learning method that can achieve equivalence to GNNs in the optimal case. The key idea is to employ self-supervised learning to align the representations encoded by graph context-aware GNNs and neighborhood dependency-free MLPs, thereby fully integrating the structural information into MLPs. We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis, demonstrating the equivalence between SimMLP and GNNs based on mutual information and inductive bias, highlighting SimMLP's advanced structural learning capabilities. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments on 20 benchmark datasets, covering node classification, link prediction, and graph classification, to showcase SimMLP's superiority over state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in scenarios involving unseen nodes (e.g., inductive and cold-start node classification) where structural insights are crucial.

      <title>Artificial Intelligence for the Internal Democracy of Political Parties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The article argues that AI can enhance the measurement and implementation of democratic processes within political parties, known as Intra-Party Democracy (IPD). It identifies the limitations of traditional methods for measuring IPD, which often rely on formal parameters, self-reported data, and tools like surveys. Such limitations lead to the collection of partial data, rare updates, and significant demands on resources. To address these issues, the article suggests that specific data management and Machine Learning (ML) techniques, such as natural language processing and sentiment analysis, can improve the measurement (ML about) and practice (ML for) of IPD. The article concludes by considering some of the principal risks of ML for IPD, including concerns over data privacy, the potential for manipulation, and the dangers of overreliance on technology.</description>

      <title>Understanding Sarcoidosis Using Large Language Models and Social Media Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sarcoidosis is a rare inflammatory disease characterized by the formation of granulomas in various organs. The disease presents diagnostic and treatment challenges due to its diverse manifestations and unpredictable nature. In this study, we employed a Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze sarcoidosis-related discussions on the social media platform Reddit. Our findings underscore the efficacy of LLMs in accurately identifying sarcoidosis-related content. We discovered a wide array of symptoms reported by patients, with fatigue, swollen lymph nodes, and shortness of breath as the most prevalent. Prednisone was the most prescribed medication, while infliximab showed the highest effectiveness in improving prognoses. Notably, our analysis revealed disparities in prognosis based on age and gender, with women and younger patients experiencing good and polarized outcomes, respectively. Furthermore, unsupervised clustering identified three distinct patient subgroups (phenotypes) with unique symptom profiles, prognostic outcomes, and demographic distributions. Finally, sentiment analysis revealed a moderate negative impact on patients' mental health post-diagnosis, particularly among women and younger individuals. Our study represents the first application of LLMs to understand sarcoidosis through social media data. It contributes to understanding the disease by providing data-driven insights into its manifestations, treatments, prognoses, and impact on patients' lives. Our findings have direct implications for improving personalized treatment strategies and enhancing the quality of care for individuals living with sarcoidosis.</description>
