      <title>Entanglement in two-quasiparticle-triaxial-rotor systems: Chirality, wobbling, and the Pauli effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the entanglement in two-quasiparticle plus triaxial-rotor (PTR) model for the particle-hole configuration $\pi(1h_{11/2})^1 \otimes \nu(1h_{11/2})^{-1}$, the particle-particle configuration $\pi(1h_{11/2})^1 \otimes \nu(1h_{11/2})^1$, and two-proton particles configuration $\pi(1h_{11/2})^2$ for different values of the triaxiality parameter. The entanglement between the angular momenta of the two quasiparticles and the total angular momentum is quantified by the three bipartite concurrences $\mathcal{C}$ of one type of angular momentum with the other two angular momenta and the area $\mathcal{F}$ of the triangle formed by the bipartite concurrences. Collective chiral and wobbling modes are identified for $\gamma&gt;15^\circ$ via spin coherent state (SCS) maps and spin squeezed state (SSS) plots. Their entanglement increases from moderate values at the band head to near-maximal values at $I=20$. The area $\mathcal{F}$ of the chiral partners changes order as function of $I$ which reflects the crossing of the partner bands as a signature of chirality. For the $\pi(1h_{11/2})^2$ configuration, the antisymmetrization required by the Pauli exclusion principle causes strong entanglement between the two protons, which significantly amplifies the area $\mathcal{F}$. For $\gamma&lt;15^\circ$, the lowest bands become various uniformly rotating quasiparticle configurations, which have large values of $\mathcal{F}$ for all values $I$.</description>

      <title>Assessing effect of local approximation on single folding potential at low and intermediate incident energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To the single folding potentials (SFPs)
  for the nucleon-nucleus ($N$-$A$) elastic scatterings,
  local approximations (LAs) have customarily been applied.
  The LA discussed by Brieva and Rook has been well-known,
  which only needs the density profile as the structure information
  of the target nucleus.
  By applying the M3Y-P6 interaction
  both to the target wave functions and the real part of SFP,
  supplemented with the Koning-Delaroche phenomenological imaginary potential,
  the precision of the Brieva-Rook LA on the SFP is investigated
  for the proton-nucleus elastic scatterings
  at $\epsilon_p=16\,-\,80\,\mathrm{MeV}$ incident energies.
  The analyzing powers as well as the differential cross sections
  are in reasonable agreement with the available data.
  The precision of the LA for the central and LS channels
  is distinctly examined.
  Although the LA works well at small angles
  ($\theta_\mathrm{c.m.}\lesssim 30^\circ$),
  it gives rise to sizable deviation from the results of the non-local SFP
  (\textit{i.e.}, without the LA) at larger angles.
  The results of the non-local SFP are always in better agreement with the data.
  The LA for the LS channel influences the differential cross-sections,
  and the LA for the central channel does the spin observables.
  It is found that the precision of the LA well correlates
  to the momentum transfer $q$,
  and the discrepancy becomes sizable at $q\gtrsim 1.5\,\mathrm{fm}^{-1}$.
  The LA is also examined for a halo nucleus,
  by taking $^{86}$Ni as an example.
  The precision is slightly worse than in stable nuclei.
  Difference from the prediction of the empirical potential
  in the observables of the $p$-$^{86}$Ni scattering is discussed.</description>

      <title>Possible existence of pygmy dipole resonance built on excited states in a neutron-rich $^{80}$Ge nucleus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pygmy dipole resonance (PDR) at the low-lying tail of the giant dipole resonance (GDR) is an interesting research subject as it carries important information about the nuclear surface with mixed isoscalar and isovector vibrations in $N &gt; Z$ systems. The present paper investigates the possible existence of the PDR built on excited states in a neutron-rich $^{80}$Ge nucleus using the phonon damping model (PDM) with and without pairing correlation at zero and finite temperatures. The results obtained within the PDM with exact pairing (EP+PDM) reveal the appearance of two enhanced $\gamma$-transitions $E_\gamma = 7.25$ and 7.35 MeV at $T=0.6$ MeV, which carry the PDR nature and hence implying the possible existence of PDR built on excited states in this nucleus. These two $\gamma$-energies nicely match with a recent experimental observation, thus indicating the crucial role of the inclusion of exact pairing solution in the precise description of low-lying $\gamma$-transitions. The partition function-based analysis shows that this predicted PDR at $T=$ 0.6MeV is mainly contributed by the first $2^+$ excited state of the $^{80}$Ge nucleus. The isospin mixing at the nuclear surface is also observed in the investigated PDR at $T=0.6-0.7$ MeV. The primary mechanism underlying the emergence of the hot PDR is found due to the coupling of GDR phonon to non-collective particle-particle and hole-hole configurations at finite temperatures within the PDM framework, along with the shift in particle-hole excitation energies due to thermal pairing correlations</description>

      <title>Effects of strange molecular partners of $P_c$ states in $\gamma p \to K \Sigma$ reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our previous studies revealed evidence of the strange molecular partners of $P_c$ states, $N(2080)3/2^-$ and $N(2270)3/2^-$, in the $\gamma p \to K^{*+} \Sigma^0 / K^{*0} \Sigma^+$ and $\gamma p \to \phi p$ reactions. Motivated by the differential cross-section data for $\gamma p \to K^+ \Sigma^0$ from CLAS 2010, which exhibits some bump structures at $W \approx$ 1875, 2080 and 2270 MeV, we extend our previous analysis by investigating the effects of $N(1535)1/2^-$, $N(1875)3/2^-$, $N(2080)1/2^- \&amp;\ 3/2^-$ and $N(2270)1/2^- , 3/2^- \&amp;\ 5/2^-$, as strange partners of $P_c$ molecular states, in the reactions $\gamma p \to K^+ \Sigma^0$ and $\gamma p \to K^0 \Sigma^+$. The theoretical model employed in this study utilizes an effective Lagrangian approach in the tree-level Born approximation. It contains the contributions from $s$-channel with exchanges of $N$, $\Delta$, $N^*$ (including the hadronic molecules with hidden strangeness), and $\Delta^*$; $t$-channel; $u$-channel; and the generalized contact term. The results corresponding to the final fitted parameters are in good agreement with all available experimental data of both cross-sections and polarization observables for $\gamma p \to K^+ \Sigma^0$ and $\gamma p \to K^0 \Sigma^+$. Notably, the $s$-channel exchanges of molecules significantly contribute to the bump structures in cross-sections for $\gamma p \to K \Sigma$ at $W \approx$ 1900, 2080 and 2270 MeV, and show considerable coherence with contributions from $s$-channel exchanges of general resonances to construct the overall structures of cross-sections. More abundant experiments, particularly for the reaction $\gamma p \to K^0 \Sigma^+$, are necessary to further strengthen the constraints on the theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Greedy Emulators for Nuclear Two-Body Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Applications of reduced basis method emulators are increasing in low-energy nuclear physics because they enable fast and accurate sampling of high-fidelity calculations, enabling robust uncertainty quantification. In this paper, we develop, implement, and test two model-driven emulators based on (Petrov-)Galerkin projection using the prototypical test case of two-body scattering with the Minnesota potential and a more realistic local chiral potential. The high-fidelity scattering equations are solved with the matrix Numerov method, a reformulation of the popular Numerov recurrence relation for solving special second-order differential equations as a linear system of coupled equations. A novel error estimator based on reduced-space residuals is applied to an active learning approach (a greedy algorithm) to choosing training samples ("snapshots") for the emulator and contrasted with a proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) approach. Both approaches allow for computationally efficient offline-online decompositions, but the greedy approach requires much fewer snapshot calculations. These developments set the groundwork for emulating scattering observables based on chiral nucleon-nucleon and three-nucleon interactions and optical models, where computational speed-ups are necessary for Bayesian uncertainty quantification. Our emulators and error estimators are widely applicable to linear systems.</description>

      <title>Impact of MvdW Equation of State and Neutrino Mass on r and s Process Heavy Element Nucleosynthesis in Spiral, Elliptical and Dwarf Galactic Environments and Kilonovae Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of heavy element production with massive neutrinos in galaxies of varying types (spiral, elliptical, and dwarf) and kilonovae events by incorporating a Multicomponent van der Waals (MvdW) equation of state (EoS) for the opacity functions. This EoS is applied to derive opacities and calculate the yields of isotopes formed in r-process and s-process nucleosynthesis, with and without the influence of neutrino masses or oscillations. We look at both the lanthanide and actinide sequences using the MvdW parameters that involve the interaction strength and excluded volume effects. Our results reflect the characteristic differences found in r and s processes in the synthesis and long-term evolution of isotopes from the U, Th, and Sr chain across galactic environments. The inclusion of neutrino masses enhances the neutron-to-proton ratio, favoring heavier r-process isotopes and altering the overall galactic yields by cross section suppression. These findings offer insights into the interplay of nuclear physics and astrophysical environments, highlighting the sensitivity of nucleosynthetic pathways to EoS modifications and neutrino physics. We compare these results to metallicity profiles of similar models: the Galactic Leaky Box, the Galactic Inflow, and the Galactic Closed Box models and to the kilonova event GW170781.</description>

      <title>Physics with high-luminosity proton-nucleus collisions at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The physics case for the operation of high-luminosity proton-nucleus ($pA$) collisions during Run 3 and 4 at the LHC is reviewed. The collection of $\mathcal{O}$(1-10 pb$^{-1}$) of proton-lead ($p$Pb) collisions at the LHC will provide unique physics opportunities in a broad range of topics including proton and nuclear parton distribution functions (PDFs and nPDFs), generalised parton distributions (GPDs), transverse momentum dependent PDFs (TMDs), low-$x$ QCD and parton saturation, hadron spectroscopy, baseline studies for quark-gluon plasma and parton collectivity, double and triple parton scatterings (DPS/TPS), photon-photon collisions, and physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM); which are not otherwise as clearly accessible by exploiting data from any other colliding system at the LHC. This report summarises the accelerator aspects of high-luminosity $pA$ operation at the LHC, as well as each of the physics topics outlined above, including the relevant experimental measurements that motivate -- much -- larger $pA$ datasets.</description>

      <title>Reflections on Chiral Symmetry within QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05745v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: That chiral symmetry is a crucial feature of the strong force was realized before the discovery of Quantum Chromodynamics. However, the full power it exerts on the structure of the nucleon became apparent only afterwards. We present a high-level and somewhat personal overview of its role in almost every aspect of proton structure, from its mass and spin to the asymmetry of its antimatter content and its strange quark content. The lessons learned from studying the proton are also vital with respect to the modern challenge of the nature of baryon excited states.</description>

      <title>Interface modes in inspiralling neutron stars: A gravitational-wave probe of first-order phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At the extreme densities in neutron stars, a phase transition to deconfined quark matter is anticipated. Yet masses, radii and tidal deformabilities offer only indirect measures of a first-order phase transition, requiring many detections to resolve or being ineffective observables if the discontinuity exists at lower densities. We report on a smoking-gun gravitational-wave signature of a first-order transition: the resonant tidal excitation of an interface mode. Using relativistic perturbation theory with an equation-of-state family informed by chiral effective field theory, we show that such a resonance may be detectable with next-generation interferometers and possibly already with LIGO A+ for sufficiently loud events.</description>

      <title>Ab initio nuclear shape coexistence and emergence of island of inversion around $N=20$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend a nuclear ab initio framework based on chiral two- and three-nucleon interactions to investigate shape coexistence and the degradation of the $N=20$ magic number in both even-even and odd-even magnesium isotopes. The quantum-number projected generator coordinate method, combined with the in-medium similarity renormalization group (IMSRG), is employed to compute their low-lying states. This approach reasonably reproduces the coexistence of weakly and strongly deformed states at comparable energies, and allows us to track the emergence of the $N=20$ island of inversion through the continuous IMSRG evolution of the chiral Hamiltonian. Our results indicate that the ground state of $^{33}$Mg with spin-parity $3/2^-$ is predominantly a strongly deformed configuration with $K^\pi = 3/2^-$, while the lowest $7/2^-$ state is predicted to be a shape isomer, consisting of a mixture of weakly deformed configurations with different $K$ values. The results highlight the essential roles of both dynamical and static collective correlations in reproducing the ordering of nuclear states with distinct shapes.</description>

      <title>Transport coefficients of dense nucleon matter at low temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transport property of cold and dense nucleon matter is important for nuclear physics but is relatively less studied than that at finite temperatures. In this paper, we present a primary study of bulk and shear viscosities in the limit $T/\mu_B \ll 1$, where $T$ and $\mu_B$ are the temperature and the baryon chemical potential. The analysis is performed for a generic system where nucleons are dressed by the condensation of both scalar and vector interactions. Under the relaxation time approximation of the Boltzmann equation, we compute the viscosities of the system to leading power in $T/\mu_B$ expansion and establish a relation between the thermodynamic potential and transport coefficients, including bulk viscosity ($\zeta$) and shear viscosity ($\eta$). It is found that hydrodynamic stability ($\zeta&gt;0$) imposes additional constraints on the thermodynamic potential. As an example, these relations are applied to the Walecka model. The fluid properties of the cold and dense nucleon matter are characterized by the dimensionless combination of viscosities times the quasi-Fermi momentum over the enthalpy. Furthermore, we discuss the implication of the stability condition on the range of applicability of the model.</description>

      <title>Confined but chirally and chiral spin symmetric hot matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate properties of the quark--antiquark mesons at zero and finite temperature in the framework of a solvable chirally symmetric quark model with linear confining potential. The interquark interaction in the model is reminiscent of that derived in Coulomb gauge QCD, with the string tension being the only model parameter. We demonstrate that while the confining interaction induces spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry at T=0, chiral symmetry gets restored at a temperature Tch ~ 90 MeV for the string tension fixed to provide the phenomenological value of the quark condensate. This temperature is similar to Tch ~ 130 MeV observed on the lattice in the chiral limit for N_c=3. The physical mechanism responsible for the chiral symmetry restoration in the confining regime is Pauli blocking of the quark levels, required for the existence of a nonvanishing quark condensate, by the thermal excitations of the quarks and antiquarks. Thus, above the chiral restoration temperature, the meson-like states are chirally symmetric and approximately chiral spin symmetric. A crucial property of the confined meson-like light-light states above Tch is their size that exceeds drastically that in the chirally broken phase below Tch, in contrast to the heavy-heavy mesons that nearly preserve their size irrespective of the temperature. This property is a result of Pauli blocking of the quark and antiquark levels with small momenta. Furthermore, the root-mean-square radius of the states with J=0,1 diverges in the chiral limit. This unexpected property must be a key to understanding unusual features of the hot QCD matter as observed at RHIC and LHC. Consequently, the confining but chirally symmetric matter above Tch can be considered as a dense system of very large and strongly overlapping meson-like states (``strings'').</description>

      <title>$P$-wave charmonium contribution to hidden-charm states from reanalysis of lattice QCD data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reanalyze, considering the contribution of $P$-wave charmonia, lattice data for the $D \bar{D}$-$D_s\bar{D}_s$ coupled-channel of S. Prelovsek et al. [JHEP 06, 035 (2021)] and $D\bar{D}^*$ systems of S. Prelovsek et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 192001 (2013)] with $m_{\pi}\simeq 280$ and $266$ MeV, and $L=24a/32a$ ($a\simeq 0.09$ fm) and $L=16a$ ($a\simeq0.1239(13)$ fm), respectively. The hidden-charm states with $J^{PC}=0^{++}$, $1^{++}$, and $2^{++}$ quantum numbers are then searched for. For $0^{++}$, the analysis reveals three poles in the $D\bar{D}$-$D_s\bar{D}_s$ coupled-channel amplitude, corresponding to three states. Two of these poles, located near the $D\bar{D}$ and $D_s\bar{D}_s$ thresholds, can be interpreted as mostly molecular states. A third pole above the $D_s\bar{D}_s$ threshold is originated from the $P$-wave $\chi_{c0}(2P)$ charmonium state. The number of poles found in the $D\bar D$-$D_s \bar D_s$ system is the same as that found in the original lattice analysis though the position of the third pole changes sizeably. In the $1^{++}$ sector, we find two poles in the complex energy plane. The first one is related to the molecular $X(3872)$ state, with a compositeness exceeding $90\%$, while the second one, stemming from the $\chi_{c1}(2P)$ charmonium, appears above the $D\bar{D}^*$ threshold and it likely corresponds to the recently discovered $\chi_{c1}(4010)$ state. In the $2^{++}$ sector, we also report two poles and find that the dressed $\chi_{c2}(2P)$ is lighter than the $D^*\bar{D}^*$ molecular state, with the dynamics of the latter closely related to that of the heavy-quark spin-symmetry partner of the $X(3872)$. Our exploratory study of the $1^{++}$ and $2^{++}$ sectors offers valuable insights into their dynamics, but given that the fits that we carry out are underconstrained, more lattice data are required to draw robust conclusions.</description>

      <title>Masquerading hybrid stars with dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of dark matter on hybrid stars. Using a two-fluid approach, where normal and dark matter components interact only gravitationally, we explore how dark matter can trigger the appearance of quark matter in neutron stars for unprecedented low masses. Our findings reveal that dark matter increases the central pressure of neutron stars, potentially leading to the formation of hybrid stars with quark cores even at very low compact star masses. The critical mass for the appearance of quark matter decreases with increasing dark matter content. We introduce the concept of "masquerading hybrid stars", where dark matter admixed stars exhibit similar mass-radius relations to purely hadronic stars, making it challenging to distinguish between them based solely on these parameters. Additionally, we identify a unique class of objects termed "dark oysters", characterized by a large dark matter halo and a small normal matter core, highlighting the diverse structural possibilities for compact stars influenced by dark matter.</description>

      <title>Fragmentation functions for axial-vector heavy tetraquarks: A TQ4Q1.1 update</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present and discuss the release of novel sets of collinear, variable-flavor-number-scheme fragmentation functions for axial-vector, fully heavy $T_{4c}(1^{+-})$ and $T_{4b}(1^{+-})$ tetraquarks. Working within the single-parton approximation at leading power and employing nonrelativistic QCD factorization adapted for tetraquark Fock states, we model the initial-scale fragmentation input using a recent calculation for the constituent heavy-quark channel. Standard DGLAP evolution is then applied, ensuring consistent implementation of evolution thresholds. To support phenomenology, we investigate NLL/NLO$^+$ rates for tetraquark-jet systems at the HL-LHC and FCC from (sym)JETHAD. This study further integrates exotic matter explorations with precision QCD calculations.</description>
