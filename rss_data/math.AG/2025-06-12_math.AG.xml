      <title>Hochschild Cohomology of Isotropic Grassmannians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that nonspecial isotropic Grassmannians (that is, all isotropic Grassmannians which are neither (co)adjoint nor (co)minuscule, except $\mathsf{OGr}(n-1, 2n+1)$ for $n\geq 4$), are not Hochschild global, thus establishing a conjecture by P. Belmans and M. Smirnov. As a corollary, we conclude that Bott vanishing fails for all these varieties.</description>

      <title>Failure of Bott vanishing for (co)adjoint partial flag varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bott vanishing is a strong vanishing result for the cohomology of exterior powers of the cotangent bundle twisted by ample line bundles. Buch-Thomsen-Lauritzen-Mehta conjectured that partial flag varieties (which are not products of projective spaces) do not satisfy Bott vanishing, despite all their other nice properties. The cominuscule case is an easy application of the Borel-Weil-Bott theorem, following results of Snow. We show that the (co)adjoint partial flag varieties of all classical and exceptional Dynkin types also do not satisfy Bott vanishing, thus confirming the conjecture for this class of varieties.</description>

      <title>Continuity of the superpotentials and slices of tropical currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the question of the continuity of slices of currents and explain how it relates to several seemingly unrelated problems in tropical geometry. On the one hand, through this lens, we show that the continuity of superpotentials constitutes a very general instance of stable intersection theory in tropical geometry. On the other hand, questions concerning tropicalisation with respect to a non-trivial valuation and the commutativity of tropicalisation with intersections offer insights to the problem of the continuity of slices of currents converging to a tropical current. Within our framework, we reformulate and reprove known theorems in tropical geometry and derive new results and techniques in both tropical geometry and complex dynamical systems.</description>

Abstract: We study the vanishing of triple Massey products for absolutely irreducible smooth projective curves over a number field. For each genus $g &gt; 1$ and each prime $\ell &gt; 3$, we construct examples of hyperelliptic curves of genus $g$ for which there are non-empty triple Massey products with coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}/\ell$ that do not contain $0$.</description>

      <title>Unobstructed deformations for singular Calabi-Yau varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $Y$ be a compact Gorenstein analytic space with only isolated singularities and trivial dualizing sheaf. A recent paper of Imagi studies the deformation theory of $Y$ in case the singularities of $Y$ are weighted homogeneous and rational and $Y$ is K\"ahler. In this note, assuming that $H^1(Y;\mathcal{O}_Y) =0$, we generalize Imagi's results to the case where the singularities of $Y$ are Du Bois, with no assumption that they be weighted homogeneous, and where the K\"ahler assumption is replaced by the hypothesis that there is a resolution of singularities of $Y$ satisfying the $\partial\bar\partial$-lemma. As a consequence, if the singularites of $Y$ are additionally local complete intersections, then the deformations of $Y$ are unobstructed.</description>

      <title>Beilinson--Lichtenbaum phenomenon for motivic cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to study non-$\mathbb{A}^1$-invariant motivic cohomology, recently defined by Elmanto, Morrow, and the first-named author, for smooth schemes over possibly non-discrete valuation rings. We establish that the cycle class map from $p$-adic motivic cohomology to a suitable truncation of Bhatt--Lurie's syntomic cohomology is an isomorphism, thereby verifying the Beilinson--Lichtenbaum conjecture in this generality. As a consequence, we prove that this motivic cohomology integrally recovers the classical definition of motivic cohomology in terms of Bloch's cycle complexes, whenever the latter is defined. Over perfectoid rings, we show that this cohomology theory is actually $\mathbb{A}^1$-invariant, thus partially answering a question of Antieau--Mathew--Morrow. The key ingredient in our approach is a version of Gabber's presentation lemma applicable in mixed characteristic, non-noetherian settings.</description>

Abstract: The goal of this note is to record the following curious fact: let $S$ be an unramified regular local ring of mixed characteristic $p&gt;0$. Let $L$ denote the quotient field of $S$ and $K=L(\omega)$ with $\omega^p\in L$. Let $R$ denote the integral closure of $S$ in $K$. Then $R$ is Cohen-Macaulay if and only if $R$ satisfies Serre's condition $(S_3)$, i.e., the obstruction to the Cohen-Macaulayness of $R$ is in codimension three.</description>

Abstract: We elaborate on how two definitions of the volume of a big cohomology class are consistent. The first definition involves taking the absolutely continuous part of a closed positive current, and the second involves the non-pluripolar product. We also describe how a similar equality holds for the numerical restricted volume introduced by Collins and Tosatti.</description>

      <title>Bubbling of rank two bundles over surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, motivated by the singularity formation of ASD connections in gauge theory, we study an algebraic analogue of the singularity formation of families of rank two holomorphic vector bundles over surfaces. For this, we define a notion of fertile families bearing bubbles and give a characterization of it using the related discriminant. Then we study families that locally form the singularity of the type $\mathcal{O}\oplus \mathcal{I}$ where $\mathcal{I}$ is an ideal sheaf defining points with multiplicities. We prove the existence of fertile families bearing bubbles by using elementary modifications of the original family. As applications, we study bubble trees for a few families that form singularities of low multiplicities and use examples to give negative answers to some plausible general questions.</description>

      <title>Higher Chiral Algebras in a Polysimplicial Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vertex algebras are equivalent to translation-equivariant chiral algebras on $\mathbb{A}^1$, in the sense of Beilinson and Drinfeld. In this paper we give an algebraic construction of a chiral algebra on $\mathbb{A}^n$; this can be seen as an algebraic construction of a higher-dimensional vertex algebra.
  We introduce a model, in dg commutative algebras, of the derived algebra of functions on the configuration space of $k$ distinct labelled marked points in $\mathbb{A}^n$. Working in this model -- which we call the polysimplicial model -- we obtain a dg operad of chiral operations on a degree-shifted copy of the canonical sheaf. We prove that there is a quasi-isomorphism, to this dg operad, from the Lie-infinity operad. This result makes the shifted canonical sheaf into a first example of a homotopy polysimplicial chiral algebra on $\mathbb{A}^n$, in a sense which generalizes to higher dimensions Malikov and Schechtman's notion of a homotopy chiral algebra.</description>

      <title>Geometric effects of hyperbolic cohomology classes on K\"ahler manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of K\"ahler topologically hyperbolic manifold, as a"topological" generalization of K\"ahler [Gro91] and weakly K\"ahler [BDET24] hyperbolic manifolds. Analogously to [BCDT24], we show the birational invariance of this property and then that K\"ahler topologically hyperbolic manifolds are not uniruled nor bimeromorphic to compact K\"ahler manifolds with trivial first real Chern class. Then, we prove spectral gap theorems for positive holomorphic Hermitian vector bundles on K\"ahler topologically hyperbolic manifolds, obtaining in particular effective non vanishing results \`a la Kawamata for adjoint line bundles. We finally explore the effects of K\"ahler topologically hyperbolicity on Ricci and scalar curvature of K\"ahler metrics.</description>

Abstract: We show that for a general rational function $A$ of degree $m \geq 2$, any decomposition of its iterate $A^{\circ n}$, $n \geq 1$, into a composition of indecomposable rational functions is equivalent to the decomposition $A^{\circ n}$ itself. As an application, we prove that if $(A_1, A_2)$ is a general pair of rational functions, then the endomorphism of $\mathbb C\mathbb P^1 \times \mathbb C\mathbb P^1$ given by $(z_1, z_2) \mapsto (A_1(z_1), A_2(z_2))$ admits a periodic curve that is neither a vertical nor a horizontal line if and only if $A_1$ and $A_2$ are conjugate.</description>

Abstract: We study a pair consisting of a smooth variety over a field of positive characteristic and a multi-ideal with a real exponent. We prove the finiteness of the set of minimal log discrepancies for a fixed exponent if the dimension is
  less than or equal to three.
  We also prove that the set of log canonical thresholds (lct for short) of ideals on a smooth variety in positive characteristic
  is contained in the set of lct's of ideals on a smooth variety over C, assuming the dimension is less than or
  equal to three. Under the same dimension assumption, it follows that the accumulation points of log canonical thresholds are rational. Our proofs also show the same statements for the higher dimensional case if all such pairs admit log resolutions by a composite of blow-ups by smooth centers.</description>

Abstract: We construct a local universal Mumford form on a product of Sato Grassmannians using the flow of the Virasoro algebra. The existence of this universal Mumford form furthers the proposal that the Sato Grassmannian provides a universal moduli space with applications to string theory. Our approach using the Virasoro flow is an alternative to using the KP flow, which in particular allows for a bosonic universal Mumford form to be constructed. Applying the same method, we construct a local universal super Mumford form on a product of super Sato Grassmannians using the flow of the Neveu-Schwarz algebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1987, Albert Schwarz suggested a formula which extends the super Mumford form from the moduli space of super Riemann surfaces into the super Sato Grassmannian. His formula is a remarkably simple combination of super tau functions. We compute the Neveu-Schwarz action on super tau functions, and show that Schwarz's extended Mumford form is invariant under the the super Heisenberg-Neveu-Schwarz action, which strengthens Schwarz's proposal that a locus within the Grassmannian can serve as a universal moduli space with applications to superstring theory. Along the way, we construct the Neveu-Schwarz, super Witt, and super Heisenberg formal groups.</description>

      <title>Spencer-Riemann-Roch Theory: Mirror Symmetry of Hodge Decompositions and Characteristic Classes in Constrained Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of mirror symmetry in compatible pair Spencer complex theory brings new theoretical tools to the study of constrained geometry. Inspired by classical Spencer theory and modern Hodge theory, this paper establishes Spencer-Riemann-Roch theory in the context of constrained geometry, systematically studying the mirror symmetry of Spencer-Hodge decompositions and their manifestations in algebraic geometry. We utilize Serre's GAGA principle to algebraic geometrize Spencer complexes, establish coherent sheaf formulations, and reveal the topological essence of mirror symmetry through characteristic class theory. Main results include: Riemann-Roch type Euler characteristic computation formulas for Spencer complexes, equivalence theorems for mirror symmetry of Hodge decompositions at the characteristic class level, and verification of these theories in concrete geometric constructions. Research shows that algebraic geometric methods can not only reproduce deep results from differential geometry, but also reveal the intrinsic structure of mirror symmetry in constrained geometry through characteristic class analysis, opening new directions for applications of Spencer theory in constrained geometry.</description>

      <title>Mirror Symmetry in Geometric Constraints: Analytic and Riemann-Roch Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building upon the discovery of mirror symmetry phenomena in compatible pair Spencer complexes, this paper develops rigorous analytical foundations through systematic application of elliptic perturbation theory and characteristic class analysis. We establish a comprehensive multi-level framework revealing the mathematical mechanisms underlying the symbolic transformation $(D,\lambda) \mapsto (D,-\lambda)$: metric invariance analysis via Spencer metric theory, topological isomorphisms through elliptic operator perturbation methods, and algebraic geometric equivalences via GAGA principle and characteristic class machinery.
  Main results include: (1) Rigorous proof of Spencer-Hodge Laplacian perturbation relations and cohomological mirror isomorphisms using Fredholm theory; (2) Complete characteristic class equivalence theorems establishing algebraic geometric foundations for mirror symmetry; (3) Systematic Spencer-Riemann-Roch decomposition formulas with explicit error estimates on Calabi-Yau manifolds; (4) Computational verification frameworks demonstrated on elliptic curves.
  This research demonstrates that mirror symmetry in constraint geometry possesses deep analytical structure accessible through modern elliptic theory and algebraic geometry, establishing Spencer complexes as a bridge between constraint analysis and contemporary geometric theory.</description>

      <title>Spencer Differential Degeneration Theory and Its Applications in Algebraic Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the compatible pair theory of principal bundle constraint systems, this paper discovers and establishes a complete Spencer differential degeneration theory. We prove that when symmetric tensors satisfy a $\lambda$-dependent kernel condition $\delta_{\mathfrak{g}}^{\lambda}(s)=0$, the Spencer differential degenerates to the standard exterior differential, thus establishing a precise bridge between the complex Spencer theory and the classical de Rham theory. One of the advances in this paper is the rigorous proof that this degeneration condition remains stable under mirror transformations, revealing the profound symmetry origins of this phenomenon. Based on these rigorous mathematical results, we construct a canonical mapping from degenerate Spencer cocycles to de Rham cohomology and elucidate its geometric meaning. Finally, we demonstrate the application potential of this theory in algebraic geometry, particularly on K3 surfaces, where we preliminarily verify that this framework can systematically identify (1,1)-Hodge classes satisfying algebraicity conditions. This work provides new perspectives and technical approaches for studying algebraic invariants using tools from constraint geometry.</description>

      <title>On the connectedness of the singular set of holomorphic foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a codimension 1 singular holomorphic foliation on $\mathbb{P}^3$ and let $Z$ be the union of the 1-dimensional connected components of its singular set; Dominique Cerveau asked in 2013 whether $Z$ is necessarily connected. We prove that if a $k$-dimensional holomorphic foliation on a projective manifold whose determinant bundle of the normal sheaf is ample has a singular set $Z$ of dimension $k-1$, then $Z$ is connected. This can be regarded as providing an obstruction for the integrability of singular holomorphic distributions in the spirit of Bott's work.</description>

Abstract: For a split reductive group ${}^L G$ over a global field, we determine the spectrum of the spherical Hecke algebra coming from the unramified Eisenstein series for the minimal parabolic ${}^L B$. This is done using a certain decomposition of the Springer stack $T^*(B \backslash G/ B)$ for the Langlands dual group in the additive group of cobordisms of cohomologically proper derived quotient stacks.</description>

      <title>Classifying one-dimensional discrete models with maximum likelihood degree one</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.09547v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a classification of all one-dimensional discrete statistical models with maximum likelihood degree one based on their rational parametrization. We show how all such models can be constructed from members of a smaller class of 'fundamental models' using a finite number of simple operations. We introduce 'chipsplitting games', a class of combinatorial games on a grid which we use to represent fundamental models. This combinatorial perspective enables us to show that there are only finitely many fundamental models in the probability simplex $\Delta_n$ for $n\leq 4$.</description>

      <title>Tractable hierarchies of convex relaxations for polynomial optimization on the nonnegative orthant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.06175v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider polynomial optimization problems (POP) on a semialgebraic set contained in the nonnegative orthant (every POP on a compact set can be put in this format by a simple translation of the origin). Such a POP can be converted to an equivalent POP by squaring each variable. Using even symmetry and the concept of factor width, we propose a hierarchy of semidefinite relaxations based on the extension of P\'olya's Positivstellensatz by Dickinson-Povh. As its distinguishing and crucial feature, the maximal matrix size of each resulting semidefinite relaxation can be chosen arbitrarily and in addition, we prove that the sequence of values returned by the new hierarchy converges to the optimal value of the original POP at the rate $O(\varepsilon^{-c})$ if the semialgebraic set has nonempty interior. When applied to (i) robustness certification of multi-layer neural networks and (ii) computation of positive maximal singular values, our method based on P\'olya's Positivstellensatz provides better bounds and runs several hundred times faster than the standard Moment-SOS hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Derived Lie $\infty$-groupoids and algebroids in higher differential geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.05856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study various problems arising in higher differential geometry using {\it derived Lie $\infty$-groupoids and algebroids}.We first study Lie $\infty$-groupoids in various categories of derived geometric objects in differential geometry, including derived manifolds, derived analytic spaces, derived noncommutative spaces, and derived Banach manifolds. We construct category of fibrant objects (CFO) structures in the category of derived Lie $\infty$-groupoids. Then we study $L_{\infty}$-algebroids which are the infinitesimal counterpart of derived Lie $\infty$-groupoids. We then study the homotopical algebras for derived Lie $\infty$-groupoids and algebroids and study their homotopy-coherent representations, which we call $\infty$-representations. We relate $\infty$-representations of $L_{\infty}$-algebroids to (quasi-) cohesive modules developed by Block, and $\infty$-representations of Lie $\infty$-groupoids to $\infty$-local system introduced by Block-Smith. Then we apply these tools in studying singular foliations and their characteristic classes. We construct Atiyah classes for $L_{\infty}$-algebroids pairs. We study singular foliations and their holonomies. We construct $\L_{\infty}$-algebroids for holomorphic singular foliations, and then We study elliptic involutive structures and prove an dg-enhancement of $V$-analytic coherent sheaves. These examples inspire us to define {\it perfect singular foliations}, which is a subcategory of singular foliation but with better homological algebras. Next, we construct various Lie $\infty$-groupoids for singular foliations. Then we study foliations on stacks and higher groupoids. Finally, we prove an $A_{\infty}$ de Rham theorem for foliations, and Riemann-Hilbert correspondence for foliated $\infty$-local system foliated manifolds.</description>

      <title>Weights of mod $p$ automorphic forms and partial Hasse invariants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.16207v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a connected, reductive group $G$ over a finite field endowed with a cocharacter $\mu$, we define the zip cone of $(G,\mu)$ as the cone of all possible weights of mod $p$ automorphic forms on the stack of $G$-zips. This cone is conjectured to coincide with the cone of weights of characteristic $p$ automorphic forms for Hodge-type Shimura varieties of good reduction. We prove in full generality that the cone of weights of characteristic $0$ automorphic forms is contained in the zip cone, which gives further evidence to this conjecture. Furthermore, we determine exactly when the zip cone is generated by the weights of partial Hasse invariants, which is a group-theoretical generalization of a result of Diamond--Kassaei and Goldring--Koskivirta.</description>

      <title>Holomorphic discs of negative Maslov index and extended deformations in mirror symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13010v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The SYZ approach to mirror symmetry for log Calabi-Yau manifolds starts from a Lagrangian torus fibration on the complement of an anticanonical divisor. A mirror space is constructed by gluing local charts (moduli spaces of local systems on generic torus fibers) via wall-crossing transformations which account for corrections to the analytic structure of moduli spaces of objects of the Fukaya category induced by bubbling of Maslov index 0 holomorphic discs, and made into a Landau-Ginzburg model by equipping it with a regular function (the superpotential) which enumerates Maslov index 2 holomorphic discs.
  When they occur, holomorphic discs of negative Maslov index deform this picture by introducing inconsistencies in the wall-crossing transformations, so that the mirror is no longer an analytic space; the geometric features of the corrected mirror can be understood in the language of extended deformations of Landau-Ginzburg models. We illustrate this phenomenon (and show that it actually occurs) by working through the construction for an explicit example (a log Calabi-Yau 4-fold obtained by blowing up a toric variety), and discuss a family Floer approach to the geometry of the corrected mirror in this setting. Along the way, we introduce a Morse-theoretic model for family Floer theory which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Level-Rank Dualities from $\Phi$-Cuspidal Pairs and Affine Springer Fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a generalization of the level-rank dualities arising from Uglov's work on higher-level Fock spaces. The statements use Hecke algebras defined by Brou\'{e}-Malle, which conjecturally describe the endomorphisms of Lusztig induction modules, and a generalization of Harish-Chandra theory due to Brou\'{e}-Malle-Michel. For any generic finite reductive group $\mathbb{G}$ and integers $e, m &gt; 0$, we conjecture that: (1) the intersection of a $\Phi_e$-Harish-Chandra series and a $\Phi_m$-Harish-Chandra series is parametrized by a union of blocks of the Hecke algebra of the $\Phi_e$-cuspidal pair at an $m$th root of unity, and similarly for the Hecke algebra of the $\Phi_m$-cuspidal pair at an $e$th root of unity; (2) these parametrizations match the blocks on the two sides; (3) when two blocks match, the bijection between them lifts to a derived equivalence between associated blocks of rational DAHAs. Surprisingly, these structures also appear in bimodules formed from the cohomology of affine Springer fibers studied by Oblomkov-Yun. When $\mathbb{G} = \mathbb{GL}_n$ and $e, m$ are coprime, we show that (1)-(3) hold, and that (3) recovers the level-rank dualities conjectured by Chuang-Miyachi and later proved through the work of several other people. Finally, we verify for many cases where $\mathbb{G}$ is exceptional that Brou\'{e}-Malle's parameters are numerically compatible with our conjectures.</description>

      <title>Certified algebraic curve projections by path tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05357v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a certified algorithm that takes a smooth algebraic curve in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and computes an isotopic approximation for a generic projection of the curve into $\mathbb{R}^2$. Our algorithm is designed for curves given implicitly by the zeros of $n-1$ polynomials, but it can be partially extended to parametrically defined curves. The main challenge in correctly computing the projection is to guarantee the topological correctness of crossings in the projection. Our approach combines certified path tracking and interval arithmetic in a two-step procedure: first, we construct an approximation to the curve in $\mathbb{R}^n$, and, second, we refine the approximation until the topological correctness of the projection can be guaranteed. We provide a proof-of-concept implementation illustrating the algorithm.</description>
