      <title>Geometrical fingerprints of shear transformation zones in network glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oxide glasses have the structure of disordered covalent networks that are accountable for their mechanical response. Identifying the topological phenomena of the elastic structural response, we statistically backpropagate local regions that have the highest susceptibility of rearrangement. Shear transformation zones in network glasses highly correlate with regions of the highest variance in their bond stretch distributions projected into the direction of macroscopic deformation. However, directional influence is significantly less essential than bond stretch variance, which shows that shear transformation zones in network glasses are mainly state-dependent. Exclusively depending on the local geometry of the initial material state, our indicators are physically informing and can be evaluated directly from images with insignificant computational effort.</description>

      <title>A formally exact real-space representation of the Berry phase on infinite lattices: Applications to dipole and quadrupole moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by Kitaev's real-space representation of Chern numbers, we develop a real-space formulation of the Berry phase for infinite lattices. While the well-known Resta formula for the Berry phase is defined under periodic boundary conditions for finite lattices, our approach constructs the Berry phase directly on an infinite lattice without requiring momentum-space discretization. We apply this method to several disordered models to examine its validity. Furthermore, we attempt to generalize the real-space representation to the quadrupole moment, drawing an analogy to the generalization of the Resta formula for the quadrupole moment.</description>

      <title>Ubiquitous order known as chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A close relation has recently emerged between two of the most fundamental concepts in physics and mathematics: chaos and supersymmetry. In striking contrast to the semantics of the word 'chaos,' the true physical essence of this phenomenon now appears to be a spontaneous order associated with the breakdown of the topological supersymmetry (TS) hidden in all stochastic (partial) differential equations, i.e., in all systems from a broad domain ranging from cosmology to nanoscience. Among the low-hanging fruits of this new perspective, which can be called the supersymmetric theory of stochastic dynamics (STS), are theoretical explanations of 1/f noise and self-organized criticality. Central to STS is the physical meaning of TS breaking order parameter (OP). In this paper, we discuss that the OP is a field-theoretic embodiment of the 'butterfly effect' (BE) -- the infinitely long dynamical memory that is definitive of chaos. We stress that the formulation of the corresponding effective theory for the OP would mark the inception of the first consistent physical theory of the BE. Such a theory, potentially a valuable tool in solving chaos-related problems, would parallel the well-established and successful field theoretic descriptions of superconductivity, ferromagentism and other known orders arising from the spontaneous breakdown of various symmetries of nature.</description>

      <title>Tensor Cross Interpolation of Purities in Quantum Many-Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A defining feature of quantum many-body systems is the exponential scaling of the Hilbert space with the number of degrees of freedom. This exponential complexity na\"ively renders a complete state characterization, for instance via the complete set of bipartite Renyi entropies for all disjoint regions, a challenging task. Recently, a compact way of storing subregions' purities by encoding them as amplitudes of a fictitious quantum wave function, known as entanglement feature, was proposed. Notably, the entanglement feature can be a simple object even for highly entangled quantum states. However the complexity and practical usage of the entanglement feature for general quantum states has not been explored. In this work, we demonstrate that the entanglement feature can be efficiently learned using only a polynomial amount of samples in the number of degrees of freedom through the so-called tensor cross interpolation (TCI) algorithm, assuming it is expressible as a finite bond dimension MPS. We benchmark this learning process on Haar and random MPS states, confirming analytic expectations. Applying the TCI algorithm to quantum eigenstates of various one dimensional quantum systems, we identify cases where eigenstates have entanglement feature learnable with TCI. We conclude with possible applications of the learned entanglement feature, such as quantifying the distance between different entanglement patterns and finding the optimal one-dimensional ordering of physical indices in a given state, highlighting the potential utility of the proposed purity interpolation method.</description>

      <title>The classical limit of Quantum Max-Cut</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well-known in physics that the limit of large quantum spin $S$ should be understood as a semiclassical limit. This raises the question of whether such emergent classicality facilitates the approximation of computationally hard quantum optimization problems, such as the local Hamiltonian problem. We demonstrate this explicitly for spin-$S$ generalizations of Quantum Max-Cut ($\mathrm{QMaxCut}_S$), equivalent to the problem of finding the ground state energy of an arbitrary spin-$S$ quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnet ($\mathrm{QHA}_S$). We prove that approximating the value of $\mathrm{QHA}_S$ to inverse polynomial accuracy is QMA-complete for all $S$, extending previous results for $S=1/2$. We also present two distinct families of classical approximation algorithms for $\mathrm{QMaxCut}_S$ based on rounding the output of a semidefinite program to a product of Bloch coherent states. The approximation ratios for both our proposed algorithms strictly increase with $S$ and converge to the Bri\"et-Oliveira-Vallentin approximation ratio $\alpha_{\mathrm{BOV}} \approx 0.956$ from below as $S \to \infty$.</description>

      <title>A multiscale cavity method for sublinear-rank symmetric matrix factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a statistical model for symmetric matrix factorization with additive Gaussian noise in the high-dimensional regime where the rank $M$ of the signal matrix to infer scales with its size $N$ as $M={\rm o}(\sqrt{\ln N})$. Allowing for an $N$-dependent rank offers new challenges and requires new methods. Working in the Bayes-optimal setting, we show that whenever the signal has i.i.d.~entries, the limiting mutual information between signal and data is given by a variational formula involving a rank-one replica symmetric potential. In other words, from the information-theoretic perspective, the case of a (slowly) growing rank is the same as when $M=1$ (namely, the standard spiked Wigner model). The proof is primarily based on a novel multiscale cavity method allowing for growing rank along with some information-theoretic identities on worst noise for the vector Gaussian channel. We believe that the cavity method developed here will play a role in the analysis of a broader class of inference and spin models where the degrees of freedom are large arrays instead of vectors.</description>

      <title>A fractal geometry immersed in a hierarchical magnetic flux distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fractal geometry presents us with a self-similarity in their pattern at various length scales that is prevalent in our natural world. We present theoretical model of a Sierpinski gasket (SPG) fractal geometry with a deterministic perturbation in the form of a hierarchical distribution of magnetic flux. Such flux configuration induces a deterministic disorder in the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) phases picked up by the electron wavefunction. Using the tight-binding formalism, we show that by tunning the strength of the hierarchy parameter of those AB phases, one can systematically engineer quantum states in a SPG fractal lattice. In addition to this, we have also observed that by controlling the strength of this hierarchy parameter in the magnetic flux, one can effectively regulate the persistent current in the SPG fractal structure. This characteristic is found to be true for various filling factors. Our results could be useful for designing nanoelectronic devices using molecular fractal structures fabricated by chemical synthesis technique.</description>
