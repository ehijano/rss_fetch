      <title>Dynamical analysis of an HIV infection model including quiescent cells and immune response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research gives a thorough examination of an HIV infection model that includes quiescent cells and immune response dynamics in the host. The model, represented by a system of ordinary differential equations, captures the complex interaction between the host's immune response and viral infection. The study focuses on the model's fundamental aspects, such as equilibrium analysis, computing the basic reproduction number $\mathcal{R}_0$, stability analysis, bifurcation phenomena, numerical simulations, and sensitivity analysis.
  The analysis reveals both an infection equilibrium, which indicates the persistence of the illness, and an infection-free equilibrium, which represents disease control possibilities. Applying matrix-theoretical approaches, stability analysis proved that the infection-free equilibrium is both locally and globally stable for $\mathcal{R}_0 &lt; 1$. For the situation of $\mathcal{R}_0 &gt; 1$, the infection equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable via the Routh--Hurwitz criterion. We also studied the uniform persistence of the infection, demonstrating that the infection remains present above a positive threshold under certain conditions. The study also found a transcritical forward-type bifurcation at $\mathcal{R}_0 = 1$, indicating a critical threshold that affects the system's behavior. The model's temporal dynamics are studied using numerical simulations, and sensitivity analysis identifies the most significant variables by assessing the effects of parameter changes on system behavior.</description>

      <title>A Study on the Specialist Predator with the Allee Effect on the Prey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predator-prey models in theoretical ecology have a long and complex history, spanning decades of research. Most of the models rely upon simple reproduction and mortality rates associated with different types of functional responses. A key development in this field occurred with the introduction of a density dependent reproduction rate, originally introduced by Allee. In this manuscript, a new function representing the Allee effect is introduced and justified from the ecological point of view. This paper aims to analyze predator-prey models incorporating Holling type-I and II functional responses, influenced by this new Allee function. A rich dynamics shows up in the presence of the said function, including the emergence of the limit cycles through the Hopf bifurcation for a particular parameter domain.</description>

      <title>Phylogenetic Corrections and Higher-Order Sequence Statistics in Protein Families: The Potts Model vs MSA Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent generative learning models applied to protein multiple sequence alignment (MSA) datasets include simple and interpretable physics-based Potts covariation models and other machine learning models such as MSA-Transformer (MSA-T). The best models accurately reproduce MSA statistics induced by the biophysical constraints within proteins, raising the question of which functional forms best model the underlying physics. The Potts model is usually specified by an effective potential including pairwise residue-residue interaction terms, but it has been suggested that MSA-T can capture the effects induced by effective potentials which include more than pairwise interactions and implicitly account for phylogenetic structure in the MSA. Here we compare the ability of the Potts model and MSA-T to reconstruct higher-order sequence statistics reflecting complex biological sequence constraints. We find that the model performance depends greatly on the treatment of phylogenetic relationships between the sequences, which can induce non-biophysical mutational covariation in MSAs. When using explicit corrections for phylogenetic dependencies, we find the Potts model outperforms MSA-T in detecting epistatic interactions of biophysical origin.</description>
