      <title>Are Generics and Negativity about Social Groups Common on Social Media? A Comparative Analysis of Twitter (X) Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generics (unquantified generalizations) are thought to be pervasive in communication and when they are about social groups, this may offend and polarize people because generics gloss over variations between individuals. Generics about social groups might be particularly common on Twitter (X). This remains unexplored, however. Using machine learning (ML) techniques, we therefore developed an automatic classifier for social generics, applied it to more than a million tweets about people, and analyzed the tweets. We found that most tweets (78%) about people contained no generics. However, tweets with social generics received more 'likes' and retweets. Furthermore, while recent psychological research may lead to the prediction that tweets with generics about political groups are more common than tweets with generics about ethnic groups, we found the opposite. However, consistent with recent claims that political animosity is less constrained by social norms than animosity against gender and ethnic groups, negative tweets with generics about political groups were significantly more prevalent and retweeted than negative tweets about ethnic groups. Our study provides the first ML-based insights into the use and impact of social generics on Twitter.</description>

      <title>CTRL: Continuous-Time Representation Learning on Temporal Heterogeneous Information Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inductive representation learning on temporal heterogeneous graphs is crucial for scalable deep learning on heterogeneous information networks (HINs) which are time-varying, such as citation networks. However, most existing approaches are not inductive and thus cannot handle new nodes or edges. Moreover, previous temporal graph embedding methods are often trained with the temporal link prediction task to simulate the link formation process of temporal graphs, while ignoring the evolution of high-order topological structures on temporal graphs. To fill these gaps, we propose a Continuous-Time Representation Learning (CTRL) model on temporal HINs. To preserve heterogeneous node features and temporal structures, CTRL integrates three parts in a single layer, they are 1) a \emph{heterogeneous attention} unit that measures the semantic correlation between nodes, 2) a \emph{edge-based Hawkes process} to capture temporal influence between heterogeneous nodes, and 3) \emph{dynamic centrality} that indicates the dynamic importance of a node. We train the CTRL model with a future event (a subgraph) prediction task to capture the evolution of the high-order network structure. Extensive experiments have been conducted on three benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate that our model significantly boosts performance and outperforms various state-of-the-art approaches. Ablation studies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the model design.</description>

      <title>Community detection in bipartite signed networks is highly dependent on parameter choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decision-making processes often involve voting. Human interactions with exogenous entities such as legislations or products can be effectively modeled as two-mode (bipartite) signed networks-where people can either vote positively, negatively, or abstain from voting on the entities. Detecting communities in such networks could help us understand underlying properties: for example ideological camps or consumer preferences. While community detection is an established practice separately for bipartite and signed networks, it remains largely unexplored in the case of bipartite signed networks. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the efficacy of community detection methods on bipartite signed networks using a synthetic benchmark and real-world datasets. Our findings reveal that when no communities are present in the data, these methods often recover spurious communities. When communities are present, the algorithms exhibit promising performance, although their performance is highly susceptible to parameter choice. This indicates that researchers using community detection methods in the context of bipartite signed networks should not take the communities found at face value: it is essential to assess the robustness of parameter choices or perform domain-specific external validation.</description>

      <title>Facilitating Feature and Topology Lightweighting: An Ethereum Transaction Graph Compression Method for Malicious Account Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ethereum has become one of the primary global platforms for cryptocurrency, playing an important role in promoting the diversification of the financial ecosystem. However, the relative lag in regulation has led to a proliferation of malicious activities in Ethereum, posing a serious threat to fund security. Existing regulatory methods usually detect malicious accounts through feature engineering or large-scale transaction graph mining. However, due to the immense scale of transaction data and malicious attacks, these methods suffer from inefficiency and low robustness during data processing and anomaly detection. In this regard, we propose an Ethereum Transaction Graph Compression method named TGC4Eth, which assists malicious account detection by lightweighting both features and topology of the transaction graph. At the feature level, we select transaction features based on their low importance to improve the robustness of the subsequent detection models against feature evasion attacks; at the topology level, we employ focusing and coarsening processes to compress the structure of the transaction graph, thereby improving both data processing and inference efficiency of detection models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TGC4Eth significantly improves the computational efficiency of existing detection models while preserving the connectivity of the transaction graph. Furthermore, TGC4Eth enables existing detection models to maintain stable performance and exhibit high robustness against feature evasion attacks.</description>

      <title>How to Surprisingly Consider Recommendations? A Knowledge-Graph-based Approach Relying on Complex Network Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional recommendation proposals, including content-based and collaborative filtering, usually focus on similarity between items or users. Existing approaches lack ways of introducing unexpectedness into recommendations, prioritizing globally popular items over exposing users to unforeseen items. This investigation aims to design and evaluate a novel layer on top of recommender systems suited to incorporate relational information and suggest items with a user-defined degree of surprise. We propose a Knowledge Graph (KG) based recommender system by encoding user interactions on item catalogs. Our study explores whether network-level metrics on KGs can influence the degree of surprise in recommendations. We hypothesize that surprisingness correlates with certain network metrics, treating user profiles as subgraphs within a larger catalog KG. The achieved solution reranks recommendations based on their impact on structural graph metrics. Our research contributes to optimizing recommendations to reflect the metrics. We experimentally evaluate our approach on two datasets of LastFM listening histories and synthetic Netflix viewing profiles. We find that reranking items based on complex network metrics leads to a more unexpected and surprising composition of recommendation lists.</description>

      <title>Precarious Experiences: Citizens' Frustrations, Anxieties and Burdens of an Online Welfare Benefit System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a significant overlap between people who are supported by income-related social welfare benefits, often in precarious situations, and those who experience greater digital exclusion. We report on a study of claimants using the UK's Universal Credit online welfare benefit system designed as, and still, "digital by default". Through data collection involving remote interviews (n=11) and online surveys (n=66), we expose claimants' own lived experiences interacting with this system. The claimants explain how digital channels can contribute to an imbalance of power and agency, at a time when their own circumstances mean they have reduced abilities, resources and capacities, and where design choices can adversely affect people's utility to leverage help from their own wider socio-technical ecosystems. We contribute eight recommendations from these accounts to inform the future design and development of digital welfare benefit systems for this population, to reduce digital barriers and harms.</description>

      <title>Refinement of an Epilepsy Dictionary through Human Annotation of Health-related posts on Instagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We used a dictionary built from biomedical terminology extracted from various sources such as DrugBank, MedDRA, MedlinePlus, TCMGeneDIT, to tag more than 8 million Instagram posts by users who have mentioned an epilepsy-relevant drug at least once, between 2010 and early 2016. A random sample of 1,771 posts with 2,947 term matches was evaluated by human annotators to identify false-positives. OpenAI's GPT series models were compared against human annotation. Frequent terms with a high false-positive rate were removed from the dictionary. Analysis of the estimated false-positive rates of the annotated terms revealed 8 ambiguous terms (plus synonyms) used in Instagram posts, which were removed from the original dictionary. To study the effect of removing those terms, we constructed knowledge networks using the refined and the original dictionaries and performed an eigenvector-centrality analysis on both networks. We show that the refined dictionary thus produced leads to a significantly different rank of important terms, as measured by their eigenvector-centrality of the knowledge networks. Furthermore, the most important terms obtained after refinement are of greater medical relevance. In addition, we show that OpenAI's GPT series models fare worse than human annotators in this task.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Scalable Graph Generation through Iterative Local Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11529v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the realm of generative models for graphs, extensive research has been conducted. However, most existing methods struggle with large graphs due to the complexity of representing the entire joint distribution across all node pairs and capturing both global and local graph structures simultaneously. To overcome these issues, we introduce a method that generates a graph by progressively expanding a single node to a target graph. In each step, nodes and edges are added in a localized manner through denoising diffusion, building first the global structure, and then refining the local details. The local generation avoids modeling the entire joint distribution over all node pairs, achieving substantial computational savings with subquadratic runtime relative to node count while maintaining high expressivity through multiscale generation. Our experiments show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on well-established benchmark datasets while successfully scaling to graphs with at least 5000 nodes. Our method is also the first to successfully extrapolate to graphs outside of the training distribution, showcasing a much better generalization capability over existing methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel model-selection method for dynamic networks. Our approach involves training a classifier on a large body of synthetic network data. The data is generated by simulating nine state-of-the-art random graph models for dynamic networks, with parameter range chosen to ensure exponential growth of the network size in time. We design a conceptually novel type of dynamic features that count new links received by a group of vertices in a particular time interval. The proposed features are easy to compute, analytically tractable, and interpretable. Our approach achieves a near-perfect classification of synthetic networks, exceeding the state-of-the-art by a large margin. Applying our classification method to real-world citation networks gives credibility to the claims in the literature that models with preferential attachment, fitness and aging fit real-world citation networks best, although sometimes, the predicted model does not involve vertex fitness.</description>

      <title>ReeSPOT: Reeb Graph Models Semantic Patterns of Normalcy in Human Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces ReeSPOT, a novel Reeb graph-based method to model patterns of life in human trajectories (akin to a fingerprint). Human behavior typically follows a pattern of normalcy in day-to-day activities. This is marked by recurring activities within specific time periods. In this paper, we model this behavior using Reeb graphs where any deviation from usual day-to-day activities is encoded as nodes in the Reeb graph. The complexity of the proposed algorithm is linear with respect to the number of time points in a given trajectory. We demonstrate the usage of ReeSPOT and how it captures the critically significant spatial and temporal deviations using the nodes of the Reeb graph. Our case study presented in this paper includes realistic human movement scenarios: visiting uncommon locations, taking odd routes at infrequent times, uncommon time visits, and uncommon stay durations. We analyze the Reeb graph to interpret the topological structure of the GPS trajectories. Potential applications of ReeSPOT include urban planning, security surveillance, and behavioral research.</description>

      <title>Robust Reward Placement under Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05433v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a problem of placing generators of rewards to be collected by randomly moving agents in a network. In many settings, the precise mobility pattern may be one of several possible, based on parameters outside our control, such as weather conditions. The placement should be robust to this uncertainty, to gain a competent total reward across possible networks. To study such scenarios, we introduce the Robust Reward Placement problem (RRP). Agents move randomly by a Markovian Mobility Model with a predetermined set of locations whose connectivity is chosen adversarially from a known set $\Pi$ of candidates. We aim to select a set of reward states within a budget that maximizes the minimum ratio, among all candidates in $\Pi$, of the collected total reward over the optimal collectable reward under the same candidate. We prove that RRP is NP-hard and inapproximable, and develop $\Psi$-Saturate, a pseudo-polynomial time algorithm that achieves an $\epsilon$-additive approximation by exceeding the budget constraint by a factor that scales as $O(\ln |\Pi|/\epsilon)$. In addition, we present several heuristics, most prominently one inspired by a dynamic programming algorithm for the max-min 0-1 KNAPSACK problem. We corroborate our analysis with an experimental evaluation of the methods in both synthetic and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Improved bounds for polylogarithmic graph distances in scale-free percolation and related models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study graph distances in the geometric random graph models scale-free percolation SFP, geometric inhomogeneous random graphs GIRG, and hyperbolic random graphs HRG. Despite the wide success of the models, the parameter regime in which graph distances are polylogarithmic is poorly understood. We provide new and improved lower bounds. In a certain portion of the parameter regime, those match the known upper bounds.
  Compared to the best previous lower bounds by Hao and Heydenreich, our result has several advantages: it gives matching bounds for a larger range of parameters, thus settling the question for a larger portion of the parameter space. It strictly improves the lower bounds by Hao and Heydenreich for all parameters settings in which those bounds were not tight. It gives tail bounds on the probability of having short paths, which imply shape theorems for the $k$-neighbourhood of a vertex whenever our lower bounds are tight, and tight bounds for the size of this $k$-neighbourhood. And last but not least, our proof is much simpler and not much longer than two pages, and we demonstrate that it generalizes well by showing that the same technique also works for first passage percolation.</description>
