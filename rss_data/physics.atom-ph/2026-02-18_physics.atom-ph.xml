      <title>Strong Collective Chiroptical Response from Electric-Dipole Interactions in Atomic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiroptical responses in atomic systems are usually weak, as they arise from the interference between electric- and much weaker magnetic-dipole transitions. We show that atoms arranged in chiral geometries can instead exhibit a strong collective chiroptical response mediated entirely by electric-dipole interactions. Using a coupled-dipole framework, we identify a regime of pronounced chiroptical response emerging at subwavelength interatomic separations, which can be tuned by the probe frequency. This enhancement is directly linked to the formation of subradiant collective modes. Our results establish a fundamental connection between geometric chirality and collective light-matter interactions, opening new pathways for engineering and exploiting chiral optical responses in atomic systems.</description>

      <title>Highly correlated electronic bounding and spin effect: confirmation of an autodetaching state of O$^-$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of an auto-detaching state of O$^-$ with a lifetime on the scale of a hundred nanoseconds is demonstrated both experimentally and theoretically. The O$^-$ lifetime values are determined using two recently developed methods. The experimental approach is based on a derivation from measured electron-loss cross sections combined with time-of-flight spectrometry. For the theoretical approach, the continued Green's function within the formalism of Fano-Feshbach is applied. We present the measured lifetime value of $100 \pm 10 \text{ ns}$. The calculated lifetime value is 75 ns, and is associated with the (2p$^3$3s$^2$)$^4$S state of O$^-$. We discuss how the existence of a 100-ns-lifetime oxygen metastable anion can impact the modeling of oxygen-containing systems.</description>

      <title>Relativistic nuclear recoil effects in hyperfine splitting of hydrogenic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The finite nuclear mass $(Z\,\alpha)^2\,m/M\,E_F$ correction to the hyperfine splitting in hydrogenic systems is calculated using a combined relativistic heavy particle and nonrelativistic quantum electrodynamics. The obtained results are in disagreement with previous calculations by Bodwin and Yennie [Phys. Rev. D {\bf 37}, 498 (1988)]. The comparison of improved theoretical predictions with the corresponding measurements in hydrogen reveals $5\sigma$ discrepancy, which indicates problems with the proton structure corrections.</description>

      <title>State-selected preparation of molecular ions for precision measurements in radio-frequency traps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of mass-analyzed threshold ionization (MATI) for the state-selective preparation of molecular ions is presented. Based on photoexcitation of long-lived high-$n$ Rydberg states, molecular ions are prepared in a single rovibronic level by pulsed-field ionization. We present a theoretical analysis and a recipe for obtaining an optimal energy ratio between such selected ions and molecular ions in unwanted rovibronic states, created by direct photoionization. It is shown that the second-order chromatic aberration of a dc quadrupole bender can be used to isolate the state-selectively prepared molecular ions. The phase-space properties of ions prepared by MATI are ideally suited for axial injection into a linear radio-frequency trap. A modified approach for carrying out MATI within such an ion trap is also described.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Rydberg electron orbit manipulation with optical tweezers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser cooling and trapping of atomic matter waves in optical potentials has enabled rapid progress in quantum science, particularly when combined with Rydberg excitation of the atoms to induce long-range interactions. Here, we propose the local manipulation and spatio-temporal sculpting of the electronic matter wave of a Rydberg atom by a laser field focused so that its beam width is smaller than the Rydberg electron orbit. We compute the electronic eigenstates in the presence of a sharply focused Gaussian laser beam, and find strong Rydberg state mixing leading to large kilo-Debye dipole moments. These can be modulated with high bandwidth controlled by the local tweezer intensity. Oscillations in the position-dependent level shifts, analogous to the potential wells allowing ultralong-range Rydberg molecules to form, provide opportunities to trap the Rydberg atom in an eccentric way via ponderomotive forces acting on sub-orbital length scales.</description>

      <title>GPS constellation search for exotic physics messengers coincident with the binary neutron star merger GW170817</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Global Positioning System (GPS) includes a continuously operating, planet-scale network of atomic clocks that, beyond navigation and time dissemination, enables precision tests of fundamental physics. Here we use GPS carrier phase archival data to perform a retrospective search for exotic low-mass fields (ELFs) that might be emitted by the binary neutron-star merger GW170817, complementing gravitational wave and electromagnetic modalitiesnin multi-messenger astronomy. Such ultra-relativistic fields would imprint a dispersive, anti-chirp signature in clock-frequency time series, delayed with respect to the LIGO-Virgo gravitational wave detection. We construct network-median pseudo-frequency data from eighteen Rb satellite clocks referenced to a terrestrial hydrogen maser and conduct a template-bank search spanning ELF pulse duration, arrival delay, and characteristic frequency. No statistically significant signal is observed after accounting for noise statistics and template-bank trials. We derive 95\% confidence-level lower bounds on the interaction energy scale $\Lambda_\alpha$ of quadratic couplings driving variations in electromagnetic fine-structure constant. These limits improve upon existing astrophysical and gravity-test constraints across the ELF-energy range $\approx10^{-18}$--$10^{-14}\,\mathrm{eV}$. This demonstrates that mature global satellite-clock networks provide an observational capability for retrospective, multi-messenger searches for new physics using decades of archival timing data.</description>

      <title>Electron recollisional excitation of OCS$^+$ in phase-locked $\omega + 2\omega$ intense laser fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14148v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photoelectron-photoion coincidence momentum imaging has been performed to investigate excitation processes on dissociative ionization of OCS, OCS $\to$ OCS$^+$ + e$^-$ $\to$ OC + S$^+$ + e$^-$, in phase-locked $\omega + 2\omega$ intense laser fields. The electron kinetic energy spectra depend on coincidentally produced ion species, OCS$^+$ or S$^+$. The observed electron momentum distribution shows clear asymmetry along the laser polarization direction with a 2$\pi$-oscillation period as a function of the phase difference between the $\omega$ and $2\omega$ laser fields. The asymmetry of electron emission in the OCS$^+$ channel flips at the electron kinetic energy of 8.2 eV where the dominant scattering direction switches from forward to backward. In the S$^+$ channel, the asymmetry flips at the lower kinetic energy of 4.2 eV. In comparison with a classical trajectory Monte Carlo simulation, it has been clarified that this energy shift between the OCS$^+$ and S$^+$ channels corresponds to the excitation energy of the parent ion and that electron recollisional excitation takes place to form the fragment ion in intense laser fields.</description>

      <title>Measurements of diffusion coefficients for rubidium--inert gas mixtures using coherent scattering from optically pumped population gratings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present comprehensive determinations of the diffusion coefficients $D$ at $T=24\,\degree$C for trace amounts of naturally abundant Rb atoms in inert, naturally abundant He, Ne, N$_2$, Ar, Kr, and Xe buffer gases using a single measurement technique. We establish a spatially periodic population grating in the Rb sample using two laser beams that intersect at a small angle $\theta$ of a few milliradians. The atomic population grating decays exponentially in time due to diffusive motion induced by momentum-changing elastic collisions between Rb and buffer gas atoms or molecules, and is monitored by observing the scattered field from a read-out beam. We distinguish the contribution of diffusion from other collisional processes by measuring the characteristic $\theta^2$ dependence of the decay rate. We also measure the systematic dependence of the decay rate on the buffer gas pressure over a range of $7\,000$ Pa to $90\,000$ Pa. In this manner, we obtain diffusion coefficients at standard atmospheric pressure of $101\,325$ Pa and at a temperature of 24.0(5)~$^\circ$C. We obtain weighted averages of $0.33(5)$ cm$^2$/s, $0.214(14)$ cm$^2$/s, $0.132(7)$ cm$^2$/s, $0.123(9)$ cm$^2$/s, $0.093(9)$ cm$^2$/s, and $0.073(4)$ cm$^2$/s for Rb in He, Ne, N$_2$, Ar, Kr, and Xe, respectively. We compare this data with diffusion coefficients obtained using quantum, classical, and semi-classical theoretical methods based on the most accurate interatomic interaction potentials from the literature. Our computed diffusion coefficients based on the quantum theory agree with the experimental determinations when systematic effects are taken into account. Our measurements and modeling are relevant to the optimization of magnetometers, imaging using spin-polarized noble gases, tests of collision models based on interatomic potentials, and the development of pressure sensors.</description>

      <title>Fundamentals of Trapped Ions and Quantum Simulation of Chemical Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trapped atomic ions are among the most advanced platforms for quantum simulation, computation, and metrology, offering long coherence times and precise, individual control over both internal and motional degrees of freedom. In this review, we present a pedagogical introduction to trapped-ion systems, covering the physics of ion trapping, qubit encodings, and laser-ion interactions. We explain how spin-dependent forces generated by light fields enable both analog and digital quantum simulations of spin and spin-boson models, as well as high-fidelity quantum logic gates. We then highlight an emerging frontier in the simulation of chemical dynamics, summarizing recent experiments that demonstrate the capability of trapped ions to simulate vibronic models and excitation-transfer processes. Finally, we outline future directions in quantum simulation and discuss open challenges in scaling up trapped-ion architectures.</description>
