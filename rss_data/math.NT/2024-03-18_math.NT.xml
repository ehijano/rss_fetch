      <title>Consecutive primes and IP sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an infinite set M of natural numbers, let FS(M) be the set of all nonzero finite sums of distinct numbers in M. An IP set is any set of the form FS(M). Let p_n denote the n-th prime number for each $n \ge 1$. A de Polignac number is any number m such that $p_{n+1}-p_n=m$ for infinitely many n. In this note, we show that every IP set of even natural numbers contains infinitely many de Polignac numbers.</description>

      <title>On the Piatetski-Shapiro construction for integral models of Shimura varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Piatetski-Shapiro construction, which takes a totally real field F and a Shimura datum (G,X) and produces a new Shimura datum (H,Y). If F is Galois, then the Galois group Gamma of F acts on (H,Y), and we show that the Gamma-fixed points of the Shimura varieties for (H,Y) recover the Shimura varieties for (G,X) under some hypotheses. For Shimura varieties of Hodge type with parahoric level, we show that the same is true for the p-adic integral models constructed by Pappas--Rapoport, if p is unramified in F. We also study the Gamma-fixed points of the Igusa stacks of Zhang for (H,Y) and prove optimal results.</description>

      <title>On the Classification of Modular Congruence Families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Congruence families, i.e., $\ell$-adic convergence for well-defined arithmetic subsequences, is a commonplace phenomenon for the coefficients of modular forms. Such families superficially resemble one another, but they often vary substantially in difficulty. Moreover, the critical difficulties associated with a given family will generally manifest themselves at the end stages of an attempted proof. We give a conjectured classification system of congruence families for the coefficients of modular eta quotients by studying the topology of the associated modular curve.</description>

      <title>Relatively prime pairs in the Piatetski-Shapiro sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove an asymptotic formula for the number of relatively prime pairs in the Piatetski-Shapiro sequence of arbitrarily large order. This improves the result of Pimsert, Srichan and Tangsupphathawat (2023), the order of which was restricted to be $&lt;\frac{3}{2}$. The key ingredients of the proof are a simple averaging trick and an extension of Deshouillers' result on the distribution of the Piatetski-Shapiro sequence in arithmetic progressions.</description>

Abstract: Denote by $S_n(x,y)$ the length of the longest common substring of $x$ and $y$ with shifts in their first $n$ digits of $b$-ary expansions. We show that the sets of pairs $(x,y)$, for which the growth rate of $S_n(x,y)$ is $\alpha \log n$ with $0\le \alpha \le \infty$, have full Hausdorff dimension.</description>

      <title>The Duffin-Schaeffer Conjecture for multiplicative Diophantine approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a monotonically decreasing $\psi: \mathbb{N} \to [0,\infty)$, Khintchine's Theorem provides an efficient tool to decide whether, for almost every $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$, there are infinitely many $(p,q) \in \mathbb{Z}^2$ such that $\left\lvert \alpha - \frac{p}{q}\right\rvert \leq \frac{\psi(q)}{q}$. The recent result of Koukoulopoulos and Maynard provides an elegant way of removing monotonicity when only counting reduced fractions. Gallagher showed a multiplicative higher-dimensional generalization to Khintchine's Theorem, again assuming monotonicity. In this article, we prove the following Duffin-Schaeffer-type result for multiplicative approximations: For any $k\geq 1$, any function $\psi: \mathbb{N} \to [0,1/2]$ (not necessarily monotonic) and almost every $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}^k$, there exist infinitely many $q$ such that $\prod\limits_{i=1}^k \left\lvert \alpha_i - \frac{p_i}{q}\right\rvert \leq \frac{\psi(q)}{q^k}, p_1,\ldots,p_k$ all coprime to $q$, if and only if \[\sum\limits_{q \in \mathbb{N}} \psi(q) \left(\frac{\varphi(q)}{q} \right)^k\log \left(\frac{q}{\varphi(q)\psi(q)}\right)^{k-1} = \infty.\] This settles a conjecture of Beresnevich, Haynes, and Velani.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f$ be a normalized newform of weight 2 on $\Gamma_0(N)$ whose coefficients lie in $\mathbb{Q}$ and let $\chi_M$ be a primitive quadratic Dirichlet character with conductor $M$. In this paper, under mild assumptions on $M$, we give a sharp lower bound of the 2-adic valuation of the algebraic central $L$-value $L(f, \chi_M, 1)$ and evaluate the 2-adic valuation for an infinite number of $M$.</description>

      <title>Adelic approximation on spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish an adelic version of Dirichlet's approximation theorem on spheres. Let $K$ be a number field, $E$ be a rigid adelic space over $K$ and $q\colon E\to K$ be a quadratic form. Let $v$ be a place of $K$ and $\alpha\in E\otimes_{K}K_{v}$ such that $q(\alpha)=1$. We produce an explicit constant $c$ having the following property. If there exists $x\in E$ such that $q(x)=1$ then, for any $T&gt;c$, there exists $(\upupsilon,\upphi)\in E\times K$, with $\max{(\Vert\upupsilon\Vert_{E,v},\vert\upphi\vert_{v})}\le T$ and $\max{(\Vert\upupsilon\Vert_{E,w},\vert\upphi\vert_{w})}$ controlled for any place $w$, satisfying $q(\upupsilon)=\upphi^{2}\ne 0$ and $\vert q(\alpha\upphi-\upupsilon)\vert_{v}\le c\vert\upphi\vert_{v}/T$. This remains true for some infinite algebraic extensions as well as for a compact set of places of $K$. Our statements generalize and improve on earlier results by Kleinbock \\&amp; Merrill (2015) and Moshchevitin (2017). The proofs rely on the quadratic Siegel's lemma in a rigid adelic space obtained by the author and R{\'e}mond (2017).</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we extend the arithmetic intersection theory of adelic divisors on quasiprojective varieties developed by X. Yuan and S. W. Zhang to cover certain adelic arithmetic divisors that are not nef nor integrable. The key concept used in this extension is the relative finite energy introduced by T. Darvas, E. Di Nezza, and C. H. Lu. As an application we compute the arithmetic self-intersection number of the line bundle of Siegel-Jacobi forms on the universal abelian variety endowed with its invariant hermitian metric. The techniques developed in this paper can be applied in many other situations like mixed Shimura varieties or the moduli space of stable marked curves.</description>

Abstract: In this article we prove that linear differential equations with only algebraic solutions have zero $m$-curvature modulo $p^k$ for all except a finite number of primes $p$ and all $k,m\in\mathbb N$ with ${\rm ord}_pm!\geq k$. This provides us with a reformulation of Grothendieck-Katz conjecture with stronger hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Galois groups of random polynomials over the rational function field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a fixed prime power $q$ and natural number $d$ we consider a random polynomial $$f=x^n+a_{n-1}(t)x^{n-1}+\ldots+a_1(t)x+a_0(t)\in\mathbb F_q[t][x]$$ with $a_i$ drawn uniformly and independently at random from the set of all polynomials in $\mathbb F_q[t]$ of degree $\le d$. We show that with probability tending to 1 as $n\to\infty$ the Galois group $G_f$ of $f$ over $\mathbb F_q(t)$ is isomorphic to $S_{n-k}\times C$, where $C$ is cyclic, $k$ and $|C|$ are small quantities with a simple explicit dependence on $f$. As a corollary we deduce that $\mathbb P(G_f=S_n\,|\,f\mbox{ irreducible})\to 1$ as $n\to\infty$. Thus we are able to overcome the $S_n$ versus $A_n$ ambiguity in the most natural small box random polynomial model over $\mathbb F_q[t]$, which has not been achieved over $\mathbb Z$ so far.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the Schur polynomials in all $n$th primitive roots of unity are $1$, $0$, or $-1$, if $n$ has at most two distinct odd prime factors. This result can be regarded as a generalization of properties of the coefficients of the cyclotomic polynomial and its multiplicative inverse. This result is reduced in turn to four propositions on the unimodularity of vector systems, and the last proposition is proved by using graph theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a refinement of Gaitsgory's central functor for integral motivic sheaves, and show it preserves stratified Tate motives. Towards this end, we develop a reformulation of unipotent motivic nearby cycles, which also works over higher-dimensional bases. We moreover introduce Wakimoto motives and use them to show that our motivic central functor is t-exact. A decategorification of these functors yields a new approach to generic Hecke algebras for general parahorics.</description>

Abstract: We study generalised core partitions arising from affine Grassmannian elements in arbitrary Dynkin type. The corresponding notion of size is given by the atomic length in the sense of [CLG22]. In this paper, we first develop the theory for extended affine Weyl groups. In a series of applications, we give some remarkable parametrisations of the solutions of certain Diophantine equations resembling Pell's equation, by refining the results of [BN22] and [Alp14], and generalising them to further types.</description>

      <title>First-order factors of linear Mahler operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop and compare two algorithms for computing first-order right-hand factors in the ring of linear Mahler operators$\ell_r M^r + \dots + \ell_1 M + \ell_0$where $\ell_0, \dots, \ell_r$ are polynomials in~$x$ and $Mx = x^b M$ for some integer $b \geq 2$. In other words, we give algorithms for finding all formal infinite product solutions of linear functional equations$\ell_r(x) f(x^{b^r}) + \dots + \ell_1(x) f(x^b) + \ell_0(x) f(x) = 0$. The first of our algorithms is adapted from Petkov\v{s}ek's classical algorithm forthe analogous problem in the case of linear recurrences. The second one proceeds by computing a basis of generalized power series solutions of the functional equation and by using Hermite-Pad{\'e} approximants to detect those linear combinations of the solutions that correspond to first-order factors. We present implementations of both algorithms and discuss their use in combination with criteria from the literature to prove the differential transcendence of power series solutions of Mahler equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the upper bound of wavefront sets of irreducible admissible representations of connected reductive groups defined over non-Archimedean local fields of characteristic zero. We formulate a conjecture on the upper bound and show that it can be reduced to that of anti-discrete series representations, namely, those whose Aubert-Zelevinsky duals are discrete series. We also show that this conjecture is equivalent to Jiang's conjecture on the upper bound of wavefront sets of representations in local Arthur packets and also equivalent to an analogue conjecture on the upper bound of wavefront sets of representations in local ABV packets.</description>

      <title>The mean and variance of the reciprocal merit factor of four classes of binary sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.11246</link>
      <description>arXiv:1911.11246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The merit factor of a $\{-1, 1\}$ binary sequence measures the collective smallness of its non-trivial aperiodic autocorrelations. Binary sequences with large merit factor are important in digital communications because they allow the efficient separation of signals from noise. It is a longstanding open question whether the maximum merit factor is asymptotically unbounded and, if so, what is its limiting value. Attempts to answer this question over almost sixty years have identified certain classes of binary sequences as particularly important: skew-symmetric sequences, symmetric sequences, and anti-symmetric sequences. Using only elementary methods, we find an exact formula for the mean and variance of the reciprocal merit factor of sequences in each of these classes, and in the class of all binary sequences. This provides a much deeper understanding of the distribution of the merit factor in these four classes than was previously available. A consequence is that, for each of the four classes, the merit factor of a sequence drawn uniformly at random from the class converges in probability to a constant as the sequence length increases.</description>

      <title>A recurrence relation for elliptic divisibility sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.07573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.07573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In literature, there are two different definitions of elliptic divisibility sequences. The first one says that a sequence of integers $\{h_n\}_{n\geq 0}$ is an elliptic divisibility sequence if it verifies the recurrence relation $h_{m+n}h_{m-n}h_{r}^2=h_{m+r}h_{m-r}h_{n}^2-h_{n+r}h_{n-r}h_{m}^2$ for every natural number $m\geq n\geq r$. The second definition says that a sequence of integers $\{\beta_n\}_{n\geq 0}$ is an elliptic divisibility sequence if it is the sequence of the square roots (chosen with an appropriate sign) of the denominators of the abscissas of the iterates of a point on a rational elliptic curve. It is well-known that the two sequences are not equivalent. Hence, given a sequence of the denominators $\{\beta_n\}_{n\geq 0}$, in general does not hold $\beta_{m+n}\beta_{m-n}\beta_{r}^2=\beta_{m+r}\beta_{m-r}\beta_{n}^2-\beta_{n+r}\beta_{n-r}\beta_{m}^2$ for $m\geq n\geq r$. We will prove that the recurrence relation above holds for $\{\beta_n\}_{n\geq 0}$ under some conditions on the indexes $m$, $n$, and $r$.</description>

      <title>Algebraic integers with conjugates in a prescribed distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.12660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a compact subset $\Sigma$ of the real numbers obeying some technical conditions, we consider the set of algebraic integers whose conjugates all lie in $\Sigma$. The distribution of conjugates of such an integer defines a probability measure on $\Sigma$; our main result gives a necessary and sufficient condition for a given probability measure on $\Sigma$ to be the limit of some sequence of distributions of conjugates. As one consequence, we show there are infinitely many totally positive algebraic integers $\alpha$ with $tr(\alpha) &lt; 1.89831\cdot deg(\alpha)$. We also show how this work can be applied to find simple abelian varieties over finite fields with extreme point counts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.00434v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce a general approach for deriving zero-free half-planes for the Riemann zeta function $\zeta$ by identifying topological vector spaces of analytic functions with specific properties. This approach is applied to weighted $\ell^2$ spaces and classical Hardy spaces $ H^p $ ($ 0&lt;p\leq2 $). As a consequence precise conditions are obtained for the existence of zero-free half planes for the $\zeta$-function.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.13308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the convergence of moments of the number of directions of affine lattice vectors that fall into a small disc, under natural Diophantine conditions on the shift. Furthermore, we show that the pair correlation function is Poissonian for any irrational shift in dimension 3 and higher, including well-approximable vectors. Convergence in distribution was already proved in the work of Str\"ombergsson and the second author, and the principal step in the extension to convergence of moments is an escape of mass estimate for averages over embedded $\operatorname{SL}(d,\mathbb{R})$-horospheres in the space of affine lattices.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a class of permutation polynomial over $\mathbb F_{q^n}$ that can be written in the form $\frac{L(x)}{x^{q+1}}$ or $\frac{L(x^{q+1})}x$ for some $q$-linear polynomial $L$ over $\mathbb F_{q^n}$. Specifically, we present those permutation polynomials explicitly as well as their inverses. In addition, more permutation polynomials can be derived in a more general form.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13635v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Products of shifted characteristic polynomials, and ratios of such products, averaged over the classical compact groups are of great interest to number theorists as they model similar averages of L-functions in families with the same symmetry type as the compact group. We use Toeplitz and Toeplitz plus Hankel operators and the identities of Borodin - Okounkov, Case - Geronimo, and Basor - Erhardt to prove that, in certain cases, these unitary averages factor as polynomials in the matrix size into averages over the symplectic group and the orthogonal group. Building on these identities we present new proofs of the exact formulas for these averages where the ``swap'' terms that are characteristic of the number theoretic averages occur from the Fredholm expansions of the determinants of the appropriate Hankel operator. This is the fourth different proof of the formula for the averages of ratios of products of shifted characteristic polynomials; the other proofs are based on supersymmetry; symmetric function theory, and orthogonal polynomial methods from Random Matrix Theory.</description>

      <title>A note on odd partition numbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ramanujan's celebrated partition congruences modulo $\ell\in \{5, 7, 11\}$ assert that $$ p(\ell n+\delta_{\ell})\equiv 0\pmod{\ell}, $$ where $0&lt;\delta_{\ell}&lt;\ell$ satisfies $24\delta_{\ell}\equiv 1\pmod{\ell}.$ By proving Subbarao's Conjecture, Radu showed that there are no such congruences when it comes to parity. There are infinitely many odd (resp. even) partition numbers in every arithmetic progression. For primes $\ell \geq 5,$ we give a new proof of the conclusion that there are infinitely many $m$ for which $p(\ell m+\delta_{\ell})$ is odd. This proof uses a generalization, due to the second author and Ramsey, of a result of Mazur in his classic paper on the Eisenstein ideal. We also refine a classical criterion of Sturm for modular form congruences, which allows us to show that the smallest such $m$ satisfies $m&lt;(\ell^2-1)/24,$ representing a significant improvement to the previous bound.</description>

      <title>Five families of rapidly convergent evaluations of zeta values</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08997v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work derives 5 methods to evaluate families of odd zeta values by combining a power of $\pi$ with Lambert series whose ratios of successive terms tend to $e^{-\pi\sqrt{a}}$ with integers $a\ge7$, outperforming Ramanujan's results with merit $a=4$. Families with $a=7$ and $a=8$ evaluate $\zeta(2n+1)$. Families with $a=9$ and $a=16$ evaluate $\zeta(4n+1)$ with faster convergence. A fifth family with $a=12$ evaluates $\zeta(6n+1)$ and gives the fastest convergence for $\zeta(6n+7)$. Members of three of the families were discovered empirically by Simon Plouffe. An intensive new search strongly suggests that there are no more than 5 families with integers $a\ge7$. There are at least 18 families that involve involve Lambert series with rational $a&gt;4$. Quasi-modular transformations of Lambert series resolve rational sequences that were discovered empirically. Expansions of Lambert series in polylogarithms, familiar from quantum field theory, provide proofs of all known evaluations with rational merit $a&gt;4$.</description>

Abstract: We compute the canonical integrals associated to wheel graphs, and prove that they are proportional to odd zeta values. From this we deduce that wheel classes define explicit non-zero classes in: the locally finite homology of the general linear group $\GL_n(\ZZ)$ in both odd and even ranks, the homology of the moduli spaces of tropical curves, and the moduli space of tropical abelian varieties. We deduce the existence of a doubly infinite family of auxiliary classes in the even commutative graph complex.</description>

Abstract: Let $E$ be an elliptic curve over a number field $L$ and for a finite set $S$ of primes, let $\rho_{E,S} : {\rm Gal}(\overline{L}/L) \to {\rm GL}_{2}(\mathbb{Z}_{S})$ be the $S$-adic Galois representation. If $L \cap \mathbb{Q}(\zeta_{n}) = \mathbb{Q}$ for all positive integers $n$ whose prime factors are in $S$, then $\det \rho_{E,S} : {\rm Gal}(\overline{L}/L) \to \mathbb{Z}_{S}^{\times}$ is surjective. We say that a finite index subgroup $H \subseteq {\rm GL}_{2}(\mathbb{Z}_{S})$ is \emph{minimal} if $\det : H \to \mathbb{Z}_{S}^{\times}$ is surjective, but $\det : K \to \mathbb{Z}_{S}^{\times}$ is not surjective for any proper closed subgroup $K$ of $H$. We show that there are no minimal subgroups of ${\rm GL}_{2}(\mathbb{Z}_{S})$ unless $S = \{ 2 \}$, while minimal subgroups of ${\rm GL}_{2}(\mathbb{Z}_{2})$ are plentiful. We give models for all the genus $0$ modular curves associated to minimal subgroups of ${\rm GL}_{2}(\mathbb{Z}_{2})$, and construct an infinite family of elliptic curves over imaginary quadratic fields with bad reduction only at $2$ and with minimal $2$-adic image.</description>

Abstract: The modular group $\operatorname{PSL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ acts on the upper-half plane $\mathbb{HP}$ with quotient the modular orbifold, uniformized by the function $\mathfrak{j} \colon \mathbb{HP}\to \mathbb{C}$. We first show that second derived subgroup $\operatorname{PSL}_2(\mathbb{Z})''$ corresponds to a $\mathbb{Z}^2\rtimes \mathbb{Z}/6$ Galois cover of the modular orbifold by a hexpunctured plane, uniformized by the hexponential map $\operatorname{hexp} \colon \mathbb{HP} \to \mathbb{C} \setminus (\omega_0\mathbb{Z}[j])$, which is a primitive of $C\eta^4$ where $\omega_0\in i\mathbb{R}$ and $C\in \mathbb{R}$ are explicit constants and $\eta$ is Dedekind eta function. We describe the values of the cusp-compactification $\partial \operatorname{hexp}\colon \mathbb{QP}^1\to \omega_0 \mathbb{Z}[j]$. After defining the radial-compactification $\operatorname{Shexp} \colon \mathscr{R} \to \mathbb{R}/(2\pi\mathbb{Z})$, we construct a simple section $\operatorname{InSh} \colon \mathbb{R}/(2\pi\mathbb{Z}) \to \mathscr{S} \bmod{\operatorname{PSL}_2(\mathbb{Z})'}$ where $\mathscr{S} \subset \mathbb{RP}^1$ is a set of numbers whose continued fraction expansions arise from Sturmian sequences, which contains the set $\mathscr{M}$ of Markov quadratic irrationals as those numbers arising from periodic Sturmian sequences. We will show that the values of $\operatorname{InSh}$ are either Markov quadratic irrationals or transcendental. Finally we provide a continued fraction expansion for $\operatorname{hexp}$, and discuss its monodromy.</description>

Abstract: Let $p_{r+1}-1&gt;n \geq p_r-1$, based on a sequence $\{1,2,3\cdots\ M_r(M_r=p_1p_2\cdots p_r)\}$, we compare the density of coprime numbers and establish a correlation between the proportions of coprime numbers in the ranges from 1 to consecutive square numbers. Then, we derive the relationship between the number of coprimes in the interval of $n^2 \sim {(n+1)}^2$ and the proportion of coprimes in the interval of $1 \sim n^2$, proving that there is at least one prime number between any $n^2$ and ${(n+1)}^2$. By extending our research to the range of $1 \sim M_r^2$, we establish the relationship between the proportions of backwards coprime numbers in the ranges from ${M_r}^2$ to consecutive square numbers; furthermore, we establish a relationship between the proportions of coprimes in small interval and the whole interval. Then, in conclusion, the number of coprimes between $n^2$ and ${(n+1)}^2$ is greater than $n\prod_{i=1}^{r}{(1-\frac{1}{p_i}})$, thus proving that there are at least 2 prime numbers between $n^2$ and ${(n+1)}^2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2202.05340v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reformulate the theory of p-adic iterated integrals on semistable curves using the unipotent log rigid fundamental group. This fundamental group carries Frobenius and monodromy operators whose basic properties are established. By identifying the Frobenius-invariant subgroup of the fundamental group with the fundamental group of the dual graph, we characterize Berkovich--Coleman integration, which is path-dependent, as integration along the Frobenius-invariant lift of a path in the dual graph. We demonstrate the basic properties for this integration theory. Vologodsky's path-independent integration theory which was previously described using a monodromy condition can now be identified as Berkovich--Coleman integration along a combinatorial canonical path arising from the theory of combinatorial iterated integration as developed by the first-named author and Cheng. We use this definition to lay the groundwork for computing iterated integrals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.00879v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is a lecture on the theory of formal power series developed entirely without any analytic machinery. Combining ideas from various authors we are able to prove Newton's binomial theorem, Jacobi's triple product, the Rogers--Ramanujan identities and many other prominent results. We apply these methods to derive several combinatorial theorems including Ramanujan's partition congruences, generating functions of Stirling numbers and Jacobi's four-square theorem. We further discuss formal Laurent series and multivariate power series and end with a proof of MacMahon's master theorem.</description>

      <title>On the Linear AFL: The Non-Basic Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.10144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The linear Arithmetic Fundamental Lemma (AFL) conjecture compares intersection numbers on Lubin--Tate deformation spaces with derivatives of orbital integrals. It has been introduced for elliptic orbits in arXiv:1803.07553 and arXiv:2010.07365. In these cases, the relevant intersection problem is formulated for the basic isogeny class. In the present article, we extend the theory to all orbits and all isogeny classes. Our main result is a reduction of the non-basic cases of the AFL to the basic ones, which is achieved by exploiting the connected-\'etale sequence. Our theory will be relevant in the global setting, where also locally non-elliptic orbits may contribute in a non-trivial way.</description>

      <title>On input and Langlands parameters for epipelagic representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12142v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A paper of Reeder-Yu gives a construction of epipelagic supercuspidal representations of $p$-adic groups. The input for this construction is a pair $(\lambda, \chi)$ where $\lambda$ is a stable vector in a certain representation coming from a Moy-Prasad filtration, and $\chi$ is a character of the additive group of the residue field. We say two such pairs are equivalent if the resulting supercuspidal representations are isomorphic. In this paper we describe the equivalence classes of such pairs. As an application, we give a classification of the simple supercuspidal representations for split adjoint groups. Finally, under an assumption about unramified base change, we describe properties of the Langlands parameters associated to these simple supercuspidals, showing that they have trivial L-functions and minimal Swan conductors, and showing that each of these simple supercuspidals lies in a singleton L-packet.</description>

      <title>Toward Shimurian analogs of Barsotti-Tate groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02346v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We first recall Grothendieck's notion of n-truncated Barsotti-Tate group. Such groups form an algebraic stack over the integers. The problem is to give an illuminating description of its reductions modulo powers of p. A related problem is to construct analogs of these reductions related to general Shimura varieties with good reduction at p. We discuss some conjectures on this subject based on the theory of prismatic cohomology.</description>

      <title>On universality of general Dirichlet series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present work, we establish sufficient conditions for a Dirichlet series induced by general frequencies to be universal with respect to vertical translations. Our results can be applied to known universal objects such as Hurwitz zeta functions and also can provide new examples of universal Dirichlet series including the alternating prime zeta function $\sum_{n\geq1}(-1)^np_n^{-s}$.</description>

      <title>Permutation groups of prime power degree and $p$-complements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extending earlier work of Guralnick and of Cai and Zhang, we classify the almost simple groups which have transitive permutation representations of prime power degree $p^k$, and those which have $p$-complements (stabilisers of order coprime to $p$ in such representations). We deduce that every primitive permutation group of prime power degree has a regular subgroup, and that any two faithful primitive representations of a group, of the same prime power degree, are equivalent under automorphisms. In general, $p$-complements in a finite group can be inequivalent under automorphisms, or even non-isomorphic. We extend examples of such phenomena due to Buturlakin, Revin and Nesterov by showing that the number of inequivalent classes of complements can be arbitrarily large. Questions concerning the existence of prime power representations and $p$-complements in groups with socle ${\rm PSL}_d(q)$ are related to some difficult open problems in Number Theory.</description>

      <title>Line defect half-indices of $SU(N)$ Chern-Simons theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Wilson line defect half-indices of 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric $SU(N)$ Chern-Simons theories of level $k\le -N$ with Neumann boundary conditions for the gauge fields, together with 2d Fermi multiplets and fundamental 3d chiral multiplets to cancel the gauge anomaly. We derive some exact results and also make some conjectures based on expansions of the $q$-series. We find several interesting connections with special functions known in the literature, including Rogers-Ramanujan functions for which we conjecture integral representations, and the appearance of Appell-Lerch sums for certain Wilson line half-index grand canonical ensembles which reveal an unexpected appearance of mock modular functions. We also find intriguing $q$-difference equations relating half-indices to Wilson line half-indices. Some of these results also have a description in terms of a dual theory with Dirichlet boundary conditions for the vector multiplet in the dual theory.</description>
