      <title>On General Spherically Symmetric Finsler Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study some non-Riemannian curvature properties of general spherically symmetric Finsler metrics. First, we prove that every general spherically symmetric Finsler metric is semi C-reducible. Then, we find the necessary and sufficient condition under which a general spherically symmetric Finsler metric has vanishing mean stretch curvature.</description>

      <title>Isometric Euclidean submanifolds with isometric Gauss maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate isometric immersions $f\colon M^n\to\R^{n+2}$, $n\geq 3$, of Riemannian manifolds into Euclidean space with codimension two that admit isometric deformations that preserve the metric of the Gauss map. In precise terms, the preservation of the third fundamental form of the submanifold must be ensured throughout the deformation. For minimal isometric deformations of minimal submanifolds this is always the case. Our main result is of a local nature and states that if $f$ is neither minimal nor reducible, then it is a hypersurface of an isometrically deformable hypersurface $F\colon\tilde{M}^{n+1}\to\R^{n+2}$ such that the deformations of $F$ induce those of $f$. Moreover, for a particular class of such submanifolds, a complete local parametric description is provided.</description>

      <title>Prescribing scalar curvatures: loss of minimizability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prescribing conformally the scalar curvature on a closed manifold with negative Yamabe invariant as a given function $K$ is possible under smallness assumptions on $K_{+}=\max\{K,0\}$ and in particular, when $K&lt;0$. In addition, while solutions are unique in case $K\leq 0$, non uniqueness generally holds, when $K$ is sign changing and $K_{+}$ sufficiently small and flat around its critical points. The solutions are found variationally as minimizers. Here we study, what happens, when the relevant arguments fail to apply, describing on one hand the loss of minimizability generally, while on the other we construct a function $K$, for which saddle point solutions to the conformally prescribed scalar curvature problem still exist.</description>

      <title>On the Existence of Weighted-cscK Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that on a smooth K\"ahler manifold, the $\mathbb{G}$-coercivity of the weighted Mabuchi functional implies the existence of weighted-cscK (extremal) metric (firstly studied in \cite{Lah19}), e.g, cscK metric, K\"ahler--Ricci soliton. Furthermore, we generalize this result to the case of $\mathbb{G}$-equivariant $\mathbb{Q}$-Gorenstein smoothable projective klt varieties.</description>

      <title>Cusps of caustics by reflection in ellipses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the billiard version of Jacobi's last geometric statement and its generalizations. Given a non-focal point $O$ inside an elliptic billiard table, one considers the family of rays emanating from $O$ and the caustic $\Gamma_n$ of the reflected family after $n$ reflections off the ellipse, for each positive integer $n$. It is known that $\Gamma_n$ has at least four cusps and it has been conjectured that it has exactly four (ordinary) cusps. The present paper presents a proof of this conjecture in the special case when the ellipse is a circle. In the case of an arbitrary ellipse, we give an explicit description of the location of four of the cusps of $\Gamma_n$, though we do not prove that these are the only cusps.</description>

      <title>Neumann cut-offs and essential self-adjointness on complete Riemannian manifolds with boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize some fundamental results for noncompact Riemannian manfolds without boundary, that only require completeness and no curvature assumptions, to manifolds with boundary: let $M$ be a smooth Riemannian manifold with boundary $\partial M$ and let $\hat{C}^\infty_c(M)$ denote the space of smooth compactly supported cut-off functions with vanishing normal derivative, Neumann cut-offs. We show, among other things, that under completeness:
  - $\hat{C}^\infty_c(M)$ is dense in $W^{1,p}(\mathring{M})$ for all $p\in (1,\infty)$; this generalizes a classical result by Aubin [2] for $\partial M=\emptyset$.
  - $M$ admits a sequence of first order cut-off functions in $\hat{C}^\infty_c(M)$; for $\partial M=\emptyset$ this result can be traced back to Gaffney [7].
  - the Laplace-Beltrami operator with domain of definition $\hat{C}^\infty_c(M)$ is essentially self-adjoint; this is a generalization of a classical result by Strichartz [20] for $\partial M=\emptyset$.</description>

      <title>Embedded cylindrical and doughnut-shaped $\lambda$-hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper, we construct, for $\lambda&gt;0$, complete embedded and non-convex $\lambda$-hypersurfaces, which are diffeomorphic to a cylinder. Hence, one can not expect that $\lambda$-hypersurfaces share a common conclusion on the planar domain conjecture even if the planar domain conjecture of T. Ilmanen for self-shrinkers of mean curvature flow are solved by Brendle \cite{B} affirmatively. Furthermore, for a fixed $\lambda&lt;0$ which may have small $|\lambda|$, we can construct two compact embedded $\lambda$-hypersurfaces which are diffeomorphic to $\mathbb{S}^{1}\times \mathbb{S}^{n-1}$, but they are not isometric to each other.</description>

      <title>Hermitian-Einstein equations on noncompact manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper first investigates solvability of Hermitian-Einstein equation on a Hermitian holomorphic vector bundle on the complement of an arbitrary closed subset in a compact complex manifold. The uniqueness of Hermitian-Einstein metrics on a Zariski open subset in a compact K\"{a}hler manifold was only figured out by Takuro Mochizuki recently, the second part of this paper gives an affirmative answer to a question proposed by Takuro Mochizuki and based on which it leads to an alternative approach to the unique issue. We also prove stability from solvability of Hermitian-Einstein equation, which together with the classical existence result of Carlos Simpson in particular establish a Kobayashi-Hitchin bijective correspondence. The argument is also effective for uniqueness result and Kobayashi-Hitchin bijective correspondence on $\mathbb{C}$, as well as on non-K\"{a}hler and semi-stable contexts.</description>

      <title>Reductions of path structures and classification of homogeneous structures in dimension three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we show that if a path structure has non-vanishing curvature at apoint then it has a canonical reduction to a Z/2Z-structure at a neighbourhood of thatpoint (in many cases it has a canonical parallelism). A simple implication of this resultis that the automorphism group of a non-flat path structure is of maximal dimensionthree (a result by Tresse of 1896). We also classify the invariant path structures onthree-dimensional Lie groups.</description>

      <title>Volume Above Distance Below with Boundary II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was shown by B. Allen, R. Perales, and C. Sormani that on a closed manifold where the diameter of a sequence of Riemannian metrics is bounded, if the volume converges to the volume of a limit manifold, and the sequence of Riemannian metrics are $C^0$ converging from below then one can conclude volume preserving Sormani-Wenger Intrinsic Flat convergence. The result was extended to manifolds with boundary by B. Allen and R. Perales by a doubling with necks procedure which produced a closed manifold and reduced the case with boundary to the case without boundary. The consequence of the doubling with necks procedure was requiring a stronger condition than necessary on the boundary. Using the estimates for the Sormani-Wenger Intrinsic Flat distance on manifolds with boundary developed by B. Allen and R. Perales, we show that only a bound on the area of the boundary is needed in order to conclude volume preserving intrinsic flat convergence for manifolds with boundary. We also provide an example which shows that one should not expect convergence without a bound on area.</description>

      <title>Partial Scalar Curvatures and Topological Obstructions for Submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate specific intrinsic curvatures $\rho_k$ (where $1\leq k\leq n$) that interpolate between the minimum Ricci curvature $\rho_1$ and the normalized scalar curvature $\rho_n=\rho$ of $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifolds. For $n$-dimensional submanifolds in space forms, these curvatures satisfy an inequality involving the mean curvature $H$ and the normal scalar curvature $\rho^\perp$, which reduces to the well-known DDVV inequality when $k=n$. We derive topological obstructions for compact $n$-dimensional submanifolds based on universal lower bounds of the $L^{n/2}$-norms of certain functions involving $\rho_k,H$ and $\rho^\perp$. These obstructions are expressed in terms of the Betti numbers. Our main result applies for any $1\leq k \leq n-1$, but it generally fails for $k=n$, where the involved norm vanishes precisely for Wintgen ideal submanifolds. We demonstrate this by providing a method of constructing new compact 3-dimensional minimal Wintgen ideal submanifolds in even-dimensional spheres. Specifically, we prove that such submanifolds exist in $\mathbb{S}^6$ with arbitrarily large first Betti number.</description>

      <title>Simple matrix expressions for the curvatures of Grassmannian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that modeling a Grassmannian as symmetric orthogonal matrices $\operatorname{Gr}(k,\mathbb{R}^n) \cong\{Q \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n} : Q^{\scriptscriptstyle\mathsf{T}} Q = I, \; Q^{\scriptscriptstyle\mathsf{T}} = Q,\; \operatorname{tr}(Q)=2k - n\}$ yields exceedingly simple matrix formulas for various curvatures and curvature-related quantities, both intrinsic and extrinsic. These include Riemann, Ricci, Jacobi, sectional, scalar, mean, principal, and Gaussian curvatures; Schouten, Weyl, Cotton, Bach, Pleba\'nski, cocurvature, nonmetricity, and torsion tensors; first, second, and third fundamental forms; Gauss and Weingarten maps; and upper and lower delta invariants. We will derive explicit, simple expressions for the aforementioned quantities in terms of standard matrix operations that are stably computable with numerical linear algebra. Many of these aforementioned quantities have never before been presented for the Grassmannian.</description>

      <title>Learning from landmarks, curves, surfaces, and shapes in Geomstats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the shape module of the Python package Geomstats to analyze shapes of objects represented as landmarks, curves and surfaces across fields of natural sciences and engineering. The shape module first implements widely used shape spaces, such as the Kendall shape space, as well as elastic spaces of discrete curves and surfaces. The shape module further implements the abstract mathematical structures of group actions, fiber bundles, quotient spaces and associated Riemannian metrics which allow users to build their own shape spaces. The Riemannian geometry tools enable users to compare, average, interpolate between shapes inside a given shape space. These essential operations can then be leveraged to perform statistics and machine learning on shape data. We present the object-oriented implementation of the shape module along with illustrative examples and show how it can be used to perform statistics and machine learning on shape spaces.</description>

      <title>Flux Quantization on M5-branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The M5-brane has been argued to potentially provide much-needed theoretical underpinning for various non-perturbative phenomena in strongly-coupled quantum systems and yet the primary non-perturbative effect already in its classical on-shell formulation has received little attention: The flux-quantization of the higher gauge field on its worldvolume.
  This problem appears subtle because of (1a.) the notorious self-duality of the 3-form flux density in the small field limit, combined with (1b.) its highly non-linear self-duality for strong fields, and (2a.) the twisting of its Bianchi identity by the pullback of the 11d SuGra C-field flux density, which (2b.) is subject to its own subtle flux quantization law on the ambient spacetime.
  These subtleties call into question the tacit assumption that the M5 brane's 3-flux is quantized in ordinary cohomology and hence leaves open the rather fundamental question of what the M5-brane's worldvolume higher gauge field really is.
  Here we characterize the valid quantization laws of the M5-brane's 3-flux in (non-abelian) generalized twisted cohomology. The key step is to pass to super-spacetime and there to combine the character map with the "super-embedding"-construction of the on-shell M5-brane fields, of which we give a rigorous and streamlined re-rederivation.
  We show that one admissible quantization law of the 3-flux on M5-branes is by 4-Cohomotopy-twisted 3-Cohomotopy, as predicted by "Hypothesis H". Besides quantizing the bulk fluxes (G4,G7) and the brane's H3-flux themselves, this law also implies the (level-)quantization of the induced Page-charge/Hopf-WZ term on the M5-brane, necessary for its action functional to be globally well-defined.
  Finally, we demonstrate how with this flux quantization imposed, there generically appear skyrmionic solitons on M5-branes and anyonic topological quantum states on open M5-branes.</description>

      <title>On localizing groups of exotic diffeomorphisms of 4-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ruberman in the 90's showed that the group of exotic diffeomorphisms of closed 4-manifolds can be infinitely generated. We provide various results on the question of when such infinite generation can localize to a smaller embedded submanifold of the original manifold. Our results include: (1) All known infinitely generated groups of exotic diffeomorphisms of 4-manifolds detected by families Seiberg-Witten theory do not localize to any topologically (locally-flatly) embedded rational homology balls in the ambient 4-manifold. (2) Many exotic diffeomorphisms cannot be obtained as Dehn twists along homology spheres (under mild assumptions). (3) There is no contractible 4-manifolds with Seifert fibered boundary that have a universal property for exotic diffeomorphisms analogous to a universal cork. In addition, there is no universal compact 4-manifold $W$ such that the set of exotic diffeomorphisms of a 4-manifold can localize to an embedding of $W$. (4) Certain infinite generations of exotic diffeomorphism groups do localize to a non-compact subset $V$ with a small Betti number, but not to any compact subset of $V$. (5) An analogous result holds for mapping class groups of 4-manifolds.</description>

      <title>The systole of random hyperbolic 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the systole of a model of random hyperbolic 3-manifolds introduced by Petri and Raimbault, answering a question posed in that same article. These are compact manifolds with boundary constructed by randomly gluing truncated tetrahedra along their faces. We prove that the limit, as the volume tends to infinity, of the expected value of their systole exists and we give a closed formula of it. Moreover, we compute a numerical approximation of this value.</description>

      <title>Lectures on mean curvature flow of surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.10485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.10485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mean curvature flow is the most natural evolution equation in extrinsic geometry, and shares many features with Hamilton's Ricci flow from intrinsic geometry. In this lecture series, I will provide an introduction to the mean curvature flow of surfaces, with a focus on the analysis of singularities. We will see that the surfaces evolve uniquely through neck singularities and nonuniquely through conical singularities. Studying these questions, we will also learn many general concepts and methods, such as monotonicity formulas, epsilon-regularity, weak solutions, and blowup analysis that are of great importance in the analysis of a wide range of partial differential equations. These lecture notes are from summer schools at UT Austin and CRM Montreal, and also contain a detailed discussion of open problems and conjectures.</description>

      <title>The $h$-Principle for Maps Transverse to Bracket-Generating Distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.04323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a smooth bracket-generating distribution $\mathcal{D}$ of constant growth on a manifold $M$, we prove that maps from an arbitrary manifold $\Sigma$ to $M$, which are transverse to $\mathcal{D}$, satisfy the complete $h$-principle. This partially settles a question posed by M. Gromov.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.08755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that in the three dimensional sphere with a bumpy metric or a metric with positive Ricci curvature, there exist at least four distinct embedded minimal two-spheres. This confirms a conjecture of S. T. Yau in 1982 for bumpy metrics and metrics with positive Ricci curvature. The proof relies on a multiplicity one theorem for the Simon-Smith min-max theory.</description>

      <title>Compact convergence, deformation of the $L^2$-$\overline{\partial}$-complex and canonical $K$-homology classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(X,\gamma)$ be a compact, irreducible Hermitian complex space of complex dimension $m$ and with $\mathrm{dim}(\mathrm{sing}(X))=0$. Let $(F,\tau)\rightarrow X$ be a Hermitian holomorphic vector bundle over $X$ and let us denote with $\overline{\eth}_{F,m,\mathrm{abs}}$ the rolled-up operator of the maximal $L^2$-$\overline{\partial}$ complex of $F$-valued $(m,\bullet)$-forms. Let $\pi:M\rightarrow X$ be a resolution of singularities, $g$ a metric on $M$, $E:=\pi^*F$ and $\rho:=\pi^*\tau$. In this paper, under quite general assumptions on $\tau$, we prove the following equality of analytic $K$-homology classes $[\overline{\eth}_{F,m,\mathrm{abs}}]=\pi_*[\overline{\eth}_{E,m}]$, with $\overline{\eth}_{E,m}$ the rolled-up operator of the $L^2$-$\overline{\partial}$ complex of $E$-valued $(m,\bullet)$-forms on $M$. Our proof is based on functional analytic techniques developed in \cite{KuSh} and provides an explicit homotopy between the even unbounded Fredholm modules induced by $\overline{\eth}_{F,m,\mathrm{abs}}$ and $\overline{\eth}_{E,m}$.</description>

      <title>Calabi-Yau structures on the complexifications of rank two symmeric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17418v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that there exists a $C^{\infty}$-Calabi-Yau structure on the whole of the complexification $G^{\mathbb C}/K^{\mathbb C}$ of a rank two symmetric space $G/K$ of compact type. The proof is performed by deriving a relation (which differs from the known relation somewhat) between the complex Hessian of a real-valued $C^{\infty}$-function $\psi$ on $G^{\mathbb C}/K^{\mathbb C}$ and the Hessian of the function $\rho:=\psi|_{{\rm Exp}_o(\mathfrak a)}\circ{\rm Exp}_o|_{\mathfrak a}$ on a maximal abelian subspace $\mathfrak a$ of the normal space $T_o^{\perp}(G\cdot o)(=T_o(G^d\cdot o)\subset\mathfrak g^d)$ of the orbit $G\cdot o(=G/K)$ in $G^{\mathbb C}/K^{\mathbb C}$ at the base point $o$, where ${\rm Exp}_o$ is the exponential map of $G^{\mathbb C}/K^{\mathbb C}$ at $o$ and $\mathfrak g^d$ is the Lie algebra of the dual $G^d$ of $G$. This relation is derived in a new calculation method by using the explicit descriptions of the shape operators of the orbits of the isotropy action $K\curvearrowright G^d/K$ and the Hermann type action $G\curvearrowright G^{\mathbb C}/K^{\mathbb C}$.</description>

      <title>Stability of the Double-Cusp Spacetimes and long-time geometrizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the early years of General Relativity, understanding the long-time behavior of the cosmological solutions of Einstein's vacuum equations has been a fundamental yet challenging task. Solutions with global symmetries, or perturbations thereof, have been extensively studied and are reasonably understood. On the other hand, thanks to the work of Fischer-Moncrief and M. Anderson, it is known that there is a tight relation between the future evolution of solutions and the Thurston decomposition of the spatial 3-manifold. Consequently, cosmological spacetimes developing a future asymptotic symmetry should represent only a negligible part of a much larger yet unexplored solution landscape. In this work, we revisit a program initiated by the second named author, aimed at constructing a new type of cosmological solution first posed by M. Anderson, where (at the right scale) two hyperbolic manifolds with a cusp separate from each other through a thin torus neck. Specifically, we prove that the so-called double-cusp solution, which models the torus neck, is stable under $S^1 \times S^1$ - symmetry-preserving perturbations. The proof, which has interest on its own, reduces to proving the stability of a geodesic segment as a wave map into the hyperbolic plane and partially relates to the work of Sideris on wave maps and the work of Ringstr\"om on the future asymptotics of Gowdy spacetimes.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by a conjecture in [9] we prove that the K\"ahler cone over a regular complete Sasakian manifold is Ricci-flat and projectively induced if and only if it is flat. We also obtain that, up to $\mathcal D_a$-homothetic transformations, K\"ahler cones over homogeneous compact Sasakian manifolds are projectively induced. As main tool we provide a relation between the K\"ahler potentials of the transverse K\"ahler metric and of the cone metric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a Lorentzian homogeneous space, we study how algebraic conditions on the isotropy group affect the geometry and curvature of the homogeneous space. More specifically, we prove that a Lorentzian locally homogeneous space is locally isometric to a plane wave if it admits an Ambrose--Singer connection with indecomposable, non-irreducible holonomy. This generalises several existing results that require a certain algebraic type of the torsion of the Ambrose--Singer connection and moreover is in analogy to the fact that a Lorentzian homogeneous space with irreducible isotropy has constant sectional curvature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study caustics of an elliptical paraboloid and the history of their various representations from 3D models in XIX century to the recent computer graphics. In the paper two ways of generating the surface, one with cartesian coordinates using formula for principal curvatures, and the other one with parabolic coordinates using Seidel's formula were demonstrated. By finding the intersection curves of these caustics with the paraboloid we extend the solution of F. Caspari for classical Apollonius problem about the number of concurrent normals to the points of the paraboloid itself. A complete classification of all possible cases of intersections of these caustics with their paraboloid is given.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we first introduce the quermassintegrals for compact hypersurfaces with capillary boundaries in hyperbolic space from a variational viewpoint, and then we solve an isoperimetric type problem in hyperbolic space. By constructing a new locally constrained inverse curvature flow, we obtain the Alexandrov-Fenchel inequalities for convex capillary hypersurfaces in hyperbolic space. This generalizes a theorem of Brendle-Guan-Li \cite{BGL} for convex closed hypersurfaces in hyperbolic space.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we consider $C^{1}$ diffeomorphisms on compact Riemannian manifolds of any dimension that admit a dominated splitting $E^{cs} \oplus E^{cu}.$ We prove that if the Lyapunov exponents along $E^{cu}$ are positive for Lebesgue almost every point, then a map $f$ is non-uniformly expanding along $E^{cu}$ under the assumption that the cocycle $Df_{|E^{cu}(f)}^{-1}$ has a dominated splitting with index 1 on the support of an ergodic Lyapunov maximizing observable measure. As a result, there exists a physical SRB measure for a $C^{1+\alpha}$ diffeomorphism map $f$ that admits a dominated splitting $E^{s} \oplus E^{cu}$ under assumptions that $f$ has non-zero Lyapunov exponents for Lebesgue almost every point and that the cocycle $Df_{|E^{cu}(f)}^{-1}$ has a dominated splitting with index 1 on the support of an ergodic Lyapunov maximizing observable measure.</description>

      <title>When Leibniz algebras are Nijenhuis?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14267v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Leibniz algebras can be seen as a ``non-commutative" analogue of Lie algebras. Nijenhuis operators on Leibniz algebras introduced by Cari\~{n}ena, Grabowski, and Marmo in [J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 37(2004)] are (1, 1)-tensors with vanishing Nijenhuis torsion. Recently triangular Leibniz bialgebras were introduced by Tang and Sheng in [J. Noncommut. Geom. 16(2022)] via the twisting theory of twilled Leibniz algebras. In this paper we find that Leibniz algebras are very closely related to Nijenhuis operators, and prove that a triangular symplectic Leibniz bialgebra together with a dual triangular structure must possess Nijenhuis operators, which makes it possible to study the applications of Nijehhuis operators from the perspective of Leibniz algebras. At the same time, we regain the classical Leibniz Yang-Baxter equation by using the tensor form of classical $r$-matrics. At last we give the classification of triangular Leibniz bialgebras of low dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a sheaf theoretic and derived geometric machinery to study nonlinear partial differential equations and their singular supports. We establish a notion of derived microlocalization for solution spaces of non-linear equations and develop a formalism to pose and solve singular non-linear Cauchy problems globally. Using this approach we estimate the domains of propagation for the solutions of non-linear systems. It is achieved by exploiting the fact that one may greatly enrich and simplify the study of derived non-linear PDEs over a space $X$ by studying its derived linearization which is a module over the sheaf of functions on the $S^1$-equivariant derived loop stack $\mathcal{L}X$.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the geometry of classical Hamiltonian systems immersed in a magnetic field in three-dimensional Riemannian configuration spaces. We prove that these systems admit non-trivial symplectic-Haantjes manifolds, which are symplectic manifolds endowed with an algebra of Haantjes (1,1)-tensors. These geometric structures allow us to determine separation variables for known systems algorithmically; besides, the underlying St\"ackel geometry is used to construct new families of integrable Hamiltonian models immersed in a magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Existence and nonexistence of minimizers for classical capillarity problems in presence of nonlocal repulsion and gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate, under a volume constraint and among sets contained in a Euclidean half-space, the minimization problem of an energy functional given by the sum of a capillarity perimeter, a nonlocal repulsive term and a gravitational potential energy. The capillarity perimeter assigns a constant weight to the portion of the boundary touching the boundary of the half-space. The nonlocal term is represented by a double integral of a positive kernel $g$, while the gravitational term is represented by the integral of a positive potential $G$.
  We first establish existence of volume-constrained minimizers in the small mass regime, together with several qualitative properties of minimizers. The existence result holds even for rather general choices of kernels in the nonlocal term, including attractive-repulsive ones. When the nonlocal kernel $g(x)=1/|x|^\beta$ with $\beta \in (0,2]$, we also obtain nonexistence of volume constrained minimizers in the large mass regime. Finally, we prove a generalized existence result of minimizers holding for all masses, meaning that the infimum of the problem is realized by a finite disjoint union of sets thought located at "infinite distance" one from the other.
  These results stem from an application of quantitative isoperimetric inequalities for the capillarity problem in a half-space.</description>
