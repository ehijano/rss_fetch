      <title>Protect$^*$: Steerable Retrosynthesis through Neuro-Symbolic State Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable potential in scientific domains like retrosynthesis; yet, they often lack the fine-grained control necessary to navigate complex problem spaces without error. A critical challenge is directing an LLM to avoid specific, chemically sensitive sites on a molecule - a task where unconstrained generation can lead to invalid or undesirable synthetic pathways. In this work, we introduce Protect$^*$, a neuro-symbolic framework that grounds the generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in rigorous chemical logic. Our approach combines automated rule-based reasoning - using a comprehensive database of 55+ SMARTS patterns and 40+ characterized protecting groups - with the generative intuition of neural models. The system operates via a hybrid architecture: an ``automatic mode'' where symbolic logic deterministically identifies and guards reactive sites, and a ``human-in-the-loop mode'' that integrates expert strategic constraints. Through ``active state tracking,'' we inject hard symbolic constraints into the neural inference process via a dedicated protection state linked to canonical atom maps. We demonstrate this neuro-symbolic approach through case studies on complex natural products, including the discovery of a novel synthetic pathway for Erythromycin B, showing that grounding neural generation in symbolic logic enables reliable, expert-level autonomy.</description>

      <title>Exploring the limits of pre-trained embeddings in machine-guided protein design: a case study on predicting AAV vector viability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective representations of protein sequences are widely recognized as a cornerstone of machine learning-based protein design. Yet, protein bioengineering poses unique challenges for sequence representation, as experimental datasets typically feature few mutations, which are either sparsely distributed across the entire sequence or densely concentrated within localized regions. This limits the ability of sequence-level representations to extract functionally meaningful signals. In addition, comprehensive comparative studies remain scarce, despite their crucial role in clarifying which representations best encode relevant information and ultimately support superior predictive performance. In this study, we systematically evaluate multiple ProtBERT and ESM2 embedding variants as sequence representations, using the adeno-associated virus capsid as a case study and prototypical example of bioengineering, where functional optimization is targeted through highly localized sequence variation within an otherwise large protein. Our results reveal that, prior to fine-tuning, amino acid-level embeddings outperform sequence-level representations in supervised predictive tasks, whereas the latter tend to be more effective in unsupervised settings. However, optimal performance is only achieved when embeddings are fine-tuned with task-specific labels, with sequence-level representations providing the best performance. Moreover, our findings indicate that the extent of sequence variation required to produce notable shifts in sequence representations exceeds what is typically explored in bioengineering studies, showing the need for fine-tuning in datasets characterized by sparse or highly localized mutations.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Discovery of Cryoprotectant Cocktails via Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing cryoprotectant agent (CPA) cocktails for vitrification is challenging because formulations must be concentrated enough to suppress ice formation yet non-toxic enough to preserve cell viability. This tradeoff creates a large, multi-objective design space in which traditional discovery is slow, often relying on expert intuition or exhaustive experimentation. We present a data-efficient framework that accelerates CPA cocktail design by combining high-throughput screening with an active-learning loop based on multi-objective Bayesian optimization. From an initial set of measured cocktails, we train probabilistic surrogate models to predict concentration and viability and quantify uncertainty across candidate formulations. We then iteratively select the next experiments by prioritizing cocktails expected to improve the Pareto front, maximizing expected Pareto improvement under uncertainty, and update the models as new assay results are collected. Wet-lab validation shows that our approach efficiently discovers cocktails that simultaneously achieve high CPA concentrations and high post-exposure viability. Relative to a naive strategy and a strong baseline, our method improves dominated hypervolume by 9.5\% and 4.5\%, respectively, while reducing the number of experiments needed to reach high-quality solutions. In complementary synthetic studies, it recovers a comparably strong set of Pareto-optimal solutions using only 30\% of the evaluations required by the prior state-of-the-art multi-objective approach, which amounts to saving approximately 10 weeks of experimental time. Because the framework assumes only a suitable assay and defined formulation space, it can be adapted to different CPA libraries, objective definitions, and cell lines to accelerate cryopreservation development.</description>

      <title>Conformational landscapes in cryo-ET data based on MD simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) provides a unique window into molecular organization in cellular environments (in situ). However, the interpretation of molecular structural information is complicated by several intrinsic properties of cryo-ET data, such as noise, missing wedge, and continuous conformational variability of the molecules. Additionally, in crowded in situ environments, the number of particles extracted is sometimes small and precludes extensive classification into discrete states. These challenges shift the emphasis from high-resolution structure determination toward validation and interpretation of low-resolution density maps, and analysis of conformational flexibility. Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are particularly well suited to this task, as they provide a physically grounded way to explore continuous conformation transitions consistent with both experimental data and molecular energetics. This review focuses on the roles of MD simulations in cryo-ET, emphasizing their use in emerging methods for conformational landscape determination and their contribution to gain new biological insight.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Hit-&amp;-Run Samplers for Linearly Constrained Densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling of densities restricted to linearly constrained domains is an important task arising in Bayesian treatment of inverse problems in the natural sciences. While efficient algorithms for uniform polytope sampling exist, much less work has dealt with more complex constrained densities. In particular, gradient information as used in unconstrained MCMC is not necessarily helpful in the constrained case, where the gradient may push the proposal's density out of the polytope. In this work, we propose a novel constrained sampling algorithm, which combines strengths of higher-order information, like the target's log-density's gradients and curvature, with the Hit-&amp;-Run proposal, a simple mechanism which guarantees the generation of feasible proposals, fulfilling the linear constraints. Our extensive experiments demonstrate improved sampling efficiency on complex constrained densities over various constrained and unconstrained samplers.</description>

      <title>A Tutorial on Structural Identifiability of Epidemic Models Using StructuralIdentifiability.jl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10517v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Structural identifiability is the theoretical ability to uniquely recover model parameters from ideal, noise-free data and is a prerequisite for reliable parameter estimation in epidemic modeling. Despite its importance for calibration and inference, structural identifiability analysis remains underused and inconsistently applied in infectious disease modeling. This paper presents a user-oriented methodological tutorial demonstrating how global structural identifiability analysis can be systematically integrated into epidemic modeling workflows. We provide a reproducible framework for conducting structural identifiability analysis of ordinary differential equation models using the Julia package StructuralIdentifiability.jl. The workflow is illustrated across commonly used epidemic models, including SEIR variants with asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission, vector-borne disease models, and systems incorporating hospitalization and disease-induced mortality. We also introduce a visual communication strategy that embeds identifiability results directly into compartmental diagrams, facilitating interpretation and interdisciplinary communication. Our results show that identifiability depends critically on model structure, the choice of observed variables, and assumptions about initial conditions, and that identifiable parameter combinations may exist even when individual parameters are not globally identifiable. Emphasizing transparent implementation, interpretation, and communication, this work provides practical guidance and comparative insights across model classes. The tutorial is designed as both a reference and a teaching resource for researchers and educators seeking to incorporate structural identifiability analysis into epidemic model development. All code and annotated diagrams are publicly available to ensure reproducibility and reuse.</description>

      <title>SPATIA: Multimodal Generation and Prediction of Spatial Cell Phenotypes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how cellular morphology, gene expression, and spatial context jointly shape tissue function is a central challenge in biology. Image-based spatial transcriptomics technologies now provide high-resolution measurements of cell images and gene expression profiles, but existing methods typically analyze these modalities in isolation or at limited resolution. We address the problem by introducing SPATIA, a multi-level generative and predictive model that learns unified, spatially aware representations by fusing morphology, gene expression, and spatial context from the cell to the tissue level. SPATIA also incorporates a novel spatially conditioned generative framework for predicting cell morphologies under perturbations. Specifically, we propose a confidence-aware flow matching objective that reweights weak optimal-transport pairs based on uncertainty. We further apply morphology-profile alignment to encourage biologically meaningful image generation, enabling the modeling of microenvironment-dependent phenotypic transitions. We assembled a multi-scale dataset consisting of 25.9 million cell-gene pairs across 17 tissues. We benchmark SPATIA against 18 models across 12 tasks, spanning categories such as phenotype generation, annotation, clustering, gene imputation, and cross-modal prediction. SPATIA achieves improved performance over state-of-the-art models, improving generative fidelity by 8% and predictive accuracy by up to 3%.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Morpho-Kinematic analysis for Plant Water Stress Classification through Leaf Movements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precise irrigation management requires robust classification of plant water stress. We expanded a morpho-kinematic (MK) framework that derives canopy-movement features from RGB time-lapse imaging evaluating how methodological refinements affect robustness and fine discrimination across four irrigation treatments representing distinct stress histories. The study tested both a biological (Agg) versus an isogonal (Unif) sectoring of the canopy image, within an additive scheme where to the baseline (i.e. flattened MK features, A0) were sequentially added non-linear descriptors (A1), irrigation-context variables (i.e. dry time, A2), and their interactions with baseline (A3). The multi-class problem was decomposed in biologically meaningful binary tasks, and the final classification confronted an adaptive - to the performance obtained in the out-of-fold predictions inside the leave-one-sample-out validation framework - linear opinion pooling (ALOP) ensemble, evaluated across its full parameter space, against hierarchical cascades (HCC). In our combined dataset from two sequential Lactuca sativa experiments (144 sample-days) ALOP median outperformed HCC in every configuration, while non-linear and contextual enrichments (A1-A2) produced consistent improvements in terms of prediction stability, variability (for ALOP), and balanced accuracy (BA). The highest balanced accuracy (median BA = 0.96) was reached under Unif scheme in A3, yet the Agg configuration in A2 achieved the best compromise between accuracy (median BA approx 0.91) and robustness. Concluding, this study identifies methodological pathways that strengthen resilience and transferability of movement-based water-stress classification, establishing a solid foundation for generalizable, low-cost phenotyping.</description>

      <title>Depth-multiplexing spectral domain OCT for full eye length imaging with a single modulation unit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Clinical measurement of a patient's axial eye length is emerging as a crucial approach to track progression and monitor management of myopia. However, the preferred method for such measurements is swept-source OCT, whose cost prohibits broad use, especially in lower-income communities. Spectral domain (SD) OCT is a more affordable option, but it has limited imaging depth range, so is not suitable for full eye length measurement. Depth-multiplexing (DM) techniques for SD-OCT provide a workaround by capturing images at multiple depths within the eye. However, these methods typically require multiple light modulation units or detectors for simultaneous imaging across depths, adding complexity and cost. In response, we propose a novel DM-SD-OCT approach that utilizes a single light modulation unit for depth encoding. We capture images at multiple depths within the eye simultaneously with a single line scan camera, then computationally demix the contributions from different depths. Here, we demonstrate acquisition and demixing of signals from three distinct depths within the eye and validate experimentally in human subjects. Our method thus offers a cost-effective solution for comprehensive eye length measurement in clinical myopia research.</description>

      <title>FGBench: A Dataset and Benchmark for Molecular Property Reasoning at Functional Group-Level in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01055v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant attention in chemistry. However, most existing datasets center on molecular-level property prediction and overlook the role of fine-grained functional group (FG) information. Incorporating FG-level data can provide valuable prior knowledge that links molecular structures with textual descriptions, which can be used to build more interpretable, structure-aware LLMs for reasoning on molecule-related tasks. Moreover, LLMs can learn from such fine-grained information to uncover hidden relationships between specific functional groups and molecular properties, thereby advancing molecular design and drug discovery. Here, we introduce FGBench, a dataset comprising 625K molecular property reasoning problems with functional group information. Functional groups are precisely annotated and localized within the molecule, which ensures the dataset's interoperability thereby facilitating further multimodal applications. FGBench includes both regression and classification tasks on 245 different functional groups across three categories for molecular property reasoning: (1) single functional group impacts, (2) multiple functional group interactions, and (3) direct molecular comparisons. In the benchmark of state-of-the-art LLMs on 7K curated data, the results indicate that current LLMs struggle with FG-level property reasoning, highlighting the need to enhance reasoning capabilities in LLMs for chemistry tasks. We anticipate that the methodology employed in FGBench to construct datasets with functional group-level information will serve as a foundational framework for generating new question-answer pairs, enabling LLMs to better understand fine-grained molecular structure-property relationships. The dataset and evaluation code are available at https://github.com/xuanliugit/FGBench.</description>

      <title>ECMSim: A high-performance interactive web application for real-time spatiotemporal simulation of cardiac ECM signaling and diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling is central to a wide variety of healthy and diseased tissue processes. Unfortunately, predicting ECM remodeling under various chemical and mechanical conditions has proven to be excessively challenging, due in part to its complex regulation by intracellular and extracellular molecular reaction networks that are spatially and temporally dynamic. We introduce ECMSim, which is a highly interactive, real-time, and web application designed to simulate heterogeneous matrix remodeling. The current model simulates cardiac scar tissue with configurable input conditions using a large-scale model of the cardiac fibroblast signaling network. Cardiac fibrosis is a major component of many forms of heart failure. ECMSim solves 1.37 million coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and executes approximately 4.84 million operations per time step in real time, encompassing 137 molecular species and 259 regulatory interactions per cell across a 100x100 spatial array (10,000 cells), which accounts for inputs, receptors, intracellular signaling cascades, ECM production, feedback loops, and molecular diffusion. The algorithm is represented by a set of ODEs that are coupled with ECM molecular diffusion. The equations are solved on demand using compiled C++ and the WebAssembly standard. The software enables the investigation of pathological or experimental conditions, hypothetical scenarios, matrix remodeling, or the testing of the effects of an experimental drug(s) with a target receptor.</description>
