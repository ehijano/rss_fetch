      <title>Hamiltonian mechanics of "magnetic'' solitons in two-component Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider motion of a "magnetic'' soliton in two-component condensates along a non-uniform and time-dependent backgrounds in framework of the Hamiltonian mechanics. Our approach is based on generalization of Stokes' remark that soliton's velocity is related with its inverse half-width by the dispersion law for linear waves continued to the region of complex wave numbers. We obtain expressions for the canonical momentum and the Hamiltonian as functions of soliton's velocity and transform the Hamilton equations to the Newton-like equation. The theory is illustrated by several examples of concrete soliton's dynamics.</description>

      <title>Natural convection in a vertical channel. Part 1. Wavenumber interaction and Eckhaus instability in a narrow domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convection in a vertical channel subjected to a horizontal temperature gradient is numerically investigated. Previous numerical simulations reveal a variety of behaviors: steady, time-periodic and chaotic. We extend previous numerical investigations by constructing stable and unstable branches of equilibria and periodic orbits of the underlying Oberbeck-Boussinesq equations by parametric continuation. In a narrow domain of vertical aspect ratio ten, the observed flow structures are dominated by the competition between three and four co-rotating rolls. We identify the invariant solution branches underlying the observed flow dynamics, characterize the bifurcations creating those branches and link the observed bifurcation scenarios to the symmetries of the primary branches. Specifically, we show that D4 symmetry dictates that several intermediate branches bifurcate simultaneously from the four-roll branch, while D3 symmetry requires that the intersection of these intermediate branches with the three-roll branch be transcritical. We observe other manifestations of the competition between three and four rolls, in which the symmetry in time or in the transverse direction is broken, leading to limit cycles or wavy rolls, respectively. Our work highlights the interest of combining numerical simulations, bifurcation theory, and group theory, in order to understand the transitions between and origin of flow patterns.</description>

      <title>Quantized plastic deformation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In engineering crystal plasticity inelastic mechanisms correspond to tensorial zero-energy valleys in the space of macroscopic strains. The flat nature of such valleys is in contradiction with the fact that plastic slips, mimicking lattice-invariant shears, are inherently discrete. A reconciliation has recently been achieved in the mesoscopic tensorial model (MTM) of crystal plasticity, which introduces periodically modulated energy valleys while also capturing in a geometrically exact way the crystallographically-specific aspects of plastic slips. In this paper, we extend the MTM framework, which in its original form had the appearance of a discretized nonlinear elasticity theory, by explicitly introducing the concept of plastic deformation. The ensuing model contains a novel matrix-valued spin variable, representing the quantized plastic distortion, whose rate-independent evolution can be described by a discrete (quasi-)automaton. The proposed reformulation of the MTM leads to a considerable computational speedup associated with the use of a robust and efficient hybrid Gauss-Newton--Cauchy energy minimization algorithm. To illustrate the effectiveness of the new approach, we present a detailed case-study focusing on the aspects of crystal plasticity that are beyond reach for the classical continuum theory. Thus, we provide compelling evidence that the re-formulated MTM is fully adequate to deal with the intermittency of plastic response under quasi-static loading. In particular, our numerical experiments show that the statistics of dislocational avalanches, associated with plastic yield in 2D square crystals, exhibits a power-law tail with a critical exponent matching the value predicted by general theoretical considerations and also independently observed in discrete-dislocation-dynamics (DDD) simulations.</description>

      <title>Density engineering via inter-condensate dipole-dipole interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of inter-condensate dipole-dipole interactions in a setup consisting of physically disconnected single-species dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates. In particular, making use of the long-range and anisotropic nature of dipole-dipole interactions, we show that the density of a {\em target} dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate can be axially confined and engineered using a trapped {\em control} dipolar condensate. Increasing the number of control condensates leads to exotic ground state structures, including periodic patterns. The latter consists of single and double-peaked structures with coherence between the peaks controlled via the separation between the control condensates, thereby accessing both supersolid-like structures and incoherent arrays of density peaks.</description>
