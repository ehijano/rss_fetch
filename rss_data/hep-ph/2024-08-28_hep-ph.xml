      <title>The Sign of Gauge-Higgs Couplings at Future Lepton Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the capability of future lepton colliders to determine the sign of the gauge-Higgs coupling through the vector boson fusion (VBF) $Zh$ process. This channel offers a model-independent way to probe the sign of the gauge-Higgs coupling. Its sensitivity to interference effects and universal coupling with new physics makes it particularly effective. We show that a high-energy lepton collider such as CLIC can fully determine the sign of the gauge-Higgs coupling in a model-independent way and with high-confidence.</description>

      <title>Collider and CMB complementarity of leptophilic dark matter with light Dirac neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the discovery prospects of leptophilic dark matter (DM) in future lepton colliders by considering the light neutrinos to be of Dirac type. Adopting an effective field theory (EFT) approach, we write down dimension six operators connecting the standard model (SM) fields, light Dirac neutrinos and DM. Considering DM relic to be generated via the thermal freeze-out, we check the discovery prospects at future lepton colliders via mono-photon plus missing energy searches. The right chiral parts of light Dirac neutrinos get thermalised due to their interactions with the bath as well as leptophilic DM, leading to enhanced effective relativistic degrees of freedom $N_{\rm eff}$ within reach of future cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments. The interplay of existing bounds from cosmological observations related to DM relic and $N_{\rm eff}$, direct and indirect detection of DM, astrophysics and collider observations leave promising discovery prospects at future electron and muon colliders along with complementary signatures at future CMB experiments.</description>

      <title>Long Range Energy-energy Correlator at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the forward-backward azimuthal angular correlations of hadrons in association with multi-particle production in the central rapidity region in proton-proton collisions at the LHC. We apply the nucleon energy-energy correlator framework, where the spinning gluon distribution introduces a nontrivial $\cos(2\phi)$ asymmetries. We will demonstrate that the fundamental helicity structure of QCD amplitudes predicts a unique power counting rule: $\cos(2\phi)$ asymmetry starts at ${O}(\alpha_s^2)$ order for dijet, ${O}(\alpha_s)$ for three jet and ${O}(1)$ for four (and more) jet productions. Our results will help us to understand the long standing puzzle of nearside ridge behavior observed in high multiplicity events of $pp$ collisions at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Maxwell's equal-area law for Vaidya-Bonner-de Sitter black hole under Lorentz invariance violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the tunneling of fermions with arbitrary spin near the event horizon of non-stationary Vaidya-Bonner-de Sitter black hole (VBdS) in Lorentz invariance violation (LIV). The modified Hawking temperature of VBdS black holes is calculated by using tortoise coordinate transformation, Feynman prescription and WKB approximation. By considering cosmological constant as a thermodynamic pressure in the extended phase space, we construct Maxwell's equal-area law in LIV and study the phase transitions of VBdS black hole in P-v, P-V and T-S plane. The LIV increases the length of liquid-gas coexistence region. The thermodynamic quantities such as entropy, heat capacity, Helmholtz free energy, Internal energy, enthalpy and Gibbs free energy of VBdS black hole are discussed. These quantities tend to increase under LIV. The stability of black hole is also discussed in the presence of LIV.</description>

      <title>Effect of quark anomalous magnetic moment on neutral dense quark matter under magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the effect of the quark anomalous magnetic moment (AMM) on the neutral dense quark matter under magnetic fields based on the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model at finite baryon density. To address its correlation with the chiral symmetry, we consider a simplified situation: the model includes the two-quark flavors under constant magnetic fields, and incorporates the effective interaction of the quark AMM linked to the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking. We then examine the equation of state (EoS) in cases with and without magnetization for anatomizing the thermodynamic quantities. Without the magnetization, a small magnetic field stiffens the EoS, but with increasing the magnetic field, the EoS tends to soften. The stiffness of the EoS is found to be influenced by the magnetic effect on the critical chemical potential of the chiral phase transition and the quark number density at this critical point. As a result, the mass and radius of the neutral dense quark matter increase with the small magnetic field but turn to decrease as the magnetic field further increases. By including the quark AMM, the critical chemical potential is decreased and the quark number density takes a smaller value. Thus, for the stronger magnetic fields, the quark AMM suppresses the softening effect of the magnetic field on the EoS, leading to increased mass and radius compared to when the quark AMM is absent. In contrast, for the small magnetic field, the contribution of the quark AMM to the EoS is marginal. When the magnetization is taken into account, the magnetic effect on the stiffness of the EoS is overshadowed by the contribution of the magnetization, and the significance of the quark AMM also becomes invisible in the mass-radius relation.</description>

      <title>Lepton flavour violation Signals of the singly charged scalar singlet at the ILC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The singly charged $SU(2)_L$ singlet scalar is one of the very interesting new particles, as it can generate neutrino masses at loop level, produce contributions to various flavour observables. We study the possibility of detecting this kind of scalar predicted by the singly-charged scalar model at ILC via the lepton flavour violation (LFV) process $e^+e^-\rightarrow S^+S^-\rightarrow \mu e + {E\mkern-10.5 mu/}$. Considering the constraints on the free parameters, we obtain the expected sensitivities of the ILC with the center of mass energy $\sqrt{s}=1~\mathrm{TeV}$ and the integrated luminosity $\mathcal{L}=$ $1.5~\mathrm{ab}^{-1}$ to the parameter space of the singly-charged scalar model. The prospective excluded mass range at $95\%$ C.L. is $M_S \gtrsim 470~\mathrm{GeV}$, $410~\mathrm{GeV}$ for the branching ratio $\mathcal{B}_{\mu e}$ = $100\%$ , $50\%$, respectively, while the scalar with $M_S \gtrsim 300~\mathrm{GeV}$ is excluded at $95\%$ C.L. for $\mathcal{B}_{\mu e}$ = $30\%$.</description>

      <title>The pole structures of the $X(1840)/X(1835)$ and the $X(1880)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whether the $N\bar{N}$ interaction could form a state or not is a long standing question, even before the observation of the $p\bar{p}$ threshold enhancement in 2003. The recent high statistic measurement in the $J/\psi \to \gamma 3(\pi^+\pi^-)$ channel would provide a good opportunity to probe the nature of the peak structures around the $p\bar{p}$ threshold in various processes. By constructing the $N\bar{N}$ interaction respecting chiral symmetry, we extract the pole positions by fitting the $p\bar{p}$ and $3(\pi^+\pi^-)$ invariant mass distributions of the $J/\psi \to \gamma p \bar p$ and $J/\psi \to \gamma 3(\pi^+\pi^-)$ processes. The threshold enhancement in the $p\bar{p}$ invariant mass distribution is from the pole on the third Riemann sheet, which more couples to the isospin triplet channel. The broader structure in the $3(\pi^+\pi^-)$ invariant mass comes from the pole on the physical Riemann sheet, which more couples to the isospin singlet channel. Furthermore, the large compositeness indicates that there should exit $p\bar{p}$ resonance based on the current experimental data. In addition, we also see a clear threshold enhancement in the $n\bar{n}$ channel, but not as significant as that in $p\bar{p}$ channel, which is useful and compared with further experimental measurement.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Masses and Mixing in an Axion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel framework that addresses three critical issues: tiny neutrino masses and mixing, dark matter, and the strong CP problem. Our model extends the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry by incorporating modular $S_3$ symmetry to specifically address neutrino mixing. It features two vector-like colored fermions and three colored scalars as $S_3$ singlets, an isospin doublet inert scalar and a singlet PQ scalar with appropriate modular weights assigned. Tiny neutrino masses are generated radiatively through colored mediators, while the KSVZ-type axion appears to dynamically resolve the strong CP problem. We investigate the phenomenology of lepton flavor violation and the muon $g-2$ anomaly within this framework. Additionally, we explore the axion's properties and its role as dark matter.</description>

      <title>Greybody factor and Quasinormal modes of scalar and Dirac field perturbation in Schwarzschild-de Sitter-like black hole in Bumblebee gravity model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the scalar and Dirac field perturbation of Schwarzschild-de Sitter-like black hole in bumblebee gravity model. The effective potentials, greybody factors and quasinormal modes of the black hole are investigated by using the Klein-Gordon equation and Dirac equation. To compute the Gerybody factors for scalar and Dirac field, we use the general method of semi-analytical bounds. The impact of Lorentz invariance violation parameter $L$ and cosmological constant $\Lambda$ to the effective potential, greybody factors and quasinormal modes are analyzed for different modes. Increasing the parameters $\Lambda$ and $L$ lower the effective potentials and consequently increase the rigorous bound on the greybody factors. We also investigate the quasinormal mode using the third order WKB approximation method. Our findings show that the oscillation frequency and the damping rate decrease with increasing $L$.</description>

      <title>Final-state rescattering mechanism of charmed baryon decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamical studies on the non-leptonic weak decays of charmed baryons are always challenging, due to the large non-perturbative contributions at the charm scale. In this work, we develop the final-state rescattering mechanism to study the two-body non-leptonic decays of charmed baryons. The final-state interaction is a physical picture of long-distance effects. Instead of using the Cutkosky rule to calculate the hadronic triangle diagrams which can only provide the imaginary part of decay amplitudes, we point out that the loop integral is more appropriate, as both the real parts and the imaginary parts of amplitudes can be calculated completely. In this way, it can be obtained for the non-trivial strong phases which are essential to calculate CP violations. With the physical picture of long-distance effects and the reasonable method of calculations, it is amazingly achieved that all the nine existing experimental data of branching fractions for the $\Lambda_c^+$ decays into an octet light baryon and a vector meson can be explained by only one parameter of the model. Besides, the decay asymmetries and CP violations are not sensitive to the model parameter, since the dependence on the parameter is mainly cancelled in the ratios, so that the theoretical uncertainties on these observables are lowered down.</description>

      <title>Can Baby Universe Absorption Explain Dark Energy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been proposed that the accelerated expansion of the universe can be explained by the merging of our universe with baby universes, resulting in dark energy with a phantom-like equation of state. However, the evidence in favor of it did not include the full set of cosmological observables. Here we examine the implications of this model for both early and late universe cosmology using data from Planck collaboration, DESI 2024 and other experiments. We find that the pure baby universe model gives a poor fit to current data. Extending it to include a contribution from the cosmological constant, we find two allowed regions of parameter space: one close to $\Lambda$CDM, and another with $\Lambda &lt;0$ plus the exotic dark energy component. The two regions can be significantly favored over $\Lambda$CDM, depending on the choice of supernova datasets, and they can ameliorate the Hubble tension to the level of $2\sigma$, depending on the supernova dataset. The model with $\Lambda&lt;0$ features an equation of state $w(a)$ with a pole singularity at early times.</description>

      <title>Quasitopological Lifshitz dilaton black brane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a new class of $(n+1)$-dimensional Lifshitz dilaton black brane solutions in the presence of the cubic quasitopological gravity for a flat boundary. The related action supports asymptotically Lifshitz solutions by applying some conditions which are used throughout the paper. We have to add a new boundary term and some new counterterms to the bulk action to have finite solutions. Then we define a finite stress tensor complex by which we can calculate the energy density of the quasitopological Lifshitz dilaton black brane. It is not possible to obtain analytical solutions, and so we use some expantions to probe the functions behaviors near the horizon and at the infinity. Combining the equations, we can attain a total constant along the coordinate $r$. At the horizon, this constant is proportional to the product of the temperature and the entropy and at the infinity, the total constant shows the energ density of the quasitopological Lifshitz dilaton black brane. Therefore, we can reach to a relation between the conserved quantities temperature, entropy and the energy density and get a smarr-type formula. Using the first law of thermodynamics, we can find a relation between the entropy and the temperature and then ontain the heat capacity. Our results show that the quasitopological Lifshitz dilaton black brane solutions are thermally stable for each positive values of the dynamical critiacl exponent, $z$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first joint-likelihood analysis of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data. Bayesian inference is performed on the baryon abundance and the effective number of neutrino species, $N_{\rm eff}$, using a CMB Boltzmann solver in combination with LINX, a new flexible and efficient BBN code. We marginalize over Planck nuisance parameters and nuclear rates to find $N_{\rm{eff}} = 3.08_{-0.13}^{+0.13},\,2.94 _{-0.16}^{+0.16},$ or $2.98_{-0.13}^{+0.14}$, for three separate reaction networks. This framework enables robust testing of the Lambda Cold Dark Matter paradigm and its variants with CMB and BBN data.</description>

      <title>Confronting Cold New Early Dark Energy and its Equation of State with Updated CMB and Supernovae Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cold New Early Dark Energy (Cold NEDE) addresses the Hubble tension through a triggered vacuum phase transition in the dark sector. In this paper, we constrain a phenomenological fluid model using recent cosmic microwave background likelihoods based on Planck NPIPE data alongside baryonic acoustic oscillations and supernovae data from Pantheon+. Exploiting the enhanced constraining power of the datasets, we introduce and study an extended version of the NEDE fluid model in which the equation of state parameter $w_\mathrm{NEDE}$, characterizing the post-phase transition fluid, is allowed to evolve with non-vanishing derivatives ${d}w_\mathrm{NEDE}/d\ln a$ and ${d^2}w_\mathrm{NEDE}/{d}(\ln a)^2$. Our results indicate that data is compatible with a rather simple time dependence that could arise from a mixture of radiation and a stiff fluid. With the updated datasets, the base and extended models still show a significant reduction of the DMAP tension from $6.3 \sigma$ in $\Lambda$CDM down to $3.5\sigma$ with a small simultaneous reduction of the $S_8$ tension, slightly improving over recent findings for the axion-like early dark energy model.</description>

      <title>LINX: A Fast, Differentiable, and Extensible Big Bang Nucleosynthesis Package</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce LINX (Light Isotope Nucleosynthesis with JAX), a new differentiable public Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) code designed for fast parameter estimation. By leveraging JAX, LINX achieves both speed and differentiability, enabling the use of Bayesian inference, including gradient-based methods. We discuss the formalism used in LINX for rapid primordial elemental abundance predictions and give examples of how LINX can be used. When combined with differentiable Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) power spectrum emulators, LINX can be used for joint CMB and BBN analyses without requiring extensive computational resources, including on personal hardware.</description>

      <title>Energy-dependent intrinsic time delay of gamma-ray bursts on testing Lorentz invariance violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-energy photons of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) might be emitted at different intrinsic times with energy dependence at the source. In this letter, we expand the model from previous works on testing the Lorentz Invariance Violation (LV) with the observed GRB data from the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. We reanalyze the previous data with the full Bayesian parameter estimation method and get consistent results by assuming that the time delays are due to an LV term and a constant intrinsic time delay term. Subsequently, we neglect the LV effect and only consider the intrinsic time delay effect. We assume a common intrinsic time delay term along with a source energy correlated time delay of high-energy photons. We find that the energy-dependent emission times can also explain the observed GRB data of high-energy photon events. Finally, we integrate these two physical mechanisms into a unified model to distinguish and evaluate their respective contributions using the observed GRB data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a search for a lepton-portal dark matter model, where dark matter couples to a charged lepton in the standard model. This simplified model naturally leads to photon-mediated dark matter interactions with nuclei, making it suitable for direct dark matter detection experiments. Matching to the framework of non-relativistic effective field theory for dark matter, we report the first sensitive search for this model using data from the PandaX-4T commissioning run. Our results yield strong constraints on Dirac fermion dark matter but relatively weaker constraints on Majorana dark matter due to the suppression of effective photon interactions. These constraints complement those obtained from the collider and indirect detection experiments.</description>

      <title>A dynamical Einstein-Born-Infeld-dilaton model and holographic quarkonium melting in a magnetic field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the potential reconstruction method to set up a dynamical Einstein-Born-Infeld-dilaton model, which we then use to study holographic quarkonium melting in an external magnetic field. The non-linear nature of the model allows to couple the magnetic field to the quarkonium inner structure without having to introduce back-reacting charged flavour degrees of freedom. The magnetic field dependent melting temperature is computed from the spectral functions and suggests a switch from magnetic to inverse magnetic catalysis when the magnetic field increases. We also discuss the differences due to the anisotropy brought in by the external field.</description>

      <title>Source Count Distribution of Fermi LAT Gamma-Ray Blazars Using Novel Nonparametric Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We utilized a sample from the Fermi-LAT 14-year Source Catalog by adjusting the flux detection threshold, enabling us to derive the intrinsic source count distribution $dN/dF_{25}$ of extragalactic blazars using nonparametric, unbinned methods developed by Efron and Petrosian and Lynden-Bell. Subsequently, we evaluated the contribution of blazars to the extragalactic gamma-ray background. Our findings are summarized as follows: (1) There is no significant correlation between flux and spectral index values among blazars and their subclasses FSRQs and BL Lacs. (2) The intrinsic differential distributions of flux values exhibit a broken-power-law form, with parameters that closely match previous findings. The intrinsic photon index distributions are well described by a Gaussian form for FSRQs and BL Lacs individually, while a dual-Gaussian model provides a more appropriate fit for blazars as a whole. (3) Blazars contribute 34.5\% to the extragalactic gamma-ray background and 16.8\% to the extragalactic diffuse gamma-ray background. When examined separately, FSRQs and BL Lacs contribute 19.6\% and 13\% to the extragalactic gamma-ray background, respectively.</description>

      <title>MEET-U project II: Curvature perturbations from kinetic preheating after $\alpha$-attractor inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Preheating at the end of inflation is a violent nonlinear process that efficiently transfers the energy of the inflaton to a second field, the preheat field. When the preheat field is light during inflation and its background value modulates the preheating process, the superhorizon isocurvature perturbations of the preheat field may be converted to curvature perturbations that leave an imprint on the cosmic microwave background and the large-scale structure of the universe. We use high-precision lattice simulations to study kinetic preheating after $\alpha$-attractor inflation, a case where the effective mass of the preheat field is naturally suppressed during inflation. By comparing the expansion e-folds between different Hubble patches, we find that the conversion from isocurvature perturbations to curvature perturbations is very inefficient and can hardly be detected by cosmological observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nuclear de-excitations associated with neutrino-nucleus interactions and nucleon decays are playing an increasingly significant role in neutrino experiments. We explore the GEMINI++ code and estimate its ability to account for the de-excitation processes of highly excited $^{11}$B$^*$ and $^{15}$N$^*$, which can be created in the liquid scintillator and water Cherenkov detectors respectively. It is found that GEMINI++ can not describe the nuclear experimental data of $^{11}$B$^*$ and $^{15}$N$^*$ well. To improve its performance for de-excitations of light nuclei, we modify GEMINI++ and then develop a code of GEMINI++4$\nu$, which can give the best predictions compared with experimental measurements among some widely used statistical model codes.</description>

Abstract: This special issue of the Astroparticle Physics journal is dedicated to the memory of Thomas Korff Gaisser, the Martin A. Pomerantz Professor Emeritus of Physics at the University of Delaware. Tom was one of the most prominent scientists in cosmic-ray and astroparticle physics, and also one of the founding editors of this very journal. A theoretical particle physicist by training, he dedicated his career to cosmic-ray physics. He worked on the phenomenology of high-energy particle interactions in the atmosphere, modeling extensive air showers, including the famous 'Gaisser-Hillas' function describing their longitudinal profile. A focus of his work were muon and neutrino fluxes resulting from cosmic-ray showers in the atmosphere, and their measurement with specialized experiments at the South Pole.</description>

      <title>Sources of longitudinal flow decorrelations in high-energy nuclear collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The longitudinal structure of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) consists of several components spanning various scales. However, its short-range features are often obscured by final-state non-flow correlations. Here, we introduce a data-driven approach to separate initial state structures from non-flow effects. The longitudinal structure is found having two distinct components: one that reflects the global twisted geometry of the QGP, and another that captures localized fluctuations in rapidity. The characteristics of this second component, contributing to short- and medium-range flow decorrelations, can be quantified by comparing collisions of nuclei with different shapes. This study represents the first successful attempt to disentangle long- and short-range flow decorrelations from non-flow backgrounds, providing new insights into the initial conditions of heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Why do newer degrees of freedom appear in higher-order truncated hydrodynamic theory?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An exact derivation of relativistic hydrodynamics from an underlying microscopic theory has been shown to be an all-order theory. From the relativistic transport equation of kinetic theory, the full expressions of hydrodynamic viscous fluxes have been derived which turn out to include all orders of out-of-equilibrium derivative corrections. It has been shown, that for maintaining causality, it is imperative that the temporal derivatives must include all orders, which can be resummed in non-local, relaxation operator-like forms and finally `integrated in' introducing newer degrees of freedom. The theory can of course be truncated at any higher spatial orders, but the power over the the infinite temporal sum increases correspondingly such that the causality is respected. As a result, the theory truncated at any higher order of spatial gradient, requires newer degrees of freedom for each increasing order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01689v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The conversion of protons to positrons at the horizon of a black hole (BH) is considered. It is shown that the process may efficiently proceed for BHs with masses in the range $\sim 10^{18}$ -- $10^{21}$ g. It is argued that the electric charge of BH acquired by the proton accretion to BH could create electric field near BH horizon close to the critical Schwinger one. It leads to efficient electron-positron pair production, when electrons are back captured by the BH while positrons are emitted into outer space. Annihilation of these positrons with electrons in the interstellar medium may at least partially explain the origin of the observed 511 keV line.</description>

Abstract: We present a new paradigm for the production of the dark matter (DM) relic abundance based on the evaporation of early Universe primordial black holes (PBHs) themselves formed from DM particles. As a concrete realization, we consider a minimal model of the dark sector in which a first-order phase transition results in the formation of Fermiball remnants that collapse to PBHs, which then emit DM particles. We show that the regurgitated DM scenario allows for DM in the mass range $\sim1$ GeV $- \,10^{16}$ GeV, thereby unlocking parameter space considered excluded.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the MD-BFKL equation, considering both shadowing and anti-shadowing effects in gluon recombination processes. By deriving analytical expressions for unintegrated gluon distributions through the solution of the MD-BFKL equation, with and without the incorporation of anti-shadowing effect, we offer new insights into the influence of these effects on the behavior of unintegrated gluon distributions. Our results, when compared to the CT18NLO gluon distribution function, demonstrate that the anti-shadowing effect has a notably stronger impact on the characteristics of unintegrated gluon distributions, particularly in regions of high rapidity and momentum. This work significantly contributes to the understanding of gluon recombination mechanisms and their implications in high energy physics.</description>

Abstract: Hot viscous plasmas unavoidably emit a gravitational wave background, similar to electromagnetic black body radiation. We study the contribution from hidden particles to the diffuse background emitted by the primordial plasma in the early universe. While this contribution can easily dominate over that from Standard Model particles, we find that both are capped by a generic upper bound that makes them difficult to detect with interferometers in the foreseeable future. We illustrate our results for axions and heavy neutral leptons. Finally, our results suggest that previous works overestimated the gravitational wave background from particle decays out of thermal equilibrium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10265v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum simulations of the dynamics of QCD have been limited by the complexities of mapping the continuous gauge fields onto quantum computers. By parametrizing the gauge invariant Hilbert space in terms of plaquette degrees of freedom, we show how the Hilbert space and interactions can be expanded in inverse powers of N_c. At leading order in this expansion, the Hamiltonian simplifies dramatically, both in the required size of the Hilbert space as well as the type of interactions involved. Adding a truncation of the resulting Hilbert space in terms of local energy states we give explicit constructions that allow simple representations of SU(3) gauge fields on qubits and qutrits. This formulation allows a simulation of the real time dynamics of a SU(3) lattice gauge theory on a 5x5 and 8x8 lattice on ibm_torino with a CNOT depth of 113.</description>

Abstract: The first observation of $\mathcal{B}\left(B^+\rightarrow K^+\nu\nu\right)$ by the Belle II experiment lies almost $3\sigma$ away from the Standard Model expectation. In this letter we study this result in the SMEFT, extended by a light right-handed neutrino. We explore the correlations between the measured decay rate and other observables, such as $\mathcal{B}\left(B\rightarrow K^*\nu\nu\right)$ and $F_L\left(B\rightarrow K^*\nu\nu\right)$, showing that they could disentangle among scenarios involving left-handed neutrinos and those with the right-handed ones. Furthermore, we find that the high-$p_T$ tails of Drell-Yan processes studied at LHC provide important constraints that help us exclude some of the scenarios consistent with the Belle II result.</description>

      <title>Minimal Type-I Dirac seesaw and Leptogenesis under $A_{4}$ modular invariance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a Dirac mass model based on $A_{4}$ modular symmetry within Type-I seesaw framework. This extension of Standard Model requires three right-handed neutrinos and three heavy Dirac fermions superfields, all singlet under $SU(2)_{L}$ symmetry. The scalar sector is extended by the inclusion of a $SU(2)_{L}$ singlet superfield, $\chi$. Here, the modular symmetry plays a crucial role as the Yukawa couplings acquire modular forms, which are expressed in terms of Dedekind eta function $\eta(\tau)$. Therefore, the Yukawa couplings follow transformations akin to other matter fields, thereby obviating the necessity of additional flavon fields. The acquisition of $vev$ by complex modulus $\tau$ leads to the breaking of $A_{4}$ modular symmetry. We have obtained predictions on neutrino oscillation parameters, for example, the normal hierarchy for the neutrino mass spectrum. Furthermore, we find that heavy Dirac fermions, in our model, can decay to produce observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe through Dirac leptogenesis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work aims to review several aspects of the current status of the rare $\pi^0\to e^+e^-$ decay. A particular emphasis is made on radiative corrections and detailed interpretation of related quantities, some numbers appearing in the literature are updated, and the connection with the Dalitz decay, $\pi^0\to e^+e^-\gamma$, is discussed. This comes timely as it is aligned with an announcement of a preliminary result of a new branching-ratio measurement done by the NA62 Collaboration, which brings new light into an earlier-reported discrepancy between the Standard Model prediction and the (until-recently latest) precise KTeV result.</description>

      <title>Baryogenesis via QCD preheating with nonadiabatic baryon chemical potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03261v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The chiral phase transition in QCD can be supercooled in the thermal history of the universe to be instantaneously out-of equilibrium, if QCD is coupled to a dark QCD sector exhibiting the dark chiral phase transition of the first order. In that case the QCD sigma meson field (as the chiral order parameter, or the light quark condensate) starts to roll in a nonadiabatic way down to the true QCD vacuum. Meanwhile a dynamic baryonic chemical potential can be generated solely within QCD, which is governed by the dynamic motion of the QCD sigma meson field, analogously to the spontaneous baryogenesis or the leptogenesis via the Higgs or axionlike relaxation scenario. When QCD is further allowed to communicate with a dark fermion with mass of order of 1 GeV and the baryon number violating coupling to neutron, the nonadiabatic QCD sigma motion along with the nonadiabatic baryon chemical potential can trigger the preheating and produce the baryon number asymmetry. We discuss this scenario in details to find that the QCD-induced dynamic baryon chemical potential plays a significant role for the QCD preheating and the baryogenesis, which yields the desired amount of the asymmetry today consistently with current astrophysical, cosmological, and terrestrial experimental constraints. Cosmological and phenomenological consequences characteristic to the present scenario are also addressed.</description>

      <title>An improved description of charm fragmentation data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the fragmentation of heavy quarks into heavy-flavoured hadrons, specifically the production of charmed mesons in $e^+e^-$ collisions, at different centre-of-mass energies. We focus our attention on the ratio of moments of the $D^{*+}$ energy spectrum measured by ALEPH and CLEO. This ratio is believed to provide us with a direct test of perturbative QCD evolution because hadronisation effects should cancel between the numerator and denominator. However, state-of-the-art calculations based on standard (final-state) collinear factorisation fail to describe the experimental data. We show that this discrepancy is considerably reduced if heavy-quark threshold effects are accounted for not only in DGLAP evolution, as it is usually done, but also in the resummed coefficient functions.</description>

      <title>Thermal Dark Matter with Low-Temperature Reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the production of thermal dark matter (DM) candidates (WIMPs, SIMPs, ELDERs and Cannibals) during cosmic reheating. Assuming a general parametrization for the scaling of the inflaton energy density and the standard model (SM) temperature, we study the requirements for kinetic and chemical DM freeze-out in a model-independent way. For each of the mechanisms, up to two solutions that fit the entire observed DM relic density exist, for a given reheating scenario and DM mass. As an example, we assume a simple particle physics model in which DM interacts with itself and with SM through contact interactions. We find that low-temperature reheating can accommodate a wider range of couplings and larger masses than those permitted in the usual instantaneous high-temperature reheating. This results in DM solutions for WIMPs reaching masses as high as $10^{14}$~GeV, whereas for SIMPs and ELDERs, we can reach masses of $10^{13}$~GeV. Interestingly, current experimental data already constrain the enlarged parameter space of these models with low-reheating temperatures. Next-generation experiments could further probe these scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the article, we study the processes of single isolated photon production at the LHC energies in the framework of the Parton Reggeization Approach taking into account LO and NLO* contributions, the last one includes only tree-level corrections. Reggeized amplitudes are constructed according to the effective field theory formalism for multi-Regge kinematics processes suggested by L.N. Lipatov. To avoid the double counting between tree-level corrections and unintegrated parton distribution functions, a subtraction scheme is introduced. The results of calculations are compared with experimental data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic fields in heavy-ion collisions are pivotal and subject to diverse factors. In this study, we quantitatively investigate the impact of fluid vorticity on the evolution of magnetic fields in the 20-50\% centrality class in Au+Au collisions, with collision energies of $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=(7.7, 14.5, 19.6, 27, 39, 62.4, 200)$ GeV. Our results indicate that fluid vorticity leads to a delay in the evolution of the magnetic field, in which this effect becomes more pronounced as the collision energy decreases. Additionally, we have calculated the mean magnetic field values on the freeze-out hypersurface for various collision energies. Our simulation results align with the values inferred from experimental data of $\bar{\Lambda}-\Lambda$, within the error margins.</description>

Abstract: We present the constraints on the axial-vector and pseudo-scalar mediated WIMP-nucleus interactions from the PandaX-4T experiment, using the data set corresponding to a total exposure of 0.63~tonne$\cdot$year. No significant signal excess is observed, and the most stringent upper limits to date on the spin-dependent WIMP-neutron scattering cross section are set at 90\% confidence level with the minimum WIMP-neutron scattering cross section of 5.8$\times 10^{-42}$\si{\cm^{2}} for WIMP mass of 40~\si{\GeV/}$c^2$. Exclusion limits on the axial-vector and pseudo-scalar simplified models are also derived.</description>

      <title>Exploring Axions through the Photon Ring of a Spherically Symmetric Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we examine the phenomenon of photon axion conversion occurring in the spacetime surrounding a black hole. Specifically, we focus on the potential existence of a magnetic field around the supermassive black hole M87*, which could facilitate the conversion of photons into axions in close proximity to the photon sphere. While photons traverse through the curved spacetime, they spend time near the photon sphere, where conversion of these photons into axions takes place. Consequently, this process leads to a decrease in the intensity of the black hole's photon ring. To explore the possibilities of detecting these hypothetical axion particles, we propose observing the photon sphere using higher resolution telescopes. By doing so, we can gain valuable insights into the conversion mechanism as well as the nature of the spherically symmetric black hole geometry. Moreover, we also investigate how the photon ring luminosities are affected if the black hole possesses a charge parameter. For instance apart from U(1) electric charge, the presence of extra dimension may induce a {\em tidal charge} with a characteristic signature. It is important to note that the success of the conversion mechanism relies on the axion-photon coupling and mass. As a result, the modified luminosity of the black hole's photon ring offers a valuable means of constraining the axion's mass and coupling parameter within a certain range. Thus our findings contribute to a better understanding of photon axion conversion in the environment of a black hole spacetime and helps us explore the possible existence of extra spatial dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If dark matter (DM) consists of primordial black holes (PBHs) and particles simultaneously, PBHs are generically embedded within particle DM halos. Such ``dressed PBHs'' (dPBHs) are subject to modified constraints compared to PBHs and can contribute to significant DM abundance in the mass range $10^{-1} - 10^2 M_\odot$. We show that diffractive lensing of chirping gravitational waves (GWs) from binary mergers can not only discover, but can also identify dPBH lenses and discriminate them from bare PBHs on the event-by-event basis, with potential to definitively establish the coexistence of subdominant PBHs and particle DM.</description>

      <title>Confinement and Kink Entanglement Asymmetry on a Quantum Ising Chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the interplay of confinement, string breaking and entanglement asymmetry on a 1D quantum Ising chain. We consider the evolution of an initial domain wall and show that, surprisingly, while the introduction of confinement through a longitudinal field typically suppresses entanglement, it can also serve to increase it beyond a bound set for free particles. Our model can be tuned to conserve the number of domain walls, which gives an opportunity to explore entanglement asymmetry associated with link variables. We study two approaches to deal with the non-locality of the link variables, either directly or following a Kramers-Wannier transformation that maps bond variables (kinks) to site variables (spins). We develop a numerical procedure for computing the asymmetry using tensor network methods and use it to demonstrate the different types of entanglement and entanglement asymmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been demonstrated that factorial moments analysis in dependence from the size of phase-space cells (when the latter is decreased but is still considerably large), exhibits sensitivity to particle bunching within a system situated in the two-dimensional cell. Based on recent findings concerning fluctuations in charge particle density observed in central Au + Au collisions at various energies ranging from $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7 to 200 GeV at RHIC/STAR, it is proposed that analyzing factorial moments in relativistic heavy-ion collisions could serve as a method to investigate density fluctuations linked to correlation phenomena. Our understanding of particle production mechanisms may be enriched by using factorial moments analysis to gain new information contained in them that was previously unavailable.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Purity Lost: Perturbative and Resummed Late-Time Inflationary Decoherence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12240v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the rate with which unobserved fields decohere other fields to which they couple, both in flat space and in de Sitter space, for spectator scalar fields prepared in their standard adiabatic vacuum. The process is very efficient in de Sitter space once the modes in question pass outside the Hubble scale, displaying the tell-tale phenomenon of secular growth that indicates the breakdown of perturbative methods on a time scale parameterically long compared with the Hubble time. We show how to match the perturbative evolution valid at early times onto a late-time Lindblad evolution whose domain of validity extends to much later times, thereby allowing a reliable resummation of the perturbative result beyond the perturbative regime. Super-Hubble modes turn out to be dominantly decohered by unobserved modes that are themselves also super-Hubble. Although our calculation is done for spectator fields, if applied to curvature perturbations during inflation our observations here could close a potential loophole in recent calculations of the late-time purity of the observable primordial fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Centre vortex geometry at finite temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The geometry of centre vortices is studied in $\mathrm{SU(3)}$ gauge theory at finite temperature to capture the key structural changes that occur through the deconfinement phase transition. Visualisations of the vortex structure in temporal and spatial slices of the lattice reveal a preference for the vortex sheet to align with the temporal dimension above the critical temperature. This is quantified through a correlation measure. A collection of vortex statistics, including vortex and branching point densities, and vortex path lengths between branching points, are analysed to highlight internal shifts in vortex behaviour arising from the loss of confinement. We find the zero-temperature inclination of branching points to cluster at short distances vanishes at high temperatures, embodying a rearrangement of branching points within the vortex structure. These findings establish the many aspects of centre vortex geometry that characterise the deconfinement phase transition in pure gauge theory.</description>

Abstract: Dark energy (and its simplest model, the Cosmological Constant or $\Lambda$) acts as a repulsive force that opposes gravitational attraction. Assuming galaxies maintain a steady state over extended periods, the estimated upper limit on $\Lambda$ studies its pushback to the attractive gravitational force of dark matter. From the SPARC dataset, we select galaxies that are best fitted by the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) and Hernquist density models. Introducing the presence of $\Lambda$ in these galaxies helps to establish the upper limit on its repulsive force. This upper limit on $\Lambda$ is around $\rho_{\left(&lt;\Lambda\right)} \sim 10^{-25}$~kg/m$^3$, only two orders of magnitude higher than the one measured by Planck. {We show that for galaxies with detectable velocities far from the galaxy core, the upper limit on $\Lambda$ is lower. Furthermore, we show that galaxies and other systems follow the same principle: for larger orbital periods the upper limit on $\Lambda$ is lower. Consequently, we address the implications for future measurements on the upper limit and the condition for detecting the impact of $\Lambda$ on galactic scales.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Birefringence from Fuzzy Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) birefringence is a remarkable phenomenon that can be used to test the parity violation in gravity. By coupling the fuzzy dark matter (FDM) scalar to the gravitational Chern-Simons term, we explore the GW birefringence effects in the FDM background. In particular, in light of the highly oscillating granular FDM structure at the galactic scale, we are led to investigating the GW propagation in the Chern-Simons gravity over the general nontrivial scalar profile, which is a natural extension of previous studies on the homogeneous and isotropic configurations. As a result, it is found that GWs of both circularly polarized modes propagate in the straight line with the speed of light, and does not show any velocity birefringence. However, when considering the imaginary part of the dispersion relation, GWs exhibit the amplitude birefringence in which one circular polarization is enhanced while the other suppressed. Due to its local nature, the FDM-induced amplitude birefringence only depends on the GW frequency without any reliance on the GW event distance. More importantly, the birefringence factor shows a periodic time variation with the period reflecting the FDM scalar mass, which is the smoking gun for testing this new birefringence mechanism. Finally, we also study the extra-galactic FDM contribution to the GW birefringence, which is shown to be suppressed by the cosmological DM density and thus subdominant compared with the galactic counterpart.</description>

      <title>Self-interacting axion clouds around rotating black holes in binary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superradiant instability can form clouds around rotating black holes (BHs) composed of ultralight bosonic fields, such as axions. A BH with such a cloud in a binary system exhibits rich phenomena, and gravitational waves (GWs) from the BH merger provide a means to probe axions. For the first time, we study the evolution of axion clouds in a binary system during the inspiral phase, including axion self-interaction effects. When the self-interaction is significant, unlike in the negligible case, two types of clouds coexist through mode coupling. We examine the evolution of the system considering the effects of dissipation caused by both self-interaction and tidal interaction. For tidal interaction, in addition to the processes of emission to infinity and absorption by the BH, indirect emission via transitions (both resonant and off-resonant) is also considered as a second-order perturbation. Our results demonstrate that the signatures of axion self-interaction are imprinted in the modification of the GW phase. Furthermore, we find the possibility of a dynamical instability called bosenova during the binary inspiral phase.</description>
