      <title>Deal: Distributed End-to-End GNN Inference for All Nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a new research frontier with various applications and successes. The end-to-end inference for all nodes, is common for GNN embedding models, which are widely adopted in applications like recommendation and advertising. While sharing opportunities arise in GNN tasks (i.e., inference for a few nodes and training), the potential for sharing in full graph end-to-end inference is largely underutilized because traditional efforts fail to fully extract sharing benefits due to overwhelming overheads or excessive memory usage.
  This paper introduces Deal, a distributed GNN inference system that is dedicated to end-to-end inference for all nodes for graphs with multi-billion edges. First, we unveil and exploit an untapped sharing opportunity during sampling, and maximize the benefits from sharing during subsequent GNN computation. Second, we introduce memory-saving and communication-efficient distributed primitives for lightweight 1-D graph and feature tensor collaborative partitioning-based distributed inference. Third, we introduce partitioned, pipelined communication and fusing feature preparation with the first GNN primitive for end-to-end inference. With Deal, the end-to-end inference time on real-world benchmark datasets is reduced up to 7.70 x and the graph construction time is reduced up to 21.05 x, compared to the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Environment-Aware Dynamic Pruning for Pipelined Edge Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: IoT and edge-based inference systems require unique solutions to overcome resource limitations and unpredictable environments. In this paper, we propose an environment-aware dynamic pruning system that handles the unpredictability of edge inference pipelines. While traditional pruning approaches can reduce model footprint and compute requirements, they are often performed only once, offline, and are not designed to react to transient or post-deployment device conditions. Similarly, existing pipeline placement strategies may incur high overhead if reconfigured at runtime, limiting their responsiveness. Our approach allows slices of a model, already placed on a distributed pipeline, to be ad-hoc pruned as a means of load-balancing. To support this capability, we introduce two key components: (1) novel training strategies that endow models with robustness to post-deployment pruning, and (2) an adaptive algorithm that determines the optimal pruning level for each node based on monitored bottlenecks. In real-world experiments on a Raspberry Pi 4B cluster running camera-trap workloads, our method achieves a 1.5x speedup and a 3x improvement in service-level objective (SLO) attainment, all while maintaining high accuracy.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Augmentation in Federation: Rethinking What Collaborative Learning Can Bring Back to Decentralized Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data, as an observable form of knowledge, has become one of the most important factors of production for the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Meanwhile, increasing legislation and regulations on private and proprietary information results in scattered data sources also known as the ``data islands''. Although some collaborative learning paradigms such as Federated Learning (FL) can enable privacy-preserving training over decentralized data, they have inherent deficiencies in fairness, costs and reproducibility because of being learning-centric, which greatly limits the way how participants cooperate with each other. In light of this, we present a knowledge-centric paradigm termed \emph{Knowledge Augmentation in Federation} (KAF), with focus on how to enhance local knowledge through collaborative effort. We provide the suggested system architecture, formulate the prototypical optimization objective, and review emerging studies that employ methodologies suitable for KAF. On our roadmap, with a three-way categorization we describe the methods for knowledge expansion, knowledge filtering, and label and feature space correction in the federation. Further, we highlight several challenges and open questions that deserve more attention from the community. With our investigation, we intend to offer new insights for what collaborative learning can bring back to decentralized data.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Memory Efficiency in Large Language Model Training Through Chronos-aware Pipeline Parallelism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Larger model sizes and longer sequence lengths have empowered the Large Language Model (LLM) to achieve outstanding performance across various domains. However, this progress brings significant storage capacity challenges for LLM pretraining. High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) is expensive and requires more advanced packaging technologies for capacity expansion, creating an urgent need for memory-efficient scheduling strategies. Yet, prior pipeline parallelism schedules have primarily focused on reducing bubble overhead, often neglecting memory efficiency and lacking compatibility with other memory-efficient strategies. Consequently, these methods struggle to meet the storage demands of storage capacity for next-generation LLM. This work presents ChronosPipe, a Chronos-aware pipeline parallelism for memory-efficient LLM pretraining. The core insight of ChronosPipe is to treat HBM as a fast but small 'cache,' optimizing and exploiting temporal locality within LLM pretraining to enhance HBM utilization. ChronosPipe introduces a pipeline scheduling strategy, Chronos-Pipe, to reduce the extrinsic overhead that disrupts the temporal locality of activations. Additionally, it leverages Chronos-Recomp and Chronos-Offload to efficiently harness the intrinsic temporal locality of activations and weights in Deep Neural Networks. Experiment results show that ChronosPipe can expand the trainable model size by 2.4x while maintaining comparable throughput, achieving 1.5x better than the 1F1B strategy combined with recomputation.</description>

      <title>Access Specification-Aware Software Transactional Memory Techniques for Efficient Execution of Smart Contract Transactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a high-performance blockchain like Supra's Layer 1, minimizing latencies across key components is crucial-such as data dissemination, consensus (or ordering), and transaction execution. While through significant innovations we have improved the first two, transaction execution remains an area for further optimization. Software Transactional Memory (STM) is a widely used technique for parallel execution, with Aptos' BlockSTM pioneering its application of efficient blockchain transaction processing on multi-core validator nodes. Subsequently, PEVM [13] adapted BlockSTM for EVM transaction execution. However, we identified a gap in existing STM techniques-while access specifications have been used in industry (e.g., Solana's user-provided read-write sets), they have not been leveraged to enhance STM efficiency. Our experimental analysis demonstrates that specification-aware STMs outperform their plain counterparts on both EVM and MoveVM. To maximize these benefits, we have designed specification-aware SupraSTM (saSupraSTM), a novel algorithm that fully utilizes access specifications. Through extensive testing, saSupraSTM outperforms both our specification-aware adaptation of Aptos' BlockSTM and specification-aware PEVM, setting a new benchmark for transaction execution efficiency in the context of blockchain networks.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Dynamic SLO Compliance in Distributed Computing Continuum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring Service Level Objectives (SLOs) in large-scale architectures, such as Distributed Computing Continuum Systems (DCCS), is challenging due to their heterogeneous nature and varying service requirements across different devices and applications. Additionally, unpredictable workloads and resource limitations lead to fluctuating performance and violated SLOs. To improve SLO compliance in DCCS, one possibility is to apply machine learning; however, the design choices are often left to the developer. To that extent, we provide a benchmark of Active Inference -- an emerging method from neuroscience -- against three established reinforcement learning algorithms (Deep Q-Network, Advantage Actor-Critic, and Proximal Policy Optimization). We consider a realistic DCCS use case: an edge device running a video conferencing application alongside a WebSocket server streaming videos. Using one of the respective algorithms, we continuously monitor key performance metrics, such as latency and bandwidth usage, to dynamically adjust parameters -- including the number of streams, frame rate, and resolution -- to optimize service quality and user experience. To test algorithms' adaptability to constant system changes, we simulate dynamically changing SLOs and both instant and gradual data-shift scenarios, such as network bandwidth limitations and fluctuating device thermal states. Although the evaluated algorithms all showed advantages and limitations, our findings demonstrate that Active Inference is a promising approach for ensuring SLO compliance in DCCS, offering lower memory usage, stable CPU utilization, and fast convergence.</description>

      <title>SoK: Microservice Architectures from a Dependability Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The microservice software architecture leverages the idea of splitting large monolithic applications into multiple smaller services that interact using lightweight communication schemes. While the microservice architecture has proven its ability to support modern business applications, it also introduces new possible weak points in a system. Some scientific literature surveys have already addressed fault tolerance or security concerns but most of them lack analysis on the fault and vulnerability coverage that is introduced by microservice architectures. We explore the known faults and vulnerabilities that microservice architecture might suffer from, and the recent scientific literature that addresses them. We emphasize runtime detection and recovery mechanisms instead of offline prevention and mitigation mechanisms to limit the scope of this document.</description>

      <title>Design and Implementation of an IoT Cluster with Raspberry Pi Powered by Solar Energy: A Theoretical Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This document presents the design and implementation of a low-power IoT server cluster, based on Raspberry Pi 3 Model B and powered by solar energy. The proposed architecture integrates Kubernetes (K3s) and Docker, providing an efficient, scalable, and high-performance computing environment. The cluster is designed to optimize energy consumption, leveraging a 200W solar panel system and a 100Ah lithium-ion battery to support continuous operation under favorable environmental conditions. Performance analysis was conducted based on theoretical inferences and data obtained from external sources, evaluating resource allocation, power consumption, and service availability. These analyses provide theoretical estimates of the system's operational feasibility under different scenarios. The results suggest that this system can serve as a viable and sustainable alternative for edge computing applications and cloud services, reducing dependence on traditional data centers. In addition to its positive impact on environmental sustainability by significantly reducing the carbon footprint, this solution also addresses economic concerns, as conventional data centers consume enormous amounts of energy, leading to increased demand on the power grid and higher operational costs.</description>

      <title>Hopfield Networks Meet Big Data: A Brain-Inspired Deep Learning Framework for Semantic Data Linking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exponential rise in data generation has led to vast, heterogeneous datasets crucial for predictive analytics and decision-making. Ensuring data quality and semantic integrity remains a challenge. This paper presents a brain-inspired distributed cognitive framework that integrates deep learning with Hopfield networks to identify and link semantically related attributes across datasets. Modeled on the dual-hemisphere functionality of the human brain, the right hemisphere assimilates new information while the left retrieves learned representations for association. Our architecture, implemented on MapReduce with Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), leverages deep Hopfield networks as an associative memory mechanism to enhance recall of frequently co-occurring attributes and dynamically adjust relationships based on evolving data patterns. Experiments show that associative imprints in Hopfield memory are reinforced over time, ensuring linked datasets remain contextually meaningful and improving data disambiguation and integration accuracy. Our results indicate that combining deep Hopfield networks with distributed cognitive processing offers a scalable, biologically inspired approach to managing complex data relationships in large-scale environments.</description>

      <title>Convergence Analysis of Federated Learning Methods Using Backward Error Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Backward error analysis allows finding a modified loss function, which the parameter updates really follow under the influence of an optimization method. The additional loss terms included in this modified function is called implicit regularizer. In this paper, we attempt to find the implicit regularizer for various federated learning algorithms on non-IID data distribution, and explain why each method shows different convergence behavior. We first show that the implicit regularizer of FedAvg disperses the gradient of each client from the average gradient, thus increasing the gradient variance. We also empirically show that the implicit regularizer hampers its convergence. Similarly, we compute the implicit regularizers of FedSAM and SCAFFOLD, and explain why they converge better. While existing convergence analyses focus on pointing out the advantages of FedSAM and SCAFFOLD, our approach can explain their limitations in complex non-convex settings. In specific, we demonstrate that FedSAM can partially remove the bias in the first-order term of the implicit regularizer in FedAvg, whereas SCAFFOLD can fully eliminate the bias in the first-order term, but not in the second-order term. Consequently, the implicit regularizer can provide a useful insight on the convergence behavior of federated learning from a different theoretical perspective.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Inspired Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning Framework for Secure Dementia Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dementia, a neurological disorder impacting millions globally, presents significant challenges in diagnosis and patient care. With the rise of privacy concerns and security threats in healthcare, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising approach to enable collaborative model training across decentralized datasets without exposing sensitive patient information. However, FL remains vulnerable to advanced security breaches such as gradient inversion and eavesdropping attacks. This paper introduces a novel framework that integrates federated learning with quantum-inspired encryption techniques for dementia classification, emphasizing privacy preservation and security. Leveraging quantum key distribution (QKD), the framework ensures secure transmission of model weights, protecting against unauthorized access and interception during training. The methodology utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) for dementia classification, with federated training conducted across distributed healthcare nodes, incorporating QKD-encrypted weight sharing to secure the aggregation process. Experimental evaluations conducted on MRI data from the OASIS dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves identical accuracy levels to a baseline model while enhancing data security and reducing loss by almost 1% compared to the classical baseline model. The framework offers significant implications for democratizing access to AI-driven dementia diagnostics in low- and middle-income countries, addressing critical resource and privacy constraints. This work contributes a robust, scalable, and secure federated learning solution for healthcare applications, paving the way for broader adoption of quantum-inspired techniques in AI-driven medical research.</description>

      <title>Iterating Pointers: Enabling Static Analysis for Loop-based Pointers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pointers are an integral part of C and other programming languages. They enable substantial flexibility from the programmer's standpoint, allowing the user fine, unmediated control over data access patterns. However, accesses done through pointers are often hard to track, and challenging to understand for optimizers, compilers, and sometimes, even for the developers themselves because of the direct memory access they provide. We alleviate this problem by exposing additional information to analyzers and compilers. By separating the concept of a pointer into a data container and an offset, we can optimize C programs beyond what other state-of-the-art approaches are capable of, in some cases even enabling auto-parallelization. Using this process, we are able to successfully analyze and optimize code from OpenSSL, the Mantevo benchmark suite, and the Lempel-Ziv-Oberhumer compression algorithm. We provide the only automatic approach able to find all parallelization opportunities in the HPCCG benchmark from the Mantevo suite the developers identified and even outperform the reference implementation by up to 18%, as well as speed up the PBKDF2 algorithm implementation from OpenSSL by up to 11x.</description>

      <title>Towards Trustworthy Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a comprehensive framework to address three critical trustworthy challenges in federated learning (FL): robustness against Byzantine attacks, fairness, and privacy preservation. To improve the system's defense against Byzantine attacks that send malicious information to bias the system's performance, we develop a Two-sided Norm Based Screening (TNBS) mechanism, which allows the central server to crop the gradients that have the l lowest norms and h highest norms. TNBS functions as a screening tool to filter out potential malicious participants whose gradients are far from the honest ones. To promote egalitarian fairness, we adopt the q-fair federated learning (q-FFL). Furthermore, we adopt a differential privacy-based scheme to prevent raw data at local clients from being inferred by curious parties. Convergence guarantees are provided for the proposed framework under different scenarios. Experimental results on real datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively improves robustness and fairness while managing the trade-off between privacy and accuracy. This work appears to be the first study that experimentally and theoretically addresses fairness, privacy, and robustness in trustworthy FL.</description>

      <title>Shoal++: High Throughput DAG BFT Can Be Fast!</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Today's practical partially synchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus protocols trade off low latency and high throughput. On the one end, traditional BFT protocols such as PBFT and its derivatives optimize for latency. They require, in fault-free executions, only 3 message exchanges to commit, the optimum for BFT consensus. However, this class of protocols typically relies on a single leader, hampering throughput scalability. On the other end, a new class of so-called DAG-BFT protocols demonstrates how to achieve highly scalable throughput by separating data dissemination from consensus, and using every replica as proposer. Unfortunately, existing DAG-BFT protocols pay a steep latency premium, requiring on average 10.5 message exchanges to commit a transactions.
  This work aims to soften this tension and proposes Shoal++, a novel DAG-based BFT consensus system that offers the throughput of DAGs while reducing commit latency to an average of 4.5 message exchanges. Our empirical findings are encouraging, showing that Shoal++ achieves throughput comparable to state-of-the-art DAG BFT solutions while reducing latency by up to 60%.</description>

      <title>Scalable Co-Clustering for Large-Scale Data through Dynamic Partitioning and Hierarchical Merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18113</link>

Abstract: Co-clustering simultaneously clusters rows and columns, revealing more fine-grained groups. However, existing co-clustering methods suffer from poor scalability and cannot handle large-scale data. This paper presents a novel and scalable co-clustering method designed to uncover intricate patterns in high-dimensional, large-scale datasets. Specifically, we first propose a large matrix partitioning algorithm that partitions a large matrix into smaller submatrices, enabling parallel co-clustering. This method employs a probabilistic model to optimize the configuration of submatrices, balancing the computational efficiency and depth of analysis. Additionally, we propose a hierarchical co-cluster merging algorithm that efficiently identifies and merges co-clusters from these submatrices, enhancing the robustness and reliability of the process. Extensive evaluations validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. Experimental results demonstrate a significant reduction in computation time, with an approximate 83% decrease for dense matrices and up to 30% for sparse matrices.</description>

      <title>Chopin: An Open Source R-language Tool to Support Spatial Analysis on Parallelizable Infrastructure</title>

Abstract: An increasing volume of studies utilize geocomputation methods in large spatial data. There is a bottleneck in scalable computation for general scientific use as the existing solutions require high-performance computing domain knowledge and are tailored for specific use cases. This study presents an R package `chopin` to reduce the technical burden for parallelization in geocomputation. Supporting popular spatial analysis packages in R, `chopin` leverages parallel computing by partitioning data that are involved in a computation task. The partitioning is implemented at regular grids, data hierarchies, and multiple file inputs with flexible input types for interoperability between different packages and efficiency. This approach makes the geospatial covariate calculation to the scale of the available processing power in a wide range of computing assets from laptop computers to high-performance computing infrastructure. Testing use cases in environmental exposure assessment demonstrated that the package reduced the execution time by order of processing units used. The work is expected to provide broader research communities using geospatial data with an efficient tool to process large scale data.</description>

      <title>HiGrad: Uncertainty Quantification for Online Learning and Stochastic Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04876</link>

Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is an immensely popular approach for online learning in settings where data arrives in a stream or data sizes are very large. However, despite an ever-increasing volume of work on SGD, much less is known about the statistical inferential properties of SGD-based predictions. Taking a fully inferential viewpoint, this paper introduces a novel procedure termed HiGrad to conduct statistical inference for online learning, without incurring additional computational cost compared with SGD. The HiGrad procedure begins by performing SGD updates for a while and then splits the single thread into several threads, and this procedure hierarchically operates in this fashion along each thread. With predictions provided by multiple threads in place, a $t$-based confidence interval is constructed by decorrelating predictions using covariance structures given by a Donsker-style extension of the Ruppert--Polyak averaging scheme, which is a technical contribution of independent interest. Under certain regularity conditions, the HiGrad confidence interval is shown to attain asymptotically exact coverage probability. Finally, the performance of HiGrad is evaluated through extensive simulation studies and a real data example. An R package \texttt{higrad} has been developed to implement the method.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Distributed Artificial Intelligence is attracting interest day by day. In this paper, the authors introduce an innovative methodology for distributed learning of Particle Swarm Optimization-based Fuzzy Cognitive Maps in a privacy-preserving way. The authors design a training scheme for collaborative FCM learning that offers data privacy compliant with the current regulation. This method is applied to a cancer detection problem, proving that the performance of the model is improved by the Federated Learning process, and obtaining similar results to the ones that can be found in the literature.</description>

      <title>AIArena: A Blockchain-Based Decentralized AI Training Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI has underscored critical challenges in its development and implementation, largely due to centralized control by a few major corporations. This concentration of power intensifies biases within AI models, resulting from inadequate governance and oversight mechanisms. Additionally, it limits public involvement and heightens concerns about the integrity of model generation. Such monopolistic control over data and AI outputs threatens both innovation and fair data usage, as users inadvertently contribute data that primarily benefits these corporations. In this work, we propose AIArena, a blockchain-based decentralized AI training platform designed to democratize AI development and alignment through on-chain incentive mechanisms. AIArena fosters an open and collaborative environment where participants can contribute models and computing resources. Its on-chain consensus mechanism ensures fair rewards for participants based on their contributions. We instantiate and implement AIArena on the public Base blockchain Sepolia testnet, and the evaluation results demonstrate the feasibility of AIArena in real-world applications.</description>
