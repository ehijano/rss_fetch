      <title>Challenges in Finding Stable Price Zones in European Electricity Markets: Aiming to Square the Circle?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06489v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The European day-ahead electricity market is split into multiple bidding zones with a uniform price. The increase in renewables leads to a growing number of interventions in the generation of energy sources and increasing redispatch costs. To ensure efficient congestion management, the EU Commission mandated a Bidding Zone Review (BZR) to reevaluate the configuration of European bidding zones. An integral part of this process was a locational marginal pricing study. Based on these prices, alternative bidding zone configurations were proposed. These bidding zones shall be stable and robust over time. For Germany, four configurations were suggested. We analyzed the proposed configurations considering different clustering algorithms and periods based on the publicly released data set in the context of the BZR, and found that the configurations do not reduce the price standard deviations within zones much, and the average prices across zones are similar. Other configurations identified based on clustering the prices lead to lower price variance but they are not geographically coherent. Independent of the clustering features and algorithms used, the resulting clusters are not stable over time. Interestingly, the effect of a split on prices would be low based on an analysis of the BZR data set.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Scenarios for Urban Mobility: Quantifying the Role of ODE Models and Scenario Planning in Reducing Traffic Congestion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Urbanization and technological advancements are reshaping urban mobility, presenting both challenges and opportunities. This paper investigates how Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven technologies can impact traffic congestion dynamics and explores their potential to enhance transportation systems' efficiency. Specifically, we assess the role of AI innovations, such as autonomous vehicles and intelligent traffic management, in mitigating congestion under varying regulatory frameworks. Autonomous vehicles reduce congestion through optimized traffic flow, real-time route adjustments, and decreased human errors.
  The study employs Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) to model the dynamic relationship between AI adoption rates and traffic congestion, capturing systemic feedback loops. Quantitative outputs include threshold levels of AI adoption needed to achieve significant congestion reduction, while qualitative insights stem from scenario planning exploring regulatory and societal conditions. This dual-method approach offers actionable strategies for policymakers to create efficient, sustainable, and equitable urban transportation systems. While safety implications of AI are acknowledged, this study primarily focuses on congestion reduction dynamics.</description>

      <title>It Takes Three to Ceilidh: Pension System and Multidimensional Poverty Mitigation in China</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02807v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This research, employing the Alkire-Foster approach to uncover multidimensional poverty between 2012 and 2020 in China, models and examines the sustainable effects and mechanisms of the three-pillar pension system in household poverty mitigation with the China Family Panel Studies data. The results evince that more participation in the pension system mitigates the probability of being trapped in multidimensional poverty. The findings reveal the significance of synchronising state social insurance, enterprise annuity, and individual commercial insurance. The mitigation effect of market-oriented pillars is achieved through more investment in and consumption for livelihood assets. Based upon the sustainable livelihoods framework, livelihood assets ameliorate household capabilities in human, natural, financial, and psychological capital against exogenous shocks and uncertainties. Our research contributes to the theory and praxis of the facilitating state in new structural economics illustrated by the multi-pillar pension system in sustainable micro-household poverty mitigation.</description>

      <title>Inequality of opportunity under current China's license plate policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measuring inequality of opportunities has long been a challenging and open problem, primarily due to the limitations associated with individual-level data. In this study, we utilize data obtained from vehicle license plates in a comprehensive survey (17258 vehicles from 6 major cities in China) to evaluate the inequality of opportunities in the country. In our context, we define inequality of opportunity as the scenario where relatively expensive vehicles have a higher likelihood of being paired with license plates featuring 'Lucky Numbers'. To quantify this, we propose a lucky-number-based opportunity Gini coefficient. Through the calculation of the opportunity Gini coefficient, we observe a significant and positive correlation between opportunity inequality and income inequality. Particularly noteworthy is our finding that the advancement of technology, exemplified by the widespread adoption of new energy vehicles, can substantially reduce the inequality of opportunity. Taking incorporation of a random lottery process before acquiring a motor vehicle in Beijing and Shanghai as a natural experiment, our empirical results support the argument that, in terms of equality, employing random drawing is a fair and equitable approach for allocating scarce resources.</description>
