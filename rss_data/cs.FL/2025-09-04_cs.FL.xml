      <title>Prebiotic Functional Programs: Endogenous Selection in an Artificial Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial chemistry simulations produce many intriguing emergent behaviors, but they are often difficult to steer or control. This paper proposes a method for steering the dynamics of a classic artificial chemistry model, known as AlChemy (Algorithmic Chemistry), which is based on untyped lambda calculus. Our approach leverages features that are endogenous to AlChemy without constructing an explicit external fitness function or building learning into the dynamics. We demonstrate the approach by synthesizing non-trivial lambda functions, such as Church addition and succession, from simple primitives. The results provide insight into the possibility of endogenous selection in diverse systems such as autocatalytic chemical networks and software systems.</description>

      <title>Simplicity Lies in the Eye of the Beholder: A Strategic Perspective on Controllers in Reactive Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the game-theoretic approach to controller synthesis, we model the interaction between a system to be controlled and its environment as a game between these entities, and we seek an appropriate (e.g., winning or optimal) strategy for the system. This strategy then serves as a formal blueprint for a real-world controller. A common belief is that simple (e.g., using limited memory) strategies are better: corresponding controllers are easier to conceive and understand, and cheaper to produce and maintain.
  This invited contribution focuses on the complexity of strategies in a variety of synthesis contexts. We discuss recent results concerning memory and randomness, and take a brief look at what lies beyond our traditional notions of complexity for strategies.</description>

      <title>Autoformalization in the Wild: Assessing LLMs on Real-World Mathematical Definitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12065v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thanks to their linguistic capabilities, LLMs offer an opportunity to bridge the gap between informal mathematics and formal languages through autoformalization. However, it is still unclear how well LLMs generalize to sophisticated and naturally occurring mathematical statements. To address this gap, we investigate the task of autoformalizing real-world mathematical definitions: a critical component of mathematical discourse. Specifically, we introduce two novel resources for autoformalization, collecting definitions from Wikipedia (Def_Wiki) and arXiv papers (Def_ArXiv). We then systematically evaluate a range of LLMs, analyzing their ability to formalize definitions into Isabelle/HOL. Furthermore, we investigate strategies to enhance LLMs' performance including refinement through external feedback from Proof Assistants, and formal definition grounding, where we augment LLMs' formalizations through relevant contextual elements from formal mathematical libraries. Our findings reveal that definitions present a greater challenge compared to existing benchmarks, such as miniF2F. In particular, we found that LLMs still struggle with self-correction, and aligning with relevant mathematical libraries. At the same time, structured refinement methods and definition grounding strategies yield notable improvements of up to 16% on self-correction capabilities and 43% on the reduction of undefined errors, highlighting promising directions for enhancing LLM-based autoformalization in real-world scenarios.</description>
