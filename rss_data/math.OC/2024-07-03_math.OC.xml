      <title>An infinite-dimensional Christoffel function and detection of abnormal trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an infinite-dimensional version of the Christoffel function, where now (i) its argument lies in a Hilbert space of functions, and (ii) its associated underlying measure is supported on a compact subset of the Hilbert space. We show that it possesses the same crucial property as its finite-dimensional version to identify the support of the measure (and so to detect outliers). Indeed, the growth of its reciprocal with respect to its degree is at least exponential outside the support of the measure and at most polynomial inside. Moreover, for a fixed degree, its computation mimics that of the finite-dimensional case, but now  the entries of the moment matrix associated with the measure are moments of moments. To illustrate the potential of this new tool, we consider the following application. Given a data base  of registered reference trajectories, we consider the problem of detecting whether a newly acquired trajectory is abnormal (or out of distribution) with respect to the data base. As in the finite-dimensional case, we use the infinite-dimensional Christoffel function as a score function to detect outliers and abnormal trajectories. A few numerical examples are provided to illustrate the theory.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Optimization with Coupled Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the decentralized minimization of a separable objective $\sum_{i=1}^{n} f_i(x_i)$, where the variables are coupled through an affine constraint $\sum_{i=1}^n\left(\mathbf{A}_i x_i - b_i\right) = 0$. We assume that the functions $f_i$, matrices $\mathbf{A}_i$, and vectors $b_i$ are stored locally by the nodes of a computational network, and that the functions $f_i$ are smooth and strongly convex.
  This problem has significant applications in resource allocation and systems control and can also arise in distributed machine learning. We propose lower complexity bounds for decentralized optimization problems with coupled constraints and a first-order algorithm achieving the lower bounds. To the best of our knowledge, our method is also the first linearly convergent first-order decentralized algorithm for problems with general affine coupled constraints.</description>

      <title>Coderivative-Based Newton Methods with Wolfe Linesearch for Nonsmooth Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces and develops novel coderivative-based Newton methods with Wolfe linesearch conditions to solve various classes of problems in nonsmooth optimization. We first propose a generalized regularized Newton method with Wolfe linesearch (GRNM-W) for unconstrained $C^{1,1}$ minimization problems (which are second-order nonsmooth) and establish global as well as local superlinear convergence of their iterates. To deal with convex composite minimization problems (which are first-order nonsmooth and can be constrained), we combine the proposed GRNM-W with two algorithmic frameworks: the forward-backward envelope and the augmented Lagrangian method resulting in the two new algorithms called CNFB and CNAL, respectively. Finally, we present numerical results to solve Lasso and support vector machine problems appearing in, e.g., machine learning and statistics, which demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Formation Mission Design for Commercial Aircraft Using Switched Optimal Control Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, the formation mission design problem for commercial aircraft is studied. Given the departure times and the departure and arrival locations of several commercial flights, the relevant weather forecast, and the expected fuel savings during formation flight, the problem consists in establishing how to organize them in formation or solo flights and in finding the trajectories that minimize the overall direct operating cost of the flights. Each aircraft can fly solo or in different positions inside a formation. Therefore, the mission is modeled as a switched dynamical system, in which the discrete state describes the combination of flight modes of the individual aircraft and logical constraints in disjunctive form establish the switching logic among the discrete states of the system. The formation mission design problem has been formulated as an optimal control problem of a switched dynamical system and solved using an embedding approach, which allows switching decision among discrete states to be modeled without relying on binary variables. The resulting problem is a classical optimal control problem which has been solved using a knotting pseudospectral method. Several numerical experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach. The obtained results show that formation flight has great potential to reduce fuel consumption and emissions.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Switched Optimal Control Approach to Formation Mission Design for Commercial Aircraft</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the formation mission design problem for commercial aircraft in the presence of uncertainties. Specifically, it considers uncertainties in the departure times of the aircraft and in the fuel burn savings for the trailing aircraft. Given several commercial flights, the problem consists in arranging them in formation or solo flights and finding the trajectories that minimize the expected value of the direct operating cost of the flights. The formation mission design problem is formulated as an optimal control problem of a stochastic switched dynamical system and solved using nonintrusive generalized polynomial chaos based stochastic collocation. The stochastic collocation method converts the stochastic switched optimal control problem into an augmented deterministic switched optimal control problem. With this approach, a small number of sample points of the random parameters are used to jointly solve particular instances of the switched optimal control problem. The obtained solutions are then expressed as orthogonal polynomial expansions in terms of the random parameters using these sample points. This technique allows statistical and global sensitivity analysis of the stochastic solutions to be conducted at a low computational cost. The aim of this study is to establish if, in the presence of uncertainties, a formation mission is beneficial with respect to solo flight in terms of the expected value of the direct operating costs. Several numerical experiments have been conducted in which uncertainties on the departure times and on the fuel saving during formation flight have been considered. The obtained results demonstrate that benefits can be achieved even in the presence of these uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Probabilistic Methodology for Aircraft Conflict Detection Under Wind Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assuming the availability of a reliable aircraft trajectory planner, this paper presents a probabilistic methodology to detect conflicts between aircraft, in the cruise phase of the flight, in the presence of wind prediction uncertainties quantified by ensemble weather forecasts, which are regarded as realizations of correlated random processes and employed to derive the eastward and northward components of the wind velocity. First, the Karhunen-Lo`eve expansion is used to obtain a series expansion of the wind components in terms of a set of uncorrelated random variables and deterministic coefficients. Then, the uncertainty induced by these uncorrelated random variables in the outputs of the aircraft trajectory planner is quantified by means of the arbitrary polynomial chaos technique. Finally, the probability density function of the great circle distance between each pair of aircraft is derived from the polynomial expansions using a Gaussian kernel density estimator and employed to estimate the probability of conflict. The arbitrary polynomial chaos technique allows the effects of uncertainties in complex nonlinear dynamical system, such as those underlying aircraft trajectory planners, to be quantified with high computational efficiency, only requiring the existence of a finite number of statistical moments of the random variables of the Karhunen-Lo`eve expansion, while avoiding any assumption on their probability distributions. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed conflict detection method, numerical experiments are conducted through an optimal control based aircraft trajectory planner for a given wind forecast represented by an ensemble prediction system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Greenhouse production systems play a crucial role in modern agriculture, enabling year-round cultivation of crops by providing a controlled environment. However, effectively quantifying uncertainty in modeling greenhouse systems remains a challenging task. In this paper, we apply a novel approach based on sparse Bayesian deep learning for the system identification of lettuce greenhouse models. The method leverages the power of deep neural networks while incorporating Bayesian inference to quantify the uncertainty in the weights of a Neural ODE. The simulation results show that the generated model can capture the intrinsic nonlinear behavior of the greenhouse system with probabilistic estimates of environmental variables and lettuce growth within the greenhouse.</description>

      <title>A tactical time slot management problem under mixed logit demand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growth of e-commerce has led to an increase in home delivery requests, including those for attended home deliveries on subscription-based platforms. To accommodate customer availability, many online retailers offer various delivery time slots. This paper introduces a tactical time slot management problem for subscription-based e-retailers, focusing on slot assortment and price discounts. The novelty of our model lies in incorporating customers' heterogeneous preferences regarding delivery slots, captured through a mixed logit choice model. The resulting stochastic problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming relying on simulations. We utilize a simulation-based adaptive large neighborhood search to solve this problem efficiently for large instances. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, particularly in addressing uncertain heterogeneous customer behavior when optimizing assortment and pricing strategies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growth of e-commerce has led to an increase in requests for home deliveries, including attended home deliveries that require customers' presence at home. To accommodate customer availability, many online retailers offer different delivery time slots. Providing these time slots is convenient for customers but also results in a higher level of uncertainty for the retailer. In this paper, we introduce a choice-based slot assortment and price discounting problem in which customers' decisions regarding delivery slots and their corresponding impact on routing costs are explicitly considered. We formulate a mixed-integer linear programming model for this problem. We use a logic-based Benders decomposition to obtain benchmark solutions for larger instances of this problem. Numerical experiments are conducted to show the effectiveness of this approach. Results indicate the importance of accounting for the uncertain behavior of customers when deciding about the assortment and price discount rates of time slots.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Enhanced Ant Colony Optimization for Column Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Column generation (CG) is a powerful technique for solving optimization problems that involve a large number of variables or columns. This technique begins by solving a smaller problem with a subset of columns and gradually generates additional columns as needed. However, the generation of columns often requires solving difficult subproblems repeatedly, which can be a bottleneck for CG. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method called machine learning enhanced ant colony optimization (MLACO), to efficiently generate multiple high-quality columns from a subproblem. Specifically, we train a ML model to predict the optimal solution of a subproblem, and then integrate this ML prediction into the probabilistic model of ACO to sample multiple high-quality columns. Our experimental results on the bin packing problem with conflicts show that the MLACO method significantly improves the performance of CG compared to several state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, when our method is incorporated into a Branch-and-Price method, it leads to a significant reduction in solution time.</description>

      <title>Model-Based Diffusion for Trajectory Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have demonstrated their strong capabilities in generating high-fidelity samples from complex distributions through an iterative refinement process. Despite the empirical success of diffusion models in motion planning and control, the model-free nature of these methods does not leverage readily available model information and limits their generalization to new scenarios beyond the training data (e.g., new robots with different dynamics). In this work, we introduce Model-Based Diffusion (MBD), an optimization approach using the diffusion process to solve trajectory optimization (TO) problems without data. The key idea is to explicitly compute the score function by leveraging the model information in TO problems, which is why we refer to our approach as model-based diffusion. Moreover, although MBD does not require external data, it can be naturally integrated with data of diverse qualities to steer the diffusion process. We also reveal that MBD has interesting connections to sampling-based optimization. Empirical evaluations show that MBD outperforms state-of-the-art reinforcement learning and sampling-based TO methods in challenging contact-rich tasks. Additionally, MBD's ability to integrate with data enhances its versatility and practical applicability, even with imperfect and infeasible data (e.g., partial-state demonstrations for high-dimensional humanoids), beyond the scope of standard diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Empirical Tests of Optimization Assumptions in Deep Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a significant gap between our theoretical understanding of optimization algorithms used in deep learning and their practical performance. Theoretical development usually focuses on proving convergence guarantees under a variety of different assumptions, which are themselves often chosen based on a rough combination of intuitive match to practice and analytical convenience. The theory/practice gap may then arise because of the failure to prove a theorem under such assumptions, or because the assumptions do not reflect reality. In this paper, we carefully measure the degree to which these assumptions are capable of explaining modern optimization algorithms by developing new empirical metrics that closely track the key quantities that must be controlled in theoretical analysis. All of our tested assumptions (including typical modern assumptions based on bounds on the Hessian) fail to reliably capture optimization performance. This highlights a need for new empirical verification of analytical assumptions used in theoretical analysis.</description>

Abstract: We define a new two-parameter family of metrics on a subspace of Borel probability measures on a metric fiber bundle, called the disintegrated Monge--Kantorovich metrics. We then prove the disintegrated Monge--Kantorovich metrics are complete, separable (except an endpoint case), geodesic spaces, with a dual representation. Additionally, we prove existence and duality for an associated barycenter problem, and provide conditions for uniqueness of a barycenter. These results on barycenter problems for the disintegrated Monge--Kantorovich metrics also yield the corresponding existence, duality, and uniqueness results for classical Monge--Kantorovich barycenters in a wide variety of spaces, including a uniqueness result on any connected, complete Riemannian manifold, with or without boundary, with no restriction on the geometry of any kind.</description>

      <title>Passivity Tools for Hybrid Learning Rules in Large Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work has pioneered the use of system-theoretic passivity to study equilibrium stability for the dynamics of noncooperative strategic interactions in large populations of learning agents. In this and related works, the stability analysis leverages knowledge that certain ``canonical'' classes of learning rules used to model the agents' strategic behaviors satisfy a passivity condition known as $\delta$-passivity. In this paper, we consider that agents exhibit learning behaviors that do not align with a canonical class. Specifically, we focus on characterizing $\delta$-passivity for hybrid learning rules that combine elements from canonical classes. Our analysis also introduces and uses a more general version of $\delta$-passivity, which, for the first time, can handle discontinuous learning rules, including those showing best-response behaviors. We state and prove theorems establishing $\delta$-passivity for two broad convex cones of hybrid learning rules. These cones can merge into a larger one preserving $\delta$-passivity in scenarios limited to two strategies. In our proofs, we establish intermediate facts that are significant on their own and could potentially be used to further generalize our work. We illustrate the applicability of our results through numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Control theory and splitting methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our goal is to highlight some of the deep links between numerical splitting methods and control theory. We consider evolution equations of the form $\dot{x} = f_0(x) + f_1(x)$, where $f_0$ encodes a non-reversible dynamic, so that one is interested in schemes only involving forward flows of $f_0$. In this context, a splitting method can be interpreted as a trajectory of the control-affine system $\dot{x}(t)=f_0(x(t))+u(t)f_1(x(t))$, associated with a control~$u$ which is a finite sum of Dirac masses. The general goal is then to find a control such that the flow of $f_0 + u(t) f_1$ is as close as possible to the flow of $f_0+f_1$.
  Using this interpretation and classical tools from control theory, we revisit well-known results concerning numerical splitting methods, and we prove a handful of new ones, with an emphasis on splittings with additional positivity conditions on the coefficients. First, we show that there exist numerical schemes of any arbitrary order involving only forward flows of $f_0$ if one allows complex coefficients for the flows of $f_1$. Equivalently, for complex-valued controls, we prove that the Lie algebra rank condition is equivalent to the small-time local controllability of a system. Second, for real-valued coefficients, we show that the well-known order restrictions are linked with so-called "bad" Lie brackets from control theory, which are known to yield obstructions to small-time local controllability. We use our recent basis of the free Lie algebra to precisely identify the conditions under which high-order methods exist.</description>

      <title>Sard properties for polynomial maps in infinite dimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the Sard conjecture in sub-Riemannian geometry, and more specifically on Carnot groups, we consider the set of maps defined on a Hilbert space $H$: \[\mathscr{P}_{d}^m(H)=\bigg\{f:H\to \mathbb{R}^m\,\bigg|\, \forall\, E\subset H, \,\dim(E)&lt;\infty \implies f|_{E} \textrm{ is a polynomial map of degree $d$}\bigg\}.
  \] Example of maps belonging to this class are: the map $f:\ell^2\to \mathbb{R}$ constructed by Kukpa as a counterexample for the Sard theorem in infinite dimension; the Endpoint maps of Carnot groups.
  We prove that, for infinite-dimensional subspaces $V \subset H$ satisfying quantitative assumptions on their Kolmogorov $n$-width, the restriction of $f$ on $V$ has the Sard property, i.e. the set of critical values of $f|_{V}$ has measure zero in $\mathbb{R}^m$. We prove various quantitative versions of this result, allowing to study the Sard property also for the case $V=H$. By constructing suitable examples, we prove the sharpness of our $n$-width assumptions.
  We apply these results to sub-Riemannian geometry, proving that on Carnot groups the Sard property holds true for the restriction of the Endpoint map on the set of real-analytic controls with large enough radius of convergence. This is a more functional-analytic approach to the Sard conjecture that, unlike previous ones, does not resort to reduction to finite-dimensions.</description>

      <title>Implicit Peer Triplets in Gradient-Based Solution Algorithms for ODE Constrained Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.18180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.18180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is common practice to apply gradient-based optimization algorithms to numerically solve large-scale ODE constrained optimal control problems. Gradients of the objective function are most efficiently computed by approximate adjoint variables. High accuracy with moderate computing time can be achieved by such time integration methods that satisfy a sufficiently large number of adjoint order conditions and supply gradients with higher orders of consistency. In this paper, we upgrade our former implicit two-step Peer triplets constructed in [Algorithms, 15:310, 2022] to meet those new requirements. Since Peer methods use several stages of the same high stage order, a decisive advantage is their lack of order reduction as for semi-discretized PDE problems with boundary control. Additional order conditions for the control and certain positivity requirements now intensify the demands on the Peer triplet. We discuss the construction of $4$-stage methods with order pairs $(3,3)$ and $(4,3)$ in detail and provide three Peer triplets of practical interest. We prove convergence of order $s-1$, at least, for $s$-stage methods if state, adjoint and control satisfy the corresponding order conditions. Numerical tests show the expected order of convergence for the new Peer triplets.</description>

      <title>Logistics Hub Location Optimization: A K-Means and P-Median Model Hybrid Approach Using Road Network Distances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Logistic hubs play a pivotal role in the last-mile delivery distance; even a slight increment in distance negatively impacts the business of the e-commerce industry while also increasing its carbon footprint. The growth of this industry, particularly after Covid-19, has further intensified the need for optimized allocation of resources in an urban environment. In this study, we use a hybrid approach to optimize the placement of logistic hubs. The approach sequentially employs different techniques. Initially, delivery points are clustered using K-Means in relation to their spatial locations. The clustering method utilizes road network distances as opposed to Euclidean distances. Non-road network-based approaches have been avoided since they lead to erroneous and misleading results. Finally, hubs are located using the P-Median method. The P-Median method also incorporates the number of deliveries and population as weights. Real-world delivery data from Muller and Phipps (M&amp;P) is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach. Serving deliveries from the optimal hub locations results in the saving of 815 (10%) meters per delivery.</description>

      <title>Fast Sampling for Linear Inverse Problems of Vectors and Tensors using Multilinear Extensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01574v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of sampling vector and tensor signals, which is the process of choosing sites in vectors and tensors to place sensors for better recovery. A small core tensor and multiple factor matrices can be used to sparsely represent a dense higher-order tensor within a linear model. Using this linear model, one can effectively recover the whole signals from a limited number of measurements by solving linear inverse problems (LIPs). By providing the closed-form expressions of multilinear extensions for the frame potential of pruned matrices, we develop an algorithm named fast Frank-Wolfe algorithm (FFW) for sampling vectors and tensors with low complexity. We provide the approximation factor of our proposed algorithm for the factor matrices that are non-orthogonal and have elements of the same sign in each row. Moreover, we conduct experiments to verify the higher performance and lower complexity of our proposed algorithm for general factor matrix. Finally, we demonstrate that sampling by FFW and reconstruction by least squares methods yield better results for image data compared to convCNP completion with random sampling.</description>

      <title>A New Parallel Cooperative Landscape Smoothing Algorithm and Its Applications on TSP and UBQP</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problem (COP) is difficult to solve because of the massive number of local optimal solutions in his solution space. Various methods have been put forward to smooth the solution space of COPs, including homotopic convex (HC) transformation for the traveling salesman problem (TSP). This paper extends the HC transformation approach to unconstrained binary quadratic programming (UBQP) by proposing a method to construct a unimodal toy UBQP of any size. We theoretically prove the unimodality of the constructed toy UBQP. After that, we apply this unimodal toy UBQP to smooth the original UBQP by using the HC transformation framework and empirically verify the smoothing effects. Subsequently, we introduce an iterative algorithmic framework incorporating HC transformation, referred as landscape smoothing iterated local search (LSILS). Our experimental analyses, conducted on various UBQP instances show the effectiveness of LSILS. Furthermore, this paper proposes a parallel cooperative variant of LSILS, denoted as PC-LSILS and apply it to both the UBQP and the TSP. Our experimental findings highlight that PC-LSILS improves the smoothing performance of the HC transformation, and further improves the overall performance of the algorithm.</description>

      <title>Isolated calmness of perturbation mappings in generalized nonlinear programming and local superlinear convergence of Newton-type methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we characterize Lipschitzian properties of different multiplier-free and multiplier-dependent perturbation mappings associated with the stationarity system of a so-called generalized nonlinear program popularized by Rockafellar. Special emphasis is put on the investigation of the isolated calmness property at and around a point. The latter is decisive for the locally fast convergence of the so-called semismooth* Newton-type method by Gfrerer and Outrata. Our central result is the characterization of the isolated calmness at a point of a multiplier-free perturbation mapping via a combination of an explicit condition and a rather mild assumption, automatically satisfied e.g. for standard nonlinear programs. Isolated calmness around a point is characterized analogously by a combination of two stronger conditions. These findings are then related to so-called criticality of Lagrange multipliers, as introduced by Izmailov and extended to generalized nonlinear programming by Mordukhovich and Sarabi. We derive a new sufficient condition (a characterization for some problem classes) of nonexistence of critical multipliers, which has been also used in the literature as an assumption to guarantee local fast convergence of Newton-, SQP-, or multiplier-penalty-type methods. The obtained insights about critical multipliers seem to complement the vast literature on the topic.</description>

      <title>Solving Two-Stage Stochastic Programs with Endogenous Uncertainty via Random Variable Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-world decision-making problems involve decision-dependent uncertainty, where the probability distribution of the random vector depends on the model decisions. However, few studies focus on two-stage stochastic programs with this type of endogenous uncertainty, and those that do lack general methodologies. We thus propose a general method for solving a class of these programs based on random variable transformation, a technique widely employed in probability and statistics. The random variable transformation converts a stochastic program with endogenous uncertainty (original program) into an equivalent stochastic program with decision-independent uncertainty (transformed program), for which solution procedures are well-studied. Moreover, endogenous uncertainty usually leads to nonlinear nonconvex programs, which are theoretically intractable. Nonetheless, we show that, for some classical endogenous distributions, the proposed method yields mixed-integer linear or convex programs with exogenous uncertainty. We validate this method by applying it to a network design and facility-protection problem, considering distinct decision-dependent distributions for the random variables. Whereas the original formulation of this problem is nonlinear non-convex for most endogenous distributions, the proposed method transforms it into mixed-integer linear programs with exogenous uncertainty. Particularly, we solve these obtained programs with the sample average approximation (SAA) method. Finally, the transformed program outperforms the case in which a mixed-integer linear formulation of the original program exists.</description>

Abstract: This paper deals with event-triggered parameterized control (ETPC) of nonlinear systems with external disturbances. In this control method, between two successive events, each control input to the plant is a linear combination of a set of linearly independent scalar functions. At each event, the controller updates the coefficients of the parameterized control input so as to minimize the error in approximating a continuous time control signal and communicates the same to the actuator. We design an event-triggering rule (ETR) that guarantees global uniform ultimate boundedness of trajectories of the closed loop system. We also ensure the absence of Zeno behavior by showing the existence of a uniform positive lower bound on the inter-event times (IETs). We illustrate our results through numerical examples.</description>

      <title>On the sequential convergence of Lloyd's algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lloyd's algorithm is an iterative method that solves the quantization problem, i.e. the approximation of a target probability measure by a discrete one, and is particularly used in digital applications.This algorithm can be interpreted as a gradient method on a certain quantization functional which is given by optimal transport. We study the sequential convergence (to a single accumulation point) for two variants of Lloyd's method: (i) optimal quantization with an arbitrary discrete measure and (ii) uniform quantization with a uniform discrete measure. For both cases, we prove sequential convergence of the iterates under an analiticity assumption on the density of the target measure. This includes for example analytic densities truncated to a compact semi-algebraic set. The argument leverages the log analytic nature of globally subanalytic integrals, the interpretation of Lloyd's method as a gradient method and the convergence analysis of gradient algorithms under Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz assumptions. As a by-product, we also obtain definability results for more general semi-discrete optimal transport losses such as transport distances with general costs, the max-sliced Wasserstein distance and the entropy regularized optimal transport loss.</description>

Abstract: We study the policy iteration algorithm (PIA) for entropy-regularized stochastic control problems on an infinite time horizon with a large discount rate, focusing on two main scenarios. First, we analyze PIA with bounded coefficients where the controls applied to the diffusion term satisfy a smallness condition. We demonstrate the convergence of PIA based on a uniform $\mathcal{C}^{2,\alpha}$ estimate for the value sequence generated by PIA, and provide a quantitative convergence analysis for this scenario. Second, we investigate PIA with unbounded coefficients but no control over the diffusion term. In this scenario, we first provide the well-posedness of the exploratory Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman equation with linear growth coefficients and polynomial growth reward function. By such a well-posedess result we achieve PIA's convergence by establishing a quantitative locally uniform $\mathcal{C}^{1,\alpha}$ estimates for the generated value sequence.</description>

Abstract: Real-world decision and optimization problems, often involve constraints and conflicting criteria. For example, choosing a travel method must balance speed, cost, environmental footprint, and convenience. Similarly, designing an industrial process must consider safety, environmental impact, and cost efficiency. Ideal solutions where all objectives are optimally met are rare; instead, we seek good compromises and aim to avoid lose-lose scenarios. Multicriteria optimization offers computational techniques to compute Pareto optimal solutions, aiding decision analysis and decision making. This reader offers an introduction to this topic and has been developed on the basis of the revised edition of the reader for the MSc computer science course "Multicriteria Optimization and Decision Analysis" at the Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science, Leiden University, The Netherlands. This course was taught annually by the first author from 2007 to 2023 as a single semester course with lectures and practicals. Our aim was to make the material accessible to MSc students who do not study mathematics as their core discipline by introducing basic numerical analysis concepts when necessary and providing numerical examples for interesting cases. The introduction is organized in a unique didactic manner developed by the authors, starting from more simple concepts such as linear programming and single-point methods, and advancing from these to more difficult concepts such as optimality conditions for nonlinear optimization and set-oriented solution algorithms. Besides, we focus on the mathematical modeling and foundations rather than on specific algorithms, though not excluding the discussion of some representative examples of solution algorithms.</description>

Abstract: A common theme in all the above areas is designing a dynamical system to accomplish desired objectives, possibly in some predefined optimal way. Since control theory advances the idea of suitably modifying the behavior of a dynamical system, this paper explores the role of control theory in designing efficient algorithms (or dynamical systems) related to problems surrounding the optimization framework, including constrained optimization, optimization-based control, and parameter estimation. This amalgamation of control theory with the above-mentioned areas has been made possible by the recently introduced paradigm of Passivity and Immersion (P\&amp;I) based control. The generality and working of P\&amp;I, as compared to the existing approaches in control theory, are best introduced through the example presented below.</description>

Abstract: We consider reinforcement learning for continuous-time Markov decision processes (MDPs) in the infinite-horizon, average-reward setting. In contrast to discrete-time MDPs, a continuous-time process moves to a state and stays there for a random holding time after an action is taken. With unknown transition probabilities and rates of exponential holding times, we derive instance-dependent regret lower bounds that are logarithmic in the time horizon. Moreover, we design a learning algorithm and establish a finite-time regret bound that achieves the logarithmic growth rate. Our analysis builds upon upper confidence reinforcement learning, a delicate estimation of the mean holding times, and stochastic comparison of point processes.</description>

Abstract: We consider differential operators $A$ that can be represented by means of a so-called closure relation in terms of a simpler operator $A_{\operatorname{ext}}$ defined on a larger space. We analyze how the spectral properties of $A$ and $A_{\operatorname{ext}}$ are related and give sufficient conditions for exponential stability of the semigroup generated by $A$ in terms of the semigroup generated by $A_{\operatorname{ext}}$.
  As applications we study the long-term behaviour of a coupled wave-heat system on an interval, parabolic equations on bounded domains that are coupled by matrix valued potentials, and of linear infinite-dimensional port-Hamiltonian systems with dissipation on an interval.</description>

Abstract: Characterizing and understanding the dynamics of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) around saddle points remains an open problem. We first show that saddle points in neural networks can be divided into two types, among which the Type-II saddles are especially difficult to escape from because the gradient noise vanishes at the saddle. The dynamics of SGD around these saddles are thus to leading order described by a random matrix product process, and it is thus natural to study the dynamics of SGD around these saddles using the notion of probabilistic stability and the related Lyapunov exponent. Theoretically, we link the study of SGD dynamics to well-known concepts in ergodic theory, which we leverage to show that saddle points can be either attractive or repulsive for SGD, and its dynamics can be classified into four different phases, depending on the signal-to-noise ratio in the gradient close to the saddle.</description>

      <title>Integrating quantum and classical computing for multi-energy system optimization using Benders decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: During recent years, quantum computers have received increasing attention, primarily due to their ability to significantly increase computational performance for specific problems. Computational performance could be improved for mathematical optimization by quantum annealers. This special type of quantum computer can solve quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problems. However, multi-energy systems optimization commonly involves integer and continuous decision variables. Due to their mixed-integer problem structure, quantum annealers cannot be directly used for multi-energy system optimization. To solve multi-energy system optimization problems, we present a hybrid Benders decomposition approach combining optimization on quantum and classical computers. In our approach, the quantum computer solves the master problem, which involves only the integer variables from the original energy system optimization problem. The subproblem includes the continuous variables and is solved by a classical computer. For better performance, we apply improvement techniques to the Benders decomposition. We test the approach on a case study to design a cost-optimal multi-energy system. While we provide a proof of concept that our Benders decomposition approach is applicable for the design of multi-energy systems, the computational time is still higher than for approaches using classical computers only. We therefore estimate the potential improvement of our approach to be expected for larger and fault-tolerant quantum computers.</description>
