      <title>Autonomous Satellite Rendezvous via Hybrid Feedback Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As satellites have proliferated, interest has increased in autonomous rendezvous, proximity operations, and docking (ARPOD). A fundamental challenge in these tasks is the uncertainties when operating in space, e.g., in measurements of satellites' states, which can make future states difficult to predict. Another challenge is that satellites' onboard processors are typically much slower than their terrestrial counterparts. Therefore, to address these challenges we propose to solve an ARPOD problem with feedback optimization, which computes inputs to a system by measuring its outputs, feeding them into an optimization algorithm in the loop, and computing some number of iterations towards an optimal input. We focus on satellite rendezvous, and satellites' dynamics are modeled using the continuous-time Clohessy-Wiltshire equations, which are marginally stable. We develop an asymptotically stabilizing controller for them, and we use discrete-time gradient descent in the loop to compute inputs to them. Then, we analyze the hybrid feedback optimization system formed by the stabilized Clohessy-Wiltshire equations with gradient descent in the loop. We show that this model is well-posed and that maximal solutions are both complete and non-Zeno. Then, we show that solutions converge exponentially fast to a ball around a rendezvous point, and we bound the radius of that ball in terms of system parameters. Simulations show that this approach provides up to a 98.4\% reduction in the magnitude of disturbances across a range of simulations, which illustrates the viability of hybrid feedback optimization for autonomous satellite rendezvous.</description>

      <title>Optimal Real-Time Fusion of Time-Series Data Under R\'enyi Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the optimal real-time fusion of data collected by multiple sensors. In our set-up, the sensor measurements are considered to be private and are jointly correlated with an underlying process. A fusion center combines the private sensor measurements and releases its output to an honest-but-curious party, which is responsible for estimating the state of the underlying process based on the fusion center's output. The privacy leakage incurred by the fusion policy is quantified using R\'enyi differential privacy. We formulate the privacy-aware fusion design as a constrained finite-horizon optimization problem, in which the fusion policy and the state estimation are jointly optimized to minimize the state estimation error subject to a total privacy budget constraint. We derive the constrained optimality conditions for the proposed optimization problem and use them to characterize the structural properties of the optimal fusion policy. Unlike classical differential privacy mechanisms, the optimal fusion policy is shown to adaptively allocates the privacy budget and regulates the adversary's belief in a closed-loop manner. To reduce the computational burden of solving the resulting constrained optimality equations, we parameterize the fusion policy using a structured Gaussian distribution and show that the parameterized fusion policy satisfies the privacy constraint. We further develop a numerical algorithm to jointly optimize the fusion policy and state estimator. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed fusion framework through a traffic density estimation case study.</description>

      <title>Diagnosis-Driven Co-planning of Network Reinforcement and BESS for Distribution Grid with High Penetration of Electric Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the rapid proliferation of electric vehicles (EVs) accelerates net-zero goals, uncoordinated charging activities impose severe operational challenges on distribution grids, including exacerbated peak loads, thermal overloading, and voltage violations. To overcome the computational intractability of jointly optimizing grid infrastructure reinforcements and battery energy storage system (BESS) installations, this paper proposes a novel three-stage diagnosis-driven co-planning (DDCP) framework. The methodology integrates a violation detection and quantification (VDQ) model to systematically identify system breaches, and a violation-mitigated BESS planning (VMBP) model for optimal BESS sitting and sizing. Specifically, Stage I of the DDCP framework diagnoses critical bottleneck lines that render standalone BESS solutions infeasible. Stage II targets cable upgrades exclusively at the Top-N prioritized bottleneck lines and Stage III then executes the optimal BESS deployment using a network-enhanced VMBP model. Furthermore, this study quantifies the EV hosting capacity thresholds before and after BESS integration across varying EV adoption rates and base voltages. Finally, a comprehensive comparative analysis evaluates four mitigation approaches: the VDQ-driven cable upgrade (VCU) model, the VMBP model, system-wide voltage uprating, and the proposed DDCP framework. The results demonstrate that the DDCP framework not only resolves the complex joint-optimization hurdle but also achieves the high techno-economic superiority in addressing high-EV-penetration challenges.</description>

      <title>Asymmetry Demystified: Strict CLFs and Feedbacks for Predator-Prey Interconnections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The difficulty with control of population dynamics, besides the states being positive and the control having to also be positive, is the extreme difference in the dynamics near extinction and at overpopulated states. As hard as global stabilization is, even harder is finding CLFs that are strict, don't require LaSalle arguments, and permit quantification of convergence. Among the three canonical types of two-population dynamics (mutualism, which borders on trivial, predator-prey, and competition, which makes global stabilization with positive harvesting impossible), predator-prey is the ``sweet spot'' for the study of stabilization. Even when the predator-prey interaction is neutrally stable, global asymptotic stabilization with strict CLFs has proven very difficult, except by conservative, hard-to-gain-insight-from Matrosov-like techniques.
  In this little note we show directions for the design of clean, elegant, insight-bearing, majorization-free strict CLFs. They generalize the classical Volterra-style Lyapunov functions for population dynamics to non-separable Volterra-style constructions. As a bonus to strictification as an analysis activity, we provide examples of concurrent designs of feedback and CLFs, using customized versions of forwarding and backstepping (note that, in suitable coordinates, predator-prey is both strict-feedforward and strict-feedback), where the striking deviations from these methods' conventional forms is necessitated by the predator-prey's states and inputs needing to be kept positive.</description>

      <title>Geometry-Dependent Radiation of Pinching Antennas: Theory, Simulation, and Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most existing studies achieve beamforming by adjusting the positions of pinching antennas (PAs) and typically model PAs as isotropic radiators. However, under the dielectric scatterer model, the PA radiation pattern depends on its geometry. This letter investigates the radiation patterns of PAs with different geometries through full-wave simulations and measurements, and demonstrates how geometry influences the radiation directivity. In addition, an arc-shaped PA is introduced to enable transmit-direction control in PA systems. A PA system prototype consisting of a dielectric waveguide, waveguide transitions, and a PA element is proposed. Prototype measurements are used to validate the simulations and to characterize the directivity of square and triangular PAs, and the measurement procedure can be applied to obtain radiation patterns for PAs with general geometries. The simulation and measurement results jointly demonstrate that PA geometry is critical in PA systems because it influences the radiation characteristics significantly.</description>

      <title>Two-Stage Active Distribution Network Voltage Control via LLM-RL Collaboration: A Hybrid Knowledge-Data-Driven Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing integration of distributed photovoltaics (PVs) into active distribution networks (ADNs) has exacerbated operational challenges, making it imperative to coordinate diverse equipment to mitigate voltage violations and enhance power quality. Although existing data-driven approaches have demonstrated effectiveness in the voltage control problem, they often require extensive trial-and-error exploration and struggle to incorporate heterogeneous information, such as day-ahead forecasts and semantic-based grid codes. Considering the operational scenarios and requirements in real-world ADNs, in this paper, we propose a hybrid knowledge-data-driven approach that leverages dynamic collaboration between a large language model (LLM) agent and a reinforcement learning (RL) agent to achieve two-stage voltage control. In the day-ahead stage, the LLM agent receives coarse region-level forecasts and generates scheduling strategies for on-load tap changer (OLTC) and shunt capacitors (SCs) to regulate the overall voltage profile. Then in the intra-day stage, based on accurate node-level measurements, the RL agent refines terminal voltages by deriving reactive power generation strategies for PV inverters. On top of the LLM-RL collaboration framework, we further propose a self-evolution mechanism for the LLM agent and a pretrain-finetune pipeline for the RL agent, effectively enhancing and coordinating the policies for both agents. The proposed approach not only aligns more closely with practical operational characteristics but also effectively utilizes the inherent knowledge and reasoning capabilities of the LLM agent, significantly improving training efficiency and voltage control performance. Comprehensive comparisons and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Stability of Open Multi-agent Systems over Dynamic Signed Digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the synchronization problem in open multi-agent systems (OMAS) containing both cooperative and antagonistic interactions. In these systems, agents can join or leave the network over time, and the interaction structure may evolve accordingly. To capture these dynamical structural changes, we represent the network as a switched system interconnected over a dynamic and directed signed graph. Additionally, the network may contain one or multiple leader groups that influence the behavior of the remaining agents. In general, we show that the OMAS exhibit a more general form of synchronization, including trivial consensus, bipartite consensus and containment. Our approach uses the signed edge-based agreement protocol, and constructs strict Lyapunov functions for signed networks described by signed edge-Laplacian matrices containing multiple zero eigenvalues. Numerical simulations validate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Pilot-Free Optimal Control over Wireless Networks: A Control-Aided Channel Prediction Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recurring theme in optimal controller design for wireless networked control systems (WNCS) is the reliance on real-time channel state information (CSI). However, acquiring accurate CSI a priori is notoriously challenging due to the time-varying nature of wireless channels. In this work, we propose a pilot-free framework for optimal control over wireless channels in which control commands are generated from plant states together with control-aided channel prediction. For linear plants operating over an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) architecture, channel prediction is performed via a Kalman filter (KF), and the optimal control policy is derived from the Bellman principle. To alleviate the curse of dimensionality in computing the optimal control policy, we approximate the solution using a coupled algebraic Riccati equation (CARE), which can be computed efficiently via a stochastic approximation (SA) algorithm. Rigorous performance guarantees are established by proving the stability of both the channel predictor and the closed-loop system under the resulting control policy, providing sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a stabilizing approximate CARE solution, and establishing convergence of the SA-based control algorithm. The framework is further extended to nonlinear plants under general wireless architectures by combining a KalmanNet-based predictor with a Markov-modulated deep deterministic policy gradient (MM-DDPG) controller. Numerical results show that the proposed pilot-free approach outperforms benchmark schemes in both control performance and channel prediction accuracy for linear and nonlinear scenarios.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Geometric Leader-Follower Control for Cooperative Rigid-Payload Transport with Aerial Manipulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a learning-based tracking control framework for cooperative transport of a rigid payload by multiple aerial manipulators under rigid grasp constraints. A unified geometric model is developed, yielding a coupled agent--payload differential--algebraic system that explicitly captures contact wrenches, payload dynamics, and internal force redundancy. A leader--follower architecture is adopted in which a designated leader generates a desired payload wrench based on geometric tracking errors, while the remaining agents realize this wrench through constraint-consistent force allocation.
  Unknown disturbances and modeling uncertainties are compensated using Gaussian Process (GP) regression. High-probability bounds on the learning error are explicitly incorporated into the control design, combining GP feedforward compensation with geometric feedback. Lyapunov analysis establishes uniform ultimate boundedness of the payload tracking errors with high probability, with an ultimate bound that scales with the GP predictive uncertainty.</description>

      <title>LightSim: A Lightweight Cell Transmission Model Simulator for Traffic Signal Control Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning for traffic signal control is bottlenecked by simulators: training in SUMO takes hours, reproducing results often requires days of platform-specific setup, and the slow iteration cycle discourages the multi-seed experiments that rigorous evaluation demands. Much of this cost is unnecessary, since for signal timing optimization the relevant dynamics are queue formation and discharge, which the Cell Transmission Model (CTM) captures as a macroscopic flow model.
  We introduce LightSim, a pure Python, pip-installable traffic simulator with Gymnasium and PettingZoo interfaces that runs over 20000 steps per second on a single CPU. Across cross-simulator experiments spanning single intersections, grid networks, arterial corridors, and six real-world city networks, LightSim preserves controller rankings from SUMO for both classical and reinforcement learning strategies while training 3 to 7 times faster. LightSim is released as an open-source benchmark with nineteen built-in scenarios, seven controllers, and full reinforcement learning pipelines, lowering the barrier to signal control research from days to minutes.</description>

      <title>On the airspace complexity metrics for predecessor-follower operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This technical note proposes a novel airspace complexity metric that quantifies the air traffic controller workload and coordination effort for pairwise predecessor-follower aircraft operations in cruise. The pairwise dynamic workload (PDW) is proposed as a continuous function that depends on the relevant parameters of these operations, such as the aircraft separation and separation rate. A comparison of this metric with the dynamic density (DD) shows that it is capable of continuously evaluating the variation of airspace complexity over time and monitoring the aircraft parameters that might lead to conflicts. This metric can be used to support the implementation of autonomous and supervised aircraft procedures, to achieve a more structured and coordinated airspace.</description>

      <title>Traffic-aware Hierarchical Integrated Thermal and Energy Management for Connected HEVs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy and thermal management systems of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) are inherently interdependent. With the ongoing deployment of intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) and increasing vehicle connectivity, the integration of traffic information has become crucial for improving both energy efficiency and thermal comfort in modern vehicles. To enhance fuel economy, this paper proposes a novel traffic-aware hierarchical integrated thermal and energy management (TA-ITEM) strategy for connected HEVs. In the upper layer, global reference trajectories for battery state of charge (SOC) and cabin temperature are planned using traffic flow speed information obtained from ITSs. In the lower layer, a real-time model predictive control (MPC)-based ITEM controller is developed, which incorporates a novel Transformer-based speed predictor with driving condition recognition (TF-DCR) to enable anticipatory tracking of the reference trajectories. Numerical simulations are conducted under various driving cycles and ambient temperature conditions. The results demonstrate that the proposed TA-ITEM approach outperforms conventional rule-based and MPC-SP approaches, with average fuel consumption reductions of 56.36\% and 5.84\%, respectively, while maintaining superior thermal regulation and cabin comfort. These findings confirm the effectiveness and strong generalization capability of TA-ITEM and underscore the advantages of incorporating traffic information.</description>

      <title>Aggressiveness-Aware Learning-based Control of Quadrotor UAVs with Safety Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an aggressiveness-aware control framework for quadrotor UAVs that integrates learning-based oracles to mitigate the effects of unknown disturbances. Starting from a nominal tracking controller on $\mathrm{SE}(3)$, unmodeled generalized forces and moments are estimated using a learning-based oracle and compensated in the control inputs. An aggressiveness-aware gain scheduling mechanism adapts the feedback gains based on probabilistic model-error bounds, enabling reduced feedback-induced aggressiveness while guaranteeing a prescribed practical exponential tracking performance. The proposed approach makes explicit the trade-off between model accuracy, robustness, and control aggressiveness, and provides a principled way to exploit learning for safer and less aggressive quadrotor maneuvers.</description>

      <title>Tempered Christoffel-Weighted Polynomial Chaos Expansion for Resilience-Oriented Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient uncertainty quantification is essential for resilience assessment of modern power systems under high impact and low probability disturbances. Data driven sparse polynomial chaos expansion (DDSPCE) provides a computationally efficient surrogate framework but may suffer from ill conditioned regression and loss of accuracy in the distribution tails that determine system risk. This paper studies the impact of regression weighting schemes on the stability and tail accuracy of DD-SPCE surrogates by introducing a tempered Christoffel weighted least squares (T-CWLS) formulation that balances numerical stability and tail fidelity. The tempering exponent is treated as a hyperparameter whose influence is examined with respect to distributional accuracy compared with Monte Carlo simulations. Case studies on distribution system load shedding show that the proposed method reduces 95th percentile deviation by 16%, 5th percentile deviation by 6%, and improves the regression stability index by over 130%. The results demonstrate that controlling the weighting intensity directly influences both stability index and the accuracy of tail prediction.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Memory Design Exploration for AI Accelerators with a Gain Cell Memory Compiler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As memory increasingly dominates system cost and energy, heterogeneous on-chip memory systems that combine technologies with complementary characteristics are becoming essential. Gain Cell RAM (GCRAM) offers higher density, lower power, and tunable retention, expanding the design space beyond conventional SRAM. To this end, we create an OpenGCRAM compiler supporting both SRAM and GCRAM. It generates macro-level designs and layouts for commercial CMOS processes and characterizes area, delay, and power across user-defined configurations. The tool enables systematic identification of optimal heterogeneous memory configurations for AI tasks under specified performance metrics.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking State Space Models, Transformers, and Recurrent Networks for US Grid Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Selecting the right deep learning model for power grid forecasting is challenging, as performance heavily depends on the data available to the operator. This paper presents a comprehensive benchmark of five modern neural architectures: two state space models (PowerMamba, S-Mamba), two Transformers (iTransformer, PatchTST), and a traditional LSTM. We evaluate these models on hourly electricity demand across six diverse US power grids for forecast windows between 24 and 168 hours. To ensure a fair comparison, we adapt each model with specialized temporal processing and a modular layer that cleanly integrates weather covariates. Our results reveal that there is no single best model for all situations. When forecasting using only historical load, PatchTST and the state space models provide the highest accuracy. However, when explicit weather data is added to the inputs, the rankings reverse: iTransformer improves its accuracy three times more efficiently than PatchTST. By controlling for model size, we confirm that this advantage stems from the architecture's inherent ability to mix information across different variables. Extending our evaluation to solar generation, wind power, and wholesale prices further demonstrates that model rankings depend on the forecast task: PatchTST excels on highly rhythmic signals like solar, while state space models are better suited for the chaotic fluctuations of wind and price. Ultimately, this benchmark provides grid operators with actionable guidelines for selecting the optimal forecasting architecture based on their specific data environments.</description>

      <title>Provably Safe Generative Sampling with Constricting Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flow-based generative models, such as diffusion models and flow matching models, have achieved remarkable success in learning complex data distributions. However, a critical gap remains for their deployment in safety-critical domains: the lack of formal guarantees that generated samples will satisfy hard constraints. We address this by proposing a safety filtering framework that acts as an online shield for any pre-trained generative model. Our key insight is to cooperate with the generative process rather than override it. We define a constricting safety tube that is relaxed at the initial noise distribution and progressively tightens to the target safe set at the final data distribution, mirroring the coarse-to-fine structure of the generative process itself. By characterizing this tube via Control Barrier Functions (CBFs), we synthesize a feedback control input through a convex Quadratic Program (QP) at each sampling step. As the tube is loosest when noise is high and intervention is cheapest in terms of control energy, most constraint enforcement occurs when it least disrupts the model's learned structure. We prove that this mechanism guarantees safe sampling while minimizing the distributional shift from the original model at each sampling step, as quantified by the KL divergence. Our framework applies to any pre-trained flow-based generative scheme requiring no retraining or architectural modifications. We validate the approach across constrained image generation, physically-consistent trajectory sampling, and safe robotic manipulation policies, achieving 100% constraint satisfaction while preserving semantic fidelity.</description>

      <title>Constructive Vector Fields for Path Following in Fully-Actuated Systems on Matrix Lie Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel vector field strategy for controlling fully-actuated systems on connected matrix Lie groups, ensuring convergence to and traversal along a curve defined on the group. Our approach generalizes our previous work (Rezende et al., 2022) and reduces to it when considering the Lie group of translations in Euclidean space. Since the proofs in Rezende et al. (2022) rely on key properties such as the orthogonality between the convergent and traversal components, we extend these results by leveraging Lie group properties. These properties also allow the control input to be non-redundant, meaning it matches the dimension of the Lie group, rather than the potentially larger dimension of the space in which the group is embedded. This can lead to more practical control inputs in certain scenarios. A particularly notable application of our strategy is in controlling systems on SE(3) -- in this case, the non-redundant input corresponds to the object's mechanical twist -- making it well-suited for controlling objects that can move and rotate freely, such as omnidirectional drones. In this case, we provide an efficient algorithm to compute the vector field. We experimentally validate the proposed method using a robotic manipulator to demonstrate its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>LiLo-VLA: Compositional Long-Horizon Manipulation via Linked Object-Centric Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General-purpose robots must master long-horizon manipulation, defined as tasks involving multiple kinematic structure changes (e.g., attaching or detaching objects) in unstructured environments. While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models offer the potential to master diverse atomic skills, they struggle with the combinatorial complexity of sequencing them and are prone to cascading failures due to environmental sensitivity. To address these challenges, we propose LiLo-VLA (Linked Local VLA), a modular framework capable of zero-shot generalization to novel long-horizon tasks without ever being trained on them. Our approach decouples transport from interaction: a Reaching Module handles global motion, while an Interaction Module employs an object-centric VLA to process isolated objects of interest, ensuring robustness against irrelevant visual features and invariance to spatial configurations. Crucially, this modularity facilitates robust failure recovery through dynamic replanning and skill reuse, effectively mitigating the cascading errors common in end-to-end approaches. We introduce a 21-task simulation benchmark consisting of two challenging suites: LIBERO-Long++ and Ultra-Long. In these simulations, LiLo-VLA achieves a 69% average success rate, outperforming Pi0.5 by 41% and OpenVLA-OFT by 67%. Furthermore, real-world evaluations across 8 long-horizon tasks demonstrate an average success rate of 85%. Project page: https://yy-gx.github.io/LiLo-VLA/.</description>

      <title>Secure Semantic Communications via AI Defenses: Fundamentals, Solutions, and Future Directions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) redefines wireless communication from reproducing symbols to transmitting task-relevant semantics. However, this AI-native architecture also introduces new vulnerabilities, as semantic failures may arise from adversarial perturbations to models, corrupted training data, desynchronized priors, or misaligned inference even when lower-layer transmission reliability and cryptographic protection remain intact. This survey provides a defense-centered and system-oriented synthesis of security in SemCom via AI defense. We analyze AI-centric threat models by consolidating existing studies and organizing attack surfaces across model-level, channel-realizable, knowledge-based, and networked inference vectors. Building on this foundation, we present a structured taxonomy of defense strategies organized by where semantic integrity can be compromised in SemCom systems despite correct symbol delivery, spanning semantic encoding, wireless transmission, knowledge integrity, and coordination among multiple agents. These categories correspond to distinct security failure modes, including representation fragility, channel-realizable manipulation, semantic prior poisoning or desynchronization, and adversarial propagation through distributed inference. We also examine security utility operating envelopes that capture tradeoffs among semantic fidelity, robustness, latency, and energy under realistic constraints, survey evaluation frameworks and representative applications, and identify open challenges in cross-layer composition and deployment-time certification. Overall, this survey offers a unified system-level perspective that enables readers to understand major threat and defense mechanisms in AI-native SemCom systems and to leverage emerging security techniques in the design and deployment of robust SemCom architectures for next-generation intelligent networks.</description>

      <title>MPC of Uncertain Nonlinear Systems with Meta-Learning for Fast Adaptation of Neural Predictive Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of reference tracking in uncertain nonlinear systems. A neural State-Space Model (NSSM) is used to approximate the nonlinear system, where a deep encoder network learns the nonlinearity from data, and a state-space component captures the temporal relationship. This transforms the nonlinear system into a linear system in a latent space, enabling the application of model predictive control (MPC) to determine effective control actions. Our objective is to design the optimal controller using limited data from the \textit{target system} (the system of interest). To this end, we employ an implicit model-agnostic meta-learning (iMAML) framework that leverages information from \textit{source systems} (systems that share similarities with the target system) to expedite training in the target system and enhance its control performance. The framework consists of two phases: the (offine) meta-training phase learns a aggregated NSSM using data from source systems, and the (online) meta-inference phase quickly adapts this aggregated model to the target system using only a few data points and few online training iterations, based on local loss function gradients. The iMAML algorithm exploits the implicit function theorem to exactly compute the gradient during training, without relying on the entire optimization path. By focusing solely on the optimal solution, rather than the path, we can meta-train with less storage complexity and fewer approximations than other contemporary meta-learning algorithms. We demonstrate through numerical examples that our proposed method can yield accurate predictive models by adaptation, resulting in a downstream MPC that outperforms several baselines.</description>

      <title>Adaptive RIS Control for Mobile mmWave NLoS Communication Using Single-Bit Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16874v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are emerging as key enablers of reliable industrial automation in the millimeter-wave (mmWave) band, particularly in environments with frequent line-of-sight (LoS) blockage. While prior works have largely focused on theoretical aspects, real-time validation under user mobility remains underexplored. In this work, we propose and experimentally evaluate an adaptive beamforming algorithm that enables RIS reconfiguration via a low-rate feedback link from the mobile user equipment (UE) to the RIS controller, operating without requiring UE position knowledge. The algorithm maintains the received signal power above a predefined threshold using only a single-bit comparison of received power levels. To analyze the algorithms performance, we establish a simulation-based Monte Carlo (MC) optimization benchmark that assumes full UE position knowledge, accounts for practical hardware constraints, and serves as an upper bound for performance evaluation. Using a hexagonal RIS with 127 elements and 1-bit phase quantization at 23.8 GHz, we validate the proposed approach in a semi-anechoic environment over a 60 cm by 92 cm area. The results demonstrate that the single-bit feedback-driven algorithm closes much of the performance gap to the MC upper bound while achieving up to 24 dB gain in received power compared to an inactive RIS baseline. These findings highlight the practical potential of feedback-based adaptive RIS control for robust mmWave non-line-of-sight (NLoS) communication with mobile users.</description>

      <title>Development of a Scaled Setup for Experimental Study of the Effect of Lateral Dynamics on Energy Consumption in Electric Vehicles: An Extension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14575v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most of the existing state-of-the-art approaches for energy consumption analysis do not account for the effect of lateral dynamics on energy consumption in electric vehicles (EVs) during vehicle maneuvers. This paper aims to validate this effect through an experimental study. We develop a scaled model using a radio-controlled (RC) car, modified to achieve dynamic similitude with on-road vehicles, to conduct scaled experiments. The experimental results confirm the impact of lateral dynamics on both energy demand and driving range in electric vehicles, aligning with our previous findings [1], and emphasize the need to incorporate these factors into energy consumption models. This is an extended version of a paper accepted at IEEE ITEC 2025. It includes additional results and analysis.</description>

      <title>Exploring a New Design Paradigm for Omnidirectional MAVs for Minimal Actuation and Internal Force Elimination: Theoretical Framework and Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel concept for achieving omnidirectionality in a multirotor aerial vehicle (MAV) that uses only 6 inputs and ensures no internal forces at the equilibria. The concept integrates a single actively-tilting propeller along with 3 pendulum-like links, each carrying a propeller,connected by passive universal joints to the main body. We show that this design ensures omnidirectionality while minimizing the internal forces and without resorting to overactuation (i.e.,more than 6 inputs). A detailed dynamic model of the multi-link MAV is first developed. Afterwards, the analysis identifies the equilibrium configurations and illustrates that a forced equilibrium exists for every pose of the MAV's main platform. In order to render this equilibrium asymptotically stable for the closed-loop system, a coordinate-invariant nonlinear controller is constructed using dynamic feedback linearization and backstepping techniques with the main platform configuration error being the left-trivialized error on SE(3). The stability of the closed-loop system is then investigated by employing standard Lyapunov arguments on the zero dynamics. We conclude by providing numerical Gazebo simulations validating our approach. They demonstrate the MAV capability to perform decoupled attitude and translational motions under parametric uncertainty and actuators noise.</description>

      <title>Integrating Conductor Health into Dynamic Line Rating and Unit Commitment under Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15740v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic line rating (DLR) enables greater utilization of existing transmission lines by leveraging real-time weather data. However, the elevated temperature operation (ETO) of conductors under DLR is often overlooked, despite its long-term impact on conductor health. This paper addresses this issue by 1) quantifying risk-based depreciation costs associated with ETO and 2) proposing a Conductor Health-Aware Unit Commitment (CHA-UC) that internalizes these costs in operational decisions. CHA-UC incorporates a robust linear approximation of conductor temperature and integration of expected depreciation costs due to hourly ETO into the objective function. Case studies on the Texas 123-bus backbone test system using NOAA weather data demonstrate that the proposed CHA-UC model reduces the total cost by 0.74\% and renewable curtailment by 85\% compared to static line rating (SLR) and outperforms quantile regression forest-based methods, while conventional DLR operation without risk consideration resulted in higher costs due to excessive ETO. Further analysis of the commitment decisions and the line temperature statistics confirms that the CHA-UC achieves safer line flows by shifting generator commitments. Finally, we examine the emergent correlation behaviors arising between wind generation and DLR forecast errors, and show that CHA-UC adaptively manages this effect by relaxing flows for risk-hedging conditions while tightening flows for risk-amplifying ones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04579v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control is a sampling-based optimization method that has recently attracted attention, particularly in the robotics and reinforcement learning communities. MPPI has been widely applied as a GPU-accelerated random search method to deterministic direct single-shooting optimal control problems arising in model predictive control (MPC) formulations. MPPI offers several key advantages, including flexibility, robustness, ease of implementation, and inherent parallelizability. However, its performance can deteriorate in high-dimensional settings since the optimal control problem is solved via Monte Carlo sampling. To address this limitation, this paper proposes an enhanced MPPI method that incorporates a Jacobian reconstruction technique and the second-order Generalized Gauss-Newton method. This novel approach is called \textit{Gauss-Newton accelerated MPPI}. The numerical results show that the Gauss-Newton accelerated MPPI approach substantially improves MPPI scalability and computational efficiency while preserving the key benefits of the classical MPPI framework, making it a promising approach even for high-dimensional problems.</description>

      <title>Toward a Decision Support System for Energy-Efficient Ferry Operation on Lake Constance based on Optimal Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The maritime sector is undergoing a disruptive technological change driven by three main factors: autonomy, decarbonization, and digital transformation. Addressing these factors necessitates a reassessment of inland vessel operations. This paper presents the design and development of a decision support system for ferry operations based on a shrinking-horizon optimal control framework. The problem formulation incorporates a mathematical model of the ferry's dynamics and environmental disturbances, specifically water currents and wind, which can significantly influence the dynamics. Real-world data and illustrative scenarios demonstrate the potential of the proposed system to effectively support ferry crews by providing real-time guidance. This enables enhanced operational efficiency while maintaining predefined maneuver durations. The findings suggest that optimal control applications hold substantial promise for advancing future ferry operations on inland waters.

      <title>EExApp: GNN-Based Reinforcement Learning for Radio Unit Energy Optimization in 5G O-RAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With over 3.5 million 5G base stations deployed globally, their collective energy consumption (projected to exceed 131 TWh annually) raises significant concerns over both operational costs and environmental impacts. In this paper, we present EExAPP, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based xApp for 5G Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) that jointly optimizes radio unit (RU) sleep scheduling and distributed unit (DU) resource slicing. EExAPP uses a dual-actor-dual-critic Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) architecture, with dedicated actor-critic pairs targeting energy efficiency and quality-of-service (QoS) compliance. A transformer-based encoder enables scalable handling of variable user equipment (UE) populations by encoding all-UE observations into fixed-dimensional representations. To coordinate the two optimization objectives, a bipartite Graph Attention Network (GAT) is used to modulate actor updates based on both critic outputs, enabling adaptive trade-offs between power savings and QoS. We have implemented EExAPP and deployed it on a real-world 5G O-RAN testbed with live traffic, commercial RU and smartphones. Extensive over-the-air experiments and ablation studies confirm that EExAPP significantly outperforms existing methods in reducing the energy consumption of RU while maintaining QoS.

      <title>High-Altitude Platforms in the Low-Altitude Economy: Bridging Communication, Computing, and Regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Low-Altitude Economy (LAE) is rapidly emerging as a new technological and industrial frontier, with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, and aerial swarms increasingly deployed in logistics, infrastructure inspection, security, and emergency response. However, the large-scale development of the LAE demands a reliable aerial foundation that ensures not only real-time connectivity and computational support, but also navigation integrity and safe airspace management for safety-critical operations. High-Altitude Platforms (HAPs), positioned at around 20 km, provide a unique balance between wide-area coverage and low-latency responsiveness. Compared with low earth orbit (LEO) satellites, HAPs are closer to end users and thus capable of delivering millisecond-level connectivity, fine-grained regulatory oversight, and powerful onboard computing and caching resources. Beyond connectivity and computation, HAPs-assisted sensing and regulation further enable navigation integrity and airspace trust, which are essential for safety-critical UAV and eVTOL operations in the LAE. This article proposes a five-stage evolutionary roadmap for HAPs in the LAE: from serving as aerial infrastructure bases, to becoming super back-ends for UAV, to acting as frontline support for ground users, further enabling swarm-scale UAV coordination, and ultimately advancing toward edge-air-cloud closed-loop autonomy. In parallel, HAPs complement LEO satellites and cloud infrastructures to form a global-regional-local three-tier architecture. Looking forward, HAPs are expected to evolve from simple platforms into intelligent hubs, emerging as pivotal nodes for air traffic management, intelligent logistics, and emergency response. By doing so, they will accelerate the transition of the LAE toward large-scale deployment, autonomy, and sustainable growth.</description>

      <title>Multi-agent deep reinforcement learning with centralized training and decentralized execution for transportation infrastructure management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12455v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Life-cycle management of large-scale transportation systems requires determining a sequence of inspection and maintenance decisions to minimize long-term risks and costs while dealing with multiple uncertainties and constraints that lie in high-dimensional spaces. Traditional approaches have been widely applied but often suffer from limitations related to optimality, scalability, and the ability to properly handle uncertainty. Moreover, many existing methods rely on unconstrained formulations that overlook critical operational constraints. We address these issues in this work by casting the optimization problem within the framework of constrained Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), which provide a robust mathematical foundation for stochastic sequential decision-making under observation uncertainties, in the presence of risk and resource limitations. To tackle the high dimensionality of state and action spaces, we propose DDMAC-CTDE, a Deep Decentralized Multi-Agent Actor-Critic (DDMAC) reinforcement learning architecture with Centralized Training and Decentralized Execution (CTDE). To demonstrate the utility of the proposed framework, we also develop a new comprehensive benchmark environment representing an existing transportation network in Virginia, U.S., with heterogeneous pavement and bridge assets undergoing nonstationary degradation. This environment incorporates multiple practical constraints related to budget limits, performance guidelines, traffic delays, and risk considerations. On this benchmark, DDMAC-CTDE consistently outperforms standard transportation management baselines, producing better policies. Together, the proposed framework and benchmark provide (i) a scalable, constraint-aware methodology, and (ii) a realistic, rigorous testbed for comprehensive evaluation of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for transportation infrastructure management.</description>

      <title>MPPI-Generic: A CUDA Library for Stochastic Trajectory Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07563v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new C++/CUDA library for GPU-accelerated stochastic optimization called MPPI-Generic. It provides implementations of Model Predictive Path Integral control, Tube-Model Predictive Path Integral Control, and Robust Model Predictive Path Integral Control, and allows for these algorithms to be used across many pre-existing dynamics models and cost functions. Furthermore, researchers can create their own dynamics models or cost functions following our API definitions without needing to change the actual Model Predictive Path Integral Control code. Finally, we compare computational performance to other popular implementations of Model Predictive Path Integral Control over a variety of GPUs to show the real-time capabilities our library can allow for. Library code can be found at: https://acdslab.github.io/mppi-generic-website/ .</description>

      <title>Learning to Pursue AC Optimal Power Flow Solutions with Feasibility Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on an AC optimal power flow (OPF) problem for distribution feeders equipped with controllable distributed energy resources (DERs). We consider a solution method that is based on a continuous approximation of the projected gradient flow - referred to as the safe gradient flow - that incorporates voltage and current information obtained either through real-time measurements or power flow computations. These two setups enable both online and offline implementations. The safe gradient flow involves the solution of convex quadratic programs (QPs). To enhance computational efficiency, we propose a novel framework that employs a neural network approximation of the optimal solution map of the QP. The resulting method has two key features: (a) it ensures that the DERs' setpoints are practically feasible, even for an online implementation or when an offline algorithm has an early termination; (b) it ensures convergence to a neighborhood of a strict local optimizer of the AC OPF. The proposed method is tested on a 93-node distribution system with realistic loads and renewable generation. The test shows that our method successfully regulates voltages within limits during periods with high renewable generation.</description>

      <title>Toward a Multi-Echelon Cyber Warfare Theory: A Meta-Game-Theoretic Paradigm for Defense and Dominance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cyber warfare has become a central element of modern conflict, especially within multi-domain operations. As both a distinct and critical domain, cyber warfare requires integrating defensive and offensive technologies into coherent strategies. While prior research has emphasized isolated tactics or fragmented technologies, a holistic understanding is essential for effective resource deployment and risk mitigation. Game theory offers a unifying framework for this purpose. It not only models attacker-defender interactions but also provides quantitative tools for equilibrium analysis, risk assessment, and strategic reasoning. Integrated with modern AI techniques, game-theoretic models enable the design and optimization of strategies across multiple levels of cyber warfare, from policy and strategy to operations, tactics, and technical implementations. These models capture the paradoxical logic of conflict, where more resources do not always translate into greater advantage, and where nonlinear dynamics govern outcomes. To illustrate the approach, this chapter examines RedCyber, a synthetic cyber conflict, demonstrating how game-theoretic methods capture the interdependencies of cyber operations. The chapter concludes with directions for future research on resilience, cros-echelon planning, and the evolving role of AI in cyber warfare.</description>

      <title>Dual-Regularized Riccati Recursions for Interior-Point Optimal Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16370v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive closed-form extensions of Riccati's recursions (both sequential and parallel) for solving dual-regularized LQR problems. We show how these methods can be used to solve general constrained, non-convex, discrete-time optimal control problems via a regularized interior point method, while guaranteeing that each primal step is a descent direction of an Augmented Barrier-Lagrangian merit function. We provide MIT-licensed implementations of our methods in C++ and JAX.</description>

      <title>Improving Variational Autoencoder using Random Fourier Transformation: An Aviation Safety Anomaly Detection Case-Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01016v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we focus on the training process and inference improvements of deep neural networks (DNNs), specifically Autoencoders (AEs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), using Random Fourier Transformation (RFT). We further explore the role of RFT in model training behavior using Frequency Principle (F-Principle) analysis and show that models with RFT turn to learn low frequency and high frequency at the same time, whereas conventional DNNs start from low frequency and gradually learn (if successful) high-frequency features. We focus on reconstruction-based anomaly detection using autoencoder and variational autoencoder and investigate the RFT's role. We also introduced a trainable variant of RFT that uses the existing computation graph to train the expansion of RFT instead of it being random. We showcase our findings with two low-dimensional synthetic datasets for data representation, and an aviation safety dataset, called Dashlink, for high-dimensional reconstruction-based anomaly detection. The results indicate the superiority of models with Fourier transformation compared to the conventional counterpart and remain inconclusive regarding the benefits of using trainable Fourier transformation in contrast to the Random variant.</description>

      <title>DCoPilot: Generative AI-Empowered Policy Adaptation for Dynamic Data Center Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02137v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern data centers (DCs) hosting artificial intelligence (AI)-dedicated devices operate at high power densities with rapidly varying workloads, making minute-level adaptation essential for safe and energy-efficient operation. However, manually designing piecewise deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents cannot keep pace with frequent dynamics shifts and service-level agreement (SLA) changes of an evolving DC. This specification-to-policy lag causes a lack of timely, effective control policies, which may lead to service outages. To bridge the gap, we present DCoPilot, a hybrid framework for generative control policies in dynamic DC operation. DCoPilot synergizes two distinct generative paradigms, i.e., a large language model (LLM) that performs symbolic generation of structured reward forms, and a hypernetwork that conducts parametric generation of policy weights. DCoPilot operates through three coordinated phases: (i) simulation scale-up, which stress-tests reward candidates across diverse simulation-ready (SimReady) scenes; (ii) meta policy distillation, where a hypernetwork is trained to output policy weights conditioned on SLA and scene embeddings; and (iii) online adaptation, enabling zero-shot policy generation in response to updated specifications. Evaluated across five control task families spanning diverse DC components, DCoPilot achieves near-zero constraint violations and outperforms all baselines across specification variations. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of LLM-based unified reward generation in enabling stable hypernetwork convergence.</description>
