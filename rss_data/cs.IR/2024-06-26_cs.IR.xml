      <title>Debiased Recommendation with Noisy Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ratings of a user to most items in recommender systems are usually missing not at random (MNAR), largely because users are free to choose which items to rate. To achieve unbiased learning of the prediction model under MNAR data, three typical solutions have been proposed, including error-imputation-based (EIB), inverse-propensity-scoring (IPS), and doubly robust (DR) methods. However, these methods ignore an alternative form of bias caused by the inconsistency between the observed ratings and the users' true preferences, also known as noisy feedback or outcome measurement errors (OME), e.g., due to public opinion or low-quality data collection process. In this work, we study intersectional threats to the unbiased learning of the prediction model from data MNAR and OME in the collected data. First, we design OME-EIB, OME-IPS, and OME-DR estimators, which largely extend the existing estimators to combat OME in real-world recommendation scenarios. Next, we theoretically prove the unbiasedness and generalization bound of the proposed estimators. We further propose an alternate denoising training approach to achieve unbiased learning of the prediction model under MNAR data with OME. Extensive experiments are conducted on three real-world datasets and one semi-synthetic dataset to show the effectiveness of our proposed approaches. The code is available at https://github.com/haoxuanli-pku/KDD24-OME-DR.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic Knowledge Transfer in Cross-Domain Recommendation System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-Domain Recommendation (CDR) seeks to utilize knowledge from different domains to alleviate the problem of data sparsity in the target recommendation domain, and it has been gaining more attention in recent years. Although there have been notable advancements in this area, most current methods represent users and items in Euclidean space, which is not ideal for handling long-tail distributed data in recommendation systems. Additionally, adding data from other domains can worsen the long-tail characteristics of the entire dataset, making it harder to train CDR models effectively. Recent studies have shown that hyperbolic methods are particularly suitable for modeling long-tail distributions, which has led us to explore hyperbolic representations for users and items in CDR scenarios. However, due to the distinct characteristics of the different domains, applying hyperbolic representation learning to CDR tasks is quite challenging. In this paper, we introduce a new framework called Hyperbolic Contrastive Learning (HCTS), designed to capture the unique features of each domain while enabling efficient knowledge transfer between domains. We achieve this by embedding users and items from each domain separately and mapping them onto distinct hyperbolic manifolds with adjustable curvatures for prediction. To improve the representations of users and items in the target domain, we develop a hyperbolic contrastive learning module for knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that hyperbolic manifolds are a promising alternative to Euclidean space for CDR tasks.</description>

      <title>A Thorough Performance Benchmarking on Lightweight Embedding-based Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the creation of the Web, recommender systems (RSs) have been an indispensable mechanism in information filtering. State-of-the-art RSs primarily depend on categorical features, which ecoded by embedding vectors, resulting in excessively large embedding tables. To prevent over-parameterized embedding tables from harming scalability, both academia and industry have seen increasing efforts in compressing RS embeddings. However, despite the prosperity of lightweight embedding-based RSs (LERSs), a wide diversity is seen in evaluation protocols, resulting in obstacles when relating LERS performance to real-world usability. Moreover, despite the common goal of lightweight embeddings, LERSs are evaluated with a single choice between the two main recommendation tasks -- collaborative filtering and content-based recommendation. This lack of discussions on cross-task transferability hinders the development of unified, more scalable solutions. Motivated by these issues, this study investigates various LERSs' performance, efficiency, and cross-task transferability via a thorough benchmarking process. Additionally, we propose an efficient embedding compression method using magnitude pruning, which is an easy-to-deploy yet highly competitive baseline that outperforms various complex LERSs. Our study reveals the distinct performance of LERSs across the two tasks, shedding light on their effectiveness and generalizability. To support edge-based recommendations, we tested all LERSs on a Raspberry Pi 4, where the efficiency bottleneck is exposed. Finally, we conclude this paper with critical summaries of LERS performance, model selection suggestions, and underexplored challenges around LERSs for future research. To encourage future research, we publish source codes and artifacts at \href{this link}{https://github.com/chenxing1999/recsys-benchmark}.</description>

      <title>Performative Debias with Fair-exposure Optimization Driven by Strategic Agents in Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data bias, e.g., popularity impairs the dynamics of two-sided markets within recommender systems. This overshadows the less visible but potentially intriguing long-tail items that could capture user interest. Despite the abundance of research surrounding this issue, it still poses challenges and remains a hot topic in academic circles. Along this line, in this paper, we developed a re-ranking approach in dynamic settings with fair-exposure optimization driven by strategic agents. Designed for the producer side, the execution of agents assumes content creators can modify item features based on strategic incentives to maximize their exposure. This iterative process entails an end-to-end optimization, employing differentiable ranking operators that simultaneously target accuracy and fairness. Joint objectives ensure the performance of recommendations while enhancing the visibility of tail items. We also leveraged the performativity nature of predictions to illustrate how strategic learning influences content creators to shift towards fairness efficiently, thereby incentivizing features of tail items. Through comprehensive experiments on both public and industrial datasets, we have substantiated the effectiveness and dominance of the proposed method especially on unveiling the potential of tail items.</description>

      <title>ACE: A Generative Cross-Modal Retrieval Framework with Coarse-To-Fine Semantic Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative retrieval, which has demonstrated effectiveness in text-to-text retrieval, utilizes a sequence-to-sequence model to directly generate candidate identifiers based on natural language queries. Without explicitly computing the similarity between queries and candidates, generative retrieval surpasses dual-tower models in both speed and accuracy on large-scale corpora, providing new insights for cross-modal retrieval. However, constructing identifiers for multimodal data remains an untapped problem, and the modality gap between natural language queries and multimodal candidates hinders retrieval performance due to the absence of additional encoders. To this end, we propose a pioneering generAtive Cross-modal rEtrieval framework (ACE), which is a comprehensive framework for end-to-end cross-modal retrieval based on coarse-to-fine semantic modeling. We propose combining K-Means and RQ-VAE to construct coarse and fine tokens, serving as identifiers for multimodal data. Correspondingly, we design the coarse-to-fine feature fusion strategy to efficiently align natural language queries and candidate identifiers. ACE is the first work to comprehensively demonstrate the feasibility of generative approach on text-to-image/audio/video retrieval, challenging the dominance of the embedding-based dual-tower architecture. Extensive experiments show that ACE achieves state-of-the-art performance in cross-modal retrieval and outperforms the strong baselines on Recall@1 by 15.27% on average.</description>

      <title>Light-weight End-to-End Graph Interest Network for CTR Prediction in E-commerce Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Click-through-rate (CTR) prediction has an essential impact on improving user experience and revenue in e-commerce search. With the development of deep learning, graph-based methods are well exploited to utilize graph structure extracted from user behaviors and other information to help embedding learning. However, most of the previous graph-based methods mainly focus on recommendation scenarios, and therefore their graph structures highly depend on item's sequential information from user behaviors, ignoring query's sequential signal and query-item correlation. In this paper, we propose a new approach named Light-weight End-to-End Graph Interest Network (EGIN) to effectively mine users' search interests and tackle previous challenges. (i) EGIN utilizes query and item's correlation and sequential information from the search system to build a heterogeneous graph for better CTR prediction in e-commerce search. (ii) EGIN's graph embedding learning shares the same training input and is jointly trained with CTR prediction, making the end-to-end framework effortless to deploy in large-scale search systems. The proposed EGIN is composed of three parts: query-item heterogeneous graph, light-weight graph sampling, and multi-interest network. The query-item heterogeneous graph captures correlation and sequential information of query and item efficiently by the proposed light-weight graph sampling. The multi-interest network is well designed to utilize graph embedding to capture various similarity relationships between query and item to enhance the final CTR prediction. We conduct extensive experiments on both public and industrial datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed EGIN. At the same time, the training cost of graph learning is relatively low compared with the main CTR prediction task, ensuring efficiency in practical applications.</description>

      <title>DEXTER: A Benchmark for open-domain Complex Question Answering using LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open-domain complex Question Answering (QA) is a difficult task with challenges in evidence retrieval and reasoning. The complexity of such questions could stem from questions being compositional, hybrid evidence, or ambiguity in questions. While retrieval performance for classical QA tasks is well explored, their capabilities for heterogeneous complex retrieval tasks, especially in an open-domain setting, and the impact on downstream QA performance, are relatively unexplored. To address this, in this work, we propose a benchmark composing diverse complex QA tasks and provide a toolkit to evaluate state-of-the-art pre-trained dense and sparse retrieval models in an open-domain setting. We observe that late interaction models and surprisingly lexical models like BM25 perform well compared to other pre-trained dense retrieval models. In addition, since context-based reasoning is critical for solving complex QA tasks, we also evaluate the reasoning capabilities of LLMs and the impact of retrieval performance on their reasoning capabilities. Through experiments, we observe that much progress is to be made in retrieval for complex QA to improve downstream QA performance.

      <title>A Text is Worth Several Tokens: Text Embedding from LLMs Secretly Aligns Well with The Key Tokens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text embeddings from large language models (LLMs) have achieved excellent results in tasks such as information retrieval, semantic textual similarity, etc. In this work, we show an interesting finding: when feeding a text into the embedding LLMs, the obtained text embedding will be able to be aligned with the key tokens in the input text. We first fully analyze this phenomenon on eight embedding LLMs and show that this phenomenon is universal and is not affected by model architecture, training strategy, and embedding method. With a deeper analysis, we then find that the main change in embedding space between the embedding LLMs and their original generative LLMs is in the first principal component. By adjusting the first principal component, we can align text embedding with the key tokens. Finally, we give several examples to demonstrate the vast application potential of this finding: (1) we propose a simple and practical sparse retrieval method based on the aligned tokens, which can achieve 80\% of the dense retrieval effect of the same model while reducing the computation significantly; (2) we show that our findings provide a fresh perspective to help understand fuzzy concepts (e.g., semantic relatedness vs. semantic similarity) and emerging technologies (e.g., instruction-following embedding) in this field.</description>

      <title>LumberChunker: Long-Form Narrative Document Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern NLP tasks increasingly rely on dense retrieval methods to access up-to-date and relevant contextual information. We are motivated by the premise that retrieval benefits from segments that can vary in size such that a content's semantic independence is better captured. We propose LumberChunker, a method leveraging an LLM to dynamically segment documents, which iteratively prompts the LLM to identify the point within a group of sequential passages where the content begins to shift. To evaluate our method, we introduce GutenQA, a benchmark with 3000 "needle in a haystack" type of question-answer pairs derived from 100 public domain narrative books available on Project Gutenberg. Our experiments show that LumberChunker not only outperforms the most competitive baseline by 7.37% in retrieval performance (DCG@20) but also that, when integrated into a RAG pipeline, LumberChunker proves to be more effective than other chunking methods and competitive baselines, such as the Gemini 1.5M Pro. Our Code and Data are available at https://github.com/joaodsmarques/LumberChunker</description>

      <title>NativE: Multi-modal Knowledge Graph Completion in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal knowledge graph completion (MMKGC) aims to automatically discover the unobserved factual knowledge from a given multi-modal knowledge graph by collaboratively modeling the triple structure and multi-modal information from entities. However, real-world MMKGs present challenges due to their diverse and imbalanced nature, which means that the modality information can span various types (e.g., image, text, numeric, audio, video) but its distribution among entities is uneven, leading to missing modalities for certain entities. Existing works usually focus on common modalities like image and text while neglecting the imbalanced distribution phenomenon of modal information. To address these issues, we propose a comprehensive framework NativE to achieve MMKGC in the wild. NativE proposes a relation-guided dual adaptive fusion module that enables adaptive fusion for any modalities and employs a collaborative modality adversarial training framework to augment the imbalanced modality information. We construct a new benchmark called WildKGC with five datasets to evaluate our method. The empirical results compared with 21 recent baselines confirm the superiority of our method, consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance across different datasets and various scenarios while keeping efficient and generalizable. Our code and data are released at https://github.com/zjukg/NATIVE</description>

      <title>MagicLens: Self-Supervised Image Retrieval with Open-Ended Instructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Image retrieval, i.e., finding desired images given a reference image, inherently encompasses rich, multi-faceted search intents that are difficult to capture solely using image-based measures. Recent works leverage text instructions to allow users to more freely express their search intents. However, they primarily focus on image pairs that are visually similar and/or can be characterized by a small set of pre-defined relations. The core thesis of this paper is that text instructions can enable retrieving images with richer relations beyond visual similarity. To show this, we introduce MagicLens, a series of self-supervised image retrieval models that support open-ended instructions. MagicLens is built on a key novel insight: image pairs that naturally occur on the same web pages contain a wide range of implicit relations (e.g., inside view of), and we can bring those implicit relations explicit by synthesizing instructions via foundation models. Trained on 36.7M (query image, instruction, target image) triplets with rich semantic relations mined from the web, MagicLens achieves results comparable with or better than prior best on eight benchmarks of various image retrieval tasks, while maintaining high parameter efficiency with a significantly smaller model size. Additional human analyses on a 1.4M-image unseen corpus further demonstrate the diversity of search intents supported by MagicLens. Code and models are publicly available at https://open-vision-language.github.io/MagicLens/.</description>

      <title>VeraCT Scan: Retrieval-Augmented Fake News Detection with Justifiable Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of fake news poses a significant threat not only by disseminating misleading information but also by undermining the very foundations of democracy. The recent advance of generative artificial intelligence has further exacerbated the challenge of distinguishing genuine news from fabricated stories. In response to this challenge, we introduce VeraCT Scan, a novel retrieval-augmented system for fake news detection. This system operates by extracting the core facts from a given piece of news and subsequently conducting an internet-wide search to identify corroborating or conflicting reports. Then sources' credibility is leveraged for information verification. Besides determining the veracity of news, we also provide transparent evidence and reasoning to support its conclusions, resulting in the interpretability and trust in the results. In addition to GPT-4 Turbo, Llama-2 13B is also fine-tuned for news content understanding, information verification, and reasoning. Both implementations have demonstrated state-of-the-art accuracy in the realm of fake news detection.</description>
