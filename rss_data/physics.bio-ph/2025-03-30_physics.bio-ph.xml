      <title>Impact of Oxygen on DNA Damage Distribution in 3D Genome and Its Correlation to Oxygen Enhancement Ratio under High LET Irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The variation of the oxygen enhancement ratio (OER) across different values of Linear Energy Transfer (LET) currently lacks a comprehensive mechanistic interpretation and a mechanistic model. Our earlier research revealed a significant correlation between the distribution of double-strand breaks (DSBs) within the 3D genome and radiation-induced cell death, which offers valuable insights into the oxygen effect. In this study, we formulate a model where the reaction of oxygen is represented as the probability of inducing DNA strand breaks. Then it is integrated into a track-structure Monte Carlo simulation to investigate the impact of oxygen on the spatial distribution of DSBs within the 3D genome. Results show that the incidence ratios of clustered DSBs in a single topologically associating domain (TAD) (case 2) and DSBs in frequently-interacting TADs (case 3) under aerobic and hypoxic conditions closely align with the trend of the OER of cell survival across various LET values. By utilizing the parameters derived from our previous study, we calculate the OER values related to cell survival. Our OER curves exhibit good correspondence with experimental data. This study provides a potentially mechanistic explanation for the changes in OER across different LET levels. High-LET irradiation leads to dense ionization events, resulting in an overabundance of lesions that readily induce case 2 and case 3. The probabilities of cell death associated with case 2 and case 3 are substantially higher than other damage patterns. This may contribute to the main mechanism governing the variation of OER for high LET. Our study further underscores the importance of the DSB distribution within the 3D genome in the context of radiation-induced cell death. This study also provides valuable reference points for establishing a mechanistic model of OER.</description>

      <title>High-resolution cryoEM structure determination of soluble proteins after soft-landing ESIBD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft-landing electrospray ion beam deposition (ESIBD), i.e. the chemically selective, intact deposition of large and complex molecules on surfaces in vacuum, is a well-established sample preparation method for scanning probe microscopy (SPM), where it facilitates the high-resolution imaging of large and complex molecules. Inherited from mass spectrometry, the advantageous properties of ESIBD, chemical purity and selectivity, as well as precise control over the sample environment in vacuum, are also desirable in combination with other analytical methods. Therefore, recently ESIBD has been pursued for the fabrication of samples for electron cryo-microscopy (cryoEM) with proteins introduced into the gas phase via native electrospray ionisation (native ESIBD). However, the general applicability of this approach and the optimal conditions for an ESIBD-based cryoEM workflow remain unclear. Here, we present instrumentation and methods for a dedicated ESIBD+cryoEM workflow, based on precise control over deposition conditions and sample environment. We establish optimal conditions for gentle deposition of the proteins, for growing homogeneous, ultra-thin, amorphous ice, and for avoiding contamination, which allows for atomic-resolution cryoEM imaging of multiple protein systems. Our results confirm the retention of the protein's native secondary structure and general shape. ESIBD+cryoEM directly links native MS chemical insights with cryoEM's structural precision, offering a versatile platform for structural biology applications.</description>

      <title>Leveraging partial coherence in interferometric microscopy to enhance nanoparticle detection sensitivity and throughput</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interferometric-based microscopies stand as powerful label-free approaches for monitoring and characterising chemical reactions and heterogeneous nanoparticle systems in real time with single particle sensitivity. Nevertheless, coherent artifacts, such as speckle and parasitic interferences, together with limited photon fluxes from spatially incoherent sources, pose an ongoing challenge in achieving both high sensitivity and throughput. In this study, we systematically characterise how partial coherence affects both the signal contrast and the background noise level; thus, it offers a route to improve the signal-to-noise ratio from single nanoparticles (NPs), irrespective of their size and composition; or the light source used. We first validate that lasers can be modified into partially coherent sources with performance matching that of spatially incoherent ones; while providing higher photon fluxes. Secondly, we demonstrate that tuning the degree of partial coherence not only enhances the detection sensitivity of both synthetic and biological NPs, but also affects how signal contrasts vary as a function of the focus position. Finally, we apply our findings to single-protein detection, confirming that these principles extend to differential imaging modalities, which deliver the highest sensitivity. Our results address a critical milestone in the detection of weakly scattering NPs in complex matrices, with wide-ranging applications in biotechnology, nanotechnology, chemical synthesis, and biosensing; ushering a new generation of microscopes that push both the sensitivity and throughput boundaries without requiring beam scanning.</description>

      <title>A Tactile Void</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We mimic the mechanical response of touch mechanoreceptors by that of a gas cavity embedded in an elastic semi-cylinder, as a fingertip analogue. Using tribological experiments combined with optical imaging, we measure the dynamics and deformation of the cavity as the semi-cylinder is put in static contact or slid against model rough surfaces at constant normal force and velocity. We propose an elastic model to predict the cavity deformation under normal load showing that membrane mechanical stresses are anisotropic and we discuss its possible biological consequences. In friction experiments, we show that the cavity shape fluctuations allow for texture discriminations.</description>
