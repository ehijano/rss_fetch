      <title>In-vivo 6D heart motion analysis for emerging self-powered cardiac implants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-powered intracardiac implant devices show great promise for future clinical applications due to their extended operational lifespan and the potential to reduce the need for high-risk repeat surgeries. This study investigates the feasibility of harvesting energy from cardiac motion through in vivo testing of intracardiac devices. Comprehensive three-dimensional translational and rotational cardiac motions are captured in a porcine model using a miniaturized 9-degree-of-freedom motion sensor implanted at six strategic epicardial sites. Kinematic criteria are developed to evaluate the energy harvesting potential of each implant site based on the available kinetic energy, acceleration, and jerk factors. The recorded heart motion signals are analyzed and applied to a conceptual energy harvester proposed to identify the optimal implant site. The results reveal that the left ventricular apex emerges as a preferable site for energy harvesting, particularly at moderate heart rates. These findings offer valuable insights into optimizing self-powered intracardiac implants, reducing dependency on battery replacements, and enhancing long-term patient safety.</description>

      <title>Patient-Specific Modeling of Dose-Escalated Proton Beam Therapy for Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: This study explores the feasibility of dose-escalated proton beam therapy (dPBT) for Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer (LAPC) patients by modeling common patient scenarios using current clinically-adopted practices. Methods: Five patient datasets were used as simulation phantoms, each with six tumour sizes, to systematically simulate treatment scenarios typical in LAPC patients. Using the Raystation treatment planning system, robustly-optimised dPBT and stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) treatment plans were created with a 5 mm margin allowing for intra- and inter-fraction anatomical changes. following clinically-adopted protocols. Safe dose-escalation feasibility is assessed with dose metrics, tumour control (TCP) and normal tissue complication probabilities (NTCP) for average and worst-case intra-fraction motion scenarios. Significance testing was performed using a paired student's t-test. Results: Dose-escalation feasibility is largely dependent on tumour size and proximity to critical structures. Minimal therapeutic benefit was observed for patients with greater than 4.5 cm tumours, however for tumours less than or equal to 4.5 cm dPBT TCPs of 45-90% compared to SABR TCPs of 10-40% (p&lt;0.05). The worst-case scenario dPBT TCP was comparable to SABR. Hypofractioned dPBT further improved this result to greater than 90% (p&lt;0.05) for tumours less than or equal to 4.5 cm. Conclusion: Safe dPBT is feasible for patients with targets up to the median size and see a significant therapeutic benefit compared to the current standard of care in SABR. A patient-specific approach should be taken based on tumour size and surrounding anatomy.</description>

      <title>A Graphical Method for Designing Time-Optimal Non-Cartesian Gradient Waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the fundamental challenges for non-Cartesian MRI is the need of designing time-optimal and hardware-compatible gradient waveforms for the provided $k$-space trajectory. Currently dominant methods either work only for certain trajectories or require significant computation time. In this paper, we aim to develop a fast general method that is able to generate time-optimal gradient waveforms for arbitrary non-Cartesian trajectories satisfying both slew rate and gradient constraints. In the proposed method, the gradient waveform is projected into a space defined by the gradients along the spatial directions, termed as $g$-space. In the constructed $g$-space, the problem of finding the next gradient vector given the current gradient vector under desired slew rate limit and with desired direction is simplified to finding the intersection between a line and a circle. To handle trajectories with increasing curvature, a Forward and Backward Sweep (FBS) strategy is introduced, which ensures the existence of the solution to the above mentioned geometry problem for arbitrary trajectories. Furthermore, trajectory reparameterization is proposed to ensure trajectory fidelity. We compare the proposed method with the previous optimal-control method in simulations and validate its feasibility for real MR acquisitions in phantom and human knee for a wide range of non-Cartesian trajectories. The proposed method enables accurate and fast gradient waveform design, achieving significant reduction in computation time and slew rate overshoot compared to the previous method. The source code will be publicly accessible upon publication of this study.</description>

      <title>Comparison of diffuse correlation spectroscopy analytical models for cerebral blood flow measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-layer diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) models have been developed to reduce the contamination of superficial signals in cerebral blood flow index (CBFi) measurements. However, a systematic comparison of these models and clear guidance on model selection are still lacking. This study compares three DCS analytical models: semi-infinite, two-layer, and three-layer, focusing on their fitting strategies, performance, and suitability for CBFi and relative CBFi (rCBFi) estimation. We simulated DCS data using a four-layer slab head model with the Monte Carlo eXtreme (MCX) toolkit. Multiple fitting strategies were evaluated: early time lag range (ETLR) fitting with fixed or variable beta for the semi-infinite model, and single-distance (SD) and multi-distance (MD) fitting for the two- and three-layer models. Model performance was assessed based on CBFi sensitivity, accuracy of CBFi and rCBFi recovery, resistance to signal contamination from scalp and skull, sensitivity to assumed parameter errors, and computational efficiency across source-detector separations of 20 to 35 mm. Optimal fitting methods include ETLR with fixed beta for the semi-infinite model, SD with fixed beta for the two-layer model, and MD for the three-layer model. The multi-layer models achieved higher CBFi sensitivity (up to 100%) compared to 36.8% for the semi-infinite model. The two-layer model offered the best balance of accuracy and robustness, while the three-layer model enabled simultaneous recovery of CBFi, scalp BFi, and rCBFi. The semi-infinite model was the most computationally efficient, requiring only 0.38 seconds for 500 samples, supporting its use in real-time monitoring. This work offers a practical and systematic evaluation of DCS analytical models and provides guidance for selecting the most appropriate model based on application needs.</description>

      <title>Enhancing and Accelerating Brain MRI through Deep Learning Reconstruction Using Prior Subject-Specific Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a crucial medical imaging modality. However, long acquisition times remain a significant challenge, leading to increased costs, and reduced patient comfort. Recent studies have shown the potential of using deep learning models that incorporate information from prior subject-specific MRI scans to improve reconstruction quality of present scans. Integrating this prior information requires registration of the previous scan to the current image reconstruction, which can be time-consuming. We propose a novel deep-learning-based MRI reconstruction framework which consists of an initial reconstruction network, a deep registration model, and a transformer-based enhancement network. We validated our method on a longitudinal dataset of T1-weighted MRI scans with 2,808 images from 18 subjects at four acceleration factors (R5, R10, R15, R20). Quantitative metrics confirmed our approach's superiority over existing methods (p &lt; 0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Furthermore, we analyzed the impact of our MRI reconstruction method on the downstream task of brain segmentation and observed improved accuracy and volumetric agreement with reference segmentations. Our approach also achieved a substantial reduction in total reconstruction time compared to methods that use traditional registration algorithms, making it more suitable for real-time clinical applications. The code associated with this work is publicly available at https://github.com/amirshamaei/longitudinal-mri-deep-recon.</description>

      <title>Depth-resolved polarisation sensitive optical coherence tomography reveals the complex microanatomical response of cartilage to compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional methods for analysing cartilage microstructure under mechanical loading are largely destructive. In this work, we evaluate the efficacy of using depth-resolved polarisation sensitive optical coherence tomography (PS-OCT) to study the cartilage morphological response to compression. We show that depth-resolved PS-OCT reveals the microstructure of cartilage under load, and it can do so non-destructively, opening significant possibilities for enhanced clinical assessment of cartilage health by detecting deviance from normal load-bearing behaviour.</description>

      <title>Unified 3D MRI Representations via Sequence-Invariant Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12057v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised deep learning has accelerated 2D natural image analysis but remains difficult to translate into 3D MRI, where data are scarce and pre-trained 2D backbones cannot capture volumetric context. We present a \emph{sequence-invariant} self-supervised framework leveraging quantitative MRI (qMRI). By simulating multiple MRI contrasts from a single 3D qMRI scan and enforcing consistent representations across these contrasts, we learn anatomy-centric rather than sequence-specific features. The result is a single 3D encoder that excels across tasks and protocols. Experiments on healthy brain segmentation (IXI), stroke lesion segmentation (ARC), and MRI denoising show significant gains over baseline SSL approaches, especially in low-data settings (up to +8.3\% Dice, +4.2 dB PSNR). It also generalises to unseen sites, supporting scalable clinical use. Code and trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/liamchalcroft/contrast-squared</description>
