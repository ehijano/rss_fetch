      <title>Options for Managing Spent TRi-structural ISOtropic Nuclear Fuel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the past few decades, there has been a renewed interest in advanced reactor concepts, especially the high-temperature gas-cooled and the molten salt-cooled technologies for energy production as well as hydrogen or process heat generation. Tri-structural isotropic fuel is intended to be used in some of these emerging reactor technologies. The fuel bearing TRISO particles are encapsulated in graphite, which acts in the capacity of a moderator. TRISO based fuels can be fabricated in the form of spherical pebbles or cylindrical compacts, the latter of which are then loaded into prismatic graphite blocks.</description>

      <title>Australian Energy Market Operator National Electricity Market Network Optimal Power Flow Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The HELM algorithm was used in this project to solve the optimal power flow problem introduced by a radial PandaPower network formulated from the data given by AEMO on the NEM network. Large losses were observed in the transmission infrastructure surrounding base-load power plants. These losses were not observed in areas that had a higher percentage of renewable power generation. Furthermore, the voltage levels present at the Hydro and Wind farms across Tasmania and South Australia were found to be stable in their steady state. A distributed network of renewable infrastructure is then proposed as a solution to the issues facing the NEM network.</description>

      <title>Spatio-seasonal risk assessment of upward lightning at tall objects using meteorological reanalysis data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates lightning at tall objects and evaluates the risk of upward lightning (UL) over the eastern Alps and its surrounding areas. While uncommon, UL poses a threat, especially to wind turbines, as the long-duration current of UL can cause significant damage. Current risk assessment methods overlook the impact of meteorological conditions, potentially underestimating UL risks. Therefore, this study employs random forests, a machine learning technique, to analyze the relationship between UL measured at Gaisberg Tower (Austria) and $35$ larger-scale meteorological variables. Of these, the larger-scale upward velocity, wind speed and direction at 10 meters and cloud physics variables contribute most information. The random forests predict the risk of UL across the study area at a 1 km$^2$ resolution. Strong near-surface winds combined with upward deflection by elevated terrain increase UL risk. The diurnal cycle of the UL risk as well as high-risk areas shift seasonally. They are concentrated north/northeast of the Alps in winter due to prevailing northerly winds, and expanding southward, impacting northern Italy in the transitional and summer months. The model performs best in winter, with the highest predicted UL risk coinciding with observed peaks in measured lightning at tall objects. The highest concentration is north of the Alps, where most wind turbines are located, leading to an increase in overall lightning activity. Comprehensive meteorological information is essential for UL risk assessment, as lightning densities are a poor indicator of lightning at tall objects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For decades, hospital services have been faced with the challenge of ensuring quality care for patients despite the pressures on staff due to workload overload. Nursing staff are particularly affected by this reality, with a patient/nursing staff ratio so imbalanced that it directly affects the quality of care and the well-being of nurses. This article examines in detail the workload of nursing staff, shedding light on the various factors influencing this workload, including the type of care provided, the characteristics of patients and nursing staff, as well as the organizational context. Furthermore, different methods of calculating and estimating workload are analyzed, ranging from workload calculation systems to advanced predictive models. Finally, reflection is made on future research avenues, particularly concerning the identification of factors influencing workload, data collection and processing, and model validation.</description>

      <title>The Negative Participation Paradox in Three-Candidate Instant Runoff Elections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide theoretical and empirical estimates for the likelihood of a negative participation paradox under instant runoff voting in three-candidate elections. We determine the probability of the paradox and related conditional probabilities based on the impartial anonymous culture and impartial culture models for both complete and partial ballots. We compare these results to the empirical likelihood of a negative participation paradox occurring under instant runoff voting in a large database of voter profiles which have been reduced to three candidates. Lastly, we analyze the relative likelihood of this paradox in comparison to other well-known paradoxes.</description>

      <title>Possible counter-intuitive impact of local vaccine mandates for vaccine-preventable infectious diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model the impact of local vaccine mandates on the spread of vaccine-preventable infectious diseases, which in the absence of vaccines will mainly affect children. Examples of such diseases are measles, rubella, mumps and pertussis. To model the spread of the pathogen, we use a stochastic SIR (Susceptible, Infectious, Recovered) model with two levels of mixing in a closed population, often referred to as the household model. In this model individuals make local contacts within a specific small subgroup of the population (e.g.\ within a household or a school class), while they also make global contacts with random people in the population at a much lower rate than the rate of local contacts.
  We consider what happens if schools are given freedom to impose vaccine mandates on all of their pupils, except for the pupils that are exempt from vaccination because of medical reasons. We investigate how such a mandate affects the probability of an outbreak of a disease and the probability that a pupil that is medically exempt from vaccination, gets infected during an outbreak. We show that if the population vaccine coverage is close to the herd-immunity level then both probabilities may increase if local vaccine mandates are implemented. This is caused by unvaccinated pupils moving to schools without mandates.</description>

      <title>Transportation and Systems Analysis Collaborations in Support of a Federal Consolidated Interim Storage Facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Integrated Waste Management program under the Office of Nuclear Energy is planning for the future transportation, storage, and eventual disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste from nuclear power plant and waste custodian sites across the United States. To better enable informed decision-making regarding the back end of the nuclear fuel cycle, the IWM program has been sponsoring the development and application of system analysis tools capable of analyzing various options for managing SNF and HLW. With these tools, integrated waste management system architecture analyses are being conducted to support the future deployment of a comprehensive nuclear waste management system that considers all major back-end aspects of the nuclear fuel cycle i.e., transportation, storage, and disposal. System analyses and assessments typically use these modeling and simulation tools to investigate implications of changes in various assumptions and parameters such as acceptance rates, receipt logic, facility capacities and capabilities, use of standardized canisters, start and stop dates of facilities, etc.</description>

      <title>Synchronization dynamics of phase oscillators on power grid models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate topological and spectral properties of models of European and US-American power grids and of paradigmatic network models as well as their implications for the synchronization dynamics of phase oscillators with heterogeneous natural frequencies. We employ the complex-valued order parameter --~a widely-used indicator for phase ordering~-- to assess the synchronization dynamics and observe the order parameter to exhibit either constant or periodic or non-periodic, possibly chaotic temporal evolutions for a given coupling strength but depending on initial conditions and the systems' disorder. Interestingly, both topological and spectral characteristics of the power grids point to a diminished capability of these networks to support a temporarily stable synchronization dynamics. We find non-trivial commonalities between the synchronization dynamics of oscillators on seemingly opposing topologies.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional shape and connectivity of physical networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data describing the three-dimensional structure of physical networks is increasingly available, leading to a surge of interest in network science to explore the relationship between the shape and connectivity of physical networks. We contribute to this effort by standardizing and analyzing 15 data sets from different domains. Treating junction points as nodes and connections between them as links, we divide the networks into three categories: lattice-like networks, trees, and linked trees. We find that the degree distribution of physical networks is bounded, with most nodes having degree one or three. Characterizing the physical properties of links, we show that links have an elongated shape and tend to follow a nearly straight trajectory, while a small fraction of links follow a winding path. These typical node and link properties must be reflected by physical network models. We also measure how confined a link is in space by comparing its trajectory to a randomized null-model, showing that links that are central in the abstract network tend to be physically confined by their neighbors. The fact that the shape and connectivity of the physical networks are intertwined highlights that their three-dimensional layout must be taken into account to understand the evolution and function of physical networks.</description>

      <title>Disentangling degree and tie strength heterogeneity in egocentric social networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structure of personal networks reflects how we organise and maintain social relationships. The distribution of tie strengths in personal networks is heterogeneous, with a few close, emotionally intense relationships and a larger number of weaker ties. Recent results indicate this feature is universal across communication channels. Within this general pattern, there is a substantial and persistent inter-individual variation that is also similarly distributed among channels. The reason for the observed universality is yet unclear -- one possibility is that people's traits determine their personal network features on any channel. To address this hypothesis, we need to compare an individual's personal networks across channels, which is a non-trivial task: while we are interested in measuring the differences in tie strength heterogeneity, personal network size is also expected to vary a lot across channels. Therefore, for any measure that compares personal networks, one needs to understand the sensitivity with respect to network size. Here, we study different measures of personal network similarity and show that a recently introduced alter-preferentiality parameter and the Gini coefficient are equally suitable measures for tie strength heterogeneity, as they are fairly insensitive to differences in network size. With these measures, we show that the earlier observed individual-level persistence of personal network structure cannot be attributed to network size stability alone, but that the tie strength heterogeneity is persistent too. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the two measures on multichannel data, where tie strength heterogeneity in personal networks is seen to moderately correlate for the same users across two communication channels (calls and text messages).</description>

      <title>Repetitive Dilemma Games in Distribution Information Using Interplay of Droop Quota: Meek's Method in Impact of Maximum Compensation and Minimum Cost Routes in Information Role of Marginal Contribution in Two-Sided Matching Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is a preliminary report of the research plan and a digest of the results and discussions. On research note explores the complex dynamics of fake news dissemination and fact-checking costs within the framework of information markets and analyzes the equilibrium between supply and demand using the concepts of droop quotas, Meek's method, and marginal contributions. By adopting a two-sided matching market perspective, we delve into scenarios in which markets are stable under the influence of fake news perceived as truth and those in which credibility prevails. Through the application of iterated dilemma game theory, we investigate the strategic choices of news providers affected by the costs associated with spreading fake news and fact-checking efforts. We further examine the maximum reward problem and strategies to minimize the cost path for spreading fake news, and consider a nuanced understanding of market segmentation into "cheap" and "premium" segments based on the nature of the information being spread. Our analysis uses mathematical models and computational processes to identify stable equilibrium points that ensure market stability in the face of deceptive information practices and provide insight into effective strategies to enhance the informational health of the market. Through this comprehensive approach, this paper aims for a more truthful and reliable perspective from which to observe information markets.</description>

      <title>Narratives of Collective Action in YouTube's Discourse on Veganism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Narratives can be powerful tools for inspiring action on pressing societal issues such as climate change. While social science theories offer frameworks for understanding the narratives that arise within collective movements, these are rarely applied to the vast data available from social media platforms, which play a significant role in shaping public opinion and mobilizing collective action. This gap in the empirical evaluation of online narratives limits our understanding of their relationship with public response. In this study, we focus on plant-based diets as a form of pro-environmental action and employ natural language processing to operationalize a theoretical framework of moral narratives specific to the vegan movement. We apply this framework to narratives found in YouTube videos promoting environmental initiatives such as Veganuary, Meatless March, and No Meat May. Our analysis reveals that several narrative types, as defined by the theory, are empirically present in the data. To identify narratives with the potential to elicit positive public engagement, we used text processing to estimate the proportion of comments supporting collective action across narrative types. Video narratives advocating social fight, whether through protest or through efforts to convert others to the cause, are associated with a stronger sense of collective action in the respective comments. These narrative types also demonstrate increased semantic coherence and alignment between the message and public response, markers typically associated with successful collective action. Our work offers new insights into the complex factors that influence the emergence of collective action, thereby informing the development of effective communication strategies within social movements.</description>
