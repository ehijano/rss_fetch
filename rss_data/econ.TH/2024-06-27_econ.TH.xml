      <title>Complexity Aversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a model of decision-making under uncertainty in which an agent is constrained in her cognitive ability to consider complex acts. We identify the complexity of an act according to the corresponding partition of state space. The agent ranks acts according to the expected utility net of complexity cost. A key feature of this model is that the agent is able to update her complexity cost function after the arrival of new information. The main result characterizes axiomatically an updating rule for complexity cost function, the Minimal Complexity Aversion representation. According to this rule, the agent measures the complexity cost of an act conditional on the new information by using the cost of another act that gives exactly the same partition of the event but with the lowest ex-ante cost.</description>

      <title>Pareto-Nash Reversion Strategies: Three Period Dynamic Co-operative Signalling with Sticky Efficiency Wages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper the Nash equilibrium reversion is used as an optimal tool for clearing dynamic prices and wages. The balanced growth path of the efficiency wage and the outcome of repeated household and firm wage bargaining decisions are determined by various exogenous competitive rigidities. A location model is pursued to explore the extent to which a downstream spatial cooperation agreement might affect the price equilibrium. There is also an endogenous hiring function and a knowledge base which is increasing in output, as is the real wage. As the article demonstrates, after accounting for real rigidities in the baseline model the effect of wage growth on household utility through staggered bargaining can be best catered for by adopting a policy of point scoring on the mobility of skilled labour against the models key rigidities. Finally labour mobility is explored. Mobility point scores, which serve to encourage mobility from skilled labour within the model not only increase the knowledge base but also place upward pressure on nominal wage growth.</description>

      <title>Making Information More Valuable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.04418v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study what changes to an agent's decision problem increase her value for information. We prove that information becomes more valuable if and only if the agent's reduced-form payoff in her belief becomes more convex. When the transformation corresponds to the addition of an action, the requisite increase in convexity occurs if and only if a simple geometric condition holds, which extends in a natural way to the addition of multiple actions. We apply these findings to two scenarios: a monopolistic screening problem in which the good is information and delegation with information acquisition.</description>

      <title>Individual and Collective Welfare in Risk Sharing with Many States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07337v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of a large (but finite) state space on models of efficient risk sharing. A group of risk-averse agents agree on a risk-sharing agreement in an economy without aggregate risk. The economy is subject to a perturbation, or shock, that prompts a renegotiation of the agreement. If agents insist on an $\ep$-utility improvement to accept a new agreement, then the probability of a post-shock acceptable agreement vanishes exponentially to zero as the number of states grows. We use similar arguments to consider a model where agents have multiple prior preferences, and show that the existence of an $\ep$-Pareto improving trade requires that some sets of priors have vanishingly small measure. Our results hinge on the "shape does not matter" message of high dimensional isoperimetric inequalities.</description>
