      <title>Numin: Weighted-Majority Ensembles for Intraday Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the application of machine learning models for short-term intra-day trading in equities. We envisage a scenario wherein machine learning models are submitted by independent data scientists to predict discretised ten-candle returns every five minutes, in response to five-minute candlestick data provided to them in near real-time. An ensemble model combines these multiple models via a weighted-majority algorithm. The weights of each model are dynamically updated based on the performance of each model, and can also be used to reward model owners. Each model's performance is evaluated according to two different metrics over a recent time window: In addition to accuracy, we also consider a `utility' metric that is a proxy for a model's potential profitability under a particular trading strategy. We present experimental results on real intra-day data that show that our weighted-majority ensemble techniques show improved accuracy as well as utility over any of the individual models, especially using the utility metric to dynamically re-weight models over shorter time-windows.</description>

      <title>Electrode and electroactive polymer layout design using topology optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When electrically stimulated, electroactive polymers (EAPs) respond with mechanical deformation. The goal of this work is to design electrode and EAP layouts simultaneously in structures by using density-based, multi-material topology optimization. In this novel approach the layout of electrodes and EAP material are not given a priori but is a result from the topology optimization. Material interpolation based on exponential functions is introduced, allowing a large flexibility to control the material interpolation. The electric field in the surrounding free space is modeled using a truncated extended domain method. Numerical examples that demonstrates the method's ability to design arbitrary EAP and electrode layouts are presented. In these optimized structures, electrode material is continuously connected from the electrical sources to opposite sides of the EAP material and thereby concentrating the electric field to the EAP material which drives the deformation.</description>

      <title>Generating Synthetic Genotypes using Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the first diffusion model designed to generate complete synthetic human genotypes, which, by standard protocols, one can straightforwardly expand into full-length, DNA-level genomes. The synthetic genotypes mimic real human genotypes without just reproducing known genotypes, in terms of approved metrics. When training biomedically relevant classifiers with synthetic genotypes, accuracy is near-identical to the accuracy achieved when training classifiers with real data. We further demonstrate that augmenting small amounts of real with synthetically generated genotypes drastically improves performance rates. This addresses a significant challenge in translational human genetics: real human genotypes, although emerging in large volumes from genome wide association studies, are sensitive private data, which limits their public availability. Therefore, the integration of additional, insensitive data when striving for rapid sharing of biomedical knowledge of public interest appears imperative.</description>

      <title>Digital twin inference from multi-physical simulation data of DED additive manufacturing processes with neural ODEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A digital twin is a virtual representation that accurately replicates its physical counterpart, fostering bi-directional real-time data exchange throughout the entire process lifecycle. For Laser Directed Energy Deposition of Wire (DED-LB/w) additive manufacturing processes, digital twins may help to control the residual stress design in build parts. This study focuses on providing faster-than-real-time and highly accurate surrogate models for the formation of residual stresses by employing neural ordinary differential equations. The approach enables accurate prediction of temperatures and altered structural properties like stress tensor components. The developed surrogates can ultimately facilitate on-the-fly re-optimization of the ongoing manufacturing process to achieve desired structural outcomes. Consequently, this building block contributes significantly to realizing digital twins and the first-time-right paradigm in additive manufacturing.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Supply Chain Visibility with Generative AI: An Exploratory Case Study on Relationship Prediction in Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key stumbling block in effective supply chain risk management for companies and policymakers is a lack of visibility on interdependent supply network relationships. Relationship prediction, also called link prediction is an emergent area of supply chain surveillance research that aims to increase the visibility of supply chains using data-driven techniques. Existing methods have been successful for predicting relationships but struggle to extract the context in which these relationships are embedded - such as the products being supplied or locations they are supplied from. Lack of context prevents practitioners from distinguishing transactional relations from established supply chain relations, hindering accurate estimations of risk. In this work, we develop a new Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) enhanced machine learning framework that leverages pre-trained language models as embedding models combined with machine learning models to predict supply chain relationships within knowledge graphs. By integrating Generative AI techniques, our approach captures the nuanced semantic relationships between entities, thereby improving supply chain visibility and facilitating more precise risk management. Using data from a real case study, we show that GenAI-enhanced link prediction surpasses all benchmarks, and demonstrate how GenAI models can be explored and effectively used in supply chain risk management.</description>

      <title>Tango*: Constrained synthesis planning using chemically informed value functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP) has made significant strides in generating retrosynthetic pathways for simple molecules in a non-constrained fashion. Recent work introduces a specialised bidirectional search algorithm with forward and retro expansion to address the starting material-constrained synthesis problem, allowing CASP systems to provide synthesis pathways from specified starting materials, such as waste products or renewable feed-stocks. In this work, we introduce a simple guided search which allows solving the starting material-constrained synthesis planning problem using an existing, uni-directional search algorithm, Retro*. We show that by optimising a single hyperparameter, Tango* outperforms existing methods in terms of efficiency and solve rate. We find the Tango* cost function catalyses strong improvements for the bidirectional DESP methods. Our method also achieves lower wall clock times while proposing synthetic routes of similar length, a common metric for route quality. Finally, we highlight potential reasons for the strong performance of Tango over neural guided search methods</description>

      <title>Quantum Annealing based Hybrid Strategies for Real Time Route Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most well-known problems in transportation and logistics is the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). It involves optimizing a set of truck routes to service a set of customers, subject to limits on truck capacity, to reduce travel costs. The biggest challenge faced whilst attempting to solve the issue is that the time complexity of the issue grows exponentially with the number of customers and trucks, rendering it virtually intractable to traditional computers and algorithms. In this paper, we propose a method to circumvent this limitation, employing quantum computers to aid classical computers in solving problems faster while reducing complexity. To obtain our results, we employ two algorithms: Hybrid Two Step (H2S) and Hybrid Three Step (H3S). Both algorithms involve two phases: clustering and routing. It has been observed that both algorithms produce promising results, both in terms of solution time and solution cost.</description>

      <title>QPET: A Versatile and Portable Quantity-of-Interest-preservation Framework for Error-Bounded Lossy Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Error-bounded lossy compression has been widely adopted in many scientific domains because it can address the challenges in storing, transferring, and analyzing the unprecedented amount of scientific data. Although error-bounded lossy compression offers general data distortion control by enforcing strict error bounds on raw data, they may fail to meet the quality requirements on the results of downstream analysis derived from raw data, a.k.a Quantities of Interest (QoIs). This may lead to uncertainties and even misinterpretations in scientific discoveries, significantly limiting the use of lossy compression in practice. In this paper, we propose QPET, a novel, versatile, and portable framework for QoI-preserving error-bounded lossy compression, which overcomes the challenges of modeling diverse QoIs by leveraging numerical strategies. QPET features (1) high portability to multiple existing lossy compressors, (2) versatile preservation to most differentiable univariate and multivariate QoIs, and (3) significant compression improvements in QoI-preservation tasks. Experiments with six real-world datasets demonstrate that QPET outperformed existing QoI-preserving compression framework in terms of speed, and integrating QPET into state-of-the-art error-bounded lossy compressors can gain up to 250% compression ratio improvements to original compressors and up to 75% compression ratio improvements to existing QoI-integrated scientific compressors. Under the same level of peak signal-to-noise ratios in the QoIs, QPET can improve the compression ratio by up to 102%.</description>

      <title>Matrix-Free Higher-Order Finite Element Methods for Hyperelasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a matrix-free finite element solver for finite-strain elasticity adopting an $hp$-multigrid preconditioner. Compared to classical algorithms relying on a global sparse matrix, matrix-free solution strategies significantly reduce memory traffic by repeated evaluation of the finite element integrals.
  Following this approach in the context of finite-strain elasticity, the precise statement of the final weak form is crucial for performance, and it is not clear a priori whether to choose problem formulations in the material or spatial domain. With a focus on hyperelastic solids in biomechanics, the arithmetic costs to evaluate the material law at each quadrature point might favor an evaluation strategy where some quantities are precomputed in each Newton iteration and reused in the Krylov solver for the linearized problem. Hence, we discuss storage strategies to balance the compute load against memory access in compressible and incompressible neo-Hookean models and an anisotropic tissue model. Additionally, numerical stability becomes increasingly important using lower/mixed-precision ingredients and approximate preconditioners to better utilize modern hardware architectures.
  Application of the presented method to a patient-specific geometry of an iliac bifurcation shows significant speed-ups, especially for higher polynomial degrees, when compared to alternative approaches with matrix-based geometric or black-box algebraic multigrid preconditioners.</description>

      <title>A Physics Preserving Neural Network Based Approach for Constitutive Modeling of Isotropic Fibrous Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13357v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a new neural network architecture that strictly enforces constitutive constraints such as polyconvexity, frame-indifference, and the symmetry of the stress and material stiffness. Additionally, we show that the accuracy of the stress and material stiffness predictions is significantly improved for this neural network by using a Sobolev minimization strategy that includes derivative terms. Using our neural network, we model the constitutive behavior of fibrous-type discrete network material. With Sobolev minimization, we obtain a normalized mean square error of 0.15% for the strain energy density, 0.815% averaged across the components of the stress, and 5.4% averaged across the components of the stiffness tensor. This machine-learned constitutive model was deployed in a finite element simulation of a facet capsular ligament. The displacement fields and stress-strain curves were compared to a multiscale simulation that required running on a GPU-based supercomputer. The new approach maintained upward of 85% accuracy in stress up to 70% strain while reducing the computation cost by orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Memory into Propagation of 1-Electron Reduced Density Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15596v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any linear system with unreduced dynamics governed by invertible propagators, we derive a closed, time-delayed, linear system for a reduced-dimensional quantity of interest. This method does not target dimensionality reduction: rather, this method helps shed light on the memory-dependence of $1$-electron reduced density matrices in time-dependent configuration interaction (TDCI), a scheme to solve for the correlated dynamics of electrons in molecules. Though time-dependent density functional theory has established that the $1$-electron reduced density possesses memory-dependence, the precise nature of this memory-dependence has not been understood. We derive a symmetry/constraint-preserving method to propagate reduced TDCI electron density matrices. In numerical tests on two model systems ($\text{H}_2$ and $\text{HeH}^+$), we show that with sufficiently large time-delay (or memory-dependence), our method propagates reduced TDCI density matrices with high quantitative accuracy. We study the dependence of our results on time step and basis set. To implement our method, we derive the $4$-index tensor that relates reduced and full TDCI density matrices. Our derivation applies to any TDCI system, regardless of basis set, number of electrons, or choice of Slater determinants in the wave function.</description>

      <title>CryoFM: A Flow-based Foundation Model for Cryo-EM Densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is a powerful technique in structural biology and drug discovery, enabling the study of biomolecules at high resolution. Significant advancements by structural biologists using cryo-EM have led to the production of over 38,626 protein density maps at various resolutions1. However, cryo-EM data processing algorithms have yet to fully benefit from our knowledge of biomolecular density maps, with only a few recent models being data-driven but limited to specific tasks. In this study, we present CryoFM, a foundation model designed as a generative model, learning the distribution of high-quality density maps and generalizing effectively to downstream tasks. Built on flow matching, CryoFM is trained to accurately capture the prior distribution of biomolecular density maps. Furthermore, we introduce a flow posterior sampling method that leverages CRYOFM as a flexible prior for several downstream tasks in cryo-EM and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) without the need for fine-tuning, achieving state-of-the-art performance on most tasks and demonstrating its potential as a foundational model for broader applications in these fields.</description>
