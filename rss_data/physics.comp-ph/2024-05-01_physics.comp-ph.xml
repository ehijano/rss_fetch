      <title>Efficient Mixed-Precision Matrix Factorization of the Inverse Overlap Matrix in Electronic Structure Calculations with AI-Hardware and GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, a new kind of accelerated hardware has gained popularity in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) communities which enables extremely high-performance tensor contractions in reduced precision for deep neural network calculations. In this article, we exploit Nvidia Tensor cores, a prototypical example of such AI/ML hardware, to develop a mixed precision approach for computing a dense matrix factorization of the inverse overlap matrix in electronic structure theory, $S^{-1}$. This factorization of $S^{-1}$, written as $ZZ^T=S^{-1}$, is used to transform the general matrix eigenvalue problem into a standard matrix eigenvalue problem. Here we present a mixed precision iterative refinement algorithm where $Z$ is given recursively using matrix-matrix multiplications and can be computed with high performance on Tensor cores. To understand the performance and accuracy of Tensor cores, comparisons are made to GPU-only implementations in single and double precision. Additionally, we propose a non-parametric stopping criteria which is robust in the face of lower precision floating point operations. The algorithm is particularly useful when we have a good initial guess to $Z$, for example, from previous time steps in quantum-mechanical molecular dynamics simulations or from a previous iteration in a geometry optimization.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty quantification for charge transport in GNRs through particle Galerkin methods for the semiclassical Boltzmann equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate some issues related to the quantification of uncertainties associated with the electrical properties of graphene nanoribbons. The approach is suited to understand the effects of missing information linked to the difficulty of fixing some material parameters, such as the band gap, and the strength of the applied electric field. In particular, we focus on the extension of particle Galerkin methods for kinetic equations in the case of the semiclassical Boltzmann equation for charge transport in graphene nanoribbons with uncertainties. To this end, we develop an efficient particle scheme which allows us to parallelize the computation and then, after a suitable generalization of the scheme to the case of random inputs, we present a Galerkin reformulation of the particle dynamics, obtained by means of a generalized polynomial chaos approach, which allows the reconstruction of the kinetic distribution. As a consequence, the proposed particle-based scheme preserves the physical properties and the positivity of the distribution function also in the presence of a complex scattering in the transport equation of electrons. The impact of the uncertainty of the band gap and applied field on the electrical current is analyzed.</description>

      <title>Sign problem in tensor network contraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how the computational difficulty of contracting tensor networks depends on the sign structure of the tensor entries. Using results from computational complexity, we observe that the approximate contraction of tensor networks with only positive entries has lower complexity. This raises the question how this transition in computational complexity manifests itself in the hardness of different contraction schemes. We pursue this question by studying random tensor networks with varying bias towards positive entries. First, we consider contraction via Monte Carlo sampling, and find that the transition from hard to easy occurs when the entries become predominantly positive; this can be seen as a tensor network manifestation of the Quantum Monte Carlo sign problem. Second, we analyze the commonly used contraction based on boundary tensor networks. Its performance is governed by the amount of correlations (entanglement) in the tensor network. Remarkably, we find that the transition from hard to easy (i.e., from a volume law to a boundary law scaling of entanglement) occurs already for a slight bias towards a positive mean, and the earlier the larger the bond dimension is. This is in contrast to both expectations and the behavior found in Monte Carlo contraction. We gain further insight into this early transition from the study of an effective statmech model. Finally, we investigate the computational difficulty of computing expectation values of tensor network wavefunctions, i.e., PEPS, where we find that the complexity of entanglement-based contraction always remains low. We explain this by providing a local transformation which maps PEPS expectation values to a positive-valued tensor network. This not only provides insight into the origin of the observed boundary law entanglement scaling, but also suggests new approaches towards PEPS contraction based on positive decompositions.</description>

      <title>Better Optimization of Variational Quantum Eigensolvers by combining the Unitary Block Optimization Scheme with Classical Post-Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variational Quantum Eigensolvers (VQE) are a promising approach for finding the classically intractable ground state of a Hamiltonian. The Unitary Block Optimization Scheme (UBOS) is a state-of-the-art VQE method which works by sweeping over gates and finding optimal parameters for each gate in the environment of other gates. UBOS improves the convergence time to the ground state by an order of magnitude over Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). It nonetheless suffers in both rate of convergence and final converged energies in the face of highly noisy expectation values coming from shot noise. Here we develop two classical post-processing techniques which improve UBOS especially when measurements have large noise. Using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) we generate artificial augmented data using original data from the quantum computer to reduce the overall error when solving for the improved parameters. Using Double Robust Optimization plus Rejection (DROPR), we prevent outlying data which are atypically noisy from resulting in a a particularly erroneous single optimization step thereby increasing robustness against noisy measurements. Combining these techniques further reduces the final relative error that UBOS reaches by a factor of three without adding additional quantum measurement or sampling overhead. This work further demonstrates that developing techniques which use classical resources to post-process quantum measurement results can significantly improve VQE algorithms.</description>

      <title>Bounds to the Basset-Boussinesq force on particle laden stratified flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Basset-Boussinesq force is often perfunctory neglected when studying small inertial particles in turbulence. The force results from the diffusion of vorticity from the particles, and as it depends on the particles past history, it complicates the dynamics by turning their equations of motion into integro-differential equations. However, this force is of the same order as other viscous forces acting on the particles, and beyond convenience, the reasons for neglecting it are unclear. We derive strict bounds for the magnitude of the Basset-Boussinesq force in stably stratified flows, in contexts of interest for geophysical turbulence. The bounds are validated by direct numerical simulations. The Basset-Boussinesq force can be neglected when a buoyancy Stokes number $\textrm{Sb} = N \tau_p$ is small, where $N$ is the flow Brunt-V\"ais\"al\"a frequency and $\tau_p$ is the particles Stokes time. For sufficiently strong stratification, or particles with large inertia, this force must be considered in the dynamics.</description>

      <title>Striking the Right Balance of Encoding Electron Correlation in the Hamiltonian and the Wavefunction Ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-configurational electronic structure theory delivers the most versatile approximations to many-electron wavefunctions, flexible enough to deal with all sorts of transformations, ranging from electronic excitations, to open-shell molecules and chemical reactions. Multi-configurational models are therefore essential to establish universally applicable, predictive ab initio methods for chemistry. Here, we present a discussion of explicit correlation approaches which address the nagging problem of dealing with static and dynamic electron correlation in multi-configurational active-space approaches. We review the latest developments and then point to their key obstacles. Our discussion is supported by new data obtained with tensor network methods. We argue in favor of simple electrons-only correlator expressions that may allow one to define transcorrelated models in which the correlator does not bear a dependence on molecular structure.</description>

      <title>Negative transit time in non-tunneling electron transmission through graphene multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Attosecond dynamics of electron transmission through atomically-thin crystalline films is studied with an {\em ab initio} scattering theory. The temporal character of the electron propagation through graphene multilayers is traced to the band structure of bulk graphite: In the forbidden gaps the wave packet transit time $\tau_\mathrm{T}$ saturates with thickness and in the allowed bands $\tau_\mathrm{T}$ oscillates following transmission resonances. Hitherto unknown negative transit time due to in-plane scattering is discovered in monolayers of graphene, h-BN, and oxygen. Moreover, Wigner time delay is found to diverge at the scattering resonances caused by the emergence of secondary diffracted beams. This offers a way to manipulate the propagation timing of the wave packet without sacrificing the transmitted intensity. The spatial reshaping of the wave packet at the resonances may help elucidate details of the streaking by an inhomogeneous field at the surface.</description>

Abstract: A path integral method, combined with atomistic spin dynamics simulations, has been developed to calculate thermal quantum expectation values using a classical approach. In this study, we show how to treat Hamiltonians with non-linear terms, that are relevant for describing uniaxial anisotropies and mechanical constraints. These interactions can be expressed solely through quadratic terms of the spin operator along one axis, that can be identified with the quantisation axis.</description>

      <title>Self-assembling of multilayered polymorphs with ion beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polymorphism contributes to the diversity of nature, so that even materials having identical chemical compositions exhibit variations in properties because of different lattice symmetries. Thus, if stacked together into multilayers, polymorphs may work as an alternative approach to the sequential deposition of layers with different chemical compositions. However, selective polymorph crystallization during conventional thin film synthesis is not trivial; e.g. opting for step-like changes of temperature and/or pressure correlated with switching from one polymorph to another during synthesis is tricky, since it may cause degradation of the structural quality. In the present work, applying the disorder-induced ordering approach we fabricated such multilayered polymorph structures using ion beams. We show that during ion irradiation of gallium oxide, the dynamic annealing of disorder may be tuned towards self-assembling of several polymorph interfaces, consistently with theoretical modelling. Specifically, we demonstrated multilayers with two polymorph interface repetitions obtained in one ion beam assisted fabrication step. Importantly, single crystal structure of the polymorphs was maintained in between interfaces exhibiting repeatable crystallographic relationships, correlating with optical cross-sectional maps. This data paves the way for enhancing functionalities in materials with not previously thought capabilities of ion beam technology.</description>

      <title>High-throughput discovery of metal oxides with high thermoelectric performance via interpretable feature engineering on small data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we have proposed a data-driven screening framework combining the interpretable machine learning with high-throughput calculations to identify a series of metal oxides that exhibit both high-temperature tolerance and high power factors. Aiming at the problem of weak generalization ability of small data with power factors at high temperatures, we employ symbolic regression for feature creation which enhances the robustness of the model while preserving the physical meaning of features. 33 candidate metal oxides are finally targeted for high-temperature thermoelectric applications from a pool of 48,694 compounds in the Materials Project database. The Boltzmann transport theory is utilized to perform electrical transport properties calculations at 1,000 K. The relaxation time is approximated by employing constant electron-phonon coupling based on the deformation potential theory. Considering band degeneracy, the electron group velocity is obtained using the momentum matrix element method, yielding 28 materials with power factors greater than 50 ${\mu}W cm^{-1} K^{-2} $. The high-throughput framework we proposed is instrumental in the selection of metal oxides for high-temperature thermoelectric applications. Furthermore, our data-driven analysis and transport calculation suggest that metal oxides rich in elements such as cerium (Ce), tin (Sn), and lead (Pb) tend to exhibit high power factors at high temperatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of plasma-based acceleration processes with collisionless particle dynamics and non negligible thermal effects. We aim at assessing the applicability of fluid-like models, obtained by suitable closure assumptions applied to the relativistic kinetic equations, thus not suffering of statistical noise, even in presence of a finite temperature. The work here presented focuses on the characterization of pressure anisotropies, which crucially depend on the adopted closure scheme, and hence are useful to discern the appropriate thermal fluid model. To this aim, simulation results of spatially resolved fluid models with different thermal closure assumptions are compared with the results of particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations at changing temperature and amplitude of plasma oscillations.</description>

      <title>BAD-NEUS: Rapidly converging trajectory stratification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An issue for molecular dynamics simulations is that events of interest often involve timescales that are much longer than the simulation time step, which is set by the fastest timescales of the model. Because of this timescale separation, direct simulation of many events is prohibitively computationally costly. This issue can be overcome by aggregating information from many relatively short simulations that sample segments of trajectories involving events of interest. This is the strategy of Markov state models (MSMs) and related approaches, but such methods suffer from approximation error because the variables defining the states generally do not capture the dynamics fully. By contrast, once converged, the weighted ensemble (WE) method aggregates information from trajectory segments so as to yield unbiased estimates of both thermodynamic and kinetic statistics. Unfortunately, errors decay no faster than unbiased simulation in WE. Here we introduce a theoretical framework for describing WE that shows that introduction of an element of stratification, as in nonequilibrium umbrella sampling (NEUS), accelerates convergence. Then, building on ideas from MSMs and related methods, we propose an improved stratification that allows approximation error to be reduced systematically. We show that the improved stratification can decrease simulation times required to achieve a desired precision by orders of magnitude.</description>

Abstract: We study the stability and sensitivity of an absorbing layer for the Boltzmann equation by examining the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) approximation and using the perfectly matched layer (PML) technique. To ensure stability, we discard some parameters in the model and calculate the total sensitivity indices of the remaining parameters using the ANOVA expansion of multivariate functions. We conduct extensive numerical experiments on two test cases to study stability and compute the total sensitivity indices, which allow us to identify the essential parameters of the model.</description>

      <title>Effect of shear flow on the transverse thermal conductivity of polymer melts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effect of shear flows on the thermal conductivity of polymer melts is investigated using a reversed nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (RNEMD) method. We extended the original RNEMD method to simultaneously produce spatial gradients of temperature and flow velocity in a single direction. This method enables accurate measurement of the thermal conductivity in the direction transverse to shear flow.
  The Weissenberg number defined with the shear rate and the relaxation time of the polymer conformation can uniformly differentiate the occurrence of shear rate dependence of the thermal conductivity across different chain lengths. The stress-thermal rule (STR) (i.e., the linear relationship between anisotropic parts of the stress tensor and the thermal conductivity tensor) holds for entangled polymer melts even under shear flows but not for unentangled polymer melts. Furthermore, once entanglements form in polymer chains, the stress-thermal coefficient in the STR remains independent of the polymer chain length.
  These observations align with the theoretical foundation of the STR, which focuses on energy transmission along the network structure of entangled polymer chains [Brule, Rheol. Acta 28, 257 (1989)]. However, under driven shear flows, the stress-thermal coefficient is notably smaller than that measured in the literature for a quasi-quiescent state without external forces. Although the mechanism of the STR in shear flows has yet to be fully elucidated, our study confirmed the validity of the STR in shear flows. This allows us to use the STR as a constitutive equation for computational thermo-fluid dynamics of polymer melts, thus having broad engineering applications.</description>

      <title>A Novel Paradigm in Solving Multiscale Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05067v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiscale phenomena manifest across various scientific domains, presenting a ubiquitous challenge in accurately and effectively simulating multiscale dynamics in complex systems. In this paper, a novel decoupling solving paradigm is proposed through modelling large-scale dynamics independently and treating small-scale dynamics as a slaved system. A Spectral Physics-informed Neural Network (PINN) is developed to characterize the small-scale system in an efficient and accurate way, addressing the challenges posed by the representation of multiscale dynamics in neural networks. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through extensive numerical experiments, including one-dimensional Kuramot-Sivashinsky equation, two- and three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations, showcasing its versatility in addressing problems of fluid dynamics. Furthermore, we also delve into the application of the proposed approach to more complex problems, including non-uniform meshes, complex geometries, large-scale data with noise, and high-dimensional small-scale dynamics. The discussions about these scenarios contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the method's capabilities and limitations. By enabling the acquisition of large-scale data with minimal computational demands, coupled with the efficient and accurate characterization of small-scale dynamics via Spectral PINN, our approach offers a valuable and promising approach for researchers seeking to tackle multiscale phenomena effectively.</description>

      <title>Illuminating Systematic Trends in Nuclear Data with Generative Machine Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel method for studying systematic trends in nuclear reaction data using generative adversarial networks. Libraries of nuclear cross section evaluations exhibit intricate systematic trends across the nuclear landscape, and predictive models capable of reproducing and analyzing these trends are valuable for many applications. We have developed a predictive model using deep generative adversarial networks to learn trends from the inelastic neutron scattering channel of TENDL for even-even nuclei. The system predicts cross sections based on adding/subtracting particles to/from the target nucleus. It can thus help identify cross sections that break from expected trends and predict beyond the limit of current experiments. Our model can produce good predictions for cross section curves for many nuclides, and it is most robust near the line of stability. We also create an ensemble of predictions to leverage different correlations and estimate model uncertainty. This research marks an important first step in computer generation of nuclear cross-section libraries.</description>

      <title>Six decades of the FitzHugh-Nagumo model: A guide through its spatio-temporal dynamics and influence across disciplines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The FitzHugh-Nagumo equation, originally conceived in neuroscience during the 1960s, became a key model providing a simplified view of excitable neuron cell behavior. Its applicability, however, extends beyond neuroscience into fields like cardiac physiology, cell division, population dynamics, electronics, and other natural phenomena. In this review spanning six decades of research, we discuss the diverse spatio-temporal dynamical behaviors described by the FitzHugh-Nagumo equation. These include dynamics like bistability, oscillations, and excitability, but it also addresses more complex phenomena such as traveling waves and extended patterns in coupled systems. The review serves as a guide for modelers aiming to utilize the strengths of the FitzHugh-Nagumo model to capture generic dynamical behavior. It not only catalogs known dynamical states and bifurcations, but also extends previous studies by providing stability and bifurcation analyses for coupled spatial systems.</description>
