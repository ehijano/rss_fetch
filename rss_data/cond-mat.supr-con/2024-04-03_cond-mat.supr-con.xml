      <title>Two-line Josephson traveling wave parametric amplifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feasibility of two-line design of Josephson traveling wave parametric amplifier aimed at increase of the allowed pump wave energy and hence the gain growth is analyzed and discussed. Serious restrictions follow from both the cyclic energy transfer of the pump, signal and idler waves in the coupled waveguide lines and the phase mismatch of the waves. Besides, impact of the artificial line discreteness on the phase mismatch is considered as well.</description>

      <title>Spin caloritronics as a probe of nonunitary superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting spintronics focuses on the interplay between superconductivity and magnetism and has sparked significant interest in nonunitary superconductors as a platform for novel magneto-superconducting phenomena. However, a direct test for nonunitary superconductors is currently absent, and their identification is challenging. In this paper, we demonstrate that spin current driven by the thermal gradient sensitively probes the nature of the condensate in nonunitary superconductors. We should note that the spin polarization of the condensate in the momentum space induces the spin-Seebeck effect, and the spin-dependent chirality (spin-chirality) of the condensate induces the spin-Nernst effect in nonunitary superconductors. Notably, the nonvanishing spin-Seebeck effect provides a smoking gun evidence of nonunitary superconductivity in materials because it reflects the spin polarization of the Cooper pairs in the momentum space, irrespective of whether the net pair spin magnetization vanishes. Our results position the spin caloritronics phenomena as a definitive probe of nonunitary superconductors.</description>

      <title>Tuning superconductivity in nanosecond laser annealed boron doped $Si_{1-x}Ge_{x}$ epilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductivity in ultra-doped $Si_{1-x}Ge_{x}:B$ epilayers is demonstrated by nanosecond laser doping, which allows introducing substitutional B concentrations well above the solubility limit and up to $7\,at.\%$. A Ge fraction $x$ ranging from 0 to 0.21 is incorporated in $Si:B$ : 1) through a precursor gas by Gas Immersion Laser Doping; 2) by ion implantation, followed by nanosecond laser annealing; 3) by UHV-CVD growth of a thin Ge layer, followed by nanosecond laser annealing. The 30 nm and 80 nm thick $Si_{1-x}Ge_{x}:B$ epilayers display superconducting critical temperatures $T_c$ tuned by B and Ge between 0 and 0.6 K. Within BCS weak-coupling theory, $T_c$ evolves exponentially with both the density of states and the electron-phonon potential. While B doping affects both, through the increase of the carrier density and the tensile strain, Ge incorporation allows addressing independently the lattice deformation influence on superconductivity. To estimate the lattice parameter modulation with B and Ge, Vegard's law is validated for the ternary $SiGeB$ bulk alloy by Density Functional Theory calculations. Its validity is furthermore confirmed experimentally by X-Ray Diffraction. We highlight a global linear dependence of $T_c$ vs. lattice parameter, common for both $Si:B$ and $Si_{1-x}Ge_{x}:B$, with $\delta T_c/T_c \sim 50\,\%$ for $\delta a/a \sim 1\,\%$.</description>

      <title>Retaining Landau quasiparticles in the presence of realistic charge fluctuations in cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charge excitation spectra are getting clear in cuprate superconductors in momentum-energy space especially around a small momentum region, where plasmon excitations become dominant. Here, we study whether Landau quasiparticles survive in the presence of charge fluctuations observed in experiments. We employ the layered t-J model with the long-range Coulomb interaction, which can reproduce the realistic charge fluctuations. We find that Landau quasiparticles are retained in a realistic temperature and doping region, although the quasiparticle spectral weight is strongly reduced to 0.08-0.24. Counterintuitively, the presence of this small quasiparticle weight does not work favorably to generate a pseudogap.</description>

      <title>Spin and bond-charge excitation spectra in correlated electron systems near antiferromagnetic phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic and bond-charge interactions can arise from the same microscopic interaction. Motivated by this observation, we compute magnetic and bond-charge excitation spectra on an equal footing by introducing a simple effective model on a square lattice, which describes antiferromagnetic and d-wave superconducting phases around half-filling on the electron-doped side. The magnetic excitation spectrum Im chi(q, omega) has strong weight around q=(pi, pi) in low energy and its intensity map exhibits a pencil-tip-like shape in q-omega space. Around q=(0,0) magnetic excitations show a steep dispersion toward the (pi, pi) and (pi,0) directions, which is very similar to a spin-wave dispersion although the system is non-magnetic. Bond-charge excitations are characterized by four different symmetries and studied for all possible couplings. Bond-charge fluctuations with three different symmetries have large spectral weight around q=(pi, pi) in a relatively low-energy region and extend widely more than the magnetic excitation spectrum. The d-wave symmetry of bond-charge excitations also has sizable spectral weight along the direction (pi/2, pi/2)-(0, 0)-(pi/2, 0) in a low-energy region and exhibits softening around q approx (0.5 pi, 0), whereas no such softening is present in the other symmetries. These results capture the essential features observed in electron-doped cuprates and may motivate an experimental test of bond-charge excitations around q=(pi, pi) on top of the strong magnetic excitations there as well as additional softening in the d-wave channel in the (pi, pi)-(pi/2, pi/2) region at low temperatures near the magnetic phase. We extend the present analysis to the hole-doped side and highlight a contrast to the electron-doped side, which includes incommensurate correlations, electronic nematic correlations, and spin and bond-charge resonance modes in the superconducting state.</description>

      <title>Discovery of universal phonon thermal Hall effect in crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal Hall effect (THE) in insulator is a remarkable phenomenon that arises from the motion of chargeless quasi-particles under a magnetic field. While magnons or exotic spin excitations were considered as the origin of THE in some magnetic materials, there are more and more evidences suggest that phonons play a significant role. However, the mechanism behind phonon THE is still unknown. Here we report the observation of THE, including planar THE, in a broad range of non-magnetic insulators and semiconductor: SrTiO$_3$, SiO$_2$ (quartz), MgO and Si. While the presence of antiferrodistortive domains in SrTiO$_3$ and chiral phonons in SiO$_2$ may complicate the interpretation of THE, the striking observations of THE in the trivial insulator MgO and high-purity intrinsic semiconductor Si demonstrate that phonon THE is a universal property of crystals. Without other effects on phonons such as from magnons, this universal phonon THE is characterized by a scaling law of |$\kappa_{xy}$| $\sim$ $\kappa_{xx}^2$. Our results experimentally discover a fundamental physics of phonons in magnetic field, which must come from the direct coupling between atom vibrations and the field. Starting from this universal phonon THE in crystals, all previous interpretations of THE in magnetic or non-magnetic materials need to be reconsidered.</description>

      <title>Flat bands and unconventional superconductivity in a simple model of metal-organic frameworks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.10673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The superconducting metal-organic framework Cu-BHT forms a kagome lattice with metals at the vertices and ligands along the bonds. This bipartite motif is common in reticular materials. We show that a tight-binding model on this lattice yields partially occupied interference-induced flat bands at half-filling with large gaps between them and all other bands. Long-range hopping induces curvature in the bands but leaves them flatter and more isolated than those in twisted bilayer graphene. The slave boson theory of the t-J model on this lattice shows highly unconventional superconductivity including an f -wave singlet phase. Thus, framework materials provide an ideal lattice-driven approach to strongly correlated phenomena in flat bands at high electronic densities.</description>

      <title>Electronic correlations and partial gap in the bilayer nickelate La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02950v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity with a critical temperature of about 80~K in La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ single crystals under pressure has received enormous attention. La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ is not superconducting under ambient pressure but exhibits a transition at $T^{\ast} \simeq 115$~K. Understanding the electronic correlations and charge dynamics is an important step towards the origin of superconductivity and other instabilities. Here, our optical study shows that La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ features strong electronic correlations which significantly reduce the electron's kinetic energy and place this system in the proximity of the Mott phase. The low-frequency optical conductivity reveals two Drude components arising from multiple bands at the Fermi level. The transition at $T^{\ast}$ removes the Drude component exhibiting non-Fermi liquid behavior, whereas the one with Fermi-liquid behavior is barely affected. These observations in combination with theoretical results suggest that the Fermi surface dominated by the Ni-$d_{3z^{2}-r^{2}}$ orbital is removed due to the transition at $T^{\ast}$. Our experimental results provide pivotal information for understanding the transition at $T^{\ast}$ and superconductivity in La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$.</description>

      <title>Microscopic study of the impurity effect in the kagome superconductor La(Ru$_{1-x}$Fe$_{x}$)$_{3}$Si$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the effect of magnetic impurities on the microscopic superconducting (SC) properties of the kagome-lattice superconductor La(Ru$_{1-x}$Fe$_{x}$)$_{3}$Si$_{2}$ using muon spin relaxation/rotation. A strong suppression of the superconducting critical temperature $T_{\rm c}$, the SC volume fraction, and the superfluid density was observed. We further find a correlation between the superfluid density and $T_{\rm c}$ which is considered a hallmark feature of unconventional superconductivity. Most remarkably, measurements of the temperature-dependent magnetic penetration depth ${\lambda}$ reveal a change in the low-temperature behavior from exponential saturation to a linear increase, which indicates that Fe doping introduces nodes in the superconducting gap structure at concentrations as low as $x=$~0.015. Our results point to a rare example of unconventional superconductivity in the correlated kagome lattice and accessible tunability of the superconducting gap structure, offering new insights into the microscopic mechanisms involved in superconducting order.</description>

      <title>Unconventional $s$-Wave Pairing with Point-Node-Like Gap Structure in UTe$_2$</title>

Abstract: We explore the pairing state and gap structure of UTe$_2$ using a six-orbital model which we call the $f$-$d$-$p$ model. Our model accurately reproduces the quasi-two-dimensional Fermi surfaces consistent with recent de Haas-van Alphen oscillation measurements and the $(0, \pm \pi, 0)$ antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations observed by neutron scattering. We incorporate on-site Coulomb repulsion for $f$ electrons and solve the linearized Eliashberg equation within the third-order perturbation theory to investigate the superconducting symmetry in UTe$_2$. The most likely state is found to be an $s$-wave state with a highly anisotropic superconducting gap structure that exhibits a point-node-like behavior of the specific heat at low temperatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconductors exhibit a nonlinear interaction with an applied light, which can resonantly excite the collective amplitude (Higgs) mode. Here we study light-induced dynamics of layered superconductors, where each layer is coupled to adjacent layers via the Josephson coupling and the first few layers near the surface are driven by an in-plane-polarized light. We study the system under the assumption that the interlayer Coulomb interactions are sufficiently screened out and that the phase-difference mode becomes available in the low-energy regime. We find that interlayer transport is induced via excitations of the collective amplitude and phase-difference modes, even when the applied electric field is parallel to the planes. We provide analytic calculations as well as numerical simulations of the real-time dynamics, and investigate the influence on the light-induced interlayer Josephson current and intralayer third-harmonic generation.</description>

      <title>Multiband Metallic Ground State in Multilayered Nickelates La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ Probed by $^{139}$La-NMR at Ambient Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a $^{139}$La-NMR study of polycrystalline samples of multi($n$)-layered nickelates, La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ ($n=2$) and La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10-\delta}$ ($n=3$), at ambient pressure. Measurements of the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra and nuclear spin relaxation rate ($1/T_1$) indicate the emergence of a density wave order with a gap below $T^*\sim150$ K for La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ and $\sim130$ K for La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10-\delta}$. The finite value of $1/T_1$ below $T^*$ indicates metallic ground states with the remaining density of states at the Fermi level ($E_{\rm F}$) under the density wave order. These features are attributed to multiple $d$ electron bands with different characteristics. Above $T^*$, the gradual decrease in $1/T_1T$ upon cooling implies the presence of a band with flat dispersion near $E_{\rm F}$. From our microscopic probes, we point out that these nickelates ($n=2$ and $3$) possess similar electronic states despite the difference in the formal valence of the Ni-$d$ electron states, which provides a basis for understanding the novel high-$T_{\rm c}$ superconductivity under high pressures.</description>

      <title>Deconfined quantum criticality of nodal $d$-wave superconductivity, N\'eel order and charge order on the square lattice at half-filling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09502v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a SU(2) lattice gauge theory on the square lattice, with a single fundamental complex fermion and a single fundamental complex boson on each lattice site. Projective symmetries of the gauge-charged fermions are chosen so that they match with those of the spinons of the $\pi$-flux spin liquid. Global symmetries of all gauge-invariant observables are chosen to match with those of the particle-hole symmetric electronic Hubbard model at half-filling. Consequently, both the fundamental fermion and fundamental boson move in an average background $\pi$-flux, their gauge-invariant composite is the physical electron, and eliminating gauge fields in a strong gauge-coupling expansion yields an effective extended Hubbard model for the electrons. The SU(2) gauge theory displays several confining/Higgs phases: a nodal $d$-wave superconductor, and states with N\'eel, valence-bond solid, charge, or staggered current orders. There are also a number of quantum phase transitions between these phases which are very likely described by 2+1 dimensional deconfined conformal gauge theories, and we present large flavor expansions for such theories. These include the phenomenologically attractive case of a transition between an insulator with N\'eel order and a $d$-wave superconductor with gapless Bogoliubov quasiparticles at 4 nodal points in the Brillouin zone.</description>

      <title>Dirac Dispersions and Fermi Surface Nesting in LaCuSb$_{2}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LaCuSb$_{2}$ is a superconductor with a transition temperature of about $T_\text{c} = 0.9$K and is a potential platform where Dirac fermions can be experimentally observed. In this paper, we report systematic high-resolution studies of its electronic structure using the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) technique supported by the DFT calculation. The Fermi surface consists of four branches, of which the two inner ones are more 3-dimensional and the theoretical calculations reproduce well the experiment. We observe several linear dispersions forming Dirac-like structures. The nodal lines are present in the system along ${\text{M}}$-${\text{A}}$ and ${\text{X}}$-${\text{R}}$ and Dirac crossings along ${\text{X}}$-${\text{R}}$ are observed by ARPES. Finally, the nesting between external Fermi surface pockets, which corresponds to charge density wave (CDW) modulation vector is enhanced in LaCuSb$_{2}$ as compared to LaAgSb$_{2}$, while CDW appears in the latter system.</description>
