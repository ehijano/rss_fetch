      <title>The Anderson transition -- a view from Krylov space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Krylov subspace expansion is a workhorse method for sparse numerical methods that has been increasingly explored as source of physical insight into many-body dynamics in recent years. We revisit the venerable Anderson model of localization in dimensions $d=1, 2, 3, 4$ to construct local integrals of motion (LIOM) in Krylov space. These appear as zero eigenvalue edge states of an effective hopping problem in Krylov superoperator subspace, and can be analytically constructed, given the Lanczos coefficients. We exploit this idea, focusing on $d=3$, to study the manifestation of the disorder driven Anderson transition in the anatomy of LIOMs. We find that the increasing complexity of the Krylov operators results in a suppression of the fluctuations of the Lanczos coefficients. As such, one can study the phenomenology of the integrals of motion in the disorder averaged Krylov chain. We find edge states localized on vanishing fraction of Krylov space (of dimension $D_K=V^2$ for cubes of volume $V$), both in localized and extended phases. Importantly, in the localized phase, disorder induces powerlaw decaying dimerization in the (Krylov) hopping problem, producing stretched exponential decay of the LIOMs (in Krylov space) with a stretching exponent $1/2d$. Metallic LIOMs are completely delocalized albeit across only $\propto \sqrt{D_K}$ states). Critical LIOMs exhibit powerlaw decay with an exponent matching the expected fractal exponent.</description>

      <title>Ground State Excitations and Energy Fluctuations in Short-Range Spin Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stability of ground states in the Edwards-Anderson Ising spin glass in dimensions two and higher against perturbations of a single coupling. After reviewing the concepts of critical droplets, flexibilities and metastates, we show that, in any dimension, a certain kind of critical droplet with space-filling (i.e., positive spatial density) boundary does not exist in ground states generated by coupling-independent boundary conditions. Using this we show that if incongruent ground states exist in any dimension, the variance of their energy difference restricted to finite volumes scales proportionally to the volume. This in turn is used to prove that a metastate generated by (e.g.) periodic boundary conditions is unique and supported on a single pair of spin-reversed ground states in two dimensions. We further show that a type of excitation above a ground state, whose interface with the ground state is space-filling and whose energy remains O(1) independent of the volume, as predicted by replica symmetry breaking, cannot exist in any dimension.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Artificial Intelligence (AI) Analysis of Strongly Correlated Electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an exceptionally powerful tool for analyzing scientific data. In particular, attention-based architectures have demonstrated a remarkable capability to capture complex correlations and to furnish interpretable insights into latent, otherwise inconspicuous patterns. This progress motivates the application of AI techniques to the analysis of strongly correlated electrons, which remain notoriously challenging to study using conventional theoretical approaches. Here, we propose novel AI workflows for analyzing snapshot datasets from tensor-network simulations of the two-dimensional (2D) Hubbard model over a broad range of temperature and doping. The 2D Hubbard model is an archetypal strongly correlated system, hosting diverse intriguing phenomena including Mott insulators, anomalous metals, and high-$T_c$ superconductivity. Our AI techniques yield fresh perspectives on the intricate quantum correlations underpinning these phenomena and facilitate universal omnimetry for ultracold-atom simulations of the corresponding strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Neural Network Backflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately describing the ground state of strongly correlated systems is essential for understanding their emergent properties. Neural Network Backflow (NNBF) is a powerful variational ansatz that enhances mean-field wave functions by introducing configuration-dependent modifications to single-particle orbitals. Although NNBF is theoretically universal in the limit of large networks, we find that practical gains saturate with increasing network size. Instead, significant improvements can be achieved by using a multi-determinant ansatz. We explore efficient ways to generate these multi-determinant expansions without increasing the number of variational parameters. In particular, we study single-step Lanczos and symmetry projection techniques, benchmarking their performance against diffusion Monte Carlo and NNBF applied to alternative mean fields. Benchmarking on a doped periodic square Hubbard model near optimal doping, we find that a Lanczos step, diffusion Monte Carlo, and projection onto a symmetry sector all give similar improvements achieving state-of-the-art energies at minimal cost. By further optimizing the projected symmetrized states directly, we gain significantly in energy. Using this technique we report the lowest variational energies for this Hamiltonian on $4\times 16$ and $4 \times 8$ lattices as well as accurate variance extrapolated energies. We also show the evolution of spin, charge, and pair correlation functions as the quality of the variational ansatz improves.</description>

      <title>Learning phases with Quantum Monte Carlo simulation cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23098v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the use of the ``spin-opstring", derived from Stochastic Series Expansion Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations as machine learning (ML) input data. It offers a compact, memory-efficient representation of QMC simulation cells, combining the initial state with an operator string that encodes the state's evolution through imaginary time. Using supervised ML, we demonstrate the input's effectiveness in capturing both conventional and topological phase transitions, and in a regression task to predict non-local observables. We also demonstrate the capability of spin-opstring data in transfer learning by training models on one quantum system and successfully predicting on another, as well as showing that models trained on smaller system sizes generalize well to larger ones. Importantly, we illustrate a clear advantage of spin-opstring over conventional spin configurations in the accurate prediction of a quantum phase transition. Finally, we show how the inherent structure of spin-opstring provides an elegant framework for the interpretability of ML predictions. Using two state-of-the-art interpretability techniques, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation and SHapley Additive exPlanations, we show that the ML models learn and rely on physically meaningful features from the input data. Together, these findings establish the spin-opstring as a broadly-applicable and interpretable input format for ML in quantum many-body physics.</description>
