      <title>Nonlinear Dynamics of Kink Configurations: From Small to Large Kink Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores the scattering dynamics of kinks within a nonlinear system governed by a parameterized potential $U_\lambda(\chi)$, examining the distinct behaviors of small and large kinks across a range of $\lambda$ values and initial velocities. For small kinks, we investigate the critical velocity for separation, the influence of vibrational modes, resonance phenomena, and the conditions under which large kinks emerge from collisions. Our findings reveal that the critical velocity exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the parameter $\lambda$, reflecting the evolving stability of small kinks, while the decreasing frequency of vibrational modes with increasing $\lambda$ diminishes resonance effects, leading to simpler scattering dynamics at higher $\lambda$. The formation of large kinks from small kink collisions is favored at lower $\lambda$, where the mass difference between small and large kinks is reduced. Conversely, large kink scattering consistently results in the production of small kinks, with the number of small kink pairs growing as both $\lambda$ and initial velocity increase, a process driven by energy transfer from the translational modes of large kinks to the potential energy required for small kink creation. The absence of vibrational modes in large kinks contrasts with their presence in small kinks, where such modes give rise to complex phenomena like bion formation and resonance. These results underscore the pivotal role of $\lambda$ in shaping kink interactions and offer valuable insights into the dynamics of topological defects in nonlinear systems, with potential implications for understanding similar phenomena in condensed matter physics and related fields.</description>

      <title>Phase domain walls in coherently driven Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09553v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider coherent states of weakly interacting bosons under the conditions of external resonant excitation, with a focus on a two-dimensional polariton fluid driven by a plane electromagnetic wave near the ground state. The coherent driving breaks the U(1) symmetry explicitly, which prevents the occurrence of quantum vortices in a uniform scalar condensate. Surprisingly, a spinor (two-component) system of the same kind admits topological excitations, such as domain walls of relative phase or confined half-vortex molecules, typical of a freely evolving spinor Bose system. Opposite-phase domains arise from the spontaneous breakdown of the spin symmetry $(\mathbb{Z}_2)$. Domain walls form with time even when the initial state of the system is uniform or completely disordered; they fall into different topological types distinguished by the total phase variation in the transverse direction. One type of domain walls is similar to ``magnetic'' solitons in Bose-Einstein condensates and exhibits nonzero spin polarization whose sign depends on the direction of motion. Domain walls of the second type, by contrast, behave like monopoles with broken spatiotemporal symmetry and tend to move in certain preferred directions. The interaction of vortices and domain walls results in a long-range ordering of the system.</description>

      <title>Painleve solitons of AKNS system and irrational algebraic solitons of NLS equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel symmetry decomposition approach is introduced to derive the so-called ``Painlev\'e solitons'' of the Ablowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur (AKNS) system. These Painlev\'e solitons propagate against a background governed by a Painlev\'e transcendent, establishing a fundamental generalization of the well-known elliptic solitons concept. We demonstrate that while elliptic solitons arise from the combination of translation invariance and square eigenfunction symmetry, a \textit{different} symmetry combination-scaling invariance, Galilean invariance, and square eigenfunction symmetry-generates ``Painlev\'e IV solitons'' for the AKNS system. This discovery represents a significant theoretical advance in integrable systems theory. By selecting special solutions of the Painlev\'e IV equation, we obtain explicit forms of several previously unknown classes of solutions for the AKNS system and the nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) equation: irrational algebraic solitons, rational algebraic solitons, and parabolic cylindrical function solitons. These results dramatically expand the known solution landscape of one of the most important integrable models in mathematical physics, with broad implications for nonlinear wave phenomena across multiple physical disciplines including optics, Bose-Einstein condensates, and fluid dynamics.</description>
