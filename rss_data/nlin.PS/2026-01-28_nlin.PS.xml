      <title>Collective coordinate descriptions of a kink in a driven-damped $\phi^4$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extending a recent effective theory formulation for the dynamics of kinks in the sine-Gordon model [1], we propose an analogous effective description of $\phi^4$ kinks. Three different reduced models based on the kink position, width and internal mode amplitude are introduced and compared systematically with the numerical solution of the equation with space- and time-dependent perturbations. In all cases considered, the model based on the kink position and width agrees the best with the full numerical solution. As long as the external driving frequency of the perturbation remains moderate, it captures with remarkable accuracy the intricate dynamical processes taking place in the system.</description>

      <title>Stroboscopic motion reversals in delay-coupled neural fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual illusions provide a window into the mechanisms underlying visual processing, and dynamical neural circuit models offer a natural framework for proposing and testing theories of their emergence. We propose and analyze a delay-coupled neural field model that explains stroboscopic percepts arising from the subsampling of a moving, often rotating, stimulus, such as the wagon-wheel illusion. Motivated by the role of activity propagation delays in shaping visual percepts, we study neural fields with both uniform and spatially dependent delays, representing the finite time required for signals to travel along axonal projections. Each module is organized as a ring of neurons encoding angular preference, with instantaneous local coupling and delayed long-range coupling strongest between neurons with similar preference. We show that delays generate a family of coexisting traveling bump solutions with distinct, quantized propagation speeds. Using interface-based asymptotic methods, we reduce the neural field dynamics to a low-dimensional system of coupled delay differential equations, enabling a detailed analysis of speed selection, stability, entrainment, and state transitions. Regularly pulsed inputs induce transitions between distinct speed states, including motion opposite to the forcing direction, capturing key features of visual aliasing and stroboscopic motion reversal. These results demonstrate how delayed neural interactions organize perception into discrete dynamical states and provide a mechanistic explanation for stroboscopic visual illusions.</description>

      <title>Pulse-train propagation in nonlinear Kerr media governed by higher-order dispersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discover three novel classes of pulse-train waveforms in an optical Kerr nonlinear medium
  possessing all orders of dispersion up to the fourth order. We show that both single- and double humped pulse-trains can be formed in the nonlinear medium. A distinguishing property is that these
  structures have different amplitudes, widths and wavenumbers but equal velocity which depends on
  the three dispersion parameters. More importantly, we find that the relation between the amplitude
  and duration of all the newly obtained pulse-trains is determined by the sign of a joint parameter
  solely. The results show that those optical waves are general, in the sense that no specified conditions
  on the material parameters are assumed. Considering the long-wave limit, the derived pulse-trains
  degenerate to soliton pulses of the quartic and dipole kinds.</description>
