      <title>Spinning Twisted Ribbons: When Two Holes Meet on a Curved Liquid Film</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rupture of a liquid film, where a thin liquid layer between two other fluids breaks and forms holes, commonly occurs in both natural phenomena and industrial applications. The post-rupture dynamics, from initial hole formation to the complete collapse of the film, are crucial because they govern droplet formation, which plays a significant role in many applications such as disease transmission, aerosol formation, spray drying nanodrugs, oil spill remediation, inkjet printing, and spray coating. While single-hole rupture has been extensively studied, the dynamics of multiple-hole ruptures, especially the interactions between neighboring holes, are less well understood. Here, this study reveals that when two holes 'meet' on a curved film, the film evolves into a spinning twisted ribbon before breaking into droplets, distinctly different from what occurs on flat films. We explain the formation and evolution of the spinning twisted ribbon, including its geometry, corrugations, ligaments, and orbits, and compare the experimental observations with models. We compare and contrast this phenomena with its counterpart on planar films. While our experiments are based on the multiple-hole ruptures in corona splash, the underlying principles are likely applicable to other systems. This study sheds light on understanding and controlling droplet formation in multiple-hole rupture, improving public health, climate science, and various industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Refinements of the Smagorinsky Model for Turbulence Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a rigorous theoretical extension of the Smagorinsky model for turbulence simulations. The author builds on its fundamental framework, addressing known limitations, and making new mathematical advances. Specifically, this work introduces new theorems on the existence and uniqueness of weak solutions and establishes the stability of the model under small perturbations. The approach leverages advanced tools in functional analysis, particularly Sobolev and Banach spaces, increasing the theoretical robustness of the model. Each theorem is accompanied by detailed proofs employing variational techniques and energy estimations. Furthermore, the author proposes a variational formulation that demonstrates improvements in the mathematical behavior of the model's subgrid-scale stress representation. This work aims to provide a deeper understanding of the Smagorinsky model, setting the stage for further theoretical and computational developments. The obtained results are expected to impact turbulence modeling by offering a more robust theoretical basis for Large Eddy Simulations (LES).</description>

      <title>Constructing the body source for high-order lattice Boltzmann method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel strategy for constructing body source terms in the high-order lattice Boltzmann method (LBM), designed to efficiently introduce various physical phenomena by modifying the non-equilibrium distribution function. The source term, expressed as a Hermite polynomial, provides a flexible framework for simulating complex fluid flows. Three typical source terms are given: a body force source for gravity-driven flows, a thermal dissipation source for controlling the Prandtl number, and a pressure tensor source for modeling multiphase flows. Chapman-Enskog analysis confirms that the source terms recover the expected macroscopic equations. Notably, the proposed strategy eliminates the need for explicit construction of the collision operator, a challenge in conventional approaches for handling diverse physical scenarios. Furthermore, the method is compatible with the traditional BGK model, ensuring its applicability to various high-order lattices. The model's accuracy and versatility are validated through a series of benchmark tests, showing excellent agreement with existing literature results.</description>

      <title>Experimental study of fish-like bodies with passive tail and tunable stiffness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scombrid fishes and tuna are efficient swimmers capable of maximizing performance to escape predators and save energy during long journeys. A key aspect in achieving these goals is the flexibility of the tail, which the fish optimizes during swimming. Though, the robotic counterparts, although highly efficient, have partially investigated the importance of flexibility. We have designed and tested a fish-like robotic platform (of 30 cm in length) to quantify performance with a tail made flexible through a torsional spring placed at the peduncle. Body kinematics, forces, and power have been measured and compared with real fish. The platform can vary its frequency between 1 and 3 Hz, reaching self-propulsion conditions with speed over 1 BL/s and Strouhal number in the optimal range. We show that changing the frequency of the robot can influence the thrust and power achieved by the fish-like robot. Furthermore, by using appropriately tuned stiffness, the robot deforms in accordance with the travelling wave mechanism, which has been revealed to be the actual motion of real fish. These findings demonstrate the potential of tuning the stiffness in fish swimming and offer a basis for investigating fish-like flexibility in bio-inspired underwater vehicles.</description>

      <title>A consistent treatment of dynamic contact angles in the sharp-interface framework with the generalized Navier boundary condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we revisit the Generalized Navier Boundary condition (GNBC) introduced by Qian et al. in the sharp interface Volume-of-Fluid context. We replace the singular uncompensated Young stress by a smooth function with a characteristic width $\varepsilon$ that is understood as a physical parameter of the model. Therefore, we call the model the ``Contact Region GNBC'' (CR-GNBC). We show that the model is consistent with the fundamental kinematics of the contact angle transport described by Fricke, K\"ohne and Bothe. We implement the model in the geometrical Volume-of-Fluid solver Basilisk using a ``free angle'' approach. This means that the dynamic contact angle is not prescribed but reconstructed from the interface geometry and subsequently applied as an input parameter to compute the uncompensated Young stress. We couple this approach to the two-phase Navier Stokes solver and study the withdrawing tape problem with a receding contact line. It is shown that the model is grid-independent and leads to a full regularization of the singularity at the moving contact line. In particular, it is shown that the curvature at the moving contact line is finite and mesh converging. As predicted by the fundamental kinematics, the parallel shear stress component vanishes at the moving contact line for quasi-stationary states (i.e. for $\dot{\theta}_d=0$) and the dynamic contact angle is determined by a balance between the uncompensated Young stress and an effective contact line friction. Furthermore, a non-linear generalization of the model is proposed, which aims at reproducing the Molecular Kinetic Theory of Blake and Haynes for quasi-stationary states.</description>

      <title>The initial acceleration of a buoyant spherical bubble revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An analytical derivation of the buoyancy-induced initial acceleration of a spherical gas bubble in a host liquid is presented. The theory makes no assumptions further than applying the two-phase incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, showing that neither the classical approach using potential theory nor other simplifying assumptions needed. The result for the initial bubble acceleration as a function of the gas and liquid densities, classically built on potential theory, is retained. The result is reproduced by detailed numerical simulations. The accelerated, although stagnant state of the bubble induces a pressure distribution on the bubble surface which is different from the result related to the Archimedian principle, emphasizing the importance of the non-equilibrium state for the force acting on the bubble.</description>

      <title>Collective Behavior of Clusters of Free-to-Move Cylinders in the Wake of a Fixed Cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the collective behavior of clusters of cylinders placed in the wake of a fixed cylinder and free to move in a direction perpendicular to that of the incoming flow, with no structural damping or stiffness. We keep the Reynolds number, defined based on the cylinder diameter, at 100 and consider five different configurations for the initial positions of the cluster cylinders: linear, rectangular, V-shaped, triangular, and circular. In each configuration, we consider progressively increasing number of cylinders in the cluster. We show that overall, the cylinders tend to form final linear configurations, in which, after their transition, the cylinders form one or more lines. Some free-to-move cylinders might take the lead position in some of these linear formations depending on the initial configuration. These steady-state positions are achieved when the mean value of lift that acts on the cylinders becomes negligible. As a byproduct of these reconfigurations, the overall drag force that acts on the collection of cylinders reduces at their final steady-state locations in comparison with their original configurations. The complicated wakes that are observed in the fixed counterparts of these configurations are replaced by a series of vortex rows in the wake of separate lines of cylinders. Reducing the mass ratio allows the cylinders to oscillate about their mean displacement paths, but their transient paths and their final steady-state positions are not affected significantly by the decrease in the mass ratio.</description>

      <title>Diffusivity-Free Turbulence in Tabletop Rotating Rayleigh-B\'enard Convection Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convection in planets and stars is predicted to occur in the "ultimate regime'' of diffusivity-free, rapidly rotating turbulence, in which flows are characteristically unaffected by viscous and thermal diffusion. Boundary layer diffusion, however, has historically hindered experimental study of this regime. Here, we utilize the boundary-independent oscillatory thermal-inertial mode of rotating convection to realize the diffusivity-free scaling in liquid metal laboratory experiments. This oscillatory style of convection arises in rotating liquid metals (low Prandtl number fluids) and is driven by the temperature gradient in the fluid bulk, thus remaining independent of diffusive boundary dynamics. We triply verify the existence of the diffusivity-free regime via measurements of heat transfer efficiency $Nu$, dimensionless flow velocities $Re$, and internal temperature anomalies $\theta$, all of which are in quantitative agreement with planar asymptotically-reduced models. Achieving the theoretical diffusivity-free scalings in desktop-sized laboratory experiments provides the validation necessary to extrapolate and predict the convective flows in remote geophysical and astrophysical systems.</description>

      <title>Coupled Integral PINN for conservation law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) is an innovative approach to solve a diverse array of partial differential equations (PDEs) leveraging the power of neural networks. This is achieved by minimizing the residual loss associated with the explicit physical information, usually coupled with data derived from initial and boundary conditions. However, a challenge arises in the context of nonlinear conservation laws where derivatives are undefined at shocks, leading to solutions that deviate from the true physical phenomena. To solve this issue, the physical solution must be extracted from the weak formulation of the PDE and is typically further bounded by entropy conditions. Within the numerical framework, finite volume methods (FVM) are employed to address conservation laws. These methods resolve the integral form of conservation laws and delineate the shock characteristics. Inspired by the principles underlying FVM, this paper introduces a novel Coupled Integrated PINN methodology that involves fitting the integral solutions of equations using additional neural networks. This technique not only augments the conventional PINN's capability in modeling shock waves, but also eliminates the need for spatial and temporal discretization. As such, it bypasses the complexities of numerical integration and reconstruction associated with non-convex fluxes. Finally, we show that the proposed new Integrated PINN performs well in conservative law and outperforms the vanilla PINN when tackle the challenging shock problems using examples of Burger's equation, Buckley-Leverett Equation and Euler System.</description>

      <title>Modeling Multivariable High-resolution 3D Urban Microclimate Using Localized Fourier Neural Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate urban microclimate analysis with wind velocity and temperature is vital for energy-efficient urban planning, supporting carbon reduction, enhancing public health and comfort, and advancing the low-altitude economy. However, traditional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations that couple velocity and temperature are computationally expensive. Recent machine learning advancements offer promising alternatives for accelerating urban microclimate simulations. The Fourier neural operator (FNO) has shown efficiency and accuracy in predicting single-variable velocity magnitudes in urban wind fields. Yet, for multivariable high-resolution 3D urban microclimate prediction, FNO faces three key limitations: blurry output quality, high GPU memory demand, and substantial data requirements. To address these issues, we propose a novel localized Fourier neural operator (Local-FNO) model that employs local training, geometry encoding, and patch overlapping. Local-FNO provides accurate predictions for rapidly changing turbulence in urban microclimate over 60 seconds, four times the average turbulence integral time scale, with an average error of 0.35 m/s in velocity and 0.30 {\deg}C in temperature. It also accurately captures turbulent heat flux represented by the velocity-temperature correlation. In a 2 km by 2 km domain, Local-FNO resolves turbulence patterns down to a 10 m resolution. It provides high-resolution predictions with 150 million feature dimensions on a single 32 GB GPU at nearly 50 times the speed of a CFD solver. Compared to FNO, Local-FNO achieves a 23.9% reduction in prediction error and a 47.3% improvement in turbulent fluctuation correlation.</description>

      <title>Fake it till you make it: using artificial turbulence to achieve swift converged turbulence statistics in a pressure-driven channel flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we introduced a simple yet innovative method to trigger turbulence in a channel flow to achieve statistically stationary flow conditions. We compare this new method based on synthetically generated three-dimensional turbulence with two other well-established methods, namely, linear profile superposed with random noise and descending counter-rotating vortices and log-law profile superposed with random noise and descending counter-rotating vortices. We found that synthetically generated three-dimensional turbulence provides a computationally cheap and effective way to reduce simulation spin-up to achieve statistically stationary flow conditions when a precursor turbulent initial condition is not available. At a one-time cost of less than 1 CPU hour to generate the synthetic turbulent initial condition, the flow becomes statistically stationary within 3 eddy turnovers for all the parameters of interest in wall-bounded pressure-driven channel flow simulations when compared to other alternatives that can take more than 10 eddy turnovers resulting in substantial savings in the computational cost.</description>

      <title>Dynamical regimes of thermally convective emulsions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emulsions are paramount in various interdisciplinary topical areas, yet a satisfactory understanding of their behavior in buoyancy-driven thermal flows has not been established. In the present work, we unravel the dynamical regimes of thermal convection in emulsions by leveraging a large set of mesoscale numerical simulations. Emulsions are prepared with a given volume fraction of the initially dispersed phase, $\phi$, ranging from dilute (low values of $\phi$) to jammed emulsions (high values of $\phi$), resulting in different rheological responses, i.e., from Newtonian to non-Newtonian yield-stress behaviors, respectively. We then characterize the dynamics of the emulsions in the paradigmatic setup of the Rayleigh-B\'enard convection, i.e., when confined between two parallel walls at different temperatures under the effect of buoyancy forces, the latter encoded in the dimensionless Rayleigh number Ra. We thoroughly investigated the emulsion dynamics in changing $\phi$ and Ra. For a given $\phi$, at increasing Ra, we observe that the emulsion exhibits convection states, where structural changes may appear (i.e., droplet breakup, coalescence, or phase-inversion), which inevitably impact the emulsion rheology. For sufficiently high values of Ra, two states of convection are observed: for low/moderate values of $\phi$ (Newtonian emulsions), we observe breakup-dominated dynamics, whereas for high values of $\phi$ (non-Newtonian emulsions), we observe phase-inverted states. For both scenarios, the droplet size distribution depends on Ra, and scaling laws for the average droplet size are analyzed and quantified. Our results offer unprecedented insights into the rich dynamics of emulsions under thermal convection, offering the first detailed characterization of the various dynamic regimes to be expected and their relation with structural changes occurring in such complex fluids.</description>

      <title>Generalized Treatment of Energy Accommodation in Gas-Surface Interactions for Satellite Aerodynamics Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of satellite aerodynamics in the Very-Low-Earth-Orbit (VLEO) regime, accurate modeling of gas-surface interactions (GSI) is crucial for determining aerodynamic forces and torques. Common models such as Sentman's assume that gas particles are reflected diffusely from a surface, which leads to the incorporation of energy accommodation into the model. This technical note discusses the limitations of existing approaches for handling energy accommodation and provides a generalized treatment thereof that is valid for any molecular speed ratio. A new general expression for the temperature ratio of reflected to impinging particles is derived, which, when used in a GSI model, retains its validity even in hypothermal flows. Additionally, a simplified hyperthermal approximation is presented, proven to be an asymptote of the general expression, and shown to be an improvement upon existing approximations by comparison for a realistic VLEO scenario. The results contribute to a better understanding and modeling of GSI, potentially benefiting scientific investigations and operational applications in satellite aerodynamics.</description>

      <title>A new paradigm for wall-modeled large eddy simulations using the volume-filtering framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, we apply the framework of volume-filtering for particle-laden flows, to large eddy simulations (LES) of wall-bounded flows leading to a new perspective on wall-modeled LES (WMLES) that we refer to as volume-filtered WMLES (VF-WMLES). In contrast to existing wall-models, the VF-WMLES framework does not rely on temporal averaging, does not make a priori assumptions on the pressure gradient, and can be used with a uniform spatial filter, which avoids the appearance of commutation closures in spatial derivatives of the filtered momentum and continuity equation. Volume-filtering is well-defined, even close to the wall, and it is shown that a non-zero slip and penetration velocity at the wall is a direct consequence of volume-filtering the flow. With the VF-WMLES concept, new wall models can be directly assessed in a priori and a posteriori studies by comparing the predicted slip and penetration velocities at the wall with the velocities from explicitly volume-filtered direct numerical simulations (DNS). Based on the VF-WMLES concept, we derive an LES modeling strategy that is based on the recently proposed PC-IBM, a modeling framework based on volume-filtering allowing to couple the flow with arbitrarily shaped solid boundaries using relatively coarse Cartesian fluid meshes. The proposed VF-WMLES is validated with two cases, a turbulent channel flow and a turbulent flow over periodic hills, and shown to accurately predict the mean velocity profiles for both cases.</description>

      <title>Using LSTM Predictions for RANS Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study constitutes the second phase of a research endeavor aimed at evaluating the feasibility of employing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks as a replacement for Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) turbulence models.
  In the initial phase of this investigation (titled Modeling Turbulent Flows with LSTM Neural Networks, arXiv:2307.13784v1 [physics.flu-dyn] 25 Jul 2023), the application of an LSTM-based recurrent neural network (RNN) as an alternative to traditional RANS models was demonstrated. LSTM models were used to predict shear Reynolds stresses in both developed and developing turbulent channel flows, and these predictions were propagated through RANS simulations to obtain mean flow fields of turbulent flows. A comparative analysis was conducted, juxtaposing the LSTM results from computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations with outcomes from the $\kappa-\epsilon$ model and data from direct numerical simulations (DNS). These initial findings indicated promising performance of the LSTM approach.
  This second phase delves further into the challenges encountered and presents robust solutions. Additionally, new results are provided, demonstrating the efficacy of the LSTM model in predicting turbulent behavior in perturbed flows. While the overall study serves as a proof-of-concept for the application of LSTM networks in RANS turbulence modeling, this phase offers compelling evidence of its potential in handling more complex flow scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Component, Multi-Physics Computational Model for Solving Coupled Cardiac Electromechanics and Vascular Haemodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The circulatory system, comprising the heart and blood vessels, is vital for nutrient transport, waste removal, and homeostasis. Traditional computational models often isolate individual biophysical processes, such as cardiac electromechanics and blood flow dynamics, failing to capture the system's integrated nature. This paper presents an innovative approach that couples a 3D electromechanical model of the heart with a 3D fluid mechanics model of vascular blood flow. Our file-based partitioned coupling scheme allows these models to run independently while sharing essential data through intermediate files. We validate this approach using two solvers: one for cardiac electromechanics and the other for vascular blood flow. Developed by separate research groups, these solvers emphasise different dynamical scales and utilise distinct discretisation schemes. Numerical simulations using idealised and realistic anatomies show that the implemented coupling scheme is reliable and requires minimal additional computation time relative to advancing individual time steps in the heart and blood flow models. Notably, the coupled model predicts muscle displacement differently than the standalone heart model, highlighting the influence of detailed vascular blood flow on cardiac function. This study presents a paradigm case of how to build virtual human models and digital twins by productive collaboration between teams with complementary expertise.</description>

      <title>Drag reduction during the side-by-side motion of a pair of intruders in a granular medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When several intruders move in a granular medium, coupling effects are observed, the motion of one intruder affecting that of others. In this paper, we investigate experimentally how the drag forces acting on a pair of spherical intruders moving amid grains at constant velocity vary with the transverse separation between them and their depth. When intruders are sufficiently far apart, they do not influence each other, and the average drag felt by each of them matches that of a single intruder. However, for small distances between intruders and at a given depth, the average drag per intruder decreases, highlighting a collaborative effect that facilitates motion. This collaboration effect is amplified when the depth of the intruders increases. We propose a model for the drag reduction of a pair of intruders based on the breakup of contact chains, caused by the perturbation generated by the neighbor intruder. Our findings provide new insights into the interaction effects on the motion of solids in sand, such as those observed in animal locomotion, root growth, and soil survey.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a combined experimental and theoretical investigation of the formation and decay kinetics of vortices in two dimensional, compressible quantum turbulence. We follow the temporal evolution of a quantum fluid of exciton polaritons, hybrid light matter quasiparticles, and measure both phase and modulus of the order parameter in the turbulent regime. Fundamental topological conservation laws require that the formation and annihilation of vortices also involve critical points of the velocity field, namely nodes and saddles. Identifying the simplest mechanisms underlying these processes enables us to develop an effective kinetic model that closely aligns with the experimental observations, and shows that different processes are responsible for vortex number growth and decay. These findings underscore the crucial role played by topological constraints in shaping nonlinear, turbulent evolution of two dimensional quantum fluids.</description>

      <title>An introduction to relativistic spin hydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin polarization and spin transport are common phenomena in many quantum systems. Relativistic spin hydrodynamics provides an effective low-energy framework to describe these processes in quantum many-body systems. The fundamental symmetry underlying relativistic spin hydrodynamics is angular momentum conservation, which naturally leads to inter-conversion between spin and orbital angular momenta. This inter-conversion is a key feature of relativistic spin hydrodynamics, closely related to entropy production and introducing ambiguity in the construction of constitutive relations. In this article, we present a pedagogical introduction to relativistic spin hydrodynamics. We demonstrate how to derive the constitutive relations by applying local thermodynamic laws and explore several distinctive aspects of spin hydrodynamics. These include the pseudo-gauge ambiguity, the behavior of the system in the presence of strong vorticity, and the challenges of modeling the freeze-out of spin in heavy-ion collisions. We also outline some future prospects for spin hydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Large-Scale Turbulent Pressure Fluctuations Revealed by Ned Kahn's Artwork</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13806v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of pendulum chains immersed in turbulent boundary layers. We combine laboratory experiments and video analysis of the kinetic facade exhibits by the artist Ned Kahn, composed of large-scale clusters of centimeter-sized plates oscillating freely in the wind. At the laboratory scale, we show that a one-dimensional pendulum chain immersed in a wind tunnel exhibits a wave dispersion relation derived from a Sine-Gordon equation. Under the wind action, the dynamical response is either dominated by a resonance phenomenon, or a linear response to pressure fluctuations. From amateur video analysis on large-scale kinetic facades, we show that the plate oscillation is driven by the same resonant response mechanisms and the apparent wavy pattern corresponds to the most energetic Fourier mode propagating at the advection speed of pressure fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Investigating a single-domain approach for modeling coupled porous solid-fluid systems: applications in buoyant reacting plume formation and ignition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many natural and industrial processes involve mixed porous-solid fluid domains where multiple physics of reactions, heat transfer, and fluid flow interact over disparate length scales, such as the combustion of multi-species solid fuels. This range of problems covers small-scale fuel burning to large-scale forest fires when plant canopies can be modeled as porous media. Although many modeling studies so far have concentrated on detailed physics within the single fluid or porous phase, few consider both phases, in part due to the challenge in determining suitable boundary conditions between the regions, particularly in turbulent flows where eddies might penetrate the porous region. In this work, we develop a single-domain approach that eliminates the need for boundary conditions at the interface, and numerically study scenarios involving porous-solids and a surrounding fluid. Similar to the methods used in large eddy simulation, the flow is averaged over a small spatial volume--but over the entire domain. We focus on the ignition and related interfacial phenomena, a problem that has rarely been studied in detail from a modeling standpoint. After verifying and validating the model, we examine the emission of buoyant reacting plumes from the surface of a heated solid and the near-field flow dynamics. We observed indications of flow instabilities similar to those seen in Rayleigh-Taylor and Kelvin-Helmholtz phenomena. Our analysis highlighted that the inflectional velocity profile close to the interface triggers the generation of vorticity due to viscous torque, linked with Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. Gravitational and baroclinic torques play key roles in vortex growth in the surrounding fluid region. These flow characteristics could significantly influence the mixing of oxidizer and fuel, ignition processes, and fire propagation.</description>

      <title>Transient growth of a wake vortex and its initiation via inertial particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transient dynamics of a wake vortex, modelled as a strong swirling $q$-vortex, are investigated with a focus on optimal transient growth driven by continuous eigenmodes associated with continuous spectra. The pivotal contribution of viscous critical-layer eigenmodes (Lee &amp; Marcus, J. Fluid Mech., vol. 967) amongst the entire eigenmode families to optimal perturbations is numerically confirmed, utilising a spectral collocation method for a radially unbounded domain that ensures correct analyticity and far-field behaviour. The consistency of the numerical method across different sensitivity tests supports the reliability of the results and provides flexibility for tuning. Both axisymmetric and helical perturbations with axial wavenumbers of order unity or less are examined through linearised theory and non-linear simulations, yielding results that align with existing literature on energy growth curves and optimal perturbation structures. The initiation process of transient growth is also explored, highlighting its practical relevance. Inspired by ice crystals in contrails, the backward influence of inertial particles on the vortex flow, particularly through particle drag, is emphasised. In the pursuit of optimal transient growth, particles are initially distributed at the periphery of the vortex core to disturb the flow. Two-way coupled vortex-particle simulations reveal clear evidence of optimal transient growth during ongoing vortex-particle interactions, reinforcing the robustness and significance of transient growth in the original non-linear vortex system over finite time periods.</description>

      <title>A meshless and binless approach to compute statistics in 3D Ensemble PTV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a method to obtain superresolution of turbulent statistics for three-dimensional ensemble particle tracking velocimetry (EPTV). The method is ''meshless'' because it does not require the definition of a grid for computing derivatives, and it is ''binless'' because it does not require the definition of bins to compute local statistics. The method combines the constrained radial basis function (RBF) formalism introduced Sperotto et al. (Meas Sci Technol, 33:094005, 2022) with a kernel estimate approach for the ensemble averaging of the RBF regressions. The computational cost for the RBF regression is alleviated using the partition of unity method (PUM). Three test cases are considered: (1) a 1D illustrative problem on a Gaussian process, (2) a 3D synthetic test case reproducing a 3D jet-like flow, and (3) an experimental dataset collected for an underwater jet flow at $\text{Re} = 6750$ using a four-camera 3D PTV system. For each test case, the method performances are compared to traditional binning approaches such as Gaussian weighting (Ag\"u\'i and Jim\'enez, JFM, 185:447-468, 1987), local polynomial fitting (Ag\"uera et al, Meas Sci Technol, 27:124011, 2016), as well as a binned version of the RBF statistics.</description>

      <title>Friction and heat transfer in forced air convection with variable physical properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10473v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a theoretical framework for predicting friction and heat transfer coefficients in variable-properties forced air convection. Drawing from concepts in high-speed wall turbulence, which also involves significant temperature, viscosity, and density variations, we utilize the mean momentum balance and mean thermal balance equations to develop integral transformations that account for the impact of variable fluid properties. These transformations are then applied inversely to predict the friction and heat transfer coefficients, leveraging the universality of passive scalars transport theory. Our proposed approach is validated using a comprehensive dataset from direct numerical simulations, covering both heating and cooling conditions up to a friction Reynolds number of approximately $\Rey_\tau\approx 3200$. The predicted friction and heat transfer coefficients closely match DNS data with an accuracy margin of 1-2\%, representing a significant improvement over the current state of the art.</description>

      <title>Bayesian inverse Navier-Stokes problems: joint flow field reconstruction and parameter learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate and solve a Bayesian inverse Navier-Stokes (N-S) problem that assimilates velocimetry data in order to jointly reconstruct a 3D flow field and learn the unknown N-S parameters, including the boundary position. By hardwiring a generalised N-S problem, and regularising its unknown parameters using Gaussian prior distributions, we learn the most likely parameters in a collapsed search space. The most likely flow field reconstruction is then the N-S solution that corresponds to the learned parameters. We develop the method in the variational setting and use a stabilised Nitsche weak form of the N-S problem that permits the control of all N-S parameters. To regularise the inferred the geometry, we use a viscous signed distance field (vSDF) as an auxiliary variable, which is given as the solution of a viscous Eikonal boundary value problem. We devise an algorithm that solves this inverse problem, and numerically implement it using an adjoint-consistent stabilised cut-cell finite element method. We then use this method to reconstruct magnetic resonance velocimetry (flow-MRI) data of a 3D steady laminar flow through a physical model of an aortic arch for two different Reynolds numbers and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels (low/high). We find that the method can accurately i) reconstruct the low SNR data by filtering out the noise/artefacts and recovering flow features that are obscured by noise, and ii) reproduce the high SNR data without overfitting. Although the framework that we develop applies to 3D steady laminar flows in complex geometries, it readily extends to time-dependent laminar and Reynolds-averaged turbulent flows, as well as non-Newtonian (e.g. viscoelastic) fluids.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents fiber bundle topology optimization for mass and heat transfer in surface and volume flow in the laminar region, to optimize the matching between the pattern of a surface structure and the implicit 2-manifold on which the pattern is defined. The fiber bundle concept is used to describe the pattern of the surface structure together with the implicit 2-manifold as an ensemble defined on the preset base manifold. Topology optimization of the surface structure for mass and heat transfer in the surface and volume flow is then implemented on the variable curved surface expressed as the implicit 2-manifold, which is defined on the preset base manifold by using a differentiable homeomorphism. For both of the surface and volume flow, two sets of design variables are defined for the pattern of the surface structure and the implicit 2-manifold. The fiber bundle topology optimization problems are analyzed by using the continuous adjoint method to derive the gradient information of the design objectives and constraints, and then solved by using the gradient based iterative procedures. In the numerical results, the effects of variable amplitude of the implicit 2-manifold, Reynolds number, P\'{e}clet number, and pressure drop or dissipation power of the fluid flow are investigated to demonstrate the extended design freedom and design space of fiber bundle topology optimization for mass and heat transfer in the surface and volume flow.</description>

      <title>Sixth-order parabolic equation on an interval: Eigenfunction expansion, Green's function, and intermediate asymptotics for a finite thin film with elastic resistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A linear sixth-order partial differential equation (PDE) of ``parabolic'' type describes the dynamics of thin liquid films beneath surfaces with elastic bending resistance when deflections from the equilibrium film height are small. On a finite domain, the associated sixth-order eigenvalue problem is self-adjoint for the boundary conditions corresponding to a thin film in a closed trough, and the eigenfunctions form a complete orthonormal set. Using these eigenfunctions, we derive the Green's function for the governing sixth-order PDE on a finite interval and compare it to the known infinite-line solution. Further, we propose a Galerkin spectral method based on the constructed sixth-order eigenfunctions and their derivative expansions. The system of ordinary differential equations for the time-dependent expansion coefficients is solved by standard numerical methods. The numerical approach is applied to versions of the governing PDE with a second-order spatial derivative (in addition to the sixth-order one), which arises from gravity acting on the film. In the absence of gravity, we demonstrate the self-similar intermediate asymptotics of initially localized disturbances on the film surface, at least until the disturbances ``feel'' the finite boundaries, and show that the derived Green's function is an attractor for such solutions. In the presence of gravity, we use the proposed Galerkin numerical method to demonstrate that self-similar behavior persists, albeit for shortened intervals of time, even for large values of the gravity-to-bending ratio.\\[1mm]</description>

      <title>Local stability guarantees for data-driven quadratically nonlinear models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00324v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Navier Stokes equations (NSEs) are partial differential equations (PDEs) to describe the nonlinear convective motion of fluids and they are computationally expensive to simulate because of their high nonlinearity and variables being fully coupled. Reduced-order models (ROMs) are simpler models for evolving the flows by capturing only the dominant behaviors of a system and can be used to design controllers for high-dimensional systems. However it is challenging to guarantee the stability of these models either globally or locally. Ensuring the stability of ROMs can improve the interpretability of the behavior of the dynamics and help develop effective system control strategies. For quadratically nonlinear systems that represent many fluid flows, the Schlegel and Noack trapping theorem (JFM, 2015) can be used to check if ROMs are globally stable (long-term bounded). This theorem was subsequently incorporated into system identification techniques that determine models directly from data. In this work, we relax the quadratically energy-preserving constraints in this theorem, and then promote local stability in data-driven models of quadratically nonlinear dynamics. First, we prove a theorem outlining sufficient conditions to ensure local stability in linear-quadratic systems and provide an estimate of the stability radius. Second, we incorporate this theorem into system identification methods and produce a-priori locally stable data-driven models. Several examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed algorithm.</description>

Abstract: The dip-coating geometry, where a solid plate is withdrawn from or plunged into a liquid pool, offers a prototypical example of wetting flows involving contact-line motion. Such flows are commonly studied using the lubrication approximation approach which is intrinsically limited to small interface slopes and thus small contact angles. Flows for arbitrary contact angles, however, can be studied using a generalized lubrication theory that builds upon viscous corner flow solutions. Here we derive this generalized lubrication theory for viscoelastic liquids that exhibit normal stress effects and are modelled using the second-order fluid model. We apply our theory to advancing and receding contact lines in the dip-coating geometry, highlighting the influence of viscoelastic normal stresses for contact line motion at arbitrary contact angle.</description>
