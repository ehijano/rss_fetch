      <title>Effective longitudinal wave through a random distribution of poroelastic spheres in a poroelastic matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A random distribution of poroelastic spheres in a poroelastic medium obeying Biot's theory is considered. The scattering coefficients of the fast and the slow waves are computed in the low frequency limit using the sealed pore boundary conditions. Analytical expressions of the effective wavenumbers of the coherent longitudinal waves (fast and slow) are deduced the Rayleigh limit using a generalization of the Linton-Martin (LM) formula to poroelastic medium up to the order two in concentration. Some effective quantities (mass density, bulk modulus) of the heterogeneous media are estimated.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Cell Characterization via Hydrodynamic Compression in Suspended Microchannel Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microfluidics offer remarkable flexibility for in-flow analyte characterization and can even measure the mechanical properties of biological cells through the application of hydrodynamic forces. In this work, we present a new approach to enhance the performance of nanomechanical resonators featuring integrated microfluidic channels when they are used as cell sensors by means of applying hydrostatic compressions. For this purpose, we have studied analytically how this kind of compressions affects either the mechanical properties of the resonator as well as the analytes. We found that, depending on factors such as device geometry and material composition, the mass limit of detection of the resonator can be reduced while the buoyant mass of the particles is increased when a hydrostatic compression is applied, improving the performance of the sensor. Furthermore, we demonstrate that applying these hydrostatic compressions induces shifts in mass distributions among cell lines with similar physical properties, which not only potentially enhances the ability to differentiate between these lines, but also opens the door to measure the cell's compressibility, a biophysical parameter of interest with practical diagnostic applications.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Theory for Critical Conditions of Like-Charge Attraction Between Polarizable Spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite extensive experimental and theoretical efforts, a concise quantitative theory to predict the occurrence of like-charge attraction (LCA) between polarizable spheres remains elusive. In this work, we first derive a novel three-point image formula, based on a key observation that connects the classical Neumann's image principle with the incomplete beta function. This approach naturally yields simple yet precise critical conditions for LCA, with a relative discrepancy of less than $1\%$ compared to numerical simulations, validated across diverse parameter settings. The obtained critical conditions may provide physical insights into various processes potentially involving LCA, such as self-assembly, crystallization, and phase separation across different length scales. Additionally, the new image formula is directly applicable to enhance the efficiency of polarizable force field calculations involving polarizable spheres.</description>

      <title>Effects of particle elongation on dense granular flows down a rough inclined plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Granular materials in nature are nearly always non-spherical, but particle shape effects in granular flow remain largely elusive. This study uses discrete element method simulations to investigate how elongated particle shapes affect the mobility of dense granular flows down a rough incline. For a range of systematically varied particle length-to-diameter aspect ratios (AR), we run simulations with various flow thicknesses $h$ and slope angles $\theta$ to extract the well-known $h_\textrm{stop}(\theta)$ curves (below which the flow ceases) and the $Fr$-$h/h_\textrm{stop}$ relations following Pouliquen's approach, where $Fr=u/\sqrt{gh}$ is the Froude number, $u$ is the mean flow velocity, and $g$ is the gravitational acceleration. The slope $\beta$ of the $Fr$-$h/h_\textrm{stop}$ relations shows an intriguing S-shaped dependence on AR, with two plateaus at small and large AR, respectively, transitioning with a sharp increase. We understand this S-shaped dependence by examining statistics of particle orientation, alignment, and hindered rotation. We find that the rotation ability of weakly elongated particles ($\textrm{AR}\lesssim1.3$) remains similar to spheres, leading to the first plateau in the $\beta$-AR relation, whereas the effects of particle orientation saturates beyond $\textrm{AR}\approx2.0$, explaining the second plateau. An empirical sigmoidal function is proposed to capture this non-linear dependence. The findings are expected to enhance our understanding of how particle shape affects the flow of granular materials from both the flow- and particle-scale perspectives.</description>

      <title>Unified Flow Rule of Undeveloped and Fully Developed Dense Granular Flows Down Rough Inclines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on chute measurements of the free-surface velocity $v$ in dense flows of spheres and diverse sands and spheres-sand mixtures down rough inclines. These and previous measurements are inconsistent with standard flow rules, in which the Froude number $v/\sqrt{gh}$ scales linearly with $h/h_s$ or $(\tan\theta/\mu_r)^2h/h_s$, where $\mu_r$ is the dynamic friction coefficient, $h$ the flow thickness, and $h_s(\theta)$ its smallest value that permits a steady, uniform dense flow state at a given inclination angle $\theta$. This is because the characteristic length $L$ a flow needs to fully develop can exceed the chute or travel length $l$ and because neither rule is universal for fully developed flows across granular materials. We use a dimensional analysis motivated by a recent unification of sediment transport to derive a flow rule that solves both problems in accordance with our and previous measurements: $v=v_\infty[1-\exp(-l/L)]^{1/2}$, with $v_\infty\propto\mu_r^{3/2}\left[(\tan\theta-\mu_r)h\right]^{4/3}$ and $L\propto\mu_r^3\left[(\tan\theta-\mu_r)h\right]^{5/3}h$.</description>

      <title>Role of Random Interaction Connection in the Order Transition of Active Matter Based on the Vicsek Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Randomness plays a key role in the order transition of active matter but has not yet been explicitly considered in pairwise interaction connection. In this letter, we introduce the perception rate P into the Vicsek model as the probability of the interaction connections and model the connections as superposition states. We show that with increasing P, the polar order number undergoes an order transition and then saturation. The order transition is a first-order phase transition with band formation, and the effect of P is different from density. The change of the order number is linked with the interaction structure. The order transition, order saturation, and phase separation correspond to different critical changes in the local interaction number. The global interaction structure is further analyzed as a network. The decrease of P is comparable to random edge removal, under which the network experiences modal transitions near the critical points of the order number, and the network exhibits surprising robustness. Our results suggest that random interaction can be a new important factor in active matter models, with potential applications in robotic swarms and social activities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cohesion energy is an important property of liquid, and thus should affect the saturation vapor pressure and the evaporation rate of the liquids. Here, an analytical expression that relates the saturation vapor pressure of a liquid with its cohesive energy was first deduced, and the relationship of the evaporation rate of sessile liquid droplet to the liquid cohesive energy was then obtained.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale defects and heterogeneous cavitation in water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cavitation, the formation of vapor bubbles in metastable liquids, is highly sensitive to nanoscale surface defects. Using molecular dynamics simulations and classical nucleation theory, we show that pure water confined within defect-free walls can withstand extreme negative pressures, far beyond those observed experimentally. Hydrophobic surfaces trigger heterogeneous cavitation and lower the cavitation pressure magnitude, but not to experimental levels. Notably, a single nanoscopic surface defect capable of hosting a vapor bubble drastically reduces the tensile strength of water. We find that defects as small as 1-2 nm can act as effective cavitation nuclei, a scale smaller than predicted by simple mechanical stability arguments. This discrepancy arises from stochastic fluctuations of the vapor bubble, which can overcome the kinetic free-energy barrier for cavitation. Our findings show that cavitation is predominantly determined by the largest surface defect rather than the overall defect density, emphasizing the importance of eliminating the largest surface imperfections to enhance stability against cavitation.</description>

      <title>Boundary curvature-dependent dynamical trapping of undulating worms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of {\it Lumbriculus variegatus} in polygonal chambers and show that the worms align with the boundaries as they move forward and get dynamically trapped at concave corners over prolonged periods of time before escaping. We develop a kinematic model to calculate and describe the evolution of the worm's mean body orientation angle relative to the boundary. Performing simulations with a minimal active elastic dumbbell model, we then show that both the boundary aligning and corner trapping behavior of the worm are captured by steric interactions with the boundaries. The dimensionless ratio of the strength of forward motion and diffusion caused by the worm's undulatory and peristaltic strokes is shown to determine the boundary alignment dynamics and trapping time scales of the worm. The simulations show that that the body angle with the boundary while entering the concave corner is important to the trapping time distributions with shallow angles leading to faster escapes. Our study demonstrates that directed motion and limited angular diffusion can give rise to aggregation which can mimic shelter seeking behavior in slender undulating limbless worms even when thigmotaxis or contact seeking behavior is absent.</description>

      <title>Experimental models for cohesive granular materials: a review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Granular materials are involved in most industrial and environmental processes, as well as many civil engineering applications. Although significant advances have been made in understanding the statics and dynamics of cohesionless grains over the past decades, most granular systems we encounter often display some adhesive forces between grains. The presence of cohesion has effects at distances substantially larger than the closest neighbors and consequently can greatly modify their overall behavior. While considerable progress has been made in understanding and describing cohesive granular systems through idealized numerical simulations, controlled experiments corroborating and expanding the wide range of behavior remain challenging to perform. In recent years, various experimental approaches have been developed to control inter-particle adhesion that now pave the way to further our understanding of cohesive granular flows. This article reviews different approaches for making particles sticky, controlling their relative stickiness, and thereby studying their granular and bulk mechanics. Some recent experimental studies relying on model cohesive grains are synthesized, and opportunities and perspectives in this field are discussed.</description>

      <title>The anomalous density of states and quasi-localized vibration through homogeneous thermalization of an inhomogeneous elastic system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amorphous solids are dynamically inhomogeneous due to in lack of translational symmetry and hence exhibit vibrational properties different from crystalline solids with anomalous low frequency vibrational density of states (VDOS) and related low temperature thermal properties. However, an interpretation of their origin from basic physical laws is still needed compared with rapidly progressed particle level investigations. In this work, we start with the quasi-equilibrium condition, which requires elastic potential energy to be homogeneously distributed even in an inhomogeneous elastic solid over long time observation. Analytical result shows that the anomalous low frequency VDOS behavior $D(\omega) \propto \omega^4$ can be obtained when the quasi-equilibrium condition is satisfied on an inhomogeneous elastic system. Under high frequency after a crossover depending on the length scale of inhomogeneity, the power law of VDOS is changed to square $D(\omega) \propto \omega^2$ which is Debye's law for crystalline solids. These features agree with recent particle level investigations. Our work suggest that the universal low frequency anomaly of amorphous solids can be considered as a result of homogeneous thermalization.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous spatial sorting by cell shape in growing colonies of rod-like bacteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanical interactions among cells in a growing microbial colony can significantly influence the colony's spatial genetic structure and, thus, evolutionary outcomes such as the fates of rare mutations. Here, we computationally investigate how this spatial genetic structure changes as a result of heritable phenotypic variations in cell shape. By modeling rod-like bacterial cells as lengthening and dividing circo-rectangles in a 2D Brownian dynamics framework, we simulate the growth of a colony containing two populations with different aspect ratios. Compared to monodisperse colonies, such bidisperse colonies exhibit diminished intermixing between sub-populations when the less elongated cells are too short to nematically order, instead forming large clusters. We find that the cells with longer aspect ratio gradually segregate to the colony periphery. We present evidence that this demixing is related to nematic order in the bulk and to active nematic mixing dynamics near the periphery. These findings are qualitatively robust across different growth rate protocols and initial conditions. Because the periphery is often an advantageous position when nutrients are limited, our results suggest a possible evolutionary selective pressure of mechanical origin that favors large cell aspect ratio.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many biological systems localized mechanical information is transmitted by mechanically neutral chemical signals. Typical examples include contraction waves in acto-myosin cortex at cellular scale and peristaltic waves at tissue level. In such systems, chemical activity is transformed into mechanical deformation by distributed motor-type mechanisms represented by continuum degrees of freedom. To elucidate the underlying principles of chemo-mechanical coupling, we present in this Letter the simplest example. It involves directional motion of a localized solitary wave in a distributed mechanical system guided by a purely chemical cue. Our main result is that mechanical signals can be driven by chemical activity in a highly efficient manner.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In ABP systems, phase separation is accompanied by the emergence of vapor bubbles within liquid domains. Using large-scale particle-based simulations, we study the stochastic dynamics of these bubbles and find that most nucleate, grow, and dissolve within liquid domains. We show that their area dynamics can be described by a Langevin equation with a constant negative drift and noise proportional to the perimeter, fully characterizing bubble area and lifetime statistics. Additionally, we develop a lattice gas model that captures the morphological properties, including the decrease in bubble asphericity with increasing area. These findings provide new insights into phase separation in active matter and highlight limitations in current continuum theories.</description>

      <title>The $(2+\delta)$-dimensional theory of the electromechanics of lipid membranes: III. Constitutive models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article concludes a three-part series developing a self-consistent theoretical framework of the electromechanics of lipid membranes at the continuum scale. Owing to their small thickness, lipid membranes are commonly modeled as two-dimensional surfaces. However, this approach breaks down when considering their electromechanical behavior as it requires accounting for their thickness. To address this, we developed a dimension reduction procedure in part 1 to derive effective surface theories explicitly capturing the thickness of lipid membranes. We applied this method to dimensionally reduce Gauss' law and the electromechanical balance laws and referred to the resulting theory as $(2+\delta)$-dimensional, where $\delta$ indicates the membrane thickness. However, the $(2+\delta)$-dimensional balance laws derived in part 2 are general, and specific material models are required to specialize them to lipid membranes. In this work, we devise appropriate three-dimensional constitutive models that capture the in-plane fluid and out-of-plane elastic behavior of lipid membranes. The viscous behavior is recovered by a three-dimensional Newtonian fluid model, leading to the same viscous stresses as strictly two-dimensional models. The elastic resistance to bending is recovered by imposing a free energy penalty on local volume changes. While this gives rise to the characteristic bending resistance of lipid membranes, it differs in its higher-order curvature terms from the Canham-Helfrich-Evans theory. Furthermore, motivated by the small mid-surface stretch of lipid membranes, we introduce reactive stresses that enforce mid-surface incompressibility, resulting in an effective surface tension. Finally, we use the constitutive and reactive stresses to derive the equations of motion describing the electromechanics of lipid membranes.</description>

      <title>Nanopillar-Driven Antibacterial Surfaces: Elucidating Bactericidal Mechanisms and Engineering Nanostructures for Enhanced Efficacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Insects like dragonflies and cicadas possess nanoprotusions on their wings that rupture bacterial membranes upon contact, inspiring synthetic antibacterial surfaces mimicking this phenomenon. Designing such biomimetic surfaces requires understanding the mechanical interaction between nanopillars and bacterial membranes. However, the small scales of these interactions pose challenges. Molecular Dynamics simulations offer precise and efficient modeling at these scales. This study presents a coarse-grained membrane model to explore the mechanical responses of gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial membranes to nanopillar arrays. By varying bacterial shapes (spherical and cylindrical), membrane bending rigidity, and loading rates, we identified two distinct failure mechanisms. Low bending rigidity, typical of gram-negative bacteria, leads to tearing near nanopillar tips, contrary to prior assumptions. High bending rigidity, characteristic of gram-positive bacteria, results in puncturing at contact points. Gram-positive bacteria are more resistant, requiring a threefold increase in loading rate for effective piercing. Nanopillar height and spacing also critically impact bactericidal efficacy: greater heights enhance activity beyond a critical threshold, while increased spacing reduces efficacy. This simplified coarse-grained model, representing bacterial membranes with high fidelity, enables cost-effective, full-scale simulations over extended periods. Our findings provide essential insights for optimizing nanopillared surface designs, advancing antibacterial technology through tailored height and spacing configurations.</description>

      <title>Repulsive thermal van der Waals interaction in multi-species asymmetric electrolytes driven by external electric fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well established that the long-range component of the thermal van der Waals interaction between two semi-infinite dielectrics becomes short-range when an electrolyte is present between them, this is the well known phenomenon of screening. In Phys. Rev. Lett, 133, 238002 (2024) it was shown that for a binary symmetric electrolyte, an electric field parallel to the dielectric boundaries disrupts screening and a long-range thermal repulsive interaction appears. At large applied fields this long-range repulsive interaction can be explained by the fact that the cations and anions have differing average drifts moving in opposite directions, leading to the correlation of charge density fluctuations between the two species to decouple. Here we extend these results to binary electrolytes which are asymmetric as well as electrolytes with more than two ionic species.</description>

      <title>3D structure and stability prediction of DNA with multi-way junctions in ionic solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the three-dimensional (3D) structure and stability of DNA is fundamental for its biological function and the design of novel drugs. In this study, we introduce an improved coarse-grained (CG) model, incorporating a more refined electrostatic energy term, the replica-exchange Monte Carlo algorithm, and the weighted histogram analysis method. The enhanced model predicts the 3D structures and stability of DNA with multi-way junctions (three-way and four-way) in various ionic environments, going beyond traditional single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). Our model demonstrates remarkable accuracy in predicting the structures of DNAs with multi-way junctions from sequences and offers reliable estimates of their thermal stability across a range of sequences and lengths, with both monovalent and divalent salts. Notably, our analysis of the thermally unfolding pathways reveals that the stability of DNA with multi-way junctions is strongly influenced by the relative stabilities of their unfolded intermediate states, providing key insights into DNA structure-function relationships.</description>

      <title>Freezing in flat monolayers of soft spherocylinders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lamellar or smectic phases often have an intricate intralamellar structure that remains scarcely understood from a microscopic viewpoint. In this work, we use molecular dynamics simulations to study the effect of volume exclusion and electrostatic repulsion on the phase transitions of a flat membrane of soft spherocylinders. With increasing rod packing, we identify nematic and solid phases and find that the nematic-crystal phase transition happens at a uniform packing fraction ($\eta_c \approx 0.82$), independent of the spherocylinder aspect ratio. This value is considerably higher than the well-known critical freezing transition of a hard disk fluid ($\eta_c \approx 0.7$) to which one could naively map a system of near-parallel rods with co-planar mass centers. We attribute this difference to a non-vanishing residual orientational entropy per rod. Our findings are corroborated by a simple theory based on a simple microscopic density functional theory of freezing of a two-dimensional rod fluid. Introduction of electrostatic interactions between the rods reduces the lateral compressibility of the monolayer fluid but keeps the positional order unhindered, which in turn maintains the packing fraction at the nematic-crystal transition. The strength of the orientational fluctuations of the individual rods in our membranes exhibits a density scaling that differs from 3D bulk smectics. Our findings contribute to a qualitative understanding of liquid crystal phase stability in strong planar confinement and engage with recent experimental explorations involving nanorods on 2D substrates.</description>

      <title>Metamaterials that learn to change shape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning to change shape is a fundamental strategy of adaptation and evolution of living organisms, from bacteria and cells to tissues and animals. Human-made materials can also exhibit advanced shape morphing capabilities, but lack the ability to learn. Here, we build metamaterials that can learn complex shape-changing responses using a contrastive learning scheme. By being shown examples of the target shape changes, our metamaterials are able to learn those shape changes by progressively updating internal learning degrees of freedom -- the local stiffnesses. Unlike traditional materials that are designed once and for all, our metamaterials have the ability to forget and learn new shape changes in sequence, to learn multiple shape changes that break reciprocity, and to learn multistable shape changes, which in turn allows them to perform reflex gripping actions and locomotion. Our findings establish metamaterials as an exciting platform for physical learning, which in turn opens avenues for the use of physical learning to design adaptive materials and robots.</description>

      <title>Low-Cost 3D printed, Biocompatible Ionic Polymer Membranes for Soft Actuators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ionic polymer actuators, in essence, consist of ion exchange polymers sandwiched between layers of electrodes. They have recently gained recognition as promising candidates for soft actuators due to their lightweight nature, noise-free operation, and low-driving voltages. However, the materials traditionally utilized to develop them are often not human/environmentally friendly. Thus, to address this issue, researchers have been focusing on developing biocompatible versions of this actuator. Despite this, such actuators still face challenges in achieving high performance, in payload capacity, bending capabilities, and response time. In this paper, we present a biocompatible ionic polymer actuator whose membrane is fully 3D printed utilizing a direct ink writing method. The structure of the printed membranes consists of biodegradable ionic fluid encapsulated within layers of activated carbon polymers. From the microscopic observations of its structure, we confirmed that the ionic polymer is well encapsulated. The actuators can achieve a bending performance of up to 124$^\circ$ (curvature of 0.82 $\text{cm}^{-1}$), which, to our knowledge, is the highest curvature attained by any bending ionic polymer actuator to date. It can operate comfortably up to a 2 Hz driving frequency and can achieve blocked forces of up to 0.76 mN. Our results showcase a promising, high-performing biocompatible ionic polymer actuator, whose membrane can be easily manufactured in a single step using a standard FDM 3D printer. This approach paves the way for creating customized designs for functional soft robotic applications, including human-interactive devices, in the near future.</description>

      <title>Symmetry and Critical Dynamics in Supercooled Liquid Crystals: Insights into the Glass Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a modeling approach aimed at elucidating the pivotal role of symmetry in phase transitions, focusing specifically on the isotropic-nematic (I-N) transition characteristic of liquid crystal systems. By leveraging insights from the Ising model and incorporating considerations of topological defects, the transition to the glassy state in rod-like molecular systems in the supercooled state is examined. Through a critical-like analysis of the system's dynamical properties, universality classes directly linked to symmetry are discerned. This paper delves into the role of symmetry in the glass transition, as manifested in the generalized critical relation of configurational entropy $S_C(T)=S_0(1-T_K/T)^n$, where the critical exponent $n$ is intricately tied to the system's symmetry. The determined values of the pseudocritical exponent $n$ exhibit universality across the studied systems and demonstrate excellent agreement with thermodynamic data. Furthermore, the congruence between the dynamic representation, as indicated by the primary relaxation time, and the thermodynamic representation, exemplified by the specific heat capacity, underscores the robustness of the findings. The identification of critical-like behavior and the observation of symmetry breaking during the transition to the glass state suggest its intrinsic thermodynamic nature. This work provides a unified framework for understanding the glass transition, bridging dynamic and thermodynamic perspectives through the lens of symmetry.</description>

Abstract: We study the static and dynamic properties of a cyclic Rouse chain modified by the inclusion of an effective, spherically symmetric, attracting potential of entropic nature , is the position vector of ring center of mass, is the position vector of the segment with number n, is the Boltzmann constant multiplied on absolute temperature, is a parameter of the potential, square of which is inverse to strength of the potential. It is shown that very weak potentials with , N is the number Kuhn segments in polymer ring, b is the length of Kuhn segment, lead to dramatic compression of the polymer chain whose radius of inertia becomes much smaller compared to the free size At values of the potential parameter of order , is the concentration of Kuhn segments in the melt, the concentration of the intrinsic segments of the polymer ring becomes of order and the state of the polymer ring can be regarded as globular. The terminal relaxation time of the polymer ring turns out to be of the order of , the mean squared displacement of the center of mass of the macromolecule during this time , which can lead to a pseudo plateau for the time dependence of the mean squared displacements of the polymer segments before entering the normal diffusion mode of motion.</description>

      <title>Coevolving aerodynamic and impact ripples on Earth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Windblown sand creates multiscale bedforms on Earth, Mars, and other planetary bodies. According to conventional wisdom, decameter-scale dunes and decimeter-scale ripples emerge via distinct mechanisms on Earth: a hydrodynamic instability related to a phase shift between the turbulent flow and the topography, and a granular instability related to a synchronization of hopping grains with the topography. Here, we report the reproducible creation of coevolving centimeter and decimeter-scale ripples on fine-grained monodisperse sand beds in ambient-air and low-pressure wind-tunnels, revealing two adjacent mesoscale growth instabilities. Their morphological traits and our quantitative grain-scale numerical simulations authenticate the smaller structures as impact ripples but point at a hydrodynamic origin for the larger ones. This suggests that the aeolian transport layer would have to partially respond to the topography on a scale comparable to the average hop length, hence faster than previously thought, but consistent with the phase lag of the inferred aeolian sand flux relative to the wind. Hydrodynamic modelling supports the existence of hydrodynamic aerodynamic ripples on Earth, connecting them mechanistically to megaripples and to the debated Martian ripples. We thereby propose a unified framework for mesoscale granular bedforms found across the Solar System.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the interaction between a self-diffusiophoretic spherical Janus motor and an inert spherical cargo particle in an axisymmetric configuration in the Stokes regime. To study the different configurations of the two spheres and their motions, we develop an analog to the twin multipole approach to numerically determine the axisymmetric stream function for the flow field. We verify the validity and accuracy of this approach using existing literature and COMSOL Multiphysics. We study the effects of the size of the Janus cap, the relative ratio of sizes of the two spheres, and their separation distance on their interactions. For the case of a stationary cargo, we identify the existence of a distinct regime where the Janus motor hovers at a finite separation distance from the cargo and summarize the results using a phase diagram. In the presence of a freely moving cargo, we analyze the steady terminal velocities of the Janus motor and the cargo to identify distinct conditions at which the two spheres can translate with equal velocities while maintaining a finite separation distance.</description>

      <title>Revealing the role played by $\alpha$- and $\beta$-relaxation in hydrostatically compressed metallic glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Any property of metallic glasses is controlled by the microscopic ongoing relaxation processes. While the response of these processes to temperature is well documented, little is known on their pressure dependence, owning to non-trivial experimental challenges. By combining fast differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction and high-pressure technologies, we identify the origin of a recently discovered pressure-induced rejuvenation in metallic glasses from the different pressure response of the $\alpha$- and $\beta$-relaxation in a series of hydrostatically compressed Vit4 glasses. While the localized $\beta$-relaxation promotes rejuvenation and is associated to a constant looser atomic packing independent of the applied pressure, the collective $\alpha$-relaxation triggers density driven ordering processes promoting the stability. The latter parameter however cannot be solely described by the degree of equilibration reached during the compression, which instead determines the crossover between the two regimes allowing to rescale the corresponding activation energies of the two processes on a master curve.</description>

      <title>A Model for Self-Organized Growth, Branching, and Allometric Scaling of the Planarian Gut</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growth and scaling of organs is a fundamental aspect of animal development. However, how organs grow to the right size and shape required by physiological demands, remains largely unknown. Here, we provide a framework combining theory and experiment to study the scaling of branched organs. As a biological model, we focus on the branching morphogenesis of the planarian gut, which is a highly branched organ responsible for the delivery of nutrients. Planarians undergo massive body size changes requiring gut morphology to adapt to these size variations. Our experimental analysis shows that various gut properties scale with organism size according to power laws. We introduce a theoretical framework to understand the growth and scaling of branched organs. Our theory considers the dynamics of the interface between organ and surrounding tissue to be controlled by a morphogen and illustrates how a shape instability of this interface can give rise to the self-organized formation and growth of complex branched patterns. Considering the reaction-diffusion dynamics in a growing domain representative of organismal growth, we show that a wide range of scaling behaviors of the branching pattern emerges from the interplay between interface dynamics and organism growth. Our model can recapitulate the scaling laws of planarian gut morphology that we quantified and also opens new directions for understanding allometric scaling laws in various other branching systems in organisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the hydrodynamics of a rotating disk in a two-dimensional compressible fluid layer with odd viscosity. Unlike conventional fluids, odd viscosity introduces a radial flow component that can be directed either inward or outward, depending on its sign. This phenomenon is expected to significantly impact the hydrodynamic interactions between two rotating disks, potentially causing effective attraction or repulsion depending on the sign of the odd viscosity and the direction of rotation. Furthermore, we calculate the rotational resistance coefficient and find that odd viscosity increases this coefficient, regardless of its sign.</description>

      <title>Competition between thermocapillary and solutocapillary flows in thin liquid films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the thermocapillary flow in a thin liquid film which is subjected to local heating, in the presence of insoluble surfactants. While surfactant molecules are first advected from warmer to cooler regions, the resulting concentration gradient drives a solutal counterflow in the opposite direction. This competition is theoretically addressed within the lubrication approximation. Assuming small deviations with respect to the mean surfactant concentration, we derive the time evolution equation governing the shape of the interface. Our study reveals that both interfacial deformations and velocities are progressively suppressed as the solutal Marangoni number increases. Our versatile model, adaptable to a range of experimental setups, offers a quantitative tool for understanding the effect of surfactants in thermocapillary-driven systems.</description>

      <title>Modeling finite viscoelasticity based on the Green-Naghdi kinematic assumption and generalized strains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a modeling framework for finite viscoelasticity, inspired by the kinematic assumption made by Green and Naghdi in plasticity. This approach fundamentally differs from the widely used multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient, as the intermediate configuration, a concept that remains debated, becomes unnecessary. The advent of the concept of generalized strains allows the Green-Naghdi assumption to be employed with different strains, offering a flexible mechanism to separate inelastic deformation from total deformation. This leads to a constitutive theory in which the kinematic separation is adjustable and can be calibrated. For quadratic configurational free energy, the framework yields a suite of finite linear viscoelasticity models governed by linear evolution equations. Notably, these models recover established models, including those by Green and Tobolsky (1946) and Simo (1987), when the Seth-Hill strain is chosen with the strain parameter being -2 and 2, respectively. It is also related to the model of Miehe and Keck (2000) when the strain is of the Hencky type. We further extend the approach by adopting coercive strains, which allows us to define an elastic deformation tensor locally. This facilitates modeling the viscous branch using general forms of the configurational free energy, and we construct a micromechanical viscoelastic model as a representative instantiation. The constitutive integration algorithms of the proposed models are detailed. We employ the experimental data of VHB 4910 to examine the proposed models, which demonstrate their effectiveness and potential advantages in the quality of fitting and prediction. Three-dimensional finite element analysis is also conducted to assess the influence of different strains on the viscoelastic behavior.</description>

      <title>Large Amplitude Oscillatory Extension (LAOE) of dilute polymer solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents an experimental framework for large amplitude oscillatory extension (LAOE) to investigate nonlinear material properties of complex fluids. Using a microfluidic optimized shape cross-slot extensional rheometer, we generate approximately homogeneous planar extensional flows driven by programmable syringe pumps operating in oscillatory or pulsatile sinusoidal modes. Micro-particle image velocimetry and simultaneous pressure drop measurements are employed to analyze the time-dependent flow field and elastic stress response. For Newtonian fluids, a linear relationship between the applied strain rate and pressure drop is observed across a wide range of oscillation amplitudes and frequencies. In contrast, dilute polymer solutions exhibit significant deviations, with excess pressure drops and divergence between average strain rates along extension and compression axes during the LAOE cycle. By spanning a broad range of Weissenberg and Deborah numbers, we identify unique Lissajous curves and critical conditions for the onset of nonlinearities under oscillatory extension. Numerical simulations, assuming homogeneous flow, underpin the experimental findings, validating the robustness of our microfluidic approach. This study demonstrates the utility of oscillatory extensional flows for probing the nonlinear rheological behavior of soft materials, offering quantitative insights into their extensional properties under nonlinear flow conditions.</description>

      <title>Mesoscopic Collective Dynamics in Liquids and the Dual Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A microscopic vision is presented of a Dual Model of Liquids from a solid picture. Among the novelties of this model is that it provides quantitative expressions of various extensive thermophysical properties. The introduction of the statistical number of excited degrees of freedom (DoF) allows bypassing the problem of other dual models which are sometimes unable to correctly reproduce the expressions for those thermophysical quantities showing deviations due to the activation or deactivation of internal DoF. The interpretation of the relaxation times is given, their Order of Magnitude calculated and the way in which these times are involved in the different phases of the collective dynamics of liquids is discussed. A comparison is provided with results obtained in the frame of another phononic model of liquids, as well as with the predictions for the viscoelastic transition regions and with systems exhibiting kgap. In the last part of the paper, theoretical insights and experiments are suggested as potential directions for future research and development.</description>

      <title>Triboelectric Charging Model for Particles with Rough Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.13441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The triboelectric charging of particles depends on the contact area of the particle and the contacting surface. Even though the surface topology determines the real contact area, particle charging models do not account for surface roughness. In this paper, we combine contact mechanics and triboelectrification models to predict the charging of rough particles. First, a laser confocal microscope measured the statistical descriptors of polyethylene (PE) particles surface topology. Then, we descriptors particle surfaces by distributing spheroidal asperities on the smooth particle core until the surface roughness reaches the measured value. The Hertz contact mechanics model predicts the deformation of the asperity-covered particle and the resulting real contact area in dependence on impact velocity. Finally, we introduced the real contact area into the condenser model for triboelectric particle charging. The accuracy of the new model predictions was demonstrated by comparing it to a more complex surface reconstructions that account for the fractal surface topology. Furthermore, the model's predicted particle saturation charges agree well with our shaker experiments and with experimental data in the literature on the charging of plane surfaces. The developed triboelectric charging model for particles with rough surfaces is simple and requires only standard descriptors of the surface topology; thus, it suits large-scale simulations of electrifying powder flows.</description>

      <title>Memory in cyclically crumpled sheets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06918v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the crumpling of a sheet as it is repeatedly crushed onto itself by rolling it into a cylinder and twisting it axially while allowing the end-to-end length to evolve freely. As deduced from its plastic deformations, the sheet creases and collapses into structures which repeat and sharpen over hundreds of cycles to a remarkable degree before forming new configurations. The observed metastablilty increases with applied cycles leading to recurrent structures over a significant range of loading, but reconfigurations can continue to occur for large enough loading as the creases develop tears. The evolution of the sheet structure as measured by the mean curvature and the total crease length is found to increase logarithmically with cycle number with a rate which increases with degree of compression. We explain the overall extent of creasing using flat folding models, and show the logarithmic growth as being a consequence of individual creases becoming sharper with number of folding cycles, and due to the bifurcation in the curvature field leading to the formation of new creases and folding pathways. Thus, we show that elastoplastic sheets can follow complex folding pathways to form convergent structures after a sufficiently large number of training cycles provided material fatigue remains unimportant.</description>

      <title>Non-monotonic constitutive curves and shear banding in dry and wet granular flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use particle simulations to map comprehensively the shear rheology of dry and wet granular matter comprising particles of finite stiffness, in both fixed pressure and fixed volume protocols. At fixed pressure we find non-monotonic constitutive curves that are shear thinning, whereas at fixed volume we find non-monotonic constitutive curves that are shear thickening. We show that the presence of one non-monotonicity does not imply the other. Instead, there exists a signature in the volume fraction measured under fixed pressure that, when present, ensures non-monotonic constitutive curves at fixed volume. In the context of dry granular flow we show that gradient and vorticity bands arise under fixed pressure and volume respectively, as implied by the constitutive curves. For wet systems our results are consistent with a recent experimental observation of shear thinning at fixed pressure. We furthermore predict discontinuous shear thickening in the absence of critical load friction.</description>

      <title>Shear banding as a cause of non-monotonic stress relaxation after flow cessation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent flow cessation experiments on soft materials have shown a counter-intuitive non-monotonic relaxation of the shear stress: following the switch-off of a steady imposed shear flow, the stress initially decays before later increasing again. By simulating the soft glassy rheology model in a form extended to allow steady state shear banding, we show that the presence of shear bands prior to flow cessation can give rise to this phenomenon. We give a mechanistic understanding of the basic physics involved, in terms of (i) the decay of the shear bands after flow cessation, and (ii) the evolution of frustrated local stresses, governed by different time scales for plastic relaxation in each band. In particular, an elastic recoil in the unsheared band gives rise to negative local frustrated stresses, the slow release of which can cause an increase in macroscopic stress. Given that shear banding and frustrated local stresses arise widely across disordered soft solids, we argue that non-monotonic stress relaxation after flow cessation may occur in many different materials.</description>

      <title>Diffusion of a single colloid on the surface of a giant vesicle and a droplet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of interactions between biomimetic membranes and micron-sized particles is crucial for understanding various biological processes. Here, we control microparticle spontaneous engulfment by giant lipid vesicles by tuning particle surface charge, exploring regimes from negligible to strong adhesion. We focus our attention on dissipative phenomena at the micron- and nano- scales, occurring when a particle is wrapped by a lipid vesicle bilayer or when the particle diffuses at the lipid-monolayer interface of a droplet. For particles wrapped by membrane bilayers, we highlight the influence of the particle penetration depth and the impact of substructures on particle friction. Our work is complemented by hydrodynamic simulations that take into account the effects of the shape of the membrane wrapping the particle and the water gap separating the lipid bilayer membrane from the particle on translational particle drag. We show, however, that a purely hydrodynamic model is not suitable to describe the friction of a particle diffusing at the interface of an aqueous microdroplet in oil, stabilized by a single lipid layer. In hydrodynamic models, dissipation is solely described by the surface shear viscosity of the interface and the bulk fluid viscosity, but in this partial wetting configuration, an additional source of dissipation is required to account for fluctuations at the contact line. Hence, through experimental and numerical studies, we demonstrate that the dissipation contributions for the two geometries are fundamentally different.</description>

      <title>Ionic association and Wien effect in 2D confined electrolytes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experimental advances in nanofluidics have allowed to explore ion transport across molecular-scale pores, in particular for iontronic applications. Two dimensional nanochannels -- in which a single molecular layer of electrolyte is confined between solid walls -- constitute a unique platform to investigate fluid and ion transport in extreme confinement, highlighting unconventional transport properties. In this work, we study ionic association in 2D nanochannels, and its consequences on non-linear ionic transport, using both molecular dynamics simulations and analytical theory. We show that under sufficient confinement, ions assemble into pairs or larger clusters in a process analogous to a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition, here modified by the dielectric confinement. We further show that the breaking of pairs results in an electric-field dependent conduction, a mechanism usually known as the second Wien effect. However the 2D nature of the system results in non-universal, temperature-dependent, scaling of the conductivity with electric field, leading to ionic coulomb blockade in some regimes. A 2D generalization of the Onsager theory fully accounts for the non-linear transport. These results suggest ways to exploit electrostatic interactions between ions to build new nanofluidic devices.</description>

      <title>Surface Chemistry-based Continuous Separation of Colloidal Particles via Diffusiophoresis and Diffusioosmosis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00246v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The separation of colloidal particles based solely on their surface properties is a highly challenging task. This study demonstrates that diffusiophoresis and diffusioosmosis enable the continuous separation of carboxylate polystyrene particles with similar sizes and zeta potentials but distinct surface concentrations of carboxyl groups. The particles are exposed to salt concentration gradients generated in a double-junction microfluidic device. Through experimental and theoretical analyses, we demonstrate how the particle dynamics are influenced by their zeta potential sensitivity to the local salt concentration, which in turn is affected by surface conductance effects induced by the surface carboxyl groups. Consequently, colloids with comparable zeta potentials but differing surface concentrations of carboxyl groups can be separated with 100% efficiency. This approach, which employs a simple, easy-to-operate device, has discipline-spanning potential for the continuous separation of colloids distinguished solely by surface properties that influence their zeta potential sensitivities, like roughness, permeability, heterogeneity, and chemical composition.</description>

      <title>Discontinuous Structural Transitions in Fluids with Competing Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01629v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores how competing interactions in the intermolecular potential of fluids affect their structural transitions. This study employs a versatile potential model with a hard core followed by two constant steps, representing wells or shoulders, analyzed in both one-dimensional (1D) and three-dimensional (3D) systems. Comparing these dimensionalities highlights the effect of confinement on structural transitions. Exact results are derived for 1D systems, while the rational function approximation is used for unconfined 3D fluids. Both scenarios confirm that when the steps are repulsive, the wavelength of the oscillatory decay of the total correlation function evolves with temperature either continuously or discontinuously. In the latter case, a discontinuous oscillation crossover line emerges in the temperature--density plane. For an attractive first step and a repulsive second step, a Fisher--Widom line appears. Although the 1D and 3D results share common features, dimensionality introduces differences: these behaviors occur in distinct temperature ranges, require deeper wells, or become attenuated in 3D. Certain features observed in 1D may vanish in 3D. We conclude that fluids with competing interactions exhibit a rich and intricate pattern of structural transitions, demonstrating the significant influence of dimensionality and interaction features.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2202.02644v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Small fluid leaks are common and frequently troublesome. We often consider how to stop a leak, but here we ask a different question: how might a leak stop itself? We experimentally study leaking flow transitions from continuous drainage to spontaneous arrest. High-speed imaging reveals that fluid breakup events generate droplets whose Laplace pressures oppose the leak. Early droplets grow unstably, allowing the leak to continue, but ultimately a final capping droplet equilibrates to a stable spherical cap via lightly damped harmonic oscillations. A total energetic theory incorporating both the potential and kinetic energy of attempted capping droplets shows that inertia plays a key role in the leak-stop mechanism. Further experiments examining the stability of rivulet flow in such a system demonstrate that a transition from continuous to discrete flow is an essential prerequisite in determining when a leak can stop itself.</description>

      <title>Entanglement statistics of polymers in a lattice tube and unknotting of 4-plats</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.06186v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Knot Entropy Conjecture states that the exponential growth rate of the number of $n$-edge lattice polygons with knot-type $K$ is the same as that for unknot polygons. Moreover, the next order growth follows a power law in $n$ with an exponent that increases by one for each prime knot in the knot decomposition of $K$. We provide the first proof of this conjecture by considering knots and non-split links in tube $\mathbb{T}^*$, an $\infty \times 2\times 1$ sublattice of the simple cubic lattice. We establish upper and lower bounds relating the asymptotics of the number of $n$-edge polygons with fixed link-type in $\mathbb{T}^*$ to that of the number of $n$-edge unknots. For the upper bound, we prove that polygons can be unknotted by braid insertions. For the lower bound, we prove a pattern theorem for unknots using information from exact transfer-matrices. This work provides new knot theory results for 4-plats and new combinatorics results for lattice polygons. Connections to modelling polymers such as DNA in nanochannels are highlighted.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Investigation of Cotton Fabric Behavior Modified by Straight and Zig-Zag Stitches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.13270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we demonstrate a data-driven approach to investigate the behavior of cotton fabric modified by straight and zig-zag stitches. Existing literature in understanding the mechanical behavior of soft materials (e.g., textile-based fibers or fabrics) heavily relies on stress-strain analyses. However, the strain-induced deformation behavior can be further analyzed by taking advantage of data-driven constitutive models. Such an approach reveals intermolecular parameters that can be utilized further in design and development analyses. For that, we exhibit the altered mechanics of base cotton fabric induced by two types of singular stitches (straight and zig-zag). We have sewn simple straight and zig-zag cotton stitches to investigate the mechanics of the base cotton fabrics using uniaxial stress-strain experimental data. Then, we leveraged the constitutive models (i.e., three-network model, TNM) obtained from MCalibration software to reveal eleven intermolecular parameters for data-driven investigations. Our experimental analyses, combined with the data, suggest a 99.99% confidence in assessing the mechanical impact of stitches on cotton fabrics. We have also used distributed strain energy to analyze the mechanics and failure of the base and stitched fabrics. Once adopted, our study may contribute to an improved understanding of the production of smart wearables and e-textiles.</description>

      <title>Gradient dynamics approach to reactive thin-film hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10295v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wetting and dewetting dynamics of simple and complex liquids is described by kinetic equations in gradient dynamics form that incorporates the various coupled dissipative processes in a fully thermodynamically consistent manner. After briefly reviewing this, we also review how chemical reactions can be captured by a related gradient dynamics description, assuming detailed balanced mass action type kinetics. Then, we bring both aspects together and discuss mesoscopic reactive thin-film hydrodynamics illustrated by two examples, namely, models for reactive wetting and reactive surfactants. These models can describe the approach to equilibrium but may also be employed to study out-of-equilibrium chemo-mechanical dynamics. In the latter case, one breaks the gradient dynamics form by chemostatting to obtain active systems. In this way, for reactive wetting we recover running drops that are driven by chemically sustained wettability gradients and for drops covered by autocatalytic reactive surfactants we find complex forms of self-propulsion and self-excited oscillations.</description>

      <title>Designing aperiodic to periodic interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry sharing facilitates coherent interfaces which can transition from periodic to aperiodic structures. Motivated by the design and construction of such systems, we present hexagonal aperiodic tilings with a single edge-length which can be considered as decorations of a periodic lattice. We introduce these tilings by modifying an existing family of golden-mean trigonal and hexagonal tilings, and discuss their properties in terms of this wider family. Then, we show how the vertices of these new systems can be considered as decorations or sublattice sets of a periodic triangular lattice, before introducing methods to designing coherent aperiodic to periodic interfaces.</description>

      <title>Universal scale-free decay of tracer-bath correlations in $d$-dimensional interacting particle systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09326v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantifying the correlations between the position of a tagged tracer and the density of surrounding bath particles is crucial for understanding tracer diffusion in interacting particle systems, and for characterizing the response properties of the bath. We address this problem analytically for both hard-core and soft-core interactions, using minimal yet paradigmatic models in $d$ spatial dimensions. In both cases, we derive analytical expressions for the spatial correlation profiles in the reference frame of the tracer. We reveal unexpected universal features in their large-distance behavior, characterized by power-law tails with exponents that depend solely on the spatial dimensionality of the system. Beyond these simple models, we demonstrate the robustness of our results across different regimes using particle-based numerical simulations.</description>
