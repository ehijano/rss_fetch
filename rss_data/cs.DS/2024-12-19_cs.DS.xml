      <title>Stable Approximation Algorithms for Dominating Set and Independent Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Dominating set problem and Independent Set Problem for dynamic graphs in the vertex-arrival model. We say that a dynamic algorithm for one of these problems is $k$-stable when it makes at most $k$ changes to its output independent set or dominating set upon the arrival of each vertex. We study trade-offs between the stability parameter $k$ of the algorithm and the approximation ratio it achieves. We obtain the following results. 1. We show that there is a constant $\varepsilon^*&gt;0$ such that any dynamic $(1+\varepsilon^*)$-approximation algorithm the for Dominating set problem has stability parameter $\Omega(n)$, even for bipartite graphs of maximum degree 4. 2. We present algorithms with very small stability parameters for the Dominating set problem in the setting where the arrival degree of each vertex is upper bounded by $d$. In particular, we give a $1$-stable $(d+1)^2$-approximation algorithm, a $3$-stable $(9d/2)$-approximation algorithm, and an $O(d)$-stable $O(1)$-approximation algorithm. 3. We show that there is a constant $\varepsilon^*&gt;0$ such that any dynamic $(1+\varepsilon^*)$-approximation algorithm for the Independent Set Problem has stability parameter $\Omega(n)$, even for bipartite graphs of maximum degree $3$. 4. Finally, we present a $2$-stable $O(d)$-approximation algorithm for the Independent Set Problem, in the setting where the average degree of the graph is upper bounded by some constant $d$ at all times. We extend this latter algorithm to the fully dynamic model where vertices can also be deleted, achieving a $6$-stable $O(d)$-approximation algorithm.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Substring and Document Counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential privacy is the gold standard for privacy in data analysis. In many data analysis applications, the data is a database of documents. For databases consisting of many documents, one of the most fundamental problems is that of pattern matching and computing (i) how often a pattern appears as a substring in the database (substring counting) and (ii) how many documents in the collection contain the pattern as a substring (document counting). In this paper, we initiate the theoretical study of substring and document counting under differential privacy.
  We give an $\epsilon$-differentially private data structure solving this problem for all patterns simultaneously with a maximum additive error of $O(\ell \cdot\mathrm{polylog}(n\ell|\Sigma|))$, where $\ell$ is the maximum length of a document in the database, $n$ is the number of documents, and $|\Sigma|$ is the size of the alphabet. We show that this is optimal up to a $O(\mathrm{polylog}(n\ell))$ factor. Further, we show that for $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy, the bound for document counting can be improved to $O(\sqrt{\ell} \cdot\mathrm{polylog}(n\ell|\Sigma|))$. Additionally, our data structures are efficient. In particular, our data structures use $O(n\ell^2)$ space, $O(n^2\ell^4)$ preprocessing time, and $O(|P|)$ query time where $P$ is the query pattern. Along the way, we develop a new technique for differentially privately computing a general class of counting functions on trees of independent interest.
  Our data structures immediately lead to improved algorithms for related problems, such as privately mining frequent substrings and $q$-grams. For $q$-grams, we further improve the preprocessing time of the data structure.</description>

      <title>Assessing fault-tolerant quantum advantage for $k$-SAT with structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For many problems, quantum algorithms promise speedups over their classical counterparts. However, these results predominantly rely on asymptotic worst-case analysis, which overlooks significant overheads due to error correction and the fact that real-world instances often contain exploitable structure. In this work, we employ the hybrid benchmarking method to evaluate the potential of quantum Backtracking and Grover's algorithm against the 2023 SAT competition main track winner in solving random $k$-SAT instances with tunable structure, designed to represent industry-like scenarios, using both $T$-depth and $T$-count as cost metrics to estimate quantum run times. Our findings reproduce the results of Campbell, Khurana, and Montanaro (Quantum '19) in the unstructured case using hybrid benchmarking. However, we offer a more sobering perspective in practically relevant regimes: almost all quantum speedups vanish, even asymptotically, when minimal structure is introduced or when $T$-count is considered instead of $T$-depth. Moreover, when the requirement is for the algorithm to find a solution within a single day, we find that only Grover's algorithm has the potential to outperform classical algorithms, but only in a very limited regime and only when using $T$-depth. We also discuss how more sophisticated heuristics could restore the asymptotic scaling advantage for quantum backtracking, but our findings suggest that the potential for practical quantum speedups in more structured $k$-SAT solving will remain limited.</description>

      <title>An Enumerative Perspective on Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12889v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Connectivity (or equivalently, unweighted maximum flow) is an important measure in graph theory and combinatorial optimization. Given a graph $G$ with vertices $s$ and $t$, the connectivity $\lambda(s,t)$ from $s$ to $t$ is defined to be the maximum number of edge-disjoint paths from $s$ to $t$ in $G$.
  Much research has gone into designing fast algorithms for computing connectivities in graphs. Previous work showed that it is possible to compute connectivities for all pairs of vertices in directed graphs with $m$ edges in $\tilde{O}(m^\omega)$ time [Chueng, Lau, and Leung, FOCS 2011], where $\omega \in [2,2.3716)$ is the exponent of matrix multiplication. For the related problem of computing "small connectivities," it was recently shown that for any positive integer $k$, we can compute $\min(k,\lambda(s,t))$ for all pairs of vertices $(s,t)$ in a directed graph with $n$ nodes in $\tilde{O}((kn)^\omega)$ time [Akmal and Jin, ICALP 2023].
  In this paper, we present an alternate exposition of these $\tilde{O}(m^\omega)$ and $\tilde{O}((kn)^\omega)$ time algorithms, with simpler proofs of correctness. Earlier proofs were somewhat indirect, introducing an elegant but ad hoc "flow vector framework" for showing correctness of these algorithms. In contrast, we observe that these algorithms for computing exact and small connectivity values can be interpreted as testing whether certain generating functions enumerating families of edge-disjoint paths are nonzero. This new perspective yields more transparent proofs, and ties the approach for these problems more closely to the literature surrounding algebraic graph algorithms.</description>

      <title>Sinkhorn Algorithm for Sequentially Composed Optimal Transports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03120v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sinkhorn algorithm is the de-facto standard approximation algorithm for optimal transport, which has been applied to a variety of applications, including image processing and natural language processing. In theory, the proof of its convergence follows from the convergence of the Sinkhorn--Knopp algorithm for the matrix scaling problem, and Altschuler et al. show that its worst-case time complexity is in near-linear time. Very recently, sequentially composed optimal transports were proposed by Watanabe and Isobe as a hierarchical extension of optimal transports. In this paper, we present an efficient approximation algorithm, namely Sinkhorn algorithm for sequentially composed optimal transports, for its entropic regularization. Furthermore, we present a theoretical analysis of the Sinkhorn algorithm, namely (i) its exponential convergence to the optimal solution with respect to the Hilbert pseudometric, and (ii) a worst-case complexity analysis for the case of one sequential composition.</description>

      <title>Satisfying the Restricted Isometry Property with the Optimal Number of Rows and Slightly Less Randomness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A matrix $\Phi \in \mathbb{R}^{Q \times N}$ satisfies the restricted isometry property if $\|\Phi x\|_2^2$ is approximately equal to $\|x\|_2^2$ for all $k$-sparse vectors $x$. We give a construction of RIP matrices with the optimal $Q = O(k \log(N/k))$ rows using $O(k\log(N/k)\log(k))$ bits of randomness. The main technical ingredient is an extension of the Hanson-Wright inequality to $\epsilon$-biased distributions.</description>
