      <title>The new science of COVID-19: A Bibliographic and Network Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the outbreak of the COVID-19, there have been many scientific publications studying the COVID-19. The purpose of this study is to identify the research trend, collaboration pattern, most influential elements, etc. from scientific publications related to COVID-19 in 2020, by using bibliographic analysis and network analysis. In Chapter 1 and Chapter 2, motivation behind this paper is introduced. Some previous similar studies are discussed. Comparisons are made in different aspects, such as data collection methods, data analysis tools and methods, etc. Their advantages and limitations compared to this paper are also addressed. In Chapter 3, important concepts used in this paper related to bibliographic analysis such as h-index and g-index, and network analysis such as centrality measures and assortativity are introduced. Networks with small-world property and scale-free property will also be studied. In Chapter 4 and Chapter 5, the way the data are obtained for the analysis of this paper is introduced step by step. Full result is shown. In Chapter 6, conclusions are arrived. A general growing trend of the number of the publications is observed, due to the efforts made by scientific researchers. Meanwhile, measures should also be taken to encourage future study in this field.</description>

      <title>Estimating global article processing charges paid to six publishers for open access between 2019 and 2023</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents estimates of the global expenditure on article processing charges (APCs) paid to six publishers for open access between 2019 and 2023. APCs are fees charged for publishing in some fully open access journals (gold) and in subscription journals to make individual articles open access (hybrid). There is currently no way to systematically track institutional, national or global expenses for open access publishing due to a lack of transparency in APC prices, what articles they are paid for, or who pays them. We therefore curated and used an open dataset of annual APC list prices from Elsevier, Frontiers, MDPI, PLOS, Springer Nature, and Wiley in combination with the number of open access articles from these publishers indexed by OpenAlex to estimate that, globally, a total of \$8.349 billion (\$8.968 billion in 2023 US dollars) were spent on APCs between 2019 and 2023. We estimate that in 2023 MDPI (\$681.6 million), Elsevier (\$582.8 million) and Springer Nature (\$546.6) generated the most revenue with APCs. After adjusting for inflation, we also show that annual spending almost tripled from \$910.3 million in 2019 to \$2.538 billion in 2023, that hybrid exceed gold fees, and that the median APCs paid are higher than the median listed fees for both gold and hybrid. Our approach addresses major limitations in previous efforts to estimate APCs paid and offers much needed insight into an otherwise opaque aspect of the business of scholarly publishing. We call upon publishers to be more transparent about OA fees.</description>

      <title>Decoding Digital Influence: The Role of Social Media Behavior in Scientific Stratification Through Logistic Attribution Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientific social stratification is a classic theme in the sociology of science. The deep integration of social media has bridged the gap between scientometrics and sociology of science. This study comprehensively analyzes the impact of social media on scientific stratification and mobility, delving into the complex interplay between academic status and social media activity in the digital age. [Research Method] Innovatively, this paper employs An Explainable Logistic Attribution Analysis from a meso-level perspective to explore the correlation between social media behaviors and scientific social stratification. It examines the impact of scientists' use of social media in the digital age on scientific stratification and mobility, uniquely combining statistical methods with machine learning. This fusion effectively integrates hypothesis testing with a substantive interpretation of the contribution of independent variables to the model. [Research Conclusion] Empirical evidence demonstrates that social media promotes stratification and mobility within the scientific community, revealing a nuanced and non-linear facilitation mechanism. Social media activities positively impact scientists' status within the scientific social hierarchy to a certain extent, but beyond a specific threshold, this impact turns negative. It shows that the advent of social media has opened new channels for academic influence, transcending the limitations of traditional academic publishing, and prompting changes in scientific stratification. Additionally, the study acknowledges the limitations of its experimental design and suggests future research directions.</description>

      <title>Position: AI/ML Influencers Have a Place in the Academic Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13782v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the number of accepted papers at AI and ML conferences reaches into the thousands, it has become unclear how researchers access and read research publications. In this paper, we investigate the role of social media influencers in enhancing the visibility of machine learning research, particularly the citation counts of papers they share. We have compiled a comprehensive dataset of over 8,000 papers, spanning tweets from December 2018 to October 2023, alongside controls precisely matched by 9 key covariates. Our statistical and causal inference analysis reveals a significant increase in citations for papers endorsed by these influencers, with median citation counts 2-3 times higher than those of the control group. Additionally, the study delves into the geographic, gender, and institutional diversity of highlighted authors. Given these findings, we advocate for a responsible approach to curation, encouraging influencers to uphold the journalistic standard that includes showcasing diverse research topics, authors, and institutions.</description>
