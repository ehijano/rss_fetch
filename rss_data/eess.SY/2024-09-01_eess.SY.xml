      <title>Asymptotically Stable Data-Driven Koopman Operator Approximation with Inputs using Total Extended DMD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Koopman operator framework can be used to identify a data-driven model of a nonlinear system. Unfortunately, when the data is corrupted by noise, the identified model can be biased. Additionally, depending on the choice of lifting functions, the identified model can be unstable, even when the underlying system is asymptotically stable. This paper presents an approach to reduce the bias in an approximate Koopman model, and simultaneously ensure asymptotic stability, when using noisy data. Additionally, the proposed data-driven modeling approach is applicable to systems with inputs, such as a known forcing function or a control input. Specifically, bias is reduced by using a total least-squares, modified to accommodate inputs in addition to lifted inputs. To enforce asymptotic stability of the approximate Koopman model, linear matrix inequality constraints are augmented to the identification problem. The performance of the proposed method is then compared to the well-known extended dynamic mode decomposition method and to the newly introduced forward-backward extended dynamic mode decomposition method using a simulated Duffing oscillator dataset and experimental soft robot arm dataset.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Errors in Controlled Turret System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to characterize aiming errors in controlled weapon systems given target location as input. To achieve this objective, we analyze the accuracy of a controlled weapon system model for stationary and moving targets under different error sources and firing times. First, we develop a mathematical model of a gun turret and use it to design two controllers, a Proportional-Integral-Derivative controller and a Model Predictive controller, which accept the target location input and move the turret to the centroid of the target in simulations. For stationary targets, we analyze the impact of errors in estimating the system's parameters and uncertainty in the aim point measurement. Our results indicate that turret movement is more sensitive to errors in the moment of inertia than the damping coefficient, which could lead to incorrect simulations of controlled turret system accuracy. The results also support the hypothesis that turret movement errors are larger over longer distances of gun turret movement and, assuming no time constraints, accuracy improves the longer one waits to fire; though this may not always be practical in a combat scenario. Additionally, we demonstrate that the integral control component is needed for high accuracy in moving target scenarios.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Polarization in Recommender Systems via Network-aware Feedback Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a recommender system that takes into account the interaction between recommendations and the evolution of user interests. Users opinions are influenced by both social interactions and recommended content. We leverage online feedback optimization to design a recommender system that trades-off between maximizing engagement and minimizing polarization. The recommender system is agnostic about users' opinion, clicking behavior, and social interactions, and solely relies on clicks. We establish optimality and closed-loop stability of the resulting feedback interconnection between the social platform and the recommender system. We numerically validate our algorithm when the user population follows an extended Friedkin--Johnsen model. We observe that network-aware recommendations significantly reduce polarization without compromising user engagement.</description>

      <title>On Fixed-Time Stability for a Class of Singularly Perturbed Systems using Composite Lyapunov Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fixed-time stable dynamical systems are capable of achieving exact convergence to an equilibrium point within a fixed time that is independent of the initial conditions of the system. This property makes them highly appealing for designing control, estimation, and optimization algorithms in applications with stringent performance requirements. However, the set of tools available for analyzing the interconnection of fixed-time stable systems is rather limited compared to their asymptotic counterparts. In this paper, we address some of these limitations by exploiting the emergence of multiple time scales in nonlinear singularly perturbed dynamical systems, where the fast dynamics and the slow dynamics are fixed-time stable on their own. By extending the so-called composite Lyapunov method from asymptotic stability to the context of fixed-time stability, we provide a novel class of Lyapunov-based sufficient conditions to certify fixed-time stability in a class of singularly perturbed dynamical systems. The results are illustrated, analytically and numerically, using a fixed-time gradient flow system interconnected with a fixed-time plant and an additional high-order example.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Errors in Controlled Turret System Given Target Location Input from Artificial Intelligence Methods in Automatic Target Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we assess the movement error of a targeting system given target location data from artificial intelligence (AI) methods in automatic target recognition (ATR) systems. Few studies evaluate the impacts on the accuracy in moving a targeting system to an aimpoint provided in this manner. To address this knowledge gap, we assess the performance of a controlled gun turret system given target location from an object detector developed from AI methods. In our assessment, we define a measure of object detector error and examine the correlations with several standard metrics in object detection. We then statistically analyze the object detector error data and turret movement error data acquired from controlled targeting simulations, as well as their aggregate error, to examine the impact on turret movement accuracy. Finally, we study the correlations between additional metrics and the probability of a hit. The results indicate that AI technologies are a significant source of error to targeting systems. Moreover, the results suggest that metrics such as the confidence score, intersection-over-union, average precision and average recall are predictors of accuracy against stationary targets with our system parameters.</description>

      <title>Efficient Dual-Band Single-Port Rectifier for RF Energy Harvesting at FM and GSM Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an efficient dual-band rectifier for radiofrequency energy harvesting (RFEH) applications at FM and GSM bands. The single-port rectifier circuit, which comprises a 3-port network, optimized T-matching circuits and voltage doubler, is designed, simulated and fabricated to obtain a high RF-to-DC power conversion efficiency (PCE). Measurement results show PCE of 26% and 22% at -20 dBm, and also 58% and 51% at -10 dBm with a maximum amount of 69% and 65% at -2.5 dBm and -5 dBm, with single tone at 95 and 925 MHz, respectively. Besides, the fractional bandwidth of 21% at FM and 11% at GSM band is achieved. The measurement and simulation results are in good agreement. Consequently, the proposed rectifier can be a potential candidate for ambient RF energy harvesting and wireless power transfer (WPT). It should be noted that a 3-port network as a duplexer is designed to be integrated with single-port antennas which cover both FM and GSM bands as a low-cost solution. Moreover, based on simulation results, PCE has small variations when the load resistor varies from 10 to 18 k$\Omega$. Therefore, this rectifier can be utilized for any desired resistance within the range, such as sensors and IoT devices.</description>

      <title>iCPS-DL: A Description Language for Autonomic Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern industrial systems require frequent updates to their cyber and physical infrastructures, which often demand considerable reconfiguration effort. This paper introduces a framework to automate this process, implemented as the industrial Cyber-Physical Systems Description Language, iCPSDL. This framework maps an industrial process as a knowledge graph, which includes information about physical and cyber-physical components, a state estimation model, and software component interaction. A novel aspect is the use of communication semantics to ensure correct interaction among distributed entities. Reasoning on the knowledge graph facilitates the configuration of cyber-physical elements in an industrial system. A case study in the Water Distribution Networks domain demonstrates the framework's application.</description>

      <title>Filtering in Projection-based Integrators for Improved Phase Characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Projection-based integrators are effectively employed in high-precision systems with growing industrial success. By utilizing a projection operator, the resulting projection-based integrator keeps its input-output pair within a designated sector set, leading to unique freedom in control design that can be directly translated into performance benefits. This paper aims to enhance projection-based integrators by incorporating well-crafted linear filters into its structure, resulting in a new class of projected integrators that includes the earlier ones, such as the hybrid-integrator gain systems (with and without pre-filtering) as special cases. The extra design freedom in the form of two filters in the input paths to the projection operator and the internal dynamics allows the controller to break away from the inherent limitations of the linear control design. The enhanced performance properties of the proposed structure are formally demonstrated through a (quasi-linear) describing function analysis, the absence of the gain-loss problem, and numerical case studies showcasing improved time-domain properties. The describing function analysis is supported by rigorously showing incremental properties of the new filtered projection-based integrators thereby guaranteeing that the computed steady-state responses are unique and asymptotically stable.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Blockchain and ANFIS for Optimal Supply Chain Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The supply chain is a critical segment of the product manufacturing cycle, continuously influenced by risky, uncertain, and undesirable events. Optimizing flexibility in the supply chain presents a complex, multi-objective, and nonlinear programming challenge. In the poultry supply chain, the development of mass customization capabilities has led manufacturing companies to increasingly focus on offering tailored and customized services for individual products. To safeguard against data tampering and ensure the integrity of setup costs and overall profitability, a multi-signature decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, integrated with the IoT on a blockchain platform, is proposed. Managing the poultry supply chain involves uncertainties that may not account for parameters such as delivery time to retailers, reorder time, and the number of requested products. To address these challenges, this study employs an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), combining neural networks with fuzzy logic to compensate for the lack of data training in parameter identification. Through MATLAB simulations, the study investigates the average shop delivery duration, the reorder time, and the number of products per order. By implementing the proposed technique, the average delivery time decreases from 40 to 37 minutes, the reorder time decreases from five to four days, and the quantity of items requested per order grows from six to eleven. Additionally, the ANFIS model enhances overall supply chain performance by reducing transaction times by 15\% compared to conventional systems, thereby improving real-time responsiveness and boosting transparency in supply chain operations, effectively resolving operational issues.</description>

      <title>Robust model predictive control exploiting monotonicity properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust model predictive control algorithms are essential for addressing unavoidable errors due to the uncertainty in predicting real-world systems. However, the formulation of such algorithms typically results in a trade-off between conservatism and computational complexity. Monotone systems facilitate the efficient computation of reachable sets and thus the straightforward formulation of a robust model predictive control approach optimizing over open-loop predictions. We present an approach based on the division of reachable sets to incorporate feedback in the predictions, resulting in less conservative strategies. The concept of mixed-monotonicity enables an extension of our methodology to non-monotone systems. The potential of the proposed approaches is demonstrated through a nonlinear high-dimensional chemical tank reactor cascade case study.</description>

      <title>Secure Integrated Sensing and Communication Under Correlated Rayleigh Fading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a secure integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) scenario, in which a signal is transmitted through a state-dependent wiretap channel with one legitimate receiver with which the transmitter communicates and one honest-but-curious target that the transmitter wants to sense. The secure ISAC channel is modeled as two state-dependent fast-fading channels with correlated Rayleigh fading coefficients and independent additive Gaussian noise components. Delayed channel outputs are fed back to the transmitter to improve the communication performance and to estimate the channel state sequence. We establish and illustrate an achievable secrecy-distortion region for degraded secure ISAC channels under correlated Rayleigh fading. We also evaluate the inner bound for a large set of parameters to derive practical design insights for secure ISAC methods. The presented results include in particular parameter ranges for which the secrecy capacity of a classical wiretap channel setup is surpassed and for which the channel capacity is approached.</description>

      <title>Particle Flows for Source Localization in 3-D Using TDOA Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Localization using time-difference of arrival (TDOA) has myriad applications, e.g., in passive surveillance systems and marine mammal research. In this paper, we present a Bayesian estimation method that can localize an unknown number of static sources in 3-D based on TDOA measurements. The proposed localization algorithm based on particle flow (PFL) can overcome the challenges related to the highly nonlinear TDOA measurement model, the data association (DA) uncertainty, and the uncertainty in the number of sources to be localized. Different PFL strategies are compared within a unified belief propagation (BP) framework in a challenging multisensor source localization problem. In particular, we consider PFL-based approximation of beliefs based on one or multiple Gaussian kernels with parameters computed using deterministic and stochastic flow processes. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method can correctly determine the number of sources and provide accurate location estimates. The stochastic flow demonstrates greater accuracy compared to the deterministic flow when using the same number of particles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exponential increase in the number of devices connected to the internet globally has led to the requirement for the introduction of better and improved security measures for maintaining data integrity. The development of a wireless and authenticated communication system is required to overcome the safety threats and illegal access to the application system/data. The WIA-Comm System is the one that provides a bridge to control the devices at the application side. It has been designed to provide security by giving control rights only to the device whose MAC (physical) address has already been registered, so only authorized users can control the system. LoRa WAN technology has been used for wireless communication and Arduino IDE to develop the code for the required functionality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we address distributed learning problems over peer-to-peer networks. In particular, we focus on the challenges of quantized communications, asynchrony, and stochastic gradients that arise in this set-up. We first discuss how to turn the presence of quantized communications into an advantage, by resorting to a finite-time, quantized coordination scheme. This scheme is combined with a distributed gradient descent method to derive the proposed algorithm. Secondly, we show how this algorithm can be adapted to allow asynchronous operations of the agents, as well as the use of stochastic gradients. Finally, we propose a variant of the algorithm which employs zooming-in quantization. We analyze the convergence of the proposed methods and compare them to state-of-the-art alternatives.</description>

      <title>Learning and Verifying Maximal Taylor-Neural Lyapunov functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel neural network architecture, termed Taylor-neural Lyapunov functions, designed to approximate Lyapunov functions with formal certification. This architecture innovatively encodes local approximations and extends them globally by leveraging neural networks to approximate the residuals. Our method recasts the problem of estimating the largest region of attraction - specifically for maximal Lyapunov functions - into a learning problem, ensuring convergence around the origin through robust control theory. Physics-informed machine learning techniques further refine the estimation of the largest region of attraction. Remarkably, this method is versatile, operating effectively even without simulated data points. We validate the efficacy of our approach by providing numerical certificates of convergence across multiple examples. Our proposed methodology not only competes closely with state-of-the-art approaches, such as sum-of-squares and LyZNet, but also achieves comparable results even in the absence of simulated data. This work represents a significant advancement in control theory, with broad potential applications in the design of stable control systems and beyond.</description>

      <title>Regular Pairings for Non-quadratic Lyapunov Functions and Contraction Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies on stability and contractivity have highlighted the importance of semi-inner products, which we refer to as ``pairings'', associated with general norms. A pairing is a binary operation that relates the derivative of a curve's norm to the radius-vector of the curve and its tangent. This relationship, known as the curve norm derivative formula, is crucial when using the norm as a Lyapunov function. Another important property of the pairing, used in stability and contraction criteria, is the so-called Lumer inequality, which relates the pairing to the induced logarithmic norm. We prove that the curve norm derivative formula and Lumer's inequality are, in fact, equivalent to each other and to several simpler properties. We then introduce and characterize regular pairings that satisfy all of these properties. Our results unify several independent theories of pairings (semi-inner products) developed in previous work on functional analysis and control theory. Additionally, we introduce the polyhedral max pairing and develop computational tools for polyhedral norms, advancing contraction theory in non-Euclidean spaces.</description>

      <title>Information-Based Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Absolute Tracking in Cislunar Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The resurgence of lunar operations requires advancements in cislunar navigation and Space Situational Awareness (SSA). Challenges associated to these tasks have created an interest in autonomous planning, navigation, and tracking technologies that operate with little ground-based intervention. This research introduces a trajectory planning tool for a low-thrust mobile observer, aimed at maximizing navigation and tracking performance with satellite-to-satellite relative measurements. We formulate an expression for the information gathered over an observation period based on the mutual information between augmented observer/target states and the associated measurement set collected. We then develop an optimal trajectory design problem for a mobile observer, balancing information gain and control effort, and solve this problem with a Sequential Convex Programming (SCP) approach. The developed methods are demonstrated in scenarios involving spacecraft in the cislunar regime, demonstrating the potential for improved autonomous navigation and tracking.</description>

      <title>Empowering Aggregators with Practical Data-Driven Tools: Harnessing Aggregated and Disaggregated Flexibility for Demand Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10726v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores the interaction between aggregators and building occupants in activating flexibility through Demand Response (DR) programs, with a focus on reinforcing the resilience of the energy system considering the uncertainties presented by Renewable Energy Sources (RES). Firstly, it introduces a methodology of optimizing aggregated flexibility provision strategies in environments with limited data, utilizing Discrete Fourier Transformation (DFT) and clustering techniques to identify building occupants' activity patterns. Secondly, the study assesses the disaggregated flexibility provision of Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems during DR events, employing machine learning and optimization techniques for precise, device-level analysis. The first approach offers a non-intrusive pathway for aggregators to provide flexibility services in environments of a single smart meter for the whole building's consumption, while the second approach maximizes the amount of flexibility in the case of dedicated metering devices to the HVAC systems by carefully considering building occupants' thermal comfort profiles. Through the application of data-driven techniques and encompassing case studies from both industrial and residential buildings, this paper not only unveils pivotal opportunities for aggregators in the balancing and emerging flexibility markets but also successfully develops and demonstrates end-to-end practical tools for aggregators.</description>

      <title>GPU-Accelerated DCOPF using Gradient-Based Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: DC Optimal Power Flow (DCOPF) is a key operational tool for power system operators, and it is embedded as a subproblem in many challenging optimization problems (e.g., line switching). However, traditional CPU-based solve routines (e.g., simplex) have saturated in speed and are hard to parallelize. This paper focuses on solving DCOPF problems using gradient-based routines on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), which have massive parallelization capability. To formulate these problems, we pose a Lagrange dual associated with DCOPF (linear and quadratic cost curves), and then we explicitly solve the inner (primal) minimization problem with a dual norm. The resulting dual problem can be efficiently iterated using projected gradient ascent. After solving the dual problem on both CPUs and GPUs to find tight lower bounds, we benchmark against Gurobi and MOSEK, comparing convergence speed and tightness on the IEEE 2000 and 10000 bus systems. We provide reliable and tight lower bounds for these problems with, at best, 5.4x speedup over a conventional solver.</description>

      <title>Dirichlet Logistic Gaussian Processes for Evaluation of Black-Box Stochastic Systems under Complex Requirements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The requirement-driven performance evaluation of a black-box cyber-physical system (CPS) that utilizes machine learning methods has proven to be an effective way to assess the quality of the CPS. However, the distributional evaluation of the performance has been poorly considered. Although many uncertainty estimation methods have been advocated, they have not successfully estimated highly complex performance distributions under small data. In this paper, we propose a method to distributionally evaluate the performance under complex requirements using small input-trajectory data. To handle the unknown complex probability distributions under small data, we discretize the corresponding performance measure, yielding a discrete random process over an input region. Then, we propose a semiparametric Bayesian model of the discrete process based on a Dirichlet random field whose parameter function is represented by multiple logistic Gaussian processes (LGPs). The Dirichlet posterior parameter function is estimated through the LGP posteriors in a reasonable and conservative fashion. We show that the proposed Bayesian model converges to the true discrete random process as the number of data becomes large enough. We also empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by simulation.</description>

      <title>Fixed-time Disturbance Observer-Based MPC Robust Trajectory Tracking Control of Quadrotor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a fixed-time disturbance observerbased model predictive control algorithm is proposed for trajectory tracking of quadrotor in the presence of disturbances. First, a novel multivariable fixed-time disturbance observer is proposed to estimate the lumped disturbances. The bi-limit homogeneity and Lyapunov techniques are employed to ensure the convergence of estimation error within a fixed convergence time, independent of the initial estimation error. Then, an observerbased model predictive control strategy is formulated to achieve robust trajectory tracking of quadrotor, attenuating the lumped disturbances and model uncertainties. Finally, simulations and real-world experiments are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Iterative Thresholding and Projection Algorithms and Model-Based Deep Neural Networks for Sparse LQR Control Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.02929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider an LQR design problem for distributed control systems. For large-scale distributed systems, finding a solution might be computationally demanding due to communications among agents. To this aim, we deal with LQR minimization problem with a regularization for sparse feedback matrix, which can lead to achieve the reduction of the communication links in the distributed control systems. For this work, we introduce simple but efficient iterative algorithms -- Iterative Shrinkage Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA) and Iterative Sparse Projection Algorithm (ISPA). They can give us a trade-off solution between LQR cost and sparsity level on feedback matrix. Moreover, in order to improve the speed of the proposed algorithms, we design deep neural network models based on the proposed iterative algorithms. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our algorithms can outperform the previous methods using the Alternating Direction Method of Multiplier (ADMM) [2] and the Gradient Support Pursuit (GraSP) [3], and their deep neural network models can improve the performance of the proposed algorithms in convergence speed.</description>

      <title>On Robust Reinforcement Learning with Lipschitz-Bounded Policy Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a study of robust policy networks in deep reinforcement learning. We investigate the benefits of policy parameterizations that naturally satisfy constraints on their Lipschitz bound, analyzing their empirical performance and robustness on two representative problems: pendulum swing-up and Atari Pong. We illustrate that policy networks with smaller Lipschitz bounds are more robust to disturbances, random noise, and targeted adversarial attacks than unconstrained policies composed of vanilla multi-layer perceptrons or convolutional neural networks. However, the structure of the Lipschitz layer is important. We find that the widely-used method of spectral normalization is too conservative and severely impacts clean performance, whereas more expressive Lipschitz layers such as the recently-proposed Sandwich layer can achieve improved robustness without sacrificing clean performance.</description>
