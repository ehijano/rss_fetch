      <title>ATLAS: Adaptive Trading with LLM AgentS Through Dynamic Prompt Optimization and Multi-Agent Coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models show promise for financial decision-making, yet deploying them as autonomous trading agents raises fundamental challenges: how to adapt instructions when rewards arrive late and obscured by market noise, how to synthesize heterogeneous information streams into coherent decisions, and how to bridge the gap between model outputs and executable market actions. We present ATLAS (Adaptive Trading with LLM AgentS), a unified multi-agent framework that integrates structured information from markets, news, and corporate fundamentals to support robust trading decisions. Within ATLAS, the central trading agent operates in an order-aware action space, ensuring that outputs correspond to executable market orders rather than abstract signals. The agent can incorporate feedback while trading using Adaptive-OPRO, a novel prompt-optimization technique that dynamically adapts the prompt by incorporating real-time, stochastic feedback, leading to increasing performance over time. Across regime-specific equity studies and multiple LLM families, Adaptive-OPRO consistently outperforms fixed prompts, while reflection-based feedback fails to provide systematic gains.</description>

      <title>On Bellman equation in the limit order optimization problem for high-frequency trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An approximation method for construction of optimal strategies in the bid \&amp; ask limit order book in the high-frequency trading (HFT) is studied. The basis is the article by M. Avellaneda \&amp; S. Stoikov 2008, in which certain seemingly serious gaps have been found; in the present paper they are carefully corrected. However, a bit surprisingly, our corrections do not change the main answer in the cited paper, so that, in fact, the gaps turn out to be unimportant. An explanation of this effect is offered.</description>

      <title>The Invisible Handshake: Tacit Collusion between Adaptive Market Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the emergence of tacit collusion between adaptive trading agents in a stochastic market with endogenous price formation. Using a two-player repeated game between a market maker and a market taker, we characterize feasible and collusive strategy profiles that raise prices beyond competitive levels. We show that, when agents follow simple learning algorithms (e.g., gradient ascent) to maximize their own wealth, the resulting dynamics converge to collusive strategy profiles, even in highly liquid markets with small trade sizes. By highlighting how simple learning strategies naturally lead to tacit collusion, our results offer new insights into the dynamics of AI-driven markets.</description>

      <title>FinFlowRL: An Imitation-Reinforcement Learning Framework for Adaptive Stochastic Control in Finance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional stochastic control methods in finance struggle in real world markets due to their reliance on simplifying assumptions and stylized frameworks. Such methods typically perform well in specific, well defined environments but yield suboptimal results in changed, non stationary ones. We introduce FinFlowRL, a novel framework for financial optimal stochastic control. The framework pretrains an adaptive meta policy learning from multiple expert strategies, then finetunes through reinforcement learning in the noise space to optimize the generative process. By employing action chunking generating action sequences rather than single decisions, it addresses the non Markovian nature of markets. FinFlowRL consistently outperforms individually optimized experts across diverse market conditions.</description>

      <title>Tail-Safe Stochastic-Control SPX-VIX Hedging: A White-Box Bridge Between AI Sensitivities and Arbitrage-Free Market Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a white-box, risk-sensitive framework for jointly hedging SPX and VIX exposures under transaction costs and regime shifts. The approach couples an arbitrage-free market teacher with a control layer that enforces safety as constraints. On the market side, we integrate an SSVI-based implied-volatility surface and a Cboe-compliant VIX computation (including wing pruning and 30-day interpolation), and connect prices to dynamics via a clipped, convexity-preserving Dupire local-volatility extractor. On the control side, we pose hedging as a small quadratic program with control-barrier-function (CBF) boxes for inventory, rate, and tail risk; a sufficient-descent execution gate that trades only when risk drop justifies cost; and three targeted tail-safety upgrades: a correlation/expiry-aware VIX weight, guarded no-trade bands, and expiry-aware micro-trade thresholds with cooldown. We prove existence/uniqueness and KKT regularity of the per-step QP, forward invariance of safety sets, one-step risk descent when the gate opens, and no chattering with bounded trade rates. For the dynamics layer, we establish positivity and second-order consistency of the discrete Dupire estimator and give an index-coherence bound linking the teacher VIX to a CIR-style proxy with explicit quadrature and projection errors. In a reproducible synthetic environment mirroring exchange rules and execution frictions, the controller reduces expected shortfall while suppressing nuisance turnover, and the teacher-surface construction keeps index-level residuals small and stable.</description>

      <title>Trading with the Devil: Risk and Return in Foundation Model Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models - already transformative in domains such as natural language processing - are now starting to emerge for time-series tasks in finance. While these pretrained architectures promise versatile predictive signals, little is known about how they shape the risk profiles of the trading strategies built atop them, leaving practitioners reluctant to commit serious capital. In this paper, we propose an extension to the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) that disentangles the systematic risk introduced by a shared foundation model - potentially capable of generating alpha if the underlying model is genuinely predictive - from the idiosyncratic risk attributable to custom fine-tuning, which typically accrues no systematic premium. To enable a practical estimation of these separate risks, we align this decomposition with the concepts of uncertainty disentanglement, casting systematic risk as epistemic uncertainty (rooted in the pretrained model) and idiosyncratic risk as aleatory uncertainty (introduced during custom adaptations). Under the Aleatory Collapse Assumption, we illustrate how Monte Carlo dropout - among other methods in the uncertainty-quantization toolkit - can directly measure the epistemic risk, thereby mapping trading strategies to a more transparent risk-return plane. Our experiments show that isolating these distinct risk factors yields deeper insights into the performance limits of foundation-model-based strategies, their model degradation over time, and potential avenues for targeted refinements. Taken together, our results highlight both the promise and the pitfalls of deploying large pretrained models in competitive financial markets.</description>

      <title>Optimal Exit Time for Liquidity Providers in Automated Market Makers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of optimal liquidity withdrawal for a representative liquidity provider (LP) in an automated market maker (AMM). LPs earn fees from trading activity but are exposed to impermanent loss (IL) due to price fluctuations. While existing work has focused on static provision and exogenous exit strategies, we characterise the optimal exit time as the solution to a stochastic control problem with an endogenous stopping time. Mathematically, the LP's value function is shown to satisfy a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman quasi-variational inequality, for which we establish uniqueness in the viscosity sense. To solve the problem numerically, we develop two complementary approaches: a Euler scheme based on operator splitting and a Longstaff-Schwartz regression method. Calibrated simulations highlight how the LP's optimal exit strategy depends on the oracle price volatility, fee levels, and the behaviour of arbitrageurs and noise traders. Our results show that while arbitrage generates both fees and IL, the LP's optimal decision balances these opposing effects based on the pool state variables and price misalignments. Lastly, we find the optimal fee level for the representative LP when they play the exit strategy we derived. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of dynamic liquidity provision in AMMs and provides insights into the sustainability of passive LP strategies under different market regimes.</description>
