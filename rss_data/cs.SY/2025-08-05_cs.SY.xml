      <title>Cross-Process Defect Attribution using Potential Loss Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-process root-cause analysis of wafer defects is among the most critical yet challenging tasks in semiconductor manufacturing due to the heterogeneity and combinatorial nature of processes along the processing route. This paper presents a new framework for wafer defect root cause analysis, called Potential Loss Analysis (PLA), as a significant enhancement of the previously proposed partial trajectory regression approach. The PLA framework attributes observed high wafer defect densities to upstream processes by comparing the best possible outcomes generated by partial processing trajectories. We show that the task of identifying the best possible outcome can be reduced to solving a Bellman equation. Remarkably, the proposed framework can simultaneously solve the prediction problem for defect density as well as the attribution problem for defect scores. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework using real wafer history data.</description>

      <title>A Kalman Filter Algorithm with Process Noise Covariance Update</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic models in biomolecular contexts can have a state-dependent process noise covariance. The choice of the process noise covariance is an important parameter in the design of a Kalman Filter for state estimation and the theoretical guarantees of updating the process noise covariance as the state estimate changes are unclear. Here we investigated this issue using the Minimum Mean Square Error estimator framework and an interpretation of the Kalman Filter as minimizing a weighted least squares cost using Newton's method. We found that a Kalman Filter-like algorithm with a process noise covariance update is the best linear unbiased estimator for a class of systems with linear process dynamics and a square root-dependence of the process noise covariance on the state. We proved the result for discrete-time system dynamics and then extended it to continuous-time dynamics using a limiting procedure. For nonlinear dynamics with a general dependence of process noise covariance on the state, we showed that this algorithm minimizes a quadratic approximation to a least squares cost weighted by the noise covariance. The algorithm is illustrated with an example.</description>

      <title>Estimating Reliability of Electric Vehicle Charging Ecosystem using the Principle of Maximum Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the critical challenge of estimating the reliability of an Electric Vehicle (EV) charging systems when facing risks such as overheating, unpredictable, weather, and cyberattacks. Traditional methods for predicting failures often rely on past data or limiting assumptions, making them ineffective for new or less common threats that results in failure. To solve this issue, we utilize the Principle of Maximum Entropy (PME), a statistical tool that estimates risks even with limited information. PME works by balancing known constraints to create an unbiased predictions without guessing missing details. Using the EV charging ecosystem as a case study, we show how PME models stress factors responsible for failure. Our findings reveal a critical insight: even minor, localized stress events can trigger disproportionately large drops in overall system reliability, similar to a domino effect. The our PME model demonstrates how high-impact components, such as the power grid, are more likely to fail as stress accumulates, creating network-wide tipping points. Beyond EVs, this approach applies to any complex system with incomplete data, such as smart grids, healthcare devices, or logistics networks. By mathematically establishing an inverse relationship between uncertainty (entropy) and reliability, our work quantifies how greater system unpredictability directly degrades robustness. This offers a universal tool to improve decision-making under unpredictable conditions. This work bridges advanced mathematics with real-world engineering, providing actionable insights for policymakers and industries to build safer, more efficient systems in our increasingly connected world.</description>

      <title>Modeling Head-Neck Dynamics under Lateral Perturbations Using MPC to Mimic CNS postural stabilization strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated vehicles will allow occupants to engage in non-driving tasks, but limited visual cues will make them vulnerable to unexpected movements. These unpredictable perturbations create a "surprise factor," forcing the central nervous system to rely on compensatory postural adjustments, which are less effective, and are more likely to trigger sensory conflicts. Since the head is a key reference for sensory input (vestibular and vision), models accurately capturing head-neck postural stabilization are essential for assessing AV comfort. This study extends an existing model predictive control-based framework to simulate head-neck postural control under lateral perturbations. Experimental validation against human data demonstrates that the model can accurately reproduce dynamic responses during lateral trunk perturbations. The results show that muscle effort combined with partial somatosensory feedback provides the best overall dynamic fit without requiring corrective relative and global head orientation integrators for posture.</description>

      <title>System Identification via Validation and Adaptation for Model Updating Applied to a Nonlinear Cantilever Beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently proposed System Identification via Validation and Adaptation (SIVA) method allows system identification, uncertainty quantification, and model validation directly from data. Inspired by generative modeling, SIVA employs a neural network that converts random noise to physically meaningful parameters. The known equation of motion utilizes these parameters to generate fake accelerations, which are compared to real training data using a mean square error loss. For concurrent parameter validation, independent datasets are passed through the model, and the resulting signals are classified as real or fake by a discriminator network, which guides the parameter-generator network. In this work, we apply SIVA to simulated vibration data from a cantilever beam that contains a lumped mass and a nonlinear end attachment, demonstrating accurate parameter estimation and model updating on complex, highly nonlinear systems.</description>

      <title>Trusted Routing for Blockchain-Empowered UAV Networks via Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the high flexibility and versatility, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are leveraged in various fields including surveillance and disaster rescue.However, in UAV networks, routing is vulnerable to malicious damage due to distributed topologies and high dynamics. Hence, ensuring the routing security of UAV networks is challenging. In this paper, we characterize the routing process in a time-varying UAV network with malicious nodes. Specifically, we formulate the routing problem to minimize the total delay, which is an integer linear programming and intractable to solve. Then, to tackle the network security issue, a blockchain-based trust management mechanism (BTMM) is designed to dynamically evaluate trust values and identify low-trust UAVs. To improve traditional practical Byzantine fault tolerance algorithms in the blockchain, we propose a consensus UAV update mechanism. Besides, considering the local observability, the routing problem is reformulated into a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process. Further, a multi-agent double deep Q-network based routing algorithm is designed to minimize the total delay. Finally, simulations are conducted with attacked UAVs and numerical results show that the delay of the proposed mechanism decreases by 13.39$\%$, 12.74$\%$, and 16.6$\%$ than multi-agent proximal policy optimal algorithms, multi-agent deep Q-network algorithms, and methods without BTMM, respectively.</description>

      <title>Consumer-based Carbon Costs: Integrating Consumer Carbon Preferences in Electricity Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An increasing share of consumers care about the carbon footprint of their electricity. This paper proposes to integrate consumer carbon preferences in the electricity market-clearing through consumer-based carbon costs. Specifically, consumers can submit not only bids for power but also assign a cost to the carbon emissions incurred by their electricity use. We start from a centralized market clearing that maximizes social welfare under consideration of generation costs, consumer utility and consumer carbon costs. We then derive an equivalent equilibrium formulation which incorporates a carbon allocation problem and gives rise to a set of carbon-adjusted electricity prices for both consumers and generators. We prove that the carbon-adjusted prices are higher for low-emitting generators and consumers with high carbon costs. Further, we prove that this new paradigm satisfies the same desirable market properties as standard electricity markets based on locational marginal prices, namely revenue adequacy and individual rationality, and demonstrate that a carbon tax on generators is equivalent to imposing a uniform carbon cost on consumers. Using a simplified three-bus system and the RTS-GMLC system, we illustrate that consumer-based carbon costs contribute to greener electricity market clearing both through generation redispatch and reductions in demand.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Data-Driven Control of Nonlinear Polynomial Systems with Noisy Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work addresses the critical challenge of guaranteeing safety for complex dynamical systems where precise mathematical models are uncertain and data measurements are corrupted by noise. We develop a physics-informed, direct data-driven framework for synthesizing robust safety controllers (R-SCs) for both discrete- and continuous-time nonlinear polynomial systems that are subject to unknown-but-bounded disturbances. To do so, we introduce a notion of safety through robust control barrier certificates (R-CBCs), which ensure avoidance of (potentially multiple) unsafe regions, offering a less conservative alternative to existing methods based on robust invariant sets. Our core innovation lies in integrating the fundamental physical principles with observed noisy data which drastically reduces data requirements, enabling robust safety analysis with significantly shorter trajectories, compared to purely data-driven methods. To achieve this, the proposed synthesis procedure is formulated as a sum-of-squares (SOS) optimization program that systematically designs the R-CBC and its associated R-SC by leveraging both collected data and underlying physical laws. The efficacy of our framework is demonstrated on four benchmark systems, three discrete-time and one continuous-time nonlinear polynomial systems, confirming its ability to offer robust safety guarantees with reduced data demands.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Inverse Learning for Sensor Networks: Identifying Coordination in UAV Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose there is an adversarial UAV network being tracked by a radar. How can the radar determine whether the UAVs are coordinating, in some well-defined sense? How can the radar infer the objectives of the individual UAVs and the network as a whole? We present an abstract interpretation of such a strategic interaction, allowing us to conceptualize coordination as a linearly constrained multi-objective optimization problem. Then, we present some tools from microeconomic theory that allow us to detect coordination and reconstruct individual UAV objective functions, from radar tracking signals. This corresponds to performing inverse multi-objective optimization. We present details for how the abstract microeconomic interpretation corresponds to, and naturally arises from, physical-layer radar waveform modulation and multi-target filtering. This article serves as a tutorial, bringing together concepts from several established research contributions in an expository style.</description>

      <title>Kernel-Based Sparse Additive Nonlinear Model Structure Detection through a Linearization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The choice of parameterization in Nonlinear (NL) system models greatly affects the quality of the estimated model. Overly complex models can be impractical and hard to interpret, necessitating data-driven methods for simpler and more accurate representations. In this paper, we propose a data-driven approach to simplify a class of continuous-time NL system models using linear approximations around varying operating points. Specifically, for sparse additive NL models, our method identifies the number of NL subterms and their corresponding input spaces. Under small-signal operation, we approximate the unknown NL system as a trajectory-scheduled Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) system, with LPV coefficients representing the gradient of the NL function and indicating input sensitivity. Using this sensitivity measure, we determine the NL system's structure through LPV model reduction by identifying non-zero LPV coefficients and selecting scheduling parameters. We introduce two sparse estimators within a vector-valued Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) framework to estimate the LPV coefficients while preserving their structural relationships. The structure of the sparse additive NL model is then determined by detecting non-zero elements in the gradient vector (LPV coefficients) and the Hessian matrix (Jacobian of the LPV coefficients). We propose two computationally tractable RKHS-based estimators for this purpose. The sparsified Hessian matrix reveals the NL model's structure, with numerical simulations confirming the approach's effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Bounded fuzzy logic control for optimal scheduling of green hydrogen production and revenue maximisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen Purchase Agreements (HPAs) guarantee revenue streams that mitigate the financial risks inherent in the long-term production of green hydrogen from renewable energy sources. However, the intermittency of renewable electricity and the availability of parallel revenue opportunities in both the electricity and hydrogen markets complicate the scheduling of green hydrogen production. The scheduling should maximise the total revenue from short-term sales of electricity and hydrogen against the long-term HPA delivery obligations. This challenge is addressed by developing a Bounded Fuzzy Logic Control (BFLC) which determines the daily HPA delivery target based on day-ahead forecasts of electricity and hydrogen prices, as well as wind capacity factors. Subsequently, the daily target is imposed as a constraint in dispatch optimisation which allocates energy and hydrogen flows for each hour of the day. Revenue comparisons over several years demonstrate that the BFLC achieves total annual revenues within 9% of optimal revenues that are based on perfect foresight. The BFLC revenues consistently exceed those of steady control, with the largest differences observed under conditions of elevated price levels and variability. The BFLC provides an effective long-term scheduling of green hydrogen production, enabling realistic revenue quantification that mitigates economic risks without overlooking economically viable projects.</description>

      <title>Pursuit-Evasion Between a Velocity-Constrained Double-Integrator Pursuer and a Single-Integrator Evader</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a pursuit-evasion game between a double integrator-driven pursuer with bounded velocity and bounded acceleration and a single integrator-driven evader with bounded velocity in a two-dimensional plane. The pursuer's goal is to capture the evader in the shortest time, while the evader attempts to delay the capture. We analyze two scenarios based on whether the capture can happen before the pursuer's speed reaches its maximum. For the case when the pursuer can capture the evader before its speed reaches its maximum, we use geometric methods to obtain the strategies for the pursuer and the evader. For the case when the pursuer cannot capture the evader before its speed reaches its maximum, we use numerical methods to obtain the strategies for the pursuer and the evader. In both cases, we demonstrate that the proposed strategies are optimal in the sense of Nash equilibrium through the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equation, and the pursuer can capture the evader as long as as its maximum speed is larger than that of the evader. Simulation experiments illustrate the effectiveness of the strategies.</description>

      <title>A class of unified disturbance rejection control barrier functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most existing robust control barrier functions (CBFs) can only handle matched disturbances, restricting their applications in real-world scenarios. While some recent advances extend robust CBFs to unmatched disturbances, they heavily rely on differentiability property of disturbances, and fail to accommodate non-differentiable case for high-relative-degree safety constraints. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a class of disturbance rejection CBFs (DRCBFs), including DRCBFs and adaptive DRCBFs (aDRCBFs). This class of DRCBFs can strictly guarantee safety under general bounded disturbances, which includes both matched or unmatched, differentiable or non-differentiable disturbances as special cases. Morevoer, no information of disturbance bound is needed in aDRCBFs. Simulation results illustrate that this class of DRCBFs outperform existing robust CBFs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites are essential for providing accurate navigation and timing information worldwide. Operating in medium Earth orbit (MEO), these satellites must maintain precise Earth-pointing attitudes to transmit signals effectively. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the operational dynamics, attitude determination and control systems (ADCS), and orbital insertion techniques for GPS satellites. We explore the integration of sensors and actuators, control algorithms, stabilization strategies, and the launch procedures required to deploy these satellites. Key equations related to orbital mechanics and attitude control are discussed, and references to recent technical literature are included.</description>

      <title>Supervisory Control of Discrete Event Systems for Small Language Under Cyber Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyber attacks are unavoidable in networked discrete event systems where the plant and the supervisor communicate with each other via networks. Because of the nondeterminism in observation and control caused by cyber attacks, the language generated by the supervised system becomes nondeterministic. The small language is defined as the lower bound on all possible languages that can be generated by the supervised system, which is needed for a supervised system to perform some required tasks under cyber attacks. In this paper, we investigate supervisory control for the small language. After introducing CA-S-controllability and CA-S-observability, we prove that the supervisory control problem of achieving a required small language is solvable if and only if the given language is CA-Scontrollable and CA-S-observable. If the given language is not CA-S controllable and/or CA-S-observable, we derive conditions under which the infimal CA-S-controllable and CA-S-observable superlanguage exists and can be used to design a supervisor satisfying the given requirement.</description>

      <title>Centralized Dynamic State Estimation Algorithm for Detecting and Distinguishing Faults and Cyber Attacks in Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As power systems evolve with increased integration of renewable energy sources, they become more complex and vulnerable to both cyber and physical threats. This study validates a centralized Dynamic State Estimation (DSE) algorithm designed to enhance the protection of power systems, particularly focusing on microgrids with substantial renewable energy integration. The algorithm utilizing a structured hypothesis testing framework, systematically identifies and differentiates anomalies caused by cyberattacks from those resulting from physical faults. This algorithm was evaluated through four case studies: a False Data Injection Attack (FDIA) via manipulation of Current Transformer (CT) ratios, a single line-to-ground (SLG) fault, and two combined scenarios involving both anomalies. Results from real-time simulations demonstrate that the algorithm effectively distinguishes between cyber-induced anomalies and physical faults, thereby significantly enhancing the reliability and security of energy systems. This research underscores the critical role of advanced diagnostic tools in protecting power systems against the growing prevalence of cyber-physical threats, enhancing the resilience of the grid and preventing potential blackouts by avoiding the mis-operation of protection relays.</description>

      <title>Distributed Non-Uniform Scaling Control of Multi-Agent Formation via Matrix-Valued Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed formation maneuver control refers to the problem of maneuvering a group of agents to change their formation shape by adjusting the motions of partial agents, where the controller of each agent only requires local information measured from its neighbors. Although this problem has been extensively investigated, existing approaches are mostly limited to uniform scaling transformations. This article proposes a new type of local matrix-valued constraints, via which non-uniform scaling control of position formation can be achieved by tuning the positions of only two agents (i.e., leaders). Here, the non-uniform scaling transformation refers to scaling the position formation with different ratios along different orthogonal coordinate directions. Moreover, by defining scaling and translation of attitude formation, we propose a distributed control scheme for scaling and translation maneuver control of joint position-attitude formations. It is proven that the proposed controller achieves global convergence, provided that the sensing graph among agents is a 2-rooted bidirectional graph. Compared with the affine formation maneuver control approach, the proposed approach leverages a sparser sensing graph, requires fewer leaders, and additionally enables scaling transformations of the attitude formation. A simulation example is proposed to demonstrate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Adaptive Second-Order Sliding Mode Control with Noisy Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper offers a data-driven approach for designing adaptive suboptimal second-order sliding mode (ASSOSM) controllers for single-input nonlinear systems, characterized by perturbed strict-feedback structures with unknown dynamics. The proposed approach is recursive, in which the system dynamics are first decomposed into two parts, referred to as the upper and lower dynamics. The control design task is then divided into two stages, that is, designing a virtual controller for the upper dynamics, followed by synthesizing the actual controller for the full-order system. To this end, we start by collecting noisy data from the system through a finite-time experiment, referred to as a single trajectory. We then formulate a data-dependent condition as a semidefinite program, whose feasibility enables the design of a virtual controller that ensures global asymptotic stability of the origin for the upper dynamics. Building upon this virtual controller, we subsequently propose a data-driven sliding variable that facilitates the design of an ASSOSM controller for the unknown full-order system. This controller guarantees semi-global asymptotic stability of the origin in the presence of disturbances. Specifically, for any prescribed bounded set--no matter how large--the controller's design parameters can be chosen to ensure asymptotic stability of the origin. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through three case studies, reflecting different aspects of the approach.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of Koopman Eigenfunctions and a Commuting Local Frame of Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article establishes the relationship between the Koopman eigenfunctions of a first-order nonlinear ODE system and its symmetries. Specifically, a bijective mapping is obtained between i) a commuting local frame of symmetry generators, and ii) a set of Koopman eigenfunctions whose gradients form a local frame. This equivalence is used to convert the problem of finding Koopman eigenfunctions into the equivalent problem of finding commuting vector fields, which are readily given by the flow map of the system. The implication for stability is also studied in terms of a contraction metric that is associated with the commuting local frame of symmetries. The theoretical result is verified with the van der Pol oscillator whose eigenfunctions are computed to the precision of finite numerical integration.</description>

      <title>Computationally efficient Gauss-Newton reinforcement learning for model predictive control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) is widely used in process control due to its interpretability and ability to handle constraints. As a parametric policy in reinforcement learning (RL), MPC offers strong initial performance and low data requirements compared to black-box policies like neural networks. However, most RL methods rely on first-order updates, which scale well to large parameter spaces but converge at most linearly, making them inefficient when each policy update requires solving an optimal control problem, as is the case with MPC. While MPC policies are typically sparsely parameterized and thus amenable to second-order approaches, existing second-order methods demand second-order policy derivatives, which can be computationally and memory-wise intractable.
  This work introduces a Gauss-Newton approximation of the deterministic policy Hessian that eliminates the need for second-order policy derivatives, enabling superlinear convergence with minimal computational overhead. To further improve robustness, we propose a momentum-based Hessian averaging scheme for stable training under noisy estimates. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on a nonlinear continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR), showing faster convergence and improved data efficiency over state-of-the-art first-order methods.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Perception-Based Control for Autonomous Racing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous systems operating in unknown environments often rely heavily on visual sensor data, yet making safe and informed control decisions based on these measurements remains a significant challenge. To facilitate the integration of perception and control in autonomous vehicles, we propose a novel perception-based control approach that incorporates road estimation, quantification of its uncertainty, and uncertainty-aware control based on this estimate. At the core of our method is a parametric road curvature model, optimized using visual measurements of the road through a constrained nonlinear optimization problem. This process ensures adherence to constraints on both model parameters and curvature. By leveraging the Frenet frame formulation, we embed the estimated track curvature into the system dynamics, allowing the controller to explicitly account for perception uncertainty and enhancing robustness to estimation errors based on visual input. We validate our approach in a simulated environment, using a high-fidelity 3D rendering engine, and demonstrate its effectiveness in achieving reliable and uncertainty-aware control for autonomous racing.</description>

      <title>Causality and Interpretability for Electrical Distribution System faults</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal analysis helps us understand variables that are responsible for system failures. This improves fault detection and makes system more reliable. In this work, we present a new method that combines causal inference with machine learning to classify faults in electrical distribution systems (EDS) using graph-based models. We first build causal graphs using transfer entropy (TE). Each fault case is represented as a graph, where the nodes are features such as voltage and current, and the edges demonstrate how these features influence each other. Then, the graphs are classified using machine learning and GraphSAGE where the model learns from both the node values and the structure of the graph to predict the type of fault. To make the predictions understandable, we further developed an integrated approach using GNNExplainer and Captums Integrated Gradients to highlight the nodes (features) that influences the most on the final prediction. This gives us clear insights into the possible causes of the fault. Our experiments show high accuracy: 99.44% on the EDS fault dataset, which is better than state of art models. By combining causal graphs with machine learning, our method not only predicts faults accurately but also helps understand their root causes. This makes it a strong and practical tool for improving system reliability.</description>

      <title>Tensor Dynamic Mode Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) has become a powerful data-driven method for analyzing the spatiotemporal dynamics of complex, high-dimensional systems. However, conventional DMD methods are limited to matrix-based formulations, which might be inefficient or inadequate for modeling inherently multidimensional data including images, videos, and higher-order networks. In this letter, we propose tensor dynamic mode decomposition (TDMD), a novel extension of DMD to third-order tensors based on the recently developed T-product framework. By incorporating tensor factorization techniques, TDMD achieves more efficient computation and better preservation of spatial and temporal structures in multiway data for tasks such as state reconstruction and dynamic component separation, compared to standard DMD with data flattening. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TDMD on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Learning-Based Control for Multi-Agent Shepherding of Stochastic Autonomous Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent shepherding represents a challenging distributed control problem where herder agents must coordinate to guide independently moving targets to desired spatial configurations. Most existing control strategies assume cohesive target behavior, which frequently fails in practical applications where targets exhibit stochastic autonomous behavior. This paper presents a hierarchical learning-based control architecture that decomposes the shepherding problem into a high-level decision-making module and a low-level motion control component. The proposed distributed control system synthesizes effective control policies directly from closed-loop experience without requiring explicit inter-agent communication or prior knowledge of target dynamics. The decentralized architecture achieves cooperative control behavior through emergent coordination without centralized supervision. Experimental validation demonstrates superior closed-loop performance compared to state-of-the-art heuristic control methods, achieving 100\% success rates with improved settling times and control efficiency. The control architecture scales beyond its design conditions, adapts to time-varying goal regions, and demonstrates practical implementation feasibility through real-time experiments on the Robotarium platform.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel type of mobile rolling robot designed as a modular platform for non-prehensile manipulation, highlighting the associated control challenges in achieving balancing control of the robotic system. The developed rolling disk modules incorporate an innovative internally actuated magnetic-pendulum coupling mechanism, which introduces a compelling control problem due to the frictional and sliding interactions, as well as the magnetic effects between each module. In this paper, we derive the nonlinear dynamics of the robot using the Euler-Lagrange formulation. Then, through simulation, the motion behavior of the system is studied and analyzed, providing critical insights for future investigations into control methods for complex non-prehensile motion between robotic modules. Also, we study the balancing of this new platform and introduce a new motion pattern of lifting. This research aims to enhance the understanding and implementation of modular self-reconfigurable robots in various scenarios for future applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Engineering design optimization seeks to automatically determine the shapes, topologies, or parameters of components that maximize performance under given conditions. This process often depends on physics-based simulations, which are difficult to install, computationally expensive, and require domain-specific expertise. To mitigate these challenges, we introduce EngiBench, the first open-source library and datasets spanning diverse domains for data-driven engineering design. EngiBench provides a unified API and a curated set of benchmarks -- covering aeronautics, heat conduction, photonics, and more -- that enable fair, reproducible comparisons of optimization and machine learning algorithms, such as generative or surrogate models. We also release EngiOpt, a companion library offering a collection of such algorithms compatible with the EngiBench interface. Both libraries are modular, letting users plug in novel algorithms or problems, automate end-to-end experiment workflows, and leverage built-in utilities for visualization, dataset generation, feasibility checks, and performance analysis. We demonstrate their versatility through experiments comparing state-of-the-art techniques across multiple engineering design problems, an undertaking that was previously prohibitively time-consuming to perform. Finally, we show that these problems pose significant challenges for standard machine learning methods due to highly sensitive and constrained design manifolds.</description>

      <title>Predictive calibration for digital sun sensors using sparse submanifold convolutional neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in AI techniques for space applications mirror the success achieved in terrestrial applications. Machine learning, which excels in data rich environments, is particularly well suited to space-based computer vision applications, such as space optical attitude sensing. Of these sensors, digital sun sensors (DSS) are one of the most common and important sensors for spacecraft attitude determination. The main challenge in using the DSS for attitude estimation are sensor errors, which limit the overall achievable estimation accuracy. However, the traditional sun sensor calibration process is costly, slow, labor-intensive and inefficient. These limitations motivate the use of AI techniques to enable more accurate and efficient DSS calibration.
  The objective of this work is to develop an end-to-end predictive calibration methodology for digital sun sensors to solve 2-axis state estimates utilizing a sparse submanifold convolutional neural network (SSCNN). We find that the proposed framework can achieve state-of-the-art performance on synthetic data with a mean accuracy of 0.005{\deg} for the two sun angle estimates. Furthermore, the model is highly capable of implicitly learning complex noise patterns and handling mixed noise types, thereby greatly improving the model robustness and accuracy to real-world applications. The main contributions of this work are: (1) the first application (to our knowledge) of a CNN regression model to the problem of DSS predictive calibration, (2) the introduction of a fused end-to-end training approach for DSS calibration, (3) the creation of a publicly available physics-informed synthetic dataset and simulation for DSS training images, and (4) the evaluation of the performance of the deep learning approach for various mask configurations.</description>

      <title>Learning Pivoting Manipulation with Force and Vision Feedback Using Optimization-based Demonstrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-prehensile manipulation is challenging due to complex contact interactions between objects, the environment, and robots. Model-based approaches can efficiently generate complex trajectories of robots and objects under contact constraints. However, they tend to be sensitive to model inaccuracies and require access to privileged information (e.g., object mass, size, pose), making them less suitable for novel objects. In contrast, learning-based approaches are typically more robust to modeling errors but require large amounts of data. In this paper, we bridge these two approaches to propose a framework for learning closed-loop pivoting manipulation. By leveraging computationally efficient Contact-Implicit Trajectory Optimization (CITO), we design demonstration-guided deep Reinforcement Learning (RL), leading to sample-efficient learning. We also present a sim-to-real transfer approach using a privileged training strategy, enabling the robot to perform pivoting manipulation using only proprioception, vision, and force sensing without access to privileged information. Our method is evaluated on several pivoting tasks, demonstrating that it can successfully perform sim-to-real transfer.</description>

      <title>Improving Drone Racing Performance Through Iterative Learning MPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous drone racing presents a challenging control problem, requiring real-time decision-making and robust handling of nonlinear system dynamics. While iterative learning model predictive control~(LMPC) offers a promising framework for iterative performance improvement, its direct application to drone racing faces challenges like real-time compatibility or the trade-off between time-optimal and safe traversal. In this paper, we enhance LMPC with three key innovations:~(1) an adaptive cost function that dynamically weights time-optimal tracking against centerline adherence,~(2)~a shifted local safe set to prevent excessive shortcutting and enable more robust iterative updates, and~(3) a Cartesian-based formulation that accommodates safety constraints without the singularities or integration errors associated with Frenet-frame transformations. Results from extensive simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that our improved algorithm can optimize initial trajectories generated by a wide range of controllers with varying levels of tuning for a maximum improvement in lap time by 60.85\%. Even applied to the most aggressively tuned state-of-the-art model-based controller, MPCC++, on a real drone, a 6.05\% improvement is still achieved. Overall, the proposed method pushes the drone toward faster traversal and avoids collisions in simulation and real-world experiments, making it a practical solution to improve the peak performance of drone racing.</description>

      <title>Design of Q8bot: A Miniature, Low-Cost, Dynamic Quadruped Built with Zero Wires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces Q8bot, an open-source, miniature quadruped designed for robotics research and education. We present the robot's novel zero-wire design methodology, which leads to its superior form factor, robustness, replicability, and high performance. With a size and weight similar to a modern smartphone, this standalone robot can walk for over an hour on a single battery charge and survive meter-high drops with simple repairs. Its 300-dollar bill of materials includes minimal off-the-shelf components, readily available custom electronics from online vendors, and structural parts that can be manufactured on hobbyist 3D printers. A preliminary user assembly study confirms that Q8bot can be easily replicated, with an average assembly time of under one hour by a single person. With heuristic open-loop control, Q8bot achieves a stable walking speed of 5.4 body lengths per second and a turning speed of 5 radians per second, along with other dynamic movements such as jumping and climbing moderate slopes.</description>

      <title>Upper bound of transient growth in accelerating and decelerating wall-driven flows using the Lyapunov method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work analyzes accelerating and decelerating wall-driven flows by quantifying the upper bound of transient energy growth using a Lyapunov-type approach. By formulating the linearized Navier-Stokes equations as a linear time-varying system and constructing a time-dependent Lyapunov function, we obtain a rigorous upper bound on transient energy growth by solving linear matrix inequalities (LMI). The LMI approach can obtain the upper bound of transient energy growth that closely matches transient growth computed via the singular value decomposition of the state-transition matrix of linear time-varying systems. Our analysis captures that decelerating base flows exhibit significantly larger transient growth compared with accelerating flows. Our approach offers the advantages of providing a rigorous certificate of uniform stability and an invariant ellipsoid to bound the solution trajectory. This Lyapunov-based analysis also has the potential to be extended to input-output analysis and nonlinear analysis.</description>

      <title>VWAttacker: A Systematic Security Testing Framework for Voice over WiFi User Equipments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present VWAttacker, the first systematic testing framework for analyzing the security of Voice over WiFi (VoWiFi) User Equipment (UE) implementations. VWAttacker includes a complete VoWiFi network testbed that communicates with Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) UEs based on a simple interface to test the behavior of diverse VoWiFi UE implementations; uses property-guided adversarial testing to uncover security issues in different UEs systematically. To reduce manual effort in extracting and testing properties, we introduce an LLM-based, semi-automatic, and scalable approach for property extraction and testcase (TC) generation. These TCs are systematically mutated by two domain-specific transformations. Furthermore, we introduce two deterministic oracles to detect property violations automatically. Coupled with these techniques, VWAttacker extracts 63 properties from 11 specifications, evaluates 1,116 testcases, and detects 13 issues in 21 UEs. The issues range from enforcing a DH shared secret to 0 to supporting weak algorithms. These issues result in attacks that expose the victim UE's identity or establish weak channels, thus severely hampering the security of cellular networks. We responsibly disclose the findings to all the related vendors. At the time of writing, one of the vulnerabilities has been acknowledged by MediaTek with high severity.</description>

      <title>The Vanishing Gradient Problem for Stiff Neural Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gradient-based optimization of neural differential equations and other parameterized dynamical systems fundamentally relies on the ability to differentiate numerical solutions with respect to model parameters. In stiff systems, it has been observed that sensitivities to parameters controlling fast-decaying modes become vanishingly small during training, leading to optimization difficulties. In this paper, we show that this vanishing gradient phenomenon is not an artifact of any particular method, but a universal feature of all A-stable and L-stable stiff numerical integration schemes. We analyze the rational stability function for general stiff integration schemes and demonstrate that the relevant parameter sensitivities, governed by the derivative of the stability function, decay to zero for large stiffness. Explicit formulas for common stiff integration schemes are provided, which illustrate the mechanism in detail. Finally, we rigorously prove that the slowest possible rate of decay for the derivative of the stability function is $O(|z|^{-1})$, revealing a fundamental limitation: all A-stable time-stepping methods inevitably suppress parameter gradients in stiff regimes, posing a significant barrier for training and parameter identification in stiff neural ODEs.</description>

Abstract: The battlefield of information warfare has moved to online social networks, where influence campaigns operate at unprecedented speed and scale. As with any strategic domain, success requires understanding the terrain, modeling adversaries, and executing interventions. This tutorial introduces a formal optimization framework for social media information operations (IO), where the objective is to shape opinions through targeted actions. This framework is parameterized by quantities such as network structure, user opinions, and activity levels - all of which must be estimated or inferred from data. We discuss analytic tools that support this process, including centrality measures for identifying influential users, clustering algorithms for detecting community structure, and sentiment analysis for gauging public opinion. These tools either feed directly into the optimization pipeline or help defense analysts interpret the information environment. With the landscape mapped, we highlight threats such as coordinated bot networks, extremist recruitment, and viral misinformation. Countermeasures range from content-level interventions to mathematically optimized influence strategies. Finally, the emergence of generative AI transforms both offense and defense, democratizing persuasive capabilities while enabling scalable defenses. This shift calls for algorithmic innovation, policy reform, and ethical vigilance to protect the integrity of our digital public sphere.</description>

      <title>A Provably Secure Network Protocol for Private Communication with Analysis and Tracing Resistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anonymous communication networks have emerged as crucial tools for obfuscating communication pathways and concealing user identities. However, their practical deployments face significant challenges, including susceptibility to artificial intelligence (AI)-powered metadata analysis, difficulties in decentralized architectures, and the absence of provable security guarantees. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel decentralized anonymous routing protocol with resistance to tracing and traffic analysis. The protocol eliminates dependencies on the threshold model and trusted third-party setups, ensuring indistinguishable identity privacy even in highly adversarial environments. Different from traditional empirical security analysis of anonymous networks, this paper rigorously proves indistinguishable identity privacy for users even in extremely adversarial environments. Furthermore, simulations confirm its practical feasibility, demonstrating both security and efficiency. By achieving information sharing with privacy preservation, the proposed protocol offers a provably secure solution for privacy-preserving communication in digital environments.</description>

      <title>A Heuristic Method for Simplified Resource Allocation based on Comparative Advantage in Wireless Access Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a heuristic method for simplifying resource allocation in access systems, leveraging the concept of comparative advantage to reduce computational complexity while maintaining near-optimal performance. Using power-division non-orthogonal multiple access (PD-NOMA) as an example, we demonstrate how this approach mitigates the challenge of power allocation in multi-cell networks. Our method reduces the search space for optimization, significantly decreasing computational overhead while ensuring efficient spectrum utilization. In principle, the method reduces the dimensions of search space by half. Extensive analysis and simulations validate its effectiveness, highlighting its potential for practical deployment in next-generation wireless networks. The proposed framework can help streamline resource allocation in complex communication environments, enhancing system performance and scalability.</description>

      <title>Revenue Optimization in Wireless Video Caching Networks: A Privacy-Preserving Two-Stage Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video caching can significantly improve delivery efficiency and enhance quality of video streaming, which constitutes the majority of wireless communication traffic. Due to limited cache size, caching strategies must be designed to adapt to and dynamic user demand in order to maximize system revenue. The system revenue depends on the benefits of delivering the requested videos and costs for (a) transporting the files to the users and (b) cache replacement. Since the cache content at any point in time impacts the replacement costs in the future, demand predictions over multiple cache placement slots become an important prerequisite for efficient cache planning. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel two-stage privacy-preserving solution for revenue optimization in wireless video caching networks. First, we train a Transformer using privacy-preserving federated learning (FL) to predict multi-slot future demands. Given that prediction results are never entirely accurate, especially for longer horizons, we further combine global content popularity with per-user prediction results to estimate the content demand distribution. Then, in the second stage, we leverage these estimation results to find caching strategies that maximize the long-term system revenue. This latter problem takes on the form of a multi-stage knapsack problem, which we then transform to a integer linear program. Our extensive simulation results demonstrate that (i) our FL solution delivers nearly identical performance to that of the ideal centralized solution and outperforms other existing caching methods, and (ii) our novel revenue optimization approach provides deeper system performance insights than traditional cache hit ratio (CHR)-based optimization approaches.</description>

      <title>Distributed Constraint-coupled Resource Allocation: Anytime Feasibility and Violation Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers distributed resource allocation problems (DRAPs) with a coupled constraint for real-time systems. Based on primal-dual methods, we adopt a control perspective for optimization algorithm design by synthesizing a safe feedback controller using control barrier functions to enforce constraint satisfaction. On this basis, a distributed anytime-feasible resource allocation (DanyRA) algorithm is proposed. It is shown that DanyRA algorithm converges to the exact optimal solution of DRAPs while ensuring feasibility of the coupled inequality constraint at all time steps. Considering constraint violation arises from potential external interferences, a virtual queue with minimum buffer is incorporated to restore the constraint satisfaction before the pre-defined deadlines. We characterize the trade-off between convergence accuracy and violation robustness for maintaining or recovering feasibility. DanyRA algorithm is further extended to address DRAPs with a coupled equality constraint, and its linear convergence rate is theoretically established. Finally, a numerical example is provided for verification.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Lattice-based Motion Planning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes an adaptive lattice-based motion planning solution to address the problem of generating feasible trajectories for systems, represented by a linearly parameterizable non-linear model operating within a cluttered environment. The system model is considered to have uncertain model parameters. The key idea here is to utilize input/output data online to update the model set containing the uncertain system parameter, as well as a dynamic estimated parameter of the model, so that the associated model estimation error reduces over time. This in turn improves the quality of the motion primitives generated by the lattice-based motion planner using a nominal estimated model selected on the basis of suitable criteria. The motion primitives are also equipped with tubes to account for the model mismatch between the nominal estimated model and the true system model, to guarantee collision-free overall motion. The tubes are of uniform size, which is directly proportional to the size of the model set containing the uncertain system parameter. The adaptive learning module guarantees a reduction in the diameter of the model set as well as in the parameter estimation error between the dynamic estimated parameter and the true system parameter. This directly implies a reduction in the size of the implemented tubes and guarantees that the utilized motion primitives go arbitrarily close to the resolution-optimal motion primitives associated with the true model of the system, thus significantly improving the overall motion planning performance over time. The efficiency of the motion planner is demonstrated by a suitable simulation example that considers a drone model represented by Euler-Lagrange dynamics containing uncertain parameters and operating within a cluttered environment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robotic cutting is a challenging contact-rich manipulation task where the robot must simultaneously negotiate unknown object mechanics, large contact forces, and precise motion requirements. We introduce a new virtual-model control scheme that enables knife rocking motion for robot manipulators, without pre-planned trajectories or precise information of the environment. Motion is generated through interconnection with virtual mechanisms, given by virtual springs, dampers, and masses arranged in a suitable way. Through analysis and experiments, we demonstrate that the controlled robot behavior settles into a periodic motion. Experiments with a Franka manipulator demonstrate robust cuts with five different vegetables, and sub-millimeter slice accuracy from 1 mm to 6 mm at nearly one cut per second. The same controller survives changes in knife shape and cutting board height, and adaptation to a different humanoid manipulator, demonstrating robustness and platform independence.</description>

Abstract: Learning-based control has attracted significant attention in recent years, especially for plants that are difficult to model based on first-principles. A key issue in learning-based control is how to make efficient use of data as the abundance of data becomes overwhelming. To address this issue, this work proposes an information-triggered learning framework and a corresponding learning-based controller design approach with guaranteed stability. Specifically, we consider a linear time-invariant system with unknown dynamics. A set-membership approach is introduced to learn a parametric uncertainty set for the unknown dynamics. Then, a data selection mechanism is proposed by evaluating the incremental information in a data sample, where the incremental information is quantified by its effects on shrinking the parametric uncertainty set. Next, after introducing a stability criterion using the set-membership estimate of the system dynamics, a robust learning-based predictive controller (LPC) is designed by minimizing a worst-case cost function. The closed-loop stability of the LPC equipped with the information-triggered learning protocol is discussed within a high-probability framework. Finally, comparative numerical experiments are performed to verify the validity of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Metasurface-Enabled Superheterodyne Transmitter for Arbitrary-Order Modulation with Spatially Isotropic Symbol Distribution</title>

Abstract: Electromagnetically programmable information metasurfaces, as dynamically controllable 2D metamaterials, hold significant promise as low-profile hardware enabling passive wave control and signal generation for backscatter systems. However, current metasurface-based transmitters architecture fundamentally suffer from hardware non-modularization, forcing all transmitter functions onto nonlinear switch-based unit cells, which introduces symbol mapping inconsistency via phase coupling. Moreover, both temporal coding (limited by unit cell diodes) and space-time coding (impaired by symbol anisotropy) exhibit irreducible harmonic interference and entangled control of amplitude, phase, and beam direction. This paper proposes a metasurface-enabled superheterodyne architecture (MSA), comprising a digital up-conversion (DUC) module performing baseband-to-intermediate frequency (IF) conversion, filtering, and digital-to-analog conversion (DAC), and a reconfigurable metasurface featuring programmable unit cells that independently control both the magnitude and phase of the reflection coefficient. Systematically, the architecture leverages a dual-stage up-conversion process, typical of superheterodyne systems, but uniquely employs the metasurface for the final RF conversion stage. Building upon this framework, a proof-of-concept prototype featuring a 5.8 GHz magnitude-phase decoupled (MPD) metasurface (&lt;15 degree phase deviation per state) and a DAC-based DUC module is presented. Extensive validation confirms the metasurface's capability for distortion-free mixing with arbitrary IF signals while maintaining consistent radiation patterns. The prototype successfully implements diverse QAM modulation schemes (4QAM to 256QAM) in mono-static and bi-static configurations, demonstrating symbol isotropy for spatially separated receivers and achieving a data rate of approximately 20 Mbps (at 5 MHz IF)...</description>

      <title>DiffOP: Reinforcement Learning of Optimization-Based Control Policies via Implicit Policy Gradients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07484v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-world system control requires both high-performing and interpretable controllers. Model-based control policies have gained popularity by using historical data to learn system costs and dynamics before implementation. However, this two-phase approach prevents these policies from achieving optimal control as the metrics that we train these models (e.g., mean squared errors) often differ from the actual control system cost. In this paper, we present DiffOP, a Differentiable Optimization-based Policy for optimal control. In the proposed framework, control actions are derived by solving an optimization, where the control cost function and system's dynamics can be parameterized as neural networks. Our key technical innovation lies in developing a hybrid optimization algorithm that combines policy gradients with implicit differentiation through the optimization layer, enabling end-to-end training with the actual cost feedback. Under standard regularity conditions, we prove DiffOP converges to stationary points at a rate of $O(1/K)$. Empirically, DiffOP achieves state-of-the-art performance in both nonlinear control tasks and real-world building control.</description>

We present a distributed asynchronous time update model wherein one randomly selected agent updates its state vector at a time by interacting with its neighbors. We prove that all agents converge to same state vector almost surely when every edge weight matrix is positive definite. We study vector consensus in cooperative-competitive networks with edge weights being either positive or negative definite matrices and present a necessary and sufficient condition to achieve bipartite vector consensus in such networks. We study the network structures on which agents achieve zero consensus. We also present a convergence result on nonhomogenous matrix products which is of independent interest in matrix convergence theory. All the results hold true for the synchronous time update model as well in which all agents update their states simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Vehicle Rebalancing Under Adherence Uncertainty</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ride-hailing systems often suffer from spatiotemporal supply-demand imbalances, largely due to the independent and uncoordinated actions of drivers. While existing fleet rebalancing methods offer repositioning recommendations to idle drivers to improve service efficiency, they typically assume full driver compliance: an unrealistic premise in practice. We propose an Adherence-Aware Vehicle Rebalancing (AAVR) framework that explicitly models and addresses uncertainties in driver adherence, stemming from individual behavioral preferences and dynamic trust in the recommender system. Our approach integrates (i) region-specific XGBoost models for demand forecasting, (ii) a network-level XGBoost model for inter-region travel time prediction, (iii) driver-specific logit models to capture repositioning preferences, and (iv) driver-specific Beta-Bernoulli Bandit models with Thompson Sampling to track and update each driver's confidence in the system over time.These elements are incorporated into a novel optimization framework that generates adherence-aware repositioning recommendations. To enable real-time implementation, we further develop a linearized version of the AAVR model. Extensive simulations on the NYC taxi dataset demonstrate that AAVR significantly outperforms four state-of-the-art adherence-agnostic baselines, achieving a 28% increase in served demand, a 22.7% reduction in customer wait times, a 28.6% increase in platform earnings and a 26% gain in driver profits on average.</description>

      <title>Prescribed-Time Newton Extremum Seeking using Delays and Time-Periodic Gains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study prescribed-time extremum seeking (PT-ES) for scalar maps in the presence of time delay. The PT-ES problem has been solved by Yilmaz and Krstic in 2023 using chirpy probing and time-varying singular gains. To alleviate the gain singularity, we present an alternative approach, employing delays with bounded time-periodic gains, for achieving prescribed-time convergence to the extremum. Our results are not extensions or refinements but a new methodological direction, even in the absence of the delay on the map. The main result we present compensates the map's delay and uses perturbation-based and the Newton (rather than gradient) approaches. With the help of averaging theorems in infinite dimension, specifically Retarded Functional Differential Equations (RFDEs), we conduct a prescribed-time convergence analysis on a suitable perturbation-averaged target ES system, which contains the time-periodic gains of the map and feedback delays. We further extend our method to multi-variable static maps and illustrate our results through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Distributed Coordination for Heterogeneous Non-Terrestrial Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To guarantee global coverage and ubiquitous connectivity, the Non-terrestrial Network (NTN) technology has been regarded as a key enabling technology in the Six Generation (6G) network, which consists of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), high-altitude platform (HAP), and satellite. It is noted that the unique characteristics of various NTN platforms directly impact the design and implementation of NTNs, which results in highly dynamic and heterogeneous networks. Even within the same tier, such as the space tier, the NTNs are developed based on different platforms including Low Earth Orbit (LEO), Medium Earth Orbit (MEO), and Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO). Therefore, distributed coordination among heterogeneous NTNs remains an important challenge. Although distributed learning framework finds a wide range of applications by leveraging rich distributed data and computation resources. The explicit and systematic analysis of the individual layers' challenges, and corresponding distributed coordination solutions in heterogeneous NTNs has not been proposed yet. In this article, we first summarize the unique characteristics of each NTN platform, and analyze the corresponding impact on the design and implementation of the NTN. We then identify the communication challenges of heterogeneous NTNs in individual layers, where the potential coordinated solutions are identified. We further illustrate the multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) algorithms tailored for coordinated solutions in heterogeneous NTNs. Last but not least, we present a case study of the user scheduling optimization problem in heterogeneous UAVs-based cellular networks, where the multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) technique is developed to validate the effectiveness of distributed coordination in heterogeneous NTNs.</description>

      <title>Convex Computations for Controlled Safety Invariant Sets of Black-box Discrete-time Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying controlled safety invariant sets (CSISs) is essential in safety-critical applications. This paper tackles the problem of identifying CSISs for black-box discrete-time systems, where the model is unknown and only limited simulation data is accessible. Traditionally, a CSIS is defined as a subset of a safe set, encompassing initial states for which a control input exists that keeps the system within the set at the next time step-this is referred to as the one-step invariance property. However, the requirement for one-step invariance can be equivalently translated into a stricter condition of ``always-invariance'', meaning that there exist control inputs capable of keeping the system within this set indefinitely. Such a condition may prove overly stringent or impractical for black-box systems, where predictions can become unreliable beyond a single time step or a limited number of finite time steps. To overcome the challenges posed by black-box systems, we reformulate the one-step invariance property in a ``Probably Approximately Correct'' (PAC) sense. This approach allows us to assess the probability that a control input exists to keep the system within the CSIS at the next time step, with a predefined level of confidence. If the system successfully remains within the set at the next time step, we can then reapply the invariance evaluation to the new state, thereby facilitating a recursive assurance of invariance. Our method employs barrier functions and scenario optimization, resulting in a linear programming method to estimate PAC CSISs. Finally, the effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated on several examples.</description>

      <title>Online and Offline Space-Filling Input Design for Nonlinear System Identification: A Receding Horizon Control-Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effectiveness of data-driven techniques heavily depends on the input signal used to generate the estimation data. However, a significant research gap exists in the field of input design for nonlinear dynamic system identification. In particular, existing methods largely overlook the minimization of the generalization error, i.e., model inaccuracies in regions not covered by the estimation dataset.
  This work addresses this gap by proposing an input design method that embeds a novel optimality criterion within a receding horizon control (RHC)-based optimization framework. The distance-based optimality criterion induces a space-filling design within a user-defined region of interest in a surrogate model's input space, requiring only minimal prior knowledge. Additionally, the method is applicable both online, where model parameters are continuously updated based on process observations, and offline, where a fixed model is employed.
  The space-filling performance of the proposed strategy is evaluated on an artificial example and compared to state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating superior efficiency in exploring process operating regions.</description>

      <title>Future Deployment and Flexibility of Distributed Energy Resources in the Distribution Grids of Switzerland</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The decarbonization goals worldwide drive the energy transition of power distribution grids, which operate under increasingly volatile conditions and closer to their technical limits. In this context, localized operational data with high temporal and spatial resolution is essential for their effective planning and regulation. Nevertheless, information on grid-connected distributed energy resources, such as electric vehicles, photovoltaic systems, and heat pumps, is often fragmented, inconsistent, and unavailable. This work introduces a comprehensive database of distributed energy resources and non-controllable loads allocated in Switzerland's medium- and low-voltage distribution grid models, covering over 2 million points of connection. Remarkably, this data specifies the flexibility capabilities of the controllable devices, with a set of projections aligned with national forecasts for 2030, 2040, and 2050. The database supports studies on flexibility provision of distributed energy resources, distribution grid resilience, and national energy policy, among other topics. Importantly, its modular structure allows users to extract national- and local-scale information across medium- and low-voltage systems, enabling broad applicability across locations.</description>

      <title>DPLib: A Standard Benchmark Library for Distributed Power System Analysis and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: \textit{DPLib} is an open-source MATLAB-based benchmark library created to support research and development in distributed and decentralized power system analysis and optimization. Distributed and decentralized methods offer scalability, privacy preservation, and resilience to single points of failure, making them increasingly important for modern power systems. However, unlike centralized tools such as MATPOWER, no general-purpose, reproducible data library package currently exists for distributed power system studies. DPLib, available at \href{https://github.com/LSU-RAISE-LAB/DPLib.git}{GitHub}, fills this gap by providing a standard power system library featuring over 20 multi-region benchmark test cases of varying sizes, along with a graph-based partitioning toolkit that decomposes any MATPOWER test system into multiple electrically coherent regions. The partitioning toolkit, an easy-to-use MATLAB code, generates standardized \texttt{.mat} and \texttt{.m} files, along with region visualizations for intuitive understanding. We also provide modular, easy-to-use distributed optimal power flow (OPF) solvers: an alternating direction method of multipliers(ADMM)-based DC-OPF solver implemented in YALMIP, and an ADMM-based AC-OPF solver leveraging IPOPT. These solvers validate the generated test systems for distributed optimization applications. Numerical results validate the generated test cases, establishing DPLib as a foundation for reproducible distributed power system research.</description>

      <title>Tunable Terahertz Detection and Generation using FETs operating in the saturation regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02605v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I report on the experimental observation of DC instability and self-amplification through stimulated emission of 0.2 and 1.63 THz radiation using InGaAs/GaAs HEMT operating in the deep saturation regime at room temperature. I demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally, that the Sub-THz and THz response of FETs are attributable to the rectification of the nonlinear dependence of the device's current-voltage characteristics. FETs function as nonlinear THz mixers and rectifiers, with their open-drain responsivity described by an expression analogous to that of a zero-bias Schottky diode detector. However, operating FETs in the deep saturation regime permits precise tuning of the device to the quantum localized resonance condition and the negative resistance mode at room temperature. Consequently, FETs can be adjusted in the deep saturation regime to facilitate tunable sub-THz and THz detection and generation as well as tunable sub-THz and THz lasing effect. These results are anticipated to significantly impact technological advancements across various fields in the near future.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Return Distributions with Distributional Dynamic Programming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce distributional dynamic programming (DP) methods for optimizing statistical functionals of the return distribution, with standard reinforcement learning as a special case. Previous distributional DP methods could optimize the same class of expected utilities as classic DP. To go beyond, we combine distributional DP with stock augmentation, a technique previously introduced for classic DP in the context of risk-sensitive RL, where the MDP state is augmented with a statistic of the rewards obtained since the first time step. We find that a number of recently studied problems can be formulated as stock-augmented return distribution optimization, and we show that we can use distributional DP to solve them. We analyze distributional value and policy iteration, with bounds and a study of what objectives these distributional DP methods can or cannot optimize. We describe a number of applications outlining how to use distributional DP to solve different stock-augmented return distribution optimization problems, for example maximizing conditional value-at-risk, and homeostatic regulation. To highlight the practical potential of stock-augmented return distribution optimization and distributional DP, we introduce an agent that combines DQN and the core ideas of distributional DP, and empirically evaluate it for solving instances of the applications discussed.</description>

      <title>Learning Plasma Dynamics and Robust Rampdown Trajectories with Predict-First Experiments at TCV</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rampdown phase of a tokamak pulse is difficult to simulate and often exacerbates multiple plasma instabilities. To reduce the risk of disrupting operations, we leverage advances in Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) to combine physics with data-driven models, developing a neural state-space model (NSSM) that predicts plasma dynamics during Tokamak \`a Configuration Variable (TCV) rampdowns. The NSSM efficiently learns dynamics from a modest dataset of 311 pulses with only five pulses in a reactor-relevant high-performance regime. The NSSM is parallelized across uncertainties, and reinforcement learning (RL) is applied to design trajectories that avoid instability limits. High-performance experiments at TCV show statistically significant improvements in relevant metrics. A predict-first experiment, increasing plasma current by 20% from baseline, demonstrates the NSSM's ability to make small extrapolations. The developed approach paves the way for designing tokamak controls with robustness to considerable uncertainty and demonstrates the relevance of SciML for fusion experiments.</description>

      <title>Frequency-Space Channel Estimation and Spatial Equalization in Wideband Fluid Antenna System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Fluid Antenna System (FAS) overcomes the spatial degree-of-freedom limitations of conventional static antenna arrays in wireless communications.This capability critically depends on acquiring full Channel State Information across all accessible ports. Existing studies focus exclusively on narrowband FAS, performing channel estimation solely in the spatial domain. This work proposes a channel estimation and spatial equalization framework for wideband FAS, revealing for the first time an inherent group-sparse structure in aperture-limited FAS channels. First, we establish a group-sparse recovery framework for space-frequency characteristics in FAS, formally characterizing leakage-induced sparsity degradation from limited aperture and bandwidth as a structured group-sparsity problem. By deriving dictionary-adapted group restricted isometry property, we prove tight recovery bounds for a convex $\ell_1/\ell_2$-mixed norm optimization formulation that preserves leakage-aware sparsity patterns. Second, we develop a descending correlation group orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm that systematically relaxes leakage constraints to reduce subcoherence. This approach enables FSC recovery with accelerated convergence and superior performance compared to conventional compressive sensing methods like OMP or GOMP. Third, we formulate spatial equalization as a mixed-integer linear programming problem, complement this with a greedy algorithm maintaining near-optimal performance. Simulation results demonstrate the proposed channel estimation algorithm effectively resolves energy misallocation and enables recovery of weak details, achieving superior recovery accuracy and convergence rate. The SE framework suppresses deep fading phenomena and largely reduces time consumption overhead while maintaining equivalent link reliability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13674v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modular robotics enables the development of versatile and adaptive robotic systems with autonomous reconfiguration. This paper presents a modular robotic system in which each module has independent actuation, battery power, and control, allowing both individual mobility and coordinated locomotion. A hierarchical Central Pattern Generator (CPG) framework governs motion, with a low-level CPG controlling individual modules and a high-level CPG synchronizing inter-module coordination, enabling smooth transitions between independent and collective behaviors. To validate the system, we conduct simulations in MuJoCo and hardware experiments, evaluating locomotion across different configurations. We first analyze single-module motion, followed by two-module cooperative locomotion. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the CPG-based control framework in achieving robust, flexible, and scalable locomotion. The proposed modular architecture has potential applications in search and rescue, environmental monitoring, and autonomous exploration, where adaptability and reconfigurability are essential.</description>

      <title>Two-Player Dynamic Potential LQ Games with Sequentially Revealed Costs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a novel finite-horizon linear-quadratic (LQ) feedback dynamic potential game with a priori unknown cost matrices played between two players. The cost matrices are revealed to the players sequentially, with the potential for future values to be previewed over a short time window. We propose an algorithm that enables the players to predict and track a feedback Nash equilibrium trajectory, and we measure the quality of their resulting decisions by introducing the concept of \emph{price of uncertainty}. We show that under the proposed algorithm, the price of uncertainty is bounded by horizon-invariant constants. The constants are the sum of three terms; the first and second terms decay exponentially as the preview window grows, and another depends on the magnitude of the differences between the cost matrices for each player. Through simulations, we illustrate that the resulting price of uncertainty initially decays at an exponential rate as the preview window lengthens, then remains constant for large time horizons.</description>

Abstract: Sampling-based model predictive control (MPC) offers strong performance in nonlinear and contact-rich robotic tasks, yet often suffers from poor exploration due to locally greedy sampling schemes. We propose \emph{Model Tensor Planning} (MTP), a novel sampling-based MPC framework that introduces high-entropy control trajectory generation through structured tensor sampling. By sampling over randomized multipartite graphs and interpolating control trajectories with B-splines and Akima splines, MTP ensures smooth and globally diverse control candidates. We further propose a simple $\beta$-mixing strategy that blends local exploitative and global exploratory samples within the modified Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) update, balancing control refinement and exploration. Theoretically, we show that MTP achieves asymptotic path coverage and maximum entropy in the control trajectory space in the limit of infinite tensor depth and width.
  Our implementation is fully vectorized using JAX and compatible with MuJoCo XLA, supporting \emph{Just-in-time} (JIT) compilation and batched rollouts for real-time control with online domain randomization. Through experiments on various challenging robotic tasks, ranging from dexterous in-hand manipulation to humanoid locomotion, we demonstrate that MTP outperforms standard MPC and evolutionary strategy baselines in task success and control robustness. Design and sensitivity ablations confirm the effectiveness of MTP tensor sampling structure, spline interpolation choices, and mixing strategy. Altogether, MTP offers a scalable framework for robust exploration in model-based planning and control.</description>

      <title>Enhancing AI System Resiliency: Formulation and Guarantee for LSTM Resilience Based on Control Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17696v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel theoretical framework for guaranteeing and evaluating the resilience of long short-term memory (LSTM) networks in control systems. We introduce "recovery time" as a new metric of resilience in order to quantify the time required for an LSTM to return to its normal state after anomalous inputs. By mathematically refining incremental input-to-state stability ($\delta$ISS) theory for LSTM, we derive a practical data-independent upper bound on recovery time. This upper bound gives us resilience-aware training. Experimental validation on simple models demonstrates the effectiveness of our resilience estimation and control methods, enhancing a foundation for rigorous quality assurance in safety-critical AI applications.</description>

      <title>Clustered Federated Learning for Generalizable FDIA Detection in Smart Grids with Heterogeneous Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: False Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs) pose severe security risks to smart grids by manipulating measurement data collected from spatially distributed devices such as SCADA systems and PMUs. These measurements typically exhibit Non-Independent and Identically Distributed (Non-IID) characteristics across different regions, which significantly challenges the generalization ability of detection models. Traditional centralized training approaches not only face privacy risks and data sharing constraints but also incur high transmission costs, limiting their scalability and deployment feasibility. To address these issues, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving federated learning framework, termed Federated Cluster Average (FedClusAvg), designed to improve FDIA detection in Non-IID and resource-constrained environments. FedClusAvg incorporates cluster-based stratified sampling and hierarchical communication (client-subserver-server) to enhance model generalization and reduce communication overhead. By enabling localized training and weighted parameter aggregation, the algorithm achieves accurate model convergence without centralizing sensitive data. Experimental results on benchmark smart grid datasets demonstrate that FedClusAvg not only improves detection accuracy under heterogeneous data distributions but also significantly reduces communication rounds and bandwidth consumption. This work provides an effective solution for secure and efficient FDIA detection in large-scale distributed power systems.</description>

      <title>Reward-Augmented Reinforcement Learning for Continuous Control in Precision Autonomous Parking via Policy Optimization Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19642</link>

Abstract: Autonomous parking (AP) represents a critical yet complex subset of intelligent vehicle automation, characterized by tight spatial constraints, frequent close-range obstacle interactions, and stringent safety margins. However, conventional rule-based and model-predictive methods often lack the adaptability and generalization needed to handle the nonlinear and environment-dependent complexities of AP. To address these limitations, we propose a reward-augmented learning framework for AP (RARLAP), that mitigates the inherent complexities of continuous-domain control by leveraging structured reward design to induce smooth and adaptable policy behavior, trained entirely within a high-fidelity Unity-based custom 3D simulation environment. We systematically design and assess three structured reward strategies: goal-only reward (GOR), dense proximity reward (DPR), and milestone-augmented reward (MAR), each integrated with both on-policy and off-policy optimization paradigms. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the on-policy MAR achieves a 91\% success rate, yielding smoother trajectories and more robust behavior, while GOR and DPR fail to guide effective learning. Convergence and trajectory analyses demonstrate that the proposed framework enhances policy adaptability, accelerates training, and improves safety in continuous control. Overall, RARLAP establishes that reward augmentation effectively addresses complex autonomous parking challenges, enabling scalable and efficient policy optimization with both on- and off-policy methods. To support reproducibility, the code accompanying this paper is publicly available.</description>

      <title>Systolic Array-based Accelerator for State-Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21394</link>

Abstract: Sequence modeling is crucial for AI to understand temporal data and detect complex time-dependent patterns. While recurrent neural networks (RNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and Transformers have advanced in capturing long-range dependencies, they struggle with achieving high accuracy with very long sequences due to limited memory retention (fixed context window). State-Space Models (SSMs) leverage exponentially decaying memory enabling lengthy context window and so they process very long data sequences more efficiently than recurrent and Transformer-based models. Unlike traditional neural models like CNNs and RNNs, SSM-based models require solving differential equations through continuous integration, making training and inference both compute- and memory-intensive on conventional CPUs and GPUs. In this paper we introduce a specialized hardware accelerator, EpochCore, for accelerating SSMs. EpochCore is based on systolic arrays (SAs) and is designed to enhance the energy efficiency and throughput of inference of SSM-based models for long-range sequence tasks. Within the SA, we propose a versatile processing element (PE) called LIMA-PE to perform traditional and specialized MAC operations to support traditional DNNs and SSMs. To complement the EpochCore microarchitecture, we propose a novel dataflow, ProDF, which enables highly efficient execution of SSM-based models. By leveraging the LIMA-PE microarchitecture and ProDF, EpochCore achieves on average 250x gains in performance and 45x improvement in energy efficiency, at the expense of 2x increase in area cost over traditional SA-based accelerators, and around ~2,000x improvement in latency/inference on LRA datasets compared to GPU kernel operations.</description>
