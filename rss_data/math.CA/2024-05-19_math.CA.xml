      <title>Bounds for asymptotic characters of simple Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An important function attached to a complex simple Lie group $G$ is its asymptotic character $X(\lambda,x)$ (where $\lambda,x$ are real (co)weights of $G$) - the Fourier transform in $x$ of its Duistermaat-Heckman function $DH_\lambda(p)$ (continuous limit of weight multiplicities). It is shown in arXiv:2312.03101 that the best $\lambda$-independent upper bound $-c(G)$ for ${\rm inf}_x{\rm Re}X(\lambda,x)$ for fixed $\lambda$ is strictly negative. We quantify this result by providing a lower bound for $c(G)$ in terms of $\dim G$. We also provide upper and lower bounds for $DH_\lambda(0)$ when $|\lambda|=1$. This allows us to show that $|X(\lambda,x)|\le C(G)|\lambda|^{-1}|x|^{-1}$ for some constant $C(G)$ depending only on $G$, which implies the conjecture in Remark 17.16 of arXiv:2312.03101. We also show that $c(SL_n)\le (\frac{4}{\pi^2})^{n-2}$. Finally, in the appendix, which subsumes our previous paper arXiv:1811.05293, we prove Conjecture 1 in arXiv:1706.02793 about Mittag-Leffler type sums for $G$.</description>

      <title>On dimension stable spaces of measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we define spaces of measures $DS_\beta(\mathbb{R}^d)$ with dimensional stability $\beta \in (0,d)$. These spaces bridge between $M_b(\mathbb{R}^d)$, the space of finite Radon measures, and $DS_d(\mathbb{R}^d)= \mathrm{H}^1(\mathbb{R}^d)$, the real Hardy space. We show the spaces $DS_\beta(\mathbb{R}^d)$ support Sobolev inequalities for $\beta \in (0,d]$, while for any $\beta \in [0,d]$ we show that the lower Hausdorff dimension of an element of $DS_\beta(\mathbb{R}^d)$ is at least $\beta$.</description>

      <title>Recovering orthogonality from quasi-nature of Spectral transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this contribution, quasi-orthogonality of polynomials generated by Geronimus and Uvarov transformations is analyzed. An attempt is made to discuss the recovery of the source orthogonal polynomial from the quasi-Geronimus and quasi-Uvarov polynomials of order one. Moreover, the discussion on the difference equation satisfied by quasi-Geronimus and quasi-Uvarov polynomials is presented. Furthermore, the orthogonality of quasi-Geronimus and quasi-Uvarov polynomials is achieved through the reduction of the degree of coefficients in the difference equation. During this procedure, alternative representations of the parameters responsible for achieving orthogonality are derived. One of these representations involves the Stieltjes transform of the measure. Finally, the recurrence coefficients ensuring the existence of a measure that makes the quasi-Geronimus Laguerre polynomial of order one an orthogonal polynomial are calculated.</description>

      <title>Symmetries and periodic orbits for the $n$-body problem: about the computational approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main problem is to understand and to find periodic symmetric orbits in the $n$-body problem, in the sense of finding methods to prove or compute their existence, and more importantly to describe their qualitative and quantitative properties. In order to do so, and in order to classify such orbits and their symmetries, computers have been extensively used in many ways since decades. We will focus on some very special symmetric orbits, which occur as symmetric critical points (local minimizers) of the gravitational Lagrangean action functional. The exploration of the loop space of the $n$-point configuration space, raised some computational and mathematical questions that couldd be interesting. The aim of the article is to explain how such questions and issues were % considered in the development of a software package that combined symbolic algebra, numerical and scientific libraries, human interaction and visualization.</description>
