      <title>Learning geometry-dependent lead-field operators for forward ECG modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern forward electrocardiogram (ECG) computational models rely on an accurate representation of the torso domain. The lead-field method enables fast ECG simulations while preserving full geometric fidelity. Achieving high anatomical accuracy in torso representation is, however, challenging in clinical practice, as imaging protocols are typically focused on the heart and often do not include the entire torso. In addition, the computational cost of the lead-field method scales linearly with the number of electrodes, limiting its applicability in high-density recording settings. To date, no existing approach simultaneously achieves high anatomical fidelity, low data requirements and computational efficiency. In this work, we propose a shape-informed surrogate model of the lead-field operator that serves as a drop-in replacement for the full-order model in forward ECG simulations. The proposed framework consists of two components: a geometry-encoding module that maps anatomical shapes into a low-dimensional latent space, and a geometry-conditioned neural surrogate that predicts lead-field gradients from spatial coordinates, electrode positions and latent codes. The proposed method achieves high accuracy in approximating lead fields both within the torso (mean angular error 5{\deg}) and inside the heart, resulting in highly accurate ECG simulations (relative mean squared error &lt;2.5%. The surrogate consistently outperforms the widely used pseudo lead-field approximation while preserving negligible inference cost. Owing to its compact latent representation, the method does not require a fully detailed torso segmentation and can therefore be deployed in data-limited settings while preserving high-fidelity ECG simulations.</description>

      <title>Non-linear visco-elasto-plastic rheology of a viscous vertex model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Morphogenesis involves complex shape changes of biological tissues. Yet, tissue shape changes depend on tissue rheology, which in turn arises from the interplay of large numbers of cells. Here, we link cell- and tissue-scale mechanics by constructing mean-field rheological relations for the vertex model. In contrast to past work in the field, we study a vertex model with an explicit viscous friction. We also include two different cellular mechanisms creating active, anisotropic stresses. Our mean-field model accounts for cell shape and the non-linear elastic and visco-plastic regimes. We validate our results by predicting the response to large-amplitude oscillatory shear. There are several vertex model variants, and comparing to results from the literature, we show that their rheology depends on a number of model details. Our approach should be sufficiently general to construct non-linear mean-field constitutive relations for any cell-based tissue model.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Monitor: Mixed Reality Visualization and Multimodal AI for Enhanced Digital Pathology Workflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pathologists diagnose cancer using gigapixel whole-slide images (WSIs), but the current digital workflow is fragmented. These multiscale datasets often exceed 100,000 x 100,000 pixels, yet standard 2D monitors restrict the field of view. This disparity forces constant panning and zooming, which increases cognitive load and disrupts diagnostic momentum. We introduce PathVis, a mixed-reality platform for Apple Vision Pro that unifies this ecosystem into a single immersive environment. PathVis replaces indirect mouse navigation with embodied interaction, utilizing eye gaze, natural hand gestures, and voice commands to explore gigapixel data. The system integrates multimodal AI agents to support computer-aided diagnosis: a content-based image retrieval engine spatially displays similar patient cases for side-by-side prognostic comparison, while a conversational assistant provides real-time interpretation. By merging immersive visualization with integrated AI capabilities, PathVis shows promise in streamlining diagnostic workflows and mitigating the burden of context switching. This paper presents the system architecture and a preliminary qualitative evaluation demonstrating the platform's feasibility. The PathVis source code and a demo video are publicly available at: https://github.com/jaiprakash1824/Path_Vis.</description>
