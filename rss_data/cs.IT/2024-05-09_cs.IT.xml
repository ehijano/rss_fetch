      <title>Bounds on the Statistical Leakage-Resilience of Shamir's Secret Sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Secret sharing is an instrumental tool for sharing secret keys in distributed systems. In a classical threshold setting, this involves a dealer who has a secret/key, a set of parties/users to which shares of the secret are sent, and a threshold on the number of users whose presence is needed in order to recover the secret. In secret sharing, secure links with no leakage are often assumed between the involved parties. However, when the users are nodes in a communication network and all the links are physical links, e.g., wireless, such assumptions are not valid anymore. In order to study this critical problem, we propose a statistical leakage model of secret sharing, where some noisy versions of all the secret shares might be independently leaked to an adversary. We then study the resilience of the seminal Shamir's secret sharing scheme with statistical leakage, and bound certain measures of security (i.e., semantic security, mutual information security), given other parameters of the system including the amount of leakage from each secret share. We show that for an extreme scenario of Shamir's scheme, in particular when the underlying field characteristic is $2$, the security of each bit of the secret against leakage improves exponentially with the number of users. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt towards understanding secret sharing under general statistical noisy leakage.</description>

      <title>One-Bit Phase Retrieval: Optimal Rates and Efficient Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the sample complexity and develop efficient optimal algorithms for 1-bit phase retrieval: recovering a signal $\mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{R}^n$ from $m$ phaseless bits $\{\mathrm{sign}(|\mathbf{a}_i^\top\mathbf{x}|-\tau)\}_{i=1}^m$ generated by standard Gaussian $\mathbf{a}_i$s. By investigating a phaseless version of random hyperplane tessellation, we show that (constrained) hamming distance minimization uniformly recovers all unstructured signals with Euclidean norm bounded away from zero and infinity to the error $\mathcal{O}((n/m)\log(m/n))$, and $\mathcal{O}((k/m)\log(mn/k^2))$ when restricting to $k$-sparse signals. Both error rates are shown to be information-theoretically optimal, up to a logarithmic factor. Intriguingly, the optimal rate for sparse recovery matches that of 1-bit compressed sensing, suggesting that the phase information is non-essential for 1-bit compressed sensing. We also develop efficient algorithms for 1-bit (sparse) phase retrieval that can achieve these error rates. Specifically, we prove that (thresholded) gradient descent with respect to the one-sided $\ell_1$-loss, when initialized via spectral methods, converges linearly and attains the near optimal reconstruction error, with sample complexity $\mathcal{O}(n)$ for unstructured signals and $\mathcal{O}(k^2\log(n)\log^2(m/k))$ for $k$-sparse signals. Our proof is based upon the observation that a certain local (restricted) approximate invertibility condition is respected by Gaussian measurements. To show this, we utilize a delicate covering argument and derive tight concentration bounds for the directional gradients by properly conditioning on the index set of phaseless hyperplane separations, which may be of independent interests and useful for other related problems.</description>

      <title>Communication-Efficient Collaborative Perception via Information Filling with Codebook</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collaborative perception empowers each agent to improve its perceptual ability through the exchange of perceptual messages with other agents. It inherently results in a fundamental trade-off between perception ability and communication cost. To address this bottleneck issue, our core idea is to optimize the collaborative messages from two key aspects: representation and selection. The proposed codebook-based message representation enables the transmission of integer codes, rather than high-dimensional feature maps. The proposed information-filling-driven message selection optimizes local messages to collectively fill each agent's information demand, preventing information overflow among multiple agents. By integrating these two designs, we propose CodeFilling, a novel communication-efficient collaborative perception system, which significantly advances the perception-communication trade-off and is inclusive to both homogeneous and heterogeneous collaboration settings. We evaluate CodeFilling in both a real-world dataset, DAIR-V2X, and a new simulation dataset, OPV2VH+. Results show that CodeFilling outperforms previous SOTA Where2comm on DAIR-V2X/OPV2VH+ with 1,333/1,206 times lower communication volume. Our code is available at https://github.com/PhyllisH/CodeFilling.</description>

      <title>RF-based Energy Harvesting: Nonlinear Models, Applications and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: So far, various aspects associated with wireless energy harvesting (EH) have been investigated from diverse perspectives, including energy sources and models, usage protocols, energy scheduling and optimization, and EH implementation in different wireless communication systems. However, a comprehensive survey specifically focusing on models of radio frequency (RF)-based EH behaviors has not yet been presented. To address this gap, this article provides an overview of the mainstream mathematical models that capture the nonlinear behavior of practical EH circuits, serving as a valuable handbook of mathematical models for EH application research. Moreover, we summarize the application of each nonlinear EH model, including the associated challenges and precautions. We also analyze the impact and advancements of each EH model on RF-based EH systems in wireless communication, utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. Additionally, we highlight emerging research directions in the context of nonlinear RF-based EH. This article aims to contribute to the future application of RF-based EH in novel communication research domains to a significant extent.</description>

      <title>On Stochastic Fundamental Limits in a Downlink Integrated Sensing and Communication Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to analyze the stochastic performance of a multiple input multiple output (MIMO) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system in a downlink scenario, where a base station (BS) transmits a dual-functional radar-communication (DFRC) signal matrix, serving the purpose of transmitting communication data to the user while simultaneously sensing the angular location of a target. The channel between the BS and the user is modeled as a random channel with Rayleigh fading distribution, and the azimuth angle of the target is assumed to follow a uniform distribution. Due to the randomness inherent in the network, the challenge is to consider suitable performance metrics for this randomness. To address this issue, for users, we employ the user's rate outage probability (OP) and ergodic rate, while for target, we propose using the OP of the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for the angle of arrival and the ergodic CRLB. We have obtained the expressions of these metrics for scenarios where the BS employs two different beamforming methods. Our approach to deriving these metrics involves computing the probability density function (PDF) of the signal-to-noise ratio for users and the CRLB for the target. We have demonstrated that the central limit theorem provides a viable approach for deriving these PDFs. In our numerical results, we demonstrate the trade-off between sensing and communication (S \&amp; C) by characterizing the region of S \&amp; C metrics and by obtaining the Pareto optimal boundary points, confirmed with simulations.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limits for Jammer-Resilient Communication in Finite-Resolution MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial filtering based on multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) processing is a powerful method for jammer mitigation. In principle, a MIMO receiver can null the interference of a single-antenna jammer at the cost of only one degree of freedom - if the number of receive antennas is large, communication performance is barely affected. In this paper, we show that the potential for MIMO jammer mitigation based on the digital outputs of finite-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) is fundamentally worse: Strong jammers will either cause the ADCs to saturate (when the ADCs' quantization range is small) or drown legitimate communication signals in quantization noise (when the ADCs' quantization range is large). We provide a fundamental bound on the mutual information between the quantized receive signal and the legitimate transmit signal. Our bound shows that, for any fixed ADC resolution, the mutual information tends to zero as the jammer power tends to infinity. Our bound also confirms the intuition that for every 6.02 dB increase in jamming power, the ADC resolution must be increased by 1 bit in order to prevent the mutual information from vanishing.</description>

      <title>Broadcast Channel Synthesis from Shared Randomness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of synthesising a two-user broadcast channel using a common message, where each output terminal shares an independent source of randomness with the input terminal. This generalises two problems studied in the literature (Cuff, IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory, 2013; Kurri et.al., IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory, 2021). We give an inner bound on the tradeoff region between the rates of communication and shared randomness, and a lower bound on the minimum communication rate. Although the bounds presented here are not tight in general, they are tight for some special cases, including the aforementioned problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The need to analyze sensitive data, such as medical records or financial data, has created a critical research challenge in recent years. In this paper, we adopt the framework of differential privacy, and explore mechanisms for generating an entire dataset which accurately captures characteristics of the original data. We build upon the work of Boedihardjo et al, which laid the foundations for a new optimization-based algorithm for generating private synthetic data. Importantly, we adapt their algorithm by replacing a uniform sampling step with a private distribution estimator; this allows us to obtain better computational guarantees for discrete distributions, and develop a novel algorithm suitable for continuous distributions. We also explore applications of our work to several statistical tasks.</description>

      <title>Achievable Rate Optimization for Stacked Intelligent Metasurface-Assisted Holographic MIMO Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM) is a revolutionary technology, which can outperform its single-layer counterparts by performing advanced signal processing relying on wave propagation. In this work, we exploit SIM to enable transmit precoding and receiver combining in holographic multiple-input multiple-output (HMIMO) communications, and we study the achievable rate by formulating a joint optimization problem of the SIM phase shifts at both sides of the transceiver and the covariance matrix of the transmitted signal. Notably, we propose its solution by means of an iterative optimization algorithm that relies on the projected gradient method, and accounts for all optimization parameters simultaneously. We also obtain the step size guaranteeing the convergence of the proposed algorithm. Simulation results provide fundamental insights such the performance improvements compared to the single-RIS counterpart and conventional MIMO system. Remarkably, the proposed algorithm results in the same achievable rate as the alternating optimization (AO) benchmark but with a less number of iterations.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Identification Codes for Fading Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many communication applications incorporate event-triggered behavior, where the conventional Shannon capacity may not effectively gauge performance. Consequently, we advocate for the concept of identification capacity as a more suitable metric for assessing these systems. We consider deterministic identification codes for the Gaussian AWGN, the slow fading, and the fast fading channels with power constraints. We prove lower bounds on capacities for the slow and the fast fading channels with side information for a wide range of fading distributions. Additionally, we present the code construction with efficient encoding which achieves the lower bound on capacity both for the slow and the fast fading channels. At last, we prove the same lower bound on the capacity of the fast fading channel without side information, i.e. the same lower bound holds even when the receiver doesn't know the fading coefficients. As a result we show that compared with Shannon's message transmission paradigm we achieved completely different capacity scaling for deterministic identification codes for all relevant fading channels.</description>

      <title>$\alpha$-leakage by R\'{e}nyi Divergence and Sibson Mutual Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00423v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $\tilde{f}(t) = \exp(\frac{\alpha-1}{\alpha}t)$, this paper proposes a $\tilde{f}$-mean information gain measure. R\'{e}nyi divergence is shown to be the maximum $\tilde{f}$-mean information gain incurred at each elementary event $y$ of channel output $Y$ and Sibson mutual information is the $\tilde{f}$-mean of this $Y$-elementary information gain. Both are proposed as $\alpha$-leakage measures, indicating the most information an adversary can obtain on sensitive data. It is shown that the existing $\alpha$-leakage by Arimoto mutual information can be expressed as $\tilde{f}$-mean measures by a scaled probability. Further, Sibson mutual information is interpreted as the maximum $\tilde{f}$-mean information gain over all estimation decisions applied to channel output. This reveals that the exiting generalized Blahut-Arimoto method for computing R\'{e}nyi capacity (or Gallager's error exponent) in fact maximizes a $\tilde{f}$-mean information gain iteratively over estimation decision and channel input. This paper also derives a decomposition of $\tilde{f}$-mean information gain, analogous to the Sibson identity for R\'{e}nyi divergence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the important applications of Golay complementary sets (GCSs) is the reduction of peak-to-mean envelope power ratio (PMEPR) in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. OFDM has played a major role in modern wireless systems such as long-term-evolution (LTE), 5th generation (5G) wireless standards, etc. This paper searches for systematic constructions of GCSs of arbitrary lengths and alphabet sizes. The proposed constructions are based on extended Boolean functions (EBFs). For the first time, we can generate codes of independent parameter choices.</description>

      <title>Ranking Edges by their Impact on the Spectral Complexity of Information Diffusion over Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.15148v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the numerous ways now available to quantify which parts or subsystems of a network are most important, there remains a lack of centrality measures that are related to the complexity of information flows and are derived directly from entropy measures. Here, we introduce a ranking of edges based on how each edge's removal would change a system's von Neumann entropy (VNE), which is a spectral-entropy measure that has been adapted from quantum information theory to quantify the complexity of information dynamics over networks. We show that a direct calculation of such rankings is computationally inefficient (or unfeasible) for large networks: e.g.\ the scaling is $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ per edge for networks with $N$ nodes. To overcome this limitation, we employ spectral perturbation theory to estimate VNE perturbations and derive an approximate edge-ranking algorithm that is accurate and fast to compute, scaling as $\mathcal{O}(N)$ per edge. Focusing on a form of VNE that is associated with a transport operator $e^{-\beta{ L}}$, where ${ L}$ is a graph Laplacian matrix and $\beta&gt;0$ is a diffusion timescale parameter, we apply this approach to diverse applications including a network encoding polarized voting patterns of the 117th U.S. Senate, a multimodal transportation system including roads and metro lines in London, and a multiplex brain network encoding correlated human brain activity. Our experiments highlight situations where the edges that are considered to be most important for information diffusion complexity can dramatically change as one considers short, intermediate and long timescales $\beta$ for diffusion.</description>

      <title>Relative Fractional Independence Number and Its Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06155v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define the relative fractional independence number of a graph $G$ with respect to another graph $H$, as $$\alpha^*(G|H)=\max_{W}\frac{\alpha(G\boxtimes W)}{\alpha(H\boxtimes W)},$$ where the maximum is taken over all graphs $W$, $G\boxtimes W$ is the strong product of $G$ and $W$, and $\alpha$ denotes the independence number. We give a non-trivial linear program to compute $\alpha^*(G|H)$ and discuss some of its properties. We show that $\alpha^*(G|H)\geq \frac{X(G)}{X(H)} \geq \frac{1}{\alpha^*(H|G)},$ where $X(G)$ can be the independence number, the zero-error Shannon capacity, the fractional independence number, the Lov\'{a}sz number, or the Schrijver's or Szegedy's variants of the Lov\'{a}sz number of a graph $G$. This inequality is the first explicit non-trivial upper bound on the ratio of the invariants of two arbitrary graphs, as mentioned earlier, which can also be used to obtain upper or lower bounds for these invariants. As explicit applications, we present new upper bounds for the ratio of the zero-error Shannon capacity of two Cayley graphs and compute new lower bounds on the Shannon capacity of certain Johnson graphs (yielding the exact value of their Haemers number). Moreover, we show that $\alpha^*(G|H)$ can be used to present a stronger version of the well-known No-Homomorphism Lemma.</description>
