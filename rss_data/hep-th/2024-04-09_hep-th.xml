      <title>Pattern formation from Gauge/Gravity Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the framework of the AdS/CFT correspondence, we report a complex scalar field dynamics in a $2+1$ dimensional black hole background can provide a scheme to study the pattern formation process in $1+1$ dimensional reaction-diffusion systems. The patterns include plane wave, defect turbulence, phase turbulence, spatio-temporal intermittency where defect chaos coexists with stable plane wave, and coherent structures. A phase diagram is obtained by studying the linear instability of the plane wave solutions to determine the onset of the holographic version of the Benjamin-Feir instability near a supercritical Hopf bifurcation.</description>

      <title>Relativistic head-on collisions of $U(1)$ gauged Q-balls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the collision dynamics of $U(1)$ gauged Q-balls by performing high-resolution numerical simulations in axisymmetry. Focusing on the case of relativistic head-on collisions, we consider the effects of the initial velocity, relative phase, relative charge, and electromagnetic coupling strength on the outcome of the collision. We find that the collision dynamics can depend strongly on these parameters; most notably, electromagnetic effects can significantly alter the outcome of the collision when the gauge coupling is large. When the gauge coupling is small, we find that the dynamics generally resemble those of ordinary (non-gauged) Q-balls.</description>

      <title>Operators in the Internal Space and Locality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realizations of the holographic correspondence in String/M theory typically involve spacetimes of the form $AdS \times Y$ where $Y$ is some internal space which geometrizes an internal symmetry of the dual field theory, hereafter referred to as an "$R$ symmetry". It has been speculated that areas of Ryu-Takayanagi surfaces anchored on the boundary of a subregion of $Y$, and smeared over the base space of the dual field theory, quantify entanglement of internal degrees of freedom. A natural candidate for the corresponding operators are linear combinations of operators with definite $R$ charge with coefficients given by the "spherical harmonics'' of the internal space: this is natural when the product spaces appear as IR geometries of higher dimensional AdS spaces. We study clustering properties of such operators both for pure $AdS \times Y$ and for flow geometries, where $AdS \times Y$ arises in the IR from a different spacetime in the UV, for example higher dimensional AdS or asymptotically flat spacetime. We show, in complete generality, that the two point functions of such operators separated along the internal space obey clustering properties at scales larger than the $AdS$ scale. For non-compact $Y$, this provides a notion of approximate locality. When $Y$ is compact, clustering happens only when the size of $Y$ is parametrically larger than the $AdS$ scale. This latter situation is realized in flow geometries where the product spaces arise in the IR from an asymptotically AdS geometry at UV, but not typically when they arise near black hole horizons in asymptotically flat spacetimes. We discuss the significance of this result for entanglement and comment on the role of color degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Evidence for universal flow and characteristics of early time thermalization in a scalar field model for heavy ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study numerically the evolution of an expanding strongly self-coupled real scalar field. We use a conformally invariant action that gives a traceless energy-momentum tensor and is better suited to model the early time behaviour of a system such as QCD, whose action is also conformally invariant.We consider asymmetric initial conditions and observe that when the system is initialized with non-zero spatial eccentricity, the eccentricity decreases and the elliptic flow coefficient increases. We look at a measure of transverse pressure asymmetry that has been shown to behave similarly to the elliptic flow coefficient in hydrodynamic systems and show that in our system their behaviour is strikingly similar. We show that the derivative of the transverse velocity is proportional to the gradient of the energy in Milne coordinates and argue that this result means that transverse velocity initially develops in the same way that it does in hydrodynamic systems. We conclude that some aspects of the early onset of hydrodynamic behaviour that has been observed in quark-gluon plasmas are seen in our numerical simulation of strongly coupled scalar fields.</description>

      <title>Scale invariance beyond criticality within the mean-field analysis of tensorial field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue the series of articles on the application of Landau-Ginzburg mean-field theory to unveil the basic phase structure of tensorial field theories which are characterized by combinatorially non-local interactions. Among others, this class covers tensor field theories (TFT) which lead to a new class of conformal field theories highly relevant for investigations on the AdS/CFT conjecture. Moreover, it also encompasses models within the tensorial group field theory (TGFT) approach to quantum gravity. Crucially, we find in the infrared that the effective mass of such theories generically vanishes not only at criticality but also throughout the entire phase of non-vanishing vacuum expectation value due to the non-locality of the interactions. As a consequence, one encounters there the emergence of scale invariance which is potentially enhanced to conformal invariance on configuration space.</description>

      <title>Nontrivial Black Hole Horizon at the Critical Point in Einstein-$R^2$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a family of new black holes with a nontrivial horizon in Einstein-$R^2$ gravity with a negative cosmological constant. The solutions are found at the critical point where the coefficient of the $R^2$ term is fixed and the phase structure of AdS black holes of the theory is reversed. These solutions possess vanishing entropy.</description>

      <title>A systematic approach to celestial holography: a case study in Einstein gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a systematic approach to celestial holography in massless theories beginning by studying the implications of properly incorporating field configurations built using the eigenstates of central interest: massless conformal primary wavefunctions that diagonalize the dilatation generator. Due to their singular behaviour on the locus $k\cdot x=0$, they do not belong to the space of Fourier decomposable functions, and incorporating them in the path integral domain requires careful manipulations. In this paper, we include these singular field configurations by a splitting procedure using large pure gauge/diffeomorphism transformations on the action functional. We demonstrate that doing so splits the action into an integrand supported on the singular locus $k\cdot x=0$ and an integrand on the rest of the space. Mellin transforms single out the scalings/conformal dimension in $x$, geometrically, we treat this as a proper non-compact scaling reduction, where we are able to further isolate the dynamics of the large pure diffeomorphism transformations. This takes the form of 2d chiral CFT on a 2d sphere on the singular locus $k\cdot x=0$ - the celestial sphere where the null cone of the origin cuts $\mathscr{I}$. Using this framework, we study Einstein gravity perturbatively around its self-dual sector, where the resulting microscopic 2d CFT couples to bulk scattering states. We are able to obtain an explicit representation of the $\mathcal{L} w_{1+\infty}$ algebra and leading soft splitting functions. With further marginal deformations, we also write down effective interaction vertices which provide form factors of tree-level graviton scattering in Minkowski space.</description>

      <title>Hawking-Page transition in holographic QCD at finite density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the confinement/deconfinement transition of QCD matter for a quark-gluon plasma at finite density using AdS/QCD duality. In order to determine the critical temperature and its dependence on the quark chemical potential, the semi-classical Hawking-Page approach is considered for a charged AdS black hole. The result obtained is consistent with the QCD phase diagram, with the critical temperature decreasing as the chemical potential increases. Using the soft wall holographic model, the value of quark density in which the phase transition occurs at zero temperature is estimated. For higher densities the QCD matter is deconfined, independent of the temperature.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new, exact, rotating and accelerating solutions within the framework of five-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory at the Chern-Simons point. The rotating solutions describe black holes characterized by a single rotation parameter, a mass parameter, and two extra integration constants that can be interpreted as hairs of a gravitational nature. It is noteworthy that the rotation cannot be removed by a large diffeomorphism. We also extend our procedure to dimension seven, providing a new rotating black hole solution with two rotation parameters pertaining to cubic Lovelock theory with a unique vacuum.</description>

      <title>Kerr-like metric in 4D Double Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Double Field Theory suggests that people can view the whole massless NS-NS sector as the gravitational unity. The $O(D,D)$ covariance and the doubled diffeomorphisms determine precisely how the Standard Model as well as a relativistic point particle should couple to the NS-NS sector. The theory also refines the notion of singularity. In [1], the authors derive analytically the most general, spherically symmetric, asymptotically flat, static vacuum solution to $D = 4$ Double Field Theory. The solution contains three free parameters and consequently generalizes the Schwarzschild geometry. In this paper, we generalize the metric in [1] to obtain the 'Kerr-like' metric in $D = 4$ double field theory (DFT) in the Einstein frame and string frame. Then we apply 'covariant phase space' approach to study the thermodynamic properties of the metric we have obtained. We explore the first law of black hole thermodynamics and Hawking radiation for this metric carefully. As a special case, the 'Schwarzschild-like' metric in $4D$ double field theory in [1] can be recovered.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic singularities of Renyi entropy as a sign of chaos?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose that the logarithmic singularities of the Renyi entropy of local-operator-excited states for replica index $n$ can be a sign of quantum chaos. As concrete examples, we analyze the logarithmic singularities of the Renyi entropy in various two-dimensional conformal field theories. We show that there are always logarithmic singularities of the Renyi entropy in holographic CFTs, but no such singularities in free and rational CFTs. These singularities of the Renyi entropy are also related to the logarithmic time growth of the Renyi entropy at late times.</description>

      <title>A Covariant and Manifestly Projective Invariant Formulation of Thomas-Whitehead Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thomas-Whitehead (TW) gravity is a recently formulated projectively invariant extension of Einstein-Hilbert gravity. Projective geometry was used long ago by Thomas et. al. to succinctly package equivalent paths encoded by the geodesic equation. Projective invariance in gravity has further origins in string theory through a geometric action constructed from the method of coadjoint orbits using the Virasoro Algebra. A projectively invariant connection arises from this construction, a part of which is known as the diffeomorphism field. TW Gravity exploits projective Gauss-Bonnet terms in the action functional to endow the diffeomorphism field with dynamics, while allowing the theory to collapse to General Relativity in the limit that the diffeomorphism field vanishes and the connection becomes Levi-Civita. In the original formulation of TW gravity, the diffeomorphism field is projectively invariant but not tensorial and the connection is projectively invariant but not affine. In this paper we reformulate TW gravity in terms of projectively invariant tensor fields and a projectively invariant covariant derivative, derive field equations respecting these symmetries, and show that the field equations obtained are classically equivalent across formulations. This provides a 'Rosetta Stone' between this newly constructed covariant and projective invariant formulation of TW gravity and the original formulation that was manifestly projectively invariant, but not covariant.</description>

      <title>Quantum Trans-Planckian Physics inside Black Holes and its Spectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a quantum unifying picture for black holes of all masses and their main properties covering classical, semiclassical, Planckian and trans-Planckian gravity domains: Space-time, size, mass, vacuum ("zero point") energy, temperature, partition function, density of states and entropy. Novel results of this paper are: Black hole {\bf interiors} are always {\bf quantum}, trans-Planckian and of constant curvature: This is so for {\it all} black holes, including the most macroscopic and astrophysical ones. The black hole interior trans-Planckian vacuum is similar to the earliest cosmological vacuum which classical gravity dual is the low energy gravity vaccum: today dark energy. There is {\it no} singularity boundary at $r = 0$, not at any other place: The quantum space-time is
  {\bf totally regular}. The {\it quantum} Penrose diagram of the Schwarschild-Kruskal black hole is displayed. The complete black hole {\it instanton} (imaginary time) covers the known classical Gibbons-Hawking instanton plus a {\it new} central highly dense {\it quantum core} of Planck length radius and {\it constant curvature}. The complete partition function, entropy, temperature, decay rate, discrete levels and density of states {\it all} include the trans-Planckian domaine. The semiclassical black hole entropy (the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy)$ (\sqrt{n})^2$ "interpolates" between the quantum point particle (QFT) entropy $(n)$ and the quantum string entropy $\sqrt{n}$, while the quantum trans-Planckian entropy is $1/(\sqrt{n})^2$. Black hole evaporation ends as {\it a pure (non mixed)} quantum state of particles, gravitons and radiation.</description>

      <title>Massless limit and conformal soft limit for celestial massive amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In celestial holography, the massive and massless scalars in 4d space-time are represented by the Fourier transform of the bulk-to-boundary propagators and the Mellin transform of plane waves respectively. Recently, the 3pt celestial amplitude of one massive scalar and two massless scalars was discussed in arXiv:2312.08597. In this paper, we compute the 3pt celestial amplitude of two massive scalars and one massless scalar. Then we take the massless limit $m\to 0$ for one of the massive scalars, during which process the gamma function $\Gamma(1-\Delta)$ appears. By requiring the resulting amplitude to be well-defined, that is it goes to the 3pt amplitude of arXiv:2312.08597, the scaling dimension of this massive scalar has to be conformally soft $\Delta \to 1$. The pole $1/(1-\Delta)$ coming from $\Gamma(1-\Delta)$ is crucial for this massless limit. Without it the resulting amplitude would be zero. This can be compared with the conformal soft limit in celestial gluon amplitudes, where a singularity $1/(\Delta -1)$ arises and the leading contribution comes from the soft energy $\omega\to 0$. The phase factors in the massless limit of massive conformal primary wave functions, dicussed in arXiv:1705.01027, plays an import and consistent role in the celestial massive amplitudes. In this massless limit, the subleading terms $m^{2n}$ can also contribute poles when the scaling dimension is analytically continued to $\Delta=1-n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study radius stabilization in the Randall-Sundrum model without assuming any unnaturally large stabilizing scalar potential parameter at the boundary branes ($\gamma$) by the frequently used superpotential method. Employing a perturbative expansion in $1/\gamma^2$ and the backreaction parameter, we obtain approximate analytical expressions for the radion mass and wavefunction. We validate them through a dedicated numerical analysis, which solves the linearized coupled scalar and metric field equations exactly. It is observed that the radion mass decreases with decreasing $\gamma$. Below a critical value of $\gamma$, the radion becomes tachyonic, suggesting destabilization of the extra dimension. We also address the issue of non-Hermiticity of the differential operator that determines the radion and Kaluza-Klein (KK) mode wavefunctions in the finite $\gamma$ limit. It is accomplished by finding an explicit form of the general scalar product that re-establishes the orthogonality in the KK decomposition.</description>

Abstract: The Emergence Proposal suggests that some Swampland criteria, in particular on large field distances, are a consequence of the emergent nature of dynamics for fields in the infrared. In the context of type II string theory compactified on Calabi-Yau manifolds, it proposes that the cubic tree-level piece of the genus-zero prepotential is emergent from integrating out massive non-perturbative states. For a certain special non-compact Calabi-Yau, the blown-up conifold, it is known that the full all-genus prepotential can be matched onto the Grand Canonical potential of a two-dimensional Fermi gas. We propose here that this should be understood in the context of emergence: the prepotential is induced by integrating out the Fermi gas degrees of freedom. To make contact with the Swampland we need dynamical gravity, so compact Calabi-Yau manifolds. We show that for specifically the cubic term, an integrating out calculation also works for compact cases. In particular, the exact cubic term coefficient can be recovered from integrating out a Fermi gas for any compact Calabi-Yau that is an elliptic fibration over a reflexive toric base. We also propose a general map, for any one-parameter Calabi-Yau, between the Grand Canonical potential of the ultraviolet non-perturbative system and the period. In particular, this map leads to an emergent cubic term in the genus-zero prepotential for any such one-parameter model.</description>

      <title>Hybrid inflation from supersymmetry breaking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend a recently proposed framework, dubbed inflation by supersymmetry breaking, to hybrid inflation by introducing a waterfall field that allows to decouple the supersymmetry breaking scale in the observable sector from the inflation scale, while keeping intact the inflation sector and its successful predictions: naturally small slow-roll parameters, small field initial conditions and absence of the pseudo-scalar companion of the inflaton, in terms of one free parameter which is the first order correction to the inflaton K\"ahler potential. During inflation, supersymmetry is spontaneously broken with the inflaton being the superpartner of the goldstino, together with a massive vector that gauges the R-symmetry. Inflation arises around the maximum of the scalar potential at the origin where R-symmetry is unbroken. Moreover, a nearby minimum with tuneable vacuum energy can be accommodated by introducing a second order correction to the K\"ahler potential. The inflaton sector can also play the role of the supersymmetry breaking 'hidden' sector when coupled to the (supersymmetric) Standard Model, predicting a superheavy superparticle spectrum near the inflation scale. Here we show that the introduction of a waterfall field provides a natural way to end inflation and allows for a scale separation between supersymmetry breaking and inflation. Moreover, the study of the global vacuum describing low energy Standard Model physics can be done in a perturbative way within a region of the parameter space of the model.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear chiral forms in the Sen formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sen formulation for chiral $(2p)$-form in $4p+2$ dimensions describes a system with two separate sectors, one is physical while the other is unphysical. Each contains a chiral form and a metric. In this paper, we focus on the cases where the self-duality condition for the unphysical sector is linear while for the physical sector can be nonlinear. We show that in order for the decoupling to be realised at the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian levels, the action should take a certain form. The decoupling at the Hamiltonian level follows the idea in the literature. Then by an appropriate field redefinition of the corresponding first-order Lagrangian, the separation at the Lagrangian level follows. We derive the diffeomorphism of the theory in the case where the chiral form in the physical sector is nonlinear and couple to external $(2p+1)$-form field. Explicit forms of Sen theories are also discussed. The Lagrangian for the quadratic theory is separated into two Henneaux-Teitelboim Lagrangians. We also discuss the method of generating explicit nonlinear theories with $p=1$ is discussed. Finally, we also show that the M5-brane action in the Sen formulation is separated into a Henneaux-Teitleboim action in unphysical sector and a gauge-fixed PST in physical sector.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method to extract the low energy behavior of physical observables from their high energy expansions, systematically calculable via the operator product expansion (OPE), in asymptotically free and mass-gapped theories. By applying the inverse Laplace transform to correlation functions, their analytic structure is modified such that low-energy information connects with high energy expansions. Furthermore, this transformation alleviates the renormalon problem, enabling a more straightforward application of the OPE compared to the OPE before the transformation. We demonstrate that the low energy limit of correlation functions can be accurately extracted using the OPE in the two dimensional $O(N)$ nonlinear $\sigma$ model, serving as a first testing ground.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study holographic supersymmetric Renyi entropies from a family of hyperbolic black holes in an Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton (EMD) system under the BPS condition. We calculate the thermodynamic quantities of these hyperbolic black holes. We find a remarkably simple formula of the supersymmetric Renyi entropy that unifies (interpolates) 11 cases embeddable to 10 or 11 dimensional supergravity. It reproduces many known results in the literature, and gives new results with distinctive features. We show that the supersymmetric version of the modular entropy and the capacity of entanglement cannot be mapped to thermal quantities, due to the dependence of the temperature and the chemical potential by the BPS condition. We also calculate the entanglement spectrum. We derive the potential of the EMD system from a $V=0$ solution and obtain two neutral solutions with scalar hair as a byproduct.</description>

      <title>Substructures of the Weyl group and their physical applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study substructures of the Weyl group of conformal transformations of the metric of (pseudo)Riemannian manifolds. These substructures are identified by differential constraints on the conformal factors of the transformations which are chosen such that their composition is associative. Mathematically, apart from rare exceptions, they are partial associative groupoids, not groups, so they do not have an algebra of infinitesimal transformations, but this limitation can be partially circumvented using some of their properties cleverly. We classify and discuss the substructures with two-derivatives differential constraints, the most famous of which being known as the harmonic or restricted Weyl group in the physics literature, but we also show the existence of a lightcone constraint which realizes a proper subgroup of the Weyl group. We then show the physical implications that come from invariance under the two most important substructures, concentrating on classical properties of the energy-momentum tensor and a generalization of the quantum trace anomaly. We also elaborate further on the harmonic substructure, which can be interpreted as partial gauge fixing of full Weyl invariance using BRST methods. Finally, we discuss how to construct differential constraints of arbitrary higher-derivative order and present, as examples, generalizations involving scalar constraints with four and six derivatives.</description>

      <title>A de Sitter S-matrix from amputated cosmological correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extending scattering to states with unphysical mass values (particles ``off their mass shell'') has been instrumental in developing modern amplitude technology for Minkowski spacetime. Here, we study the off-shell correlators which underpin the recently proposed S-matrix for scattering on de Sitter spacetime. By labelling each particle with both a spatial momentum and an independent ``energy'' variable (the de Sitter analogue of a 4-momentum), we find that the practical computation of these correlators is greatly simplified. This allows us to derive compact expressions for all 3- and 4-particle S-matrices at tree-level for scalar fields coupled through any derivative interactions. As on Minkowski, we find that the 3-particle and exchange part of the 4-particle S-matrices are unique (up to crossing). The remaining contact part of the 4-particle S-matrix is an analytic function of just two differential operators, which become the usual Mandelstam variables in the Minkowski limit. Finally, we introduce a spectral decomposition for the tree-level exchange of a heavy field responsible for a cosmological collider signal. Once projected onto physical mass eigenstates, these S-matrix elements encode the statistical properties of the early inflationary perturbations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial monopoles have been engineered in various systems, yet there has been no systematic study on the singular vector potentials associated with the monopole field. We show that the Dirac string, the line singularity of the vector potential, can be engineered, manipulated, and made manifest in a spinor atomic condensate. We elucidate the connection among spin, orbital degrees of freedom, and the artificial gauge, and reveal that there exists a mapping between the vortex filament and the Dirac string. We also devise a proposal where preparing initial spin states with relevant symmetries can result in different vortex patterns, revealing an underlying correspondence between the internal spin states and the spherical vortex structures. Such a mapping also leads to a new way of constructing monopole harmonics. Our observation provides significant insights in quantum matter possessing internal symmetries in curved spaces.</description>

      <title>The Standard Model Gauge Group, SMEFT, and Generalized Symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss heavy particles that can be used to pin down the faithful Standard Model (SM) gauge group and their patterns in the SM effective field theory (SMEFT). These heavy particles are not invariant under a specific $\mathbb{Z}_6$ subgroup of $SU(3)_c\times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$, which however acts trivially on all the SM particles, hence the faithful SM gauge group remains undetermined. Different realizations of the faithful SM gauge group correspond to different spectra of heavy particles, and they also correspond to distinct sets of line operators with one-form global symmetry acting on them. We show that the heavy particles not invariant under the $\mathbb{Z}_6$ group cannot appear in tree-level ultraviolet completions of SMEFT, this enforces us to consider one-loop UV completions of SMEFT to identify the $\mathbb{Z}_6$ non-invariant heavy particles. We demonstrate with examples that correlations between Wilson coefficients provide an efficient way to examine models with $\mathbb{Z}_6$ non-invariant heavy particles. Finally, we prove that all the scalars that can trigger electroweak symmetry breaking must be invariant under the $\mathbb{Z}_6$ group, hence they cannot be used to probe the faithful SM gauge group.</description>

      <title>Quantum Spin Chains and Symmetric Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the question of what quantum spin chains naturally encode in their Hilbert space. It turns out that quantum spin chains are rather rich systems, naturally encoding solutions to various problems in combinatorics, group theory, and algebraic geometry. In the case of the XX Heisenberg spin chain these are given by skew Kostka numbers, skew characters of the symmetric group, and Littlewood-Richardson coefficients. As we show, this is revealed by a fermionic representation of the theory of "quantized" symmetric functions formulated by Fomin and Greene, which provides a powerful framework for constructing operators extracting this data from the Hilbert space of quantum spin chains. Furthermore, these operators are diagonalized by the Bethe basis of the quantum spin chain. Underlying this is the fact that quantum spin chains are examples of "quantum integrable systems." This is somewhat analogous to bosons encoding permanents and fermions encoding determinants. This points towards considering quantum integrable systems, and the combinatorics associated with them, as potentially interesting targets for quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Bipartite Fluctuations of Critical Fermi Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the scaling behaviors of bipartite fluctuations $\mathcal{F}$ of conserved quantities across a class of interaction-driven quantum phase transitions out of Landau fermi liquids, where other phases involve fermi-surface states of fractionalized degrees of freedom. Examples of such phases include (compressible) composite fermi liquids for spinless electrons and (incompressible) spin-liquid Mott insulators for spin-$1/2$ electrons. The two sides of the critical points are typically distinguished by distinct leading-order scalings of bipartite charge fluctuations, $\mathcal{F}\sim L\log (L)$ in Landau fermi liquids, and $\mathcal{F}\sim L$ in the other phases, where $L$ is the linear size of the subsystem under bipartition. In the case of composite fermi liquids (with continuous translational and rotational invariance), we also identify a universal constant term $-\mathtt{F}(\theta)\sigma_{xy}/\pi$ arising when the subsystem geometry incorporates a sharp corner. Here, $\mathtt{F}(\theta)$ represents a function of the corner angle, and $\sigma_{xy}$ denotes the Hall conductivity. At the critical point of each example, we find that the leading-order scaling $\mathcal{F}\sim L$ is accompanied by a subleading universal corner contribution $-\mathtt{F}(\theta)C_{\rho}\log(L)$ with the same angle dependence $\mathtt{F}(\theta)$. The universal coefficient $C_{\rho}$ is linked to the predicted universal longitudinal (and Hall) resistivity jump $\Delta\rho_{xx}$ (and $\Delta\rho_{xy}$) at the critical point.</description>

      <title>Disorder operators in 2D Fermi and non-Fermi liquids through multidimensional bosonization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disorder operators are a type of non-local observables for quantum many-body systems, measuring the fluctuations of symmetry charges inside a region. It has been shown that disorder operators can reveal global aspects of many-body states that are otherwise difficult to access through local measurements. We study disorder operator for U(1) (charge or spin) symmetry in 2D Fermi and non-Fermi liquid states, using the multidimensional bosonization formalism. For a region $A$, the logarithm of the charge disorder parameter in a Fermi liquid with isotropic interactions scales asympototically as $l_A\ln l_A$, with $l_A$ being the linear size of the region $A$. We calculate the proportionality coefficient in terms of Landau parameters of the Fermi liquid theory. We then study models of Fermi surface coupled to gapless bosonic fields realizing non-Fermi liquid states. In a simple spinless model, where the fermion density is coupled to a critical scalar, we find that at the quantum critical point, the scaling behavior of the charge disorder operators is drastically modified to $l_A \ln^2 l_A$. We also consider the composite Fermi liquid state and argue that the charge disorder operator scales as $l_A$.</description>

      <title>Boosted four-top production at the LHC : a window to Randall-Sundrum or extended color symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scenarios seeking to address the issue of electroweak symmetry breaking often have heavy colored gauge bosons coupling preferentially to the top quark. Considering the bulk Randall-Sundrum as a typical example, we consider the prospects of the first Kaluza-Klein mode ($G^{(1)}$) of the gluon being produced at the LHC in association with a $t \bar{t}$ pair. The enhanced coupling not only dictates that the dominant decay mode would be to a $t \bar{t}$ pair, but also to a very large $G^{(1)}$ width, necessitating the use of a renormalised $G^{(1)}$ propagator. This, alongwith the presence of large backgrounds (specially $t \bar{t} j j$), renders a conventional cut-based analysis ineffective, yielding only marginal significances of only around 2$\sigma$. The use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques alleviates this problem to a great extent. In particular, the use of Artificial Neural Networks helps us identify the most discriminating observables, thereby allowing a significance in excess of 4$\sigma$ for $G^{(1)}$ masses of $\sim$ 4 TeV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Wilson coefficients of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory are subject to a series of positivity bounds. It has been shown that, while the positivity part of the UV partial wave unitarity leads to the Wilson coefficients living in a convex cone, further including the non-positivity part caps the cone from above. For the Higgs scattering, a capped positivity cone have been obtained using a simplified, linear unitarity conditions and without utilizing the full internal symmetries of the Higgs scattering. Here we further implement the stronger nonlinear unitarity conditions from the UV, which generically gives rise to better bounds. We show that, for the Higgs case in particular, while the nonlinear unitarity conditions per se do not enhance the bounds, the fuller use of the internal symmetries do shrink the capped positivity cone significantly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the generalization of scalar field gravitational models with a minimum length we study the equivalent theory in modified theories of gravity. The quadratic Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) gives rise to a deformed Heisenberg algebra in the application, resulting in the emergence of additional degrees of freedom described by higher-order derivatives. The new degrees of freedom can be attributed to the introduction of a new scalar field, trasforming the resulting theory into a two-scalar field theory. Thus, in order to describe all the degrees of freedom we investigate special forms of the sixth-order modify $f\left( R,\square R\right) -$theory of gravity, where the gravitational Lagrangian has similar properties~to~that of the GUP scalar field theory. Finally, the cosmological applications are discussed, and we show that the de Sitter universe can be recovered without introducing a cosmological constant.</description>

Abstract: The unitary representations of the Poincare group of a discrete space-time are constructed, following the Wigner method in continuum relativity. They can be interpreted as elementary particles with one significant new feature: the momentum space being the 4-torus is identified as the Brillouin zone of space-time where all physical phenomena occur. Consequently 4-momentum is defined and conserved only modulo a reciprocal lattice vector of the order of the Planck mass, implying that there is no notion of an invariant mass except when it vanishes. In particular the propagation of massive particles have superluminal phases under very large (trans-Planckian) boosts. This behaviour leads to new features in early cosmology which are not in conflict with current knowledge.</description>

Abstract: A particular extension of Einstein's General Relativity up to and including quartic terms in the curvature tensor is minimal in the sense that it has a unique maximally symmetric vacuum and only a massless spin-2 excitation in its spectrum around the vacuum. We study the inflation phase of the universe in the minimal quartic extension of Einstein's gravity in the presence of trace anomaly terms in the Standard Model and the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model and show that the theory allows a quasi-de Sitter phase with a sufficient number of $e$-foldings and is compatible with the spectral index and the tensor to scalar ratio.</description>

      <title>Analytic and Numerical Study of Scalar Perturbations in Loop Quantum Cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The possibility that quantum geometry effects may alleviate the apparent tensions existing at large angular scales in the observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background explains the increasing interest in considering primordial perturbations within the framework of Loop Quantum Cosmology. In this framework, a number of approximations have been suggested to simplify the study of perturbations and derive analytic expressions for the power spectra. This study requires a new choice of vacuum state that takes into account the preinflationary background geometry, choice for which we adopt the so-called NO-AHD prescription. Here, we apply the aformentioned approximations to the investigation of scalar perturbations. We discuss two approaches to the quantization of perturbations in Loop Quantum Cosmology, namely the hybrid and the dressed metric approaches. We improve previous approximations by including slow-roll corrections in the inflationary era. Moreover, we compute numerically the primordial power spectra for the two considered approaches, and show that the analytic estimations are remarkably accurate for all observable modes. We also discuss the similarities and differences between the spectra obtained with those two approaches.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on degeneracy of non-canonical inflation driven by quartic potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here, the quartic inflationary potential $V(\phi)=\frac{\lambda}{4}\phi^4$ in non-canonical framework with a power-law Lagrangian is investigated. We demonstrate that the predictions of this potential in non-canonical framework align with the observational data of Planck 2018. We determine how the predictions of the model vary with changes in the non-canonical parameter $\alpha$ and the number of $e$-folds $N$. The sound speed, non-Gaussianity parameter, scalar spectral index, and tensor-to-scalar ratio are all influenced by $\alpha$. However, the scalar spectral index exhibits degeneracy with respect to changes in $\alpha$. It is found that, this degeneracy does not break through reheating consideration. Therefore, we investigate relic gravitational waves (GWs) and show that, the degeneracy of the model with respect to the $\alpha$ parameter can be broken using the relic GWs. Additionally, the density of relic GWs falls within the sensitivity range of GWs detectors for the specific $e$-folds number between 55 and 70.</description>

      <title>Quasi-parton distributions in massive QED2: Towards quantum computation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the quasi-parton distributions of the lightest $\eta'$ meson in massive two-dimensional Quantum electrodynamics (QED2) by performing a digital quantum simulation on a classical computer (exact diagonalization). The Hamiltonian and boost operators are mapped onto spin qubits in a spatial lattice with open boundary conditions. The lowest excited state in the exact diagonalization is shown to interpolate continuously between an anomalous $\eta'$ state at strong coupling,and a non-anomalous heavy meson at weak coupling, with a cusp at the critical point. The boosted $\eta'$ state follows relativistic kinematics but with large deviations in the luminal limit. The spatial quasi-parton distribution function and amplitude for the $\eta'$ state are computed numerically for increasing rapidity both at strong and weak coupling, and compared to the exact light front results. The numerical results from the boosted form of the spatial parton distributions, compare fairly with the inverse Fourier transformation of the luminal parton distributions, derived in the lowest Fock space approximation. Our analysis points out some of the limitations facing the current lattice program for the parton distributions.</description>

      <title>A New Perspective on Kaluza-Klein Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By assuming that the geometry of spacetime is uniquely determined by the energy momentum tensor of matter alone, i.e. without any interactions, enables us to construct the Lagrangian from which the metric of higher dimensional spacetime follows. From the geodesic equations that follow it becomes clear that the incorrect mass of elementary particles predicted by Kaluza-Klein theories arises from the assumption that in the absence of gravity the solution to the Einstein field equations reduces to the Minkowski metric. From construction of a consistent theory of $4\mathcal{D}$ electromagnetism, we find that this assumption does not only result in the incorrect mass of elementary particles, but also the incorrect value of the cosmological constant. This suggests that these incorrect predictions, which are often regarded as major flaws of Kaluza-Klein theories, just reflects the inconsistency of some postulates of general relativity and gauge theories. Abandoning this assumption results in modifications of general relativity. We show that the unified description of fundamental interactions naturally incorporates the Higgs mechanism. For non-Abelian gauge fields, we find that the manifold comprising the extra dimensions has to be a group manifold and show that the standard model is realised in 16$\mathcal{D}$ spacetime. We show that charge and spin are the same concept, but what makes them different is that the former follows from symmetry of $4\mathcal{D}$ spacetime while the latter follows from symmetry of the internal space.</description>

Abstract: This paper aims to establish a close connection between the Bardeen-Moshe-Bander phenomenon and a p=2+3 spin-glass model with sextic confinement potential. This is made possible by the unconventional power-counting induced by the effective kinetics provided by the disorder coupling in the large $N$-limit. Because of the absence of epsilon expansion, our approach is more attractive than the previous one and plays a relevant role in the signal detection issue in nearly continuous spectra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been shown that primordial tensor non-Gaussianities from a cubic Weyl action with a non-dynamical coupling are suppressed by the so-called slow-roll parameter in a conventional framework of slow-roll inflation. In this paper, we consider matter bounce cosmology in which the background spacetime is no longer quasi-de Sitter, and hence one might expect that the matter bounce models could predict non-suppressed non-Gaussianities. Nevertheless, we first show that the corresponding non-Gaussian amplitudes from the cubic Weyl term with a non-dynamical coupling are much smaller than those from the conventional slow-roll inflation, in spite of the fact that there is no slow-roll suppression. We then introduce a dynamical coupling that can boost the magnitude of graviton cubic interactions and clarify that there is a parameter region where the tensor non-Gaussianities can be enhanced and can potentially be tested by cosmic microwave background experiments.</description>

      <title>Rewording theoretical predictions at colliders with vacuum amplitudes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose multiloop vacuum amplitudes as the optimal building blocks for efficiently assembling theoretical predictions at high-energy colliders. This hypothesis is strongly supported by the manifestly causal properties of the loop-tree duality (LTD) representation of a vacuum amplitude. The vacuum amplitude, acting as a kernel, encodes all the final states contributing to a given scattering or decay process through residues in the on-shell energies of the internal propagators. It also naturally implements gauge invariance and the wave function renormalisation of the external legs. This methodological approach, dubbed LTD causal unitary, leads to a novel representation of differential cross sections and decay rates that is locally free of ultraviolet and infrared singularities at all orders in perturbation theory. Unitary threshold singularities also match between different phase-space residues. Most notably, it allows us to conjecture for the first time the local functional form of initial-state collinear singularities. The fulfillment of all these properties provides a theoretical description of differential observables at colliders that is well defined in the four physical dimensions of the space-time.</description>

Abstract: We present the first proof-of-concept application to decay processes at higher perturbative orders of LTD causal unitary, a novel methodology that exploits the causal properties of vacuum amplitudes in the loop-tree duality (LTD) and is directly well-defined in the four physical dimensions of the space-time. The generation of loop- and tree-level contributions to the differential decay rates from a kernel multiloop vacuum amplitude is shown in detail, and explicit expressions are presented for selected processes that are suitable for a lightweight understanding of the method. Specifically, we provide a clear physical interpretation of the local cancellation of soft, collinear and unitary threshold singularities, and of the local renormalisation of ultraviolet singularities. The presentation is illustrated with numerical results that showcase the advantages of the method.</description>

      <title>Relaxed hydrodynamic theory of electrically driven non-equilibrium steady states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrodynamics, as an effective theory capturing long-wavelength and late-time dynamics around thermal equilibrium states, finds applications in diverse physical systems, ranging from electron flow in metals, to ocean wave propagation, traffic flow, bacterial motion and the quark-gluon plasma. On the other hand, non-equilibrium steady states (NESS), characterized by a stationary flow of energy or matter in the presence of a driving force, are pervasive in nature but they present significant challenges to the foundational principles of statistical physics, as it is generally unclear if and how they satisfy the axiomatic assumptions of thermodynamics. The capability of hydrodynamics to accurately describe slow and long-wavelength fluctuations around a NESS remains an open question. In this study, we provide positive evidence by specifically addressing electrically driven non-equilibrium charged steady states. Our approach involves introducing gapped modes and extending the effective description into a relaxed hydrodynamic theory (RHT). Leveraging the gauge-gravity duality as a tool for controlled computations within non-equilibrium systems, we establish an ultraviolet complete model for these NESS that confirms the validity of our RHT. In summary, our findings present a concrete realization of a RHT applicable to a NESS. This expands the regime of validity of hydrodynamics beyond thermal equilibrium, offering valuable insights into the dynamics of non-equilibrium systems.</description>

Abstract: Photons in vacuum are transverse in any inertial frame; longitudinal photons only exist virtually. By developing a manifestly covariant theory for electromagnetic excitations in relativistic plasmas and applying Wigner's little group method for elementary particle classifications, we show that photons in plasmas are neither transverse nor longitudinal; they are oblique. Plasmons are electromagnetic and oblique as well. The Lorentz invariant characteristics that distinguishes photons and plasmons is covariant compressibility. The manifestly covariant theory predicts the existence of the current-plasmon, a third oblique, electromagnetic eigenmode, and it also enables the study of photon topology in plasmas. Plasmas remove the photon's Dirac point in vacuum by giving it an effective mass, but create a tilted Dirac-Weyl point by reviving the virtual longitudinal photon.</description>

      <title>Cosmological constant as quantum error correction from generalised gauge invariance in double field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:1711.01922v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The holographic principle and its realisation as the AdS/CFT correspondence leads to the existence of the so called precursor operators. These are boundary operators that carry non-local information regarding events occurring deep inside the bulk and which cannot be causally connected to the boundary. Such non-local operators can distinguish non-vacuum-like excitations within the bulk that cannot be observed by any local gauge invariant operators in the boundary. The boundary precursors are expected to become increasingly non-local the further the bulk process is from the boundary. Such phenomena are expected to be related to the extended nature of the strings. Standard gauge invariance in the boundary theory equates to quantum error correction which furthermore establishes localisation of bulk information. I show that when double field theory quantum error correction prescriptions are considered in the bulk, gauge invariance in the boundary manifests residual effects associated to stringy winding modes. Also, an effect of double field theory quantum error correction is the appearance of positive cosmological constant. The emergence of spacetime from the entanglement structure of a dual quantum field theory appears in this context to generalise for de-Sitter spacetimes as well.</description>

Abstract: Orientifold projections are an important ingredient in geometrical engineering of Quantum Field Theory. However, an orientifold can break down the superconformal symmetry and no new superconformal fixed points are admitted (II scenario); nevertheless, in some cases, dubbed I and III scenarios orientifold, a new IR fixed point is achieved and, for III scenario examples, some still not fully understood IR duality seems to emerge. Here we give an algebro-geometrical point of view of III scenario orientifold for toric varieties and we propose the existence of relevant operators that deform the starting oriented CFT triggering a flow. We briefly discuss a possible holographic description of this flow.</description>

Abstract: We study a spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism for a topological quantum field theory based on the twisted $\mathcal{N} = 2$ super-Yang-Mills theory. Specifically, by employing Fujikawa's Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin mechanism, local degrees of freedom are released. In fact, a trivial potential in the equivariant cohomology is introduced. Such potential displays a nontrivial vacuum solution which induces the breaking of the gauge symmetry without explicitly breaking the original fermionic scalar supersymmetry of topological Witten's action. The result is that not only massive vector bosons emerge, but also fermionic massive fields states appear. Such a result shows that the introduction of a topological phase in quantum field theory could provide a mechanism of mass generation for fermions together with Higgs bosons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05853v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop the diagrammatic technique of quiver subtraction to facilitate the identification and evaluation of the $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ hyper-K\"ahler quotient (HKQ) of the Coulomb branch of a $3d$ $\mathcal{N}=4$ unitary quiver theory. The target quivers are drawn from a wide range of theories, typically classified as ''good'' or ''ugly'', which satisfy identified selection criteria. Our subtraction procedure uses quotient quivers that are ''bad'', differing thereby from quiver subtractions based on Kraft-Procesi transitions. The procedure identifies one or more resultant quivers, the union of whose Coulomb branches corresponds to the desired HKQ. Examples include quivers whose Coulomb branches are moduli spaces of free fields, closures of nilpotent orbits of classical and exceptional type, and slices in the affine Grassmanian. We calculate the Hilbert Series and Highest Weight Generating functions for HKQ examples of low rank. For certain families of quivers, we are able to conjecture HWGs for arbitrary rank. We examine the commutation relations between quotient quiver subtraction and other diagrammatic techniques, such as Kraft-Procesi transitions, quiver folding, and discrete quotients.</description>

      <title>Remarks on effects of projective phase on eigenstate thermalization hypothesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11425v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The existence of $p$-form symmetry in $(d+1)$-dimensional quantum field is known to always lead to the breakdown of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) for certain $(d-p)$-dimensional operators other than symmetry operators under some assumptions. The assumptions include the mixing of symmetry sectors within a given energy shell, which is rather challenging to verify because it requires information on the eigenstates in the middle of the spectrum. We reconsider this assumption from the viewpoint of projective representations to avoid this difficulty. In the case of $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetries, we can circumvent the difficulty by considering $\mathbb{Z}_N\times\mathbb{Z}_N$-symmetric theories with nontrivial projective phases, and perturbing the Hamiltonian while preserving one of the $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetries of our interest. We also perform numerical analyses for $(1+1)$-dimensional spin chains and the $(2+1)$-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory.</description>

      <title>On the positivity of the hypergeometric Veneziano amplitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12207v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, an infinite family of one-parameter generalisations of the Veneziano amplitude were bootstrapped using as input assumptions an integer mass spectrum, crossing symmetry, high-energy boundedness, and exchange of finite spins. This new result was dubbed the hypergeometric Veneziano amplitude, with a real-valued deformation parameter r. For concreteness we work in a setup where the lowest-mass state is a tachyon of mass $m^2_0=-1$ and using the partial-wave decomposition and the positivity of said decomposition's coefficients we are able to bound the deformation parameter to $r \geq 0$ and, also, to obtain an upper bound on the number of spacetime dimensions $D \leq 26$, which is the critical dimension of bosonic string theory.</description>

      <title>Finiteness Theorems and Counting Conjectures for the Flux Landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09295v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the string theory landscape obtained from type IIB and F-theory flux compactifications. We first give a comprehensive introduction to a number of mathematical finiteness theorems, indicate how they have been obtained, and clarify their implications for the structure of the locus of flux vacua. Subsequently, in order to address finer details of the locus of flux vacua, we propose three mathematically precise conjectures on the expected number of connected components, geometric complexity, and dimensionality of the vacuum locus. With the recent breakthroughs on the tameness of Hodge theory, we believe that they are attainable to rigorous mathematical tools and can be successfully addressed in the near future. The remainder of the paper is concerned with more technical aspects of the finiteness theorems. In particular, we investigate their local implications and explain how infinite tails of disconnected vacua approaching the boundaries of the moduli space are forbidden. To make this precise, we present new results on asymptotic expansions of Hodge inner products near arbitrary boundaries of the complex structure moduli space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find that in 6d maximal supergravity there are 3-loop order amplitudes with non-vanishing soft-scalar limits and anomalous $E_{5(5)}$ duality, induced by a 3-loop UV divergence. If the relevant non-vanishing soft-scalar limits would be detected in 1-loop amplitudes, it would be a 1-loop precursor of a 3-loop UV divergence in 6d.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14630v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the case of the SYK model with non-gaussian disorder in the large $N$ limit. After obtaining the effective action, we derive the density of states and the free energy of the modified theory. We show that the non-gaussian disorder corresponds to a non-local Liouville theory, and non-minimally coupled 2D gravity action. It also provides a nice realization of Colemania - Coleman's idea from the 80s of generating a small Cosmological Constant. Finally, we also calculate out of time order correlation functions (OTOC) for the model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11484v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find new bilinear relations for the partition functions of U(N)_k x U(N+M)_{-k} ABJ theory with two parameter mass deformation (m_1,m_2), which generalize the q-Toda-like equation found previously for m_1=m_2. By combining the bilinear relations with the Seiberg-like dualities and the duality cascade relations, we can determine the exact values of the partition functions recursively with respect to N. This method is more efficient than the exact calculation by the standard TBA-like approach in the Fermi gas formalism. As an application we study the large N asymptotics of the partition function with the mass parameters in the supercritical regime where the large N expansion obtained for small mass parameters is invalid.</description>

      <title>An NS-NS basis for odd-parity couplings at order $\alpha'^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we thoroughly investigate the covariant and $B$-field gauge invariant odd-parity NS-NS couplings at order $\alpha'^3$, while considering the removal of field redefinitions, Bianchi identities, and total derivative freedoms. Our comprehensive analysis reveals the existence of 477 independent couplings. To establish a specific basis, we construct it in such a way that none of the couplings contain terms involving structures such as $R$, $R_{\mu\nu}$, $\nabla_\mu H^{\mu\alpha\beta}$, $\nabla_\mu\nabla^\mu\Phi$, or terms with more than two derivatives, except for one term that possesses three derivatives on $H$. Interestingly, the mentioned coupling with the four-derivative on the $B$-field is rendered zero by the sphere-level three-point S-matrix element.
  Furthermore, we demonstrate that the remaining 476 parameters in type II superstring theory are fixed to zero by imposing the requirement that the circular reduction of the couplings remains invariant under $O(1,1,\MZ)$ T-duality transformations. This result is consistent with our expectations and highlights the crucial role played by the $O(1,1,\MZ)$ symmetry in constraining the parameter space of the classical effective actions in string theory.</description>

      <title>Yukawa Couplings at Infinite Distance and Swampland Towers in Chiral Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study limits of vanishing Yukawa couplings of 4d chiral matter fields in Quantum Gravity, using as a laboratory type IIA orientifolds with D6-branes. In these theories chiral fermions arise at brane intersections, where an infinite tower of charged particles dubbed gonions are localised. We show that in the limit $Y\rightarrow 0$ some of these towers become asymptotically massless, while at the same time the kinetic term of some chiral fields becomes singular and at least two extra dimensions decompactify. For limits parametrised by a large complex structure saxion $u$, Yukawa couplings have a behaviour of the form $Y \, \sim \, {1}/{u^r}$, with $r$ some positive rational number. Moreover, in this limit some of the gauge couplings associated to the Yukawa vanish. The lightest gonion scales are of order $m_{\rm gon} \sim g^s M_{\rm P}$ with $s&gt;1$, verifying the magnetic WGC with room to spare and with no need of its tower/sublattice versions. We also show how this behaviour can be understood in the context of the emergence of kinetic terms in Quantum Gravity. All these results may be very relevant for phenomenology, given the fact that some of the Yukawa couplings in the Standard Model are very small.</description>

      <title>A differential representation for holographic correlators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a differential representation for holographic four-point correlators. In this representation, the correlators are given by acting differential operators on certain seed functions. The number of these functions is much smaller than what is normally seen in known examples of holographic correlators, and all of them have simple Mellin amplitudes. This representation establishes a direct connection between correlators in position space and their Mellin space counterpart. The existence of this representation also imposes non-trivial constraints on the structure of holographic correlators. We illustrate these ideas by correlators in ${\rm AdS}_5 \times {\rm S}^5$ and ${\rm AdS}_5 \times {\rm S}^3$.</description>

      <title>Bosonic near-CFT$_1$ models from Fock-space fluxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a family of near-CFT$_1$ models with a conserved U(1) charge, whose basic degrees of freedom are canonical bosons. The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model -- the first microscopic model that realizes the near-CFT$_1$ dynamics -- is based on random $p$-local interactions among fermions. However, a bosonic near-CFT$_1$ model has remained elusive in the $p$-local approach because such constructions generally suffer from unwanted orderings at low temperatures. Our construction is based on a recent insight that near-CFT$_1$ dynamics can quite generally arise if we place a large amount of random fluxes in a many-body Fock space and $p$-locality is not essential. All such models are essentially solved by chord diagrams regardless of the nature of the underlying degrees of freedom. We further argue that such bosonic models do not suffer from energetic instablities or unwanted low-temperature orderings. For comparison we also consider a second class of charge-conserving models which are based on qubits. The thermodynamic scalings of these models are very similar to those of the double-scaled complex SYK model but are free of certain singularities the latter suffers from. We also show the level statistics of both models are described by random matrix theory universality down to very low energies.</description>

Abstract: We present that by predicting the spectrum in discrete space from the phase shift in continuous space, the neural network can remarkably reproduce the numerical L\"uscher's formula to a high precision. The model-independent property of the L\"uscher's formula is naturally realized by the generalizability of the neural network. This exhibits the great potential of the neural network to extract model-independent relation between model-dependent quantities, and this data-driven approach could greatly facilitate the discovery of the physical principles underneath the intricate data.</description>

Abstract: Haag's theorem cries out for explanation and critical assessment: it sounds the alarm that something is (perhaps) not right in one of the standard way of constructing interacting fields to be used in generating predictions for scattering experiments. Viewpoints as to the precise nature of the problem, the appropriate solution, and subsequently-called-for developments in areas of physics, mathematics, and philosophy differ widely. In this paper, we develop and deploy a conceptual framework for critically assessing these disparate responses to Haag's theorem. Doing so reveals the driving force of more general questions as to the nature and purpose of foundational work in physics.</description>

      <title>Emus live on the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa archipelago</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.00034v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is expected that the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa (GNY) chiral Ising transition of $N$ Majorana (or $N_f=N/4$ four-component Dirac) fermions coupled with scalar field in (2+1)D will be the first fermionic quantum critical point that various methods such as conformal bootstrap [1], perturbative renormalization group [2] and quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations [3], would yield the converged critical exponents -- serving the same textbook role as the Ising and $O(N)$ models in the statistical and quantum phase transition. However, such expectation has not been fully realized from the lattice QMC simulations due to the obstacles introduced by the UV finite size effect. In this work, by means of the elective-momentum ultra-size (EMUS) QMC method [4], we compute the critical exponents of the GNY $N=8$ chiral Ising transition on a 2D $\pi$-flux fermion lattice model between Dirac semimetal and quantum spin Hall insulator phases [3, 5]. With the matching of fermionic and bosonic momentum transfer and collective update in momentum space, our QMC results provide the fully consistent exponents with those obtained from the bootstrap and perturbative approaches. In this way, the Emus now live happily on the $N=8$ island and could explore the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa archipelago [1] with ease.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.13716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a 2+1-D interacting Dirac semimetal with onsite flavor SU(2) symmetry. Topological considerations imply that the skyrmions in the flavor-symmetry-breaking phase carry electron quantum numbers, motivating a dual bosonized low energy description in terms of two complex scalars coupled to an abelian Chern-Simons field. We propose that the transition between a nearby Chern insulator and the flavor symmetry-broken phase is a bicritical point in the bosonized description, and also suggest that the Gross-Neveu-Heisenberg (GNH) transition between the Dirac semimetal and the flavor symmetry-broken phase is a tricritical point. Heuristically, the dual description corresponds to the gap closing of fermionic skyrmions. We discuss implications and potential issues with our proposal, and motivated from it, perform extensive unbiased Determinantal Quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) simulations on a lattice regularized Hamiltonian for the GNH transition, extending previously available results. We compare DQMC results with the estimates in the proposed dual from available perturbative renormalization group results. We also numerically demonstrate the presence of fermionic skyrmions in the symmetry-broken phase of our lattice model.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Implications of Kalb-Ramond-Like-Particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02485v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kalb-Ramond field is an antisymmetric, rank-two tensor field which most notably appears in the context of string theory, but has largely been unexplored in the context of cosmology. In this work, motivated by the Kalb-Ramond field in string theory, and antisymmetric tensor fields that emerge in effective field theories ranging from particle physics to condensed matter, we study the primordial production of interacting massive Kalb-Ramond-like-particles (KRLPs). KRLPs contain features of both dark photon and axion models, which can be appreciated via their duality properties. While the massless non-interacting KRLP is dual to a pseudoscalar, and the massive non-interacting KRLP is dual to a pseudovector, the interacting massive KRLP can be distinguished from its scalar and vector counterparts. We study early-universe production of KRLPs via the freeze-in mechanism, considering a `dark photon-like' interaction, an `axion-like' interaction, and a `Higgs portal' interaction, as well as production via cosmological gravitational particle production. We find that as a dark matter candidate, KRLPs can be produced by all of the above mechanisms and account for the relic density of dark matter today for a wide range of masses. Finally, we comment on the potential to obtain both warm and cold dark matter subcomponents, and speculate on observational and experimental prospects.</description>

      <title>Higher-group symmetry of (3+1)D fermionic $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory: logical CCZ, CS, and T gates from higher symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05674v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has recently been understood that the complete global symmetry of finite group topological gauge theories contains the structure of a higher-group. Here we study the higher-group structure in (3+1)D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory with an emergent fermion, and point out that pumping chiral $p+ip$ topological states gives rise to a $\mathbb{Z}_{8}$ 0-form symmetry with mixed gravitational anomaly. This ordinary symmetry mixes with the other higher symmetries to form a 3-group structure, which we examine in detail. We then show that in the context of stabilizer quantum codes, one can obtain logical CCZ and CS gates by placing the code on a discretization of $T^3$ (3-torus) and $T^2 \rtimes_{C_2} S^1$ (2-torus bundle over the circle) respectively, and pumping $p+ip$ states. Our considerations also imply the possibility of a logical $T$ gate by placing the code on $\mathbb{RP}^3$ and pumping a $p+ip$ topological state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Brownian motion of a point particle induced by quantum vacuum fluctuations of a massless real scalar field in Einstein's universe is studied. By assuming the small displacement condition, the dispersion in the momentum and position of a point particle coupled to the massless scalar field are obtained. As a consequence of the homogeneity and isotropy properties of the Einstein's Universe, we find that all components of these physical observables are identical. We also examine divergent behaviors associated to the physical momentum and position dispersions, which we attribute to the $R^1\times S^3$ compact topology of the spacetime. Finally, based on the small displacement condition assumed, we analyze the limit of validity of our investigation.</description>

      <title>Autonomous system analysis of the late-time cosmological solutions and their stability in $f(Q)$ gravity models</title>

Abstract: Cosmological dynamics are investigated in detail through systematic procedures by using the autonomous system analyses of gravitational field equations in $ f(Q) $ gravity. The explicit analyses of the late-time cosmic evolutions are demonstrated for fundamental three types of models under the presence of non-relativistic matter (i.e., dark matter and baryons) as well as radiation. The stability of cosmological solutions is also explored by examining non-hyperbolic critical points based on the center manifold theory. It is shown that the acceleration of the universe can be achieved with $ f(Q) $ gravity. Three different models were considered for the study and dynamical systems analysis technique is incorporated. The main finding of the present analyses is that cosmological solutions in $ f(Q) $ gravity can effectively fit observable datasets. This is depicted by phase space portraits and qualitative evolution of the cosmological models.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concept of {\it quantum ratio} emerged in the recent efforts to understand how Newton's equations appear for the center of mass (CM) of an isolated macroscopic body at finite body-temperatures, as the first approximation to quantum-mechanical equations. It is defined as $Q\equiv R_q/L_0$, where the quantum fluctuation range $R_q$ is the spatial extension of the pure-state CM wave function, whereas $L_0$ stands for the body's linear size (the space support of the internal, bound-state wave function). The two cases $R_q /L_0 \lesssim 1$ or $R_q/ L_0 \gg 1$, roughly correspond to the body's CM behaving classically or quantum mechanically, respectively. In the present note we elaborate more on this concept, illustrating it in several examples. An important notion following from introduction of the quantum ratio is that the elementary particles (thus the electron and the photon) are quantum mechanical, even when the environment-induced decoherence turns them into a mixed state. Decoherence and classical state should not be identified. This simple observation, further illustrated by the consideration of a few atomic or molecular processes, may have significant implications on the way quantum mechanics works in biological systems.</description>

      <title>Inconsistency of modified gravity in cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that there is a fundamental flaw in the application of modified gravity theories in cosmology, taking $f(R)$ gravity as a paradigmatic example. This theory contains a scalar degree of freedom that couples to the matter stress-energy tensor but not to gravitational energy. However, when applied to cosmology this theory is unable to distinguish between gravitational and non-gravitational energy. Hence the cosmological version of the theory does not coincide with its own macroscopic average, and we show that this leads to order-one discrepancies. We argue that the same inconsistency is common to many other modified gravity theories with extra degrees of freedom. Our results put into question whether these theories can make sense as the cosmological average of a fundamental theory, hence challenging their physical significance.</description>

      <title>The Primordial Black Hole Formation -- Null Geodesic Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide evidence for a correspondence between the formation of primordial black holes and the stability of circular null geodesics around the collapsing perturbation. We first show that the critical threshold of the compaction function to form a black hole in radiation is well approximated by the critical threshold for the appearance of the first unstable circular orbit. We also show that the critical exponent in the scaling law of the primordial black hole mass close to the threshold is set by the inverse of the Lyapunov coefficient of the unstable orbits when a self-similar stage is developed close to criticality.</description>

      <title>Deformation-induced CPT violation in entangled pairs of neutral kaons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider description of kaon -- anti-kaon interference in the context of a theory with deformed $\cal CPT$ symmetry. In the case of such theoretical models, deviations from the standard $\cal CPT$ invariance is related to the momentum carried by the particles; in particular the rest masses of particles and antiparticles are equal. We find that the decay intensity of kaon -- anti-kaon pair has three contributing terms: the correct-parity, the wrong-parity, and the interference between them, all of which are affected by deformation. Using the fact that the presence of such terms were not observed we estimate the magnitude of deformation parameter $\kappa \gtrsim 10^{18}$ GeV, very close to the expected Planck mass scale. This raises hopes that the effect, if exists, could be detected in a near future accelerator experiments. An uncertainty of the energy measurement is crucial for accuracy of these predictions.</description>
