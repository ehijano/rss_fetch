      <title>Exploring Pintopia: Reflection Branes, Bordisms, and U-Dualities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The U-dualities of maximally supersymmetric non-chiral supergravity (SUGRA) theories lead to strong constraints on the non-perturbative structure of quantum gravity. In this paper we determine Spin- and Pin-lifts of these dualities, which extend this action to fermionic degrees of freedom. Among other things, this allows us to access non-supersymmetric sectors of these low energy effective field theories in which bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom are treated differently. We use this refinement of the duality groups, in tandem with the Swampland Cobordism Conjecture, to predict new codimension-two branes. These are a natural generalization of the recently discovered R7-branes of type II string theories. The first bordism groups for Spin-twisted duality bundles follow directly from the Abelianization of the duality groups. Viewing the SUGRA theory as the low energy limit of a toroidal compactification of M-theory, winding around these codimension-two defects enacts a reflection around one of the torus directions, which in the effective field theory appears as a charge conjugation symmetry. We establish some basic properties of such branes, including determining BPS objects which can end on it, as well as braiding rules and bound states realized by multiple reflection branes.</description>

      <title>Towards a Heterotic Axiverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we initiate a broad study of some central properties of the string axiverse arising from Calabi-Yau compactifications of the perturbative heterotic $E_8\times E_8$ theory. Along this road toward a heterotic axiverse, we characterize the generic structure of the axion mass spectrum and the effective couplings of the non-QCD heterotic axions to Abelian and non-Abelian gauge fields and discuss their implications for cosmology, particle phenomenology, and the QCD axion quality problem. We also provide arguments that the heterotic axion masses are bounded from below much more strongly than, for example, the spectrum in type IIB compactifications.</description>

      <title>Disjoint additivity and local quantum physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum systems of physical interest are often local, but there are at least three competing perspectives on how "locality" should be formalized: an algebraic framework, a path-integral framework, and a lattice framework. One puzzle in this competition is that systems with higher-form symmetries, which are perfectly local from the path-integral and lattice perspectives, can violate the algebraic principle of "additivity". In this paper, we propose a resolution to this puzzle by introducing a weaker locality principle, "disjoint additivity", which together with Haag duality should always be satisfied in local quantum systems. As evidence, we give examples in which disjoint additivity is preserved when ordinary additivity is violated; we show that Haag duality and disjoint additivity are satisfied in rather general lattice systems with local symmetry constraints; we give examples of nonlocal theories in which either disjoint additivity or Haag duality is violated; and finally we give examples of systems with nonlocal symmetry constraints in which disjoint additivity is violated, but can be restored by passing to a local "SymTFT" system in one higher dimension.</description>

      <title>The Geodesics Less Traveled: Nonminimal RT Surfaces and Holographic Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The connected wedge theorem states that in order to have a scattering process in the bulk, it is necessary to have O(1/G) mutual information between certain "decision" regions in the boundary theory. While this large mutual information is not generally sufficient to imply scattering, Caminiti et al. (2024) showed that for a certain class of geometries, bulk scattering is implied by a certain relation between two (possibly non-minimal) Ryu-Takayanagi surfaces. Here, we show that the 2-to-2 version of the theorem becomes an equivalence in pure AdS3: large mutual information between appropriate boundary subregions is both necessary and sufficient for bulk scattering. This result allows us to extend the findings of Caminiti et al. (2024) to a broader class of asymptotically AdS3 spacetimes, which we illustrate with the spinning conical defect geometry. In contrast, we find that matter sources can disrupt this converse relation, and that the n-to-n version of the theorem with n&gt;2 lacks a converse even in the AdS3 vacuum.</description>

      <title>Fermion Parity Resolution of Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement is analyzed in the Majorana fermion conformal field theory (CFT) in the vacuum, in the fermion state, and in states built from conformal interfaces. In the boundary-state approach, Hilbert space admits two factorizations for a single interval, producing distinct entanglement spectra determined by spin structures. Although R\'enyi and relative entropiesare shown to be insensitive to these structures, symmetry-resolved entanglement naturally reveals their differences. The Majorana fermion's $\mathbb{Z}_2^F$ symmetry, generated by the fermion-parity operator $F$, distinguishes bosonic from fermionic sectors, motivating the notion of fermion-parity resolution. While $\mathbb{Z}_2^F$ is naturally a symmetry of the vacuum and fermion reduced density matrices, the Hilbert space factorization is shown to stabilize this symmetry in conformal interface states. When a Majorana zero mode is present, fermion-parity-resolved entropies display equipartition at all orders in the UV cutoff; in its absence, the breaking of equipartition is quantified by Ramond-sector data. This behavior persists across all states considered. Connections with symmetry-protected topological phases of matter are outlined. All results are compared with twist field computations.</description>

      <title>Purely GHZ-like entanglement is forbidden in holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that three-party entanglement signals in holography obey a relation that is not satisfied by generalized Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states. This is the first known constraint on the structure of pure three-party holographic states, and shows that time-symmetric holographic states can never have a purely GHZ structure. We also discuss similar relations for four parties.</description>

      <title>Loops Outside a Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general conjecture for evaluating multiple discontinuity integrals arising from bulk loop diagrams in the gravitational Schwinger-Keldysh geometry. This generalises earlier tree-level results in arXiv:2403.10654 to arbitrary bulk loops with no tadpoles (for scalar non-derivative interactions). The conjectured result takes the form of loop integrals performed in a real-time finite-temperature field theory living on the exterior of the black hole. We check our conjecture against all one-loop and many two and three-loop contributions to two, three, and four-point functions. Our diagrammatic rules for the exterior field theory are consistent with microscopic unitarity and thermality at arbitrary loop level. We also remark on a novel approach to real-time finite-temperature holography based on bulk Schwinger-Dyson equations, with the vertices integrated over the black hole exterior.</description>

      <title>Action principle for $\kappa$-Minkowski noncommutative $U(1)$ gauge theory from Lie-Poisson electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lie-Poisson electrodynamics describes a semi-classical approximation of noncommutative $U(1)$ gauge theories with Lie-algebra-type noncommutativities. We obtain a gauge-invariant local classical action with the correct commutative limit for a generic Lie-Poisson gauge model. At the semi-classical level, our results provide a relatively simple solution to the old problem of constructing an admissible Lagrangian formulation for the $U(1)$ gauge theory on the four-dimensional $\kappa$-Minkowski space-time. In particular, we derive an explicit expression for the classical action which yields the deformed Maxwell equations previously proposed in JHEP 11 (2023) 200 for this noncommutativity on general grounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider electric flux tube solutions in SU(3) gauge theory with scalar fields in the fundamental representation. Such solutions can possibly be constructed in two classes, corresponding to the two maximally commuting generators $\lambda_3$ and $\lambda_8$ of SU(3). We successfully construct the 3-type solution with two scalar fields and show that it is immune to decay through Schwinger pair production of gauge bosons but we have not been able to construct an 8-type solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we present a novel family of exact black hole solutions constructed in the context of five-dimensional Gauss-Bonnet gravity. These solutions add a non-linear charge to the Ba\~{n}ados-Teitelboim-Zanelli-like configurations known to exist with arbitrary Thurston horizon geometry. We establish constraints on the parameter space defining physically viable black holes, aligning with the standard energy conditions. An explicit proof of the first law of thermodynamics within our scenario is provided. We also employ holographic techniques to characterize the DC conductivities for the distinct horizon geometries, identifying a critical temperature indicative of phase transitions and exploring pertinent limits.</description>

      <title>Cap amplitudes in random matrix models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For general one-matrix models in the large $N$ limit, we introduce the cap amplitude $\psi(b)$ as the expansion coefficient of the 1-form $ydx$ on the spectral curve. We find that the dilaton equation for the discrete volume $N_{g,n}$ of the moduli space of genus-$g$ Riemann surfaces with $n$ boundaries is interpreted as gluing the cap amplitude along one of the boundaries. In this process, one of the boundaries is capped and the number of boundaries decreases by one. In a similar manner, the genus-$g$ free energy $F_g$ is obtained by gluing the cap amplitude to $N_{g,1}$.</description>

      <title>A Critical Point on the Hairy Black Hole Phase Boundary in the Improved Holographic Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the hairy black hole solutions and their dual phase diagram in the improved holographic Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) model.From the gravitational perspective, the rich phase structures observed in the dual boundary field theory originate from the intricate interplay between the scalar field formalism and the Maxwell field coupling mechanism. Two distinct types of hairy black hole solutions are found in this framework. Type-I hairy black holes are predominantly governed by scalar potential dynamics, whereas Type-II solutions emerge through nonminimal coupling to the $U(1)$ gauge field. We map out the phase distribution in the $(\mu_B,T)$ parameter plane and delineate the boundary separating these two hairy phases. The phase diagram exhibits a first-order phase transition line consistent with previous findings, accompanied by a subtle third-order phase transition line that terminates at a critical point positioned at the turning point of the entire phase boundary curve. Our results complement existing research on holographic EMD theory by offering a comprehensive characterization of phase distributions, transition boundaries, and their gravitational sector interpretations. These insights will enable more effective engineering of specific phase structures for simulating strongly coupled systems through targeted modifications to the EMD model.</description>

      <title>Page curves and island's delays in asymptotically flat 2d spacetimes with injections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore spacetimes with multiple energy injections in asymptotically flat two-dimensional black hole and analyze the entanglement entropy in such spacetimes. This work is an extension of the setup of the single-injection case, by F.~F.~Gautason, L.~Schneiderbauer, W.~Sybesma and L.~Thorlacius, to include the multiple energy injections. We derive the solution of the model, by J.~G.~Russo, L.~Susskind and L.~Thorlacius, for a general number $n$ of the total injections, and discuss the entropy only for the case $n=2$. The essential point of this work is in the delay of the island. This delay makes the intermediate state necessary, where the island's endpoint lies between the 1st and the 2nd injections while the observer is located after the 2nd injection. The intermediate state makes the entanglement entropy evolve continuously across the 2nd injection time.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Quadratic Quantum Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate minimal two-body Hamiltonians with random interactions that generate spectra resembling those of Gaussian random matrices, a phenomenon we term quadratic quantum chaos. Unlike integrable two-body fermionic systems, the corresponding hard-core boson models exhibit genuinely chaotic dynamics, closely paralleling the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model in its spin representation. This chaotic behavior is diagnosed through spectral statistics and measures of operator growth, including Krylov complexity and the late-time decay of higher-order out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs); the latter reveals the emergence of freeness in the sense of free probability. Moreover, the fractal dimension and Stabilizer Renyi entropy of a representative mid-spectrum eigenstate show finite-size deviations yet converge toward Haar-randomness as the system size increases. This convergence, constrained by local interactions, highlights the "weakly chaotic" character of these eigenstates. Owing to its simplicity and bosonic nature, these minimal models may constitute promising and resource-efficient candidates for probing quantum chaos and information scrambling on near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Timelike Entanglement Entropy in Higher Curvature Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates holographic timelike entanglement entropy in higher curvature gravity, with a particular focus on Lovelock theories and on the role of excited states. For strip subsystems, higher-curvature terms are found to affect the imaginary part of the entropy in a dimension-dependent manner, while excited states contribute solely to the real part. For the cases analyzed, spacelike and timelike entanglement entropies exhibit proportional relations: vacuum contributions differ by universal phase factors, while excitation contributions are linked by dimension-dependent rational coefficients. For hyperbolic subsystems, the timelike entanglement entropy computed via complex extremal surfaces is shown to agree with results obtained through analytic continuation, with imaginary contributions appearing in all dimensions. Higher-curvature corrections are explicitly calculated in five- and $(d+1)$-dimensional Gauss-Bonnet gravity, illustrating the applicability of the complex surface prescription to general Lovelock corrections. These results provide a controlled setting to examine the influence of higher-curvature interactions on holographic timelike entanglement entropy, and clarify its relation to vacuum and excited-state contributions.</description>

      <title>Simple harmonic oscillators from non-semisimple walled Brauer algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Walled Brauer algebras $B_N ( m , n ) $ illuminate the combinatorics of mixed tensor representations of $U(N)$, with $m$ copies of the fundamental and $n$ copies of the anti-fundamental representation. They lie at the intersection of research in representation theory, AdS/CFT and quantum information theory. They have been used to study of correlators in multi-matrix models motivated by brane-anti-brane physics in AdS/CFT. They have been applied in computing and optimising fidelities of port-based quantum teleportation. There is a large $N$ regime, specifically $ N \ge (m+n)$ where the algebras are semi-simple and their representation theory more tractable. There are known combinatorial formulae for dimensions of irreducible representations and associated reduction multiplicities. The large $N$ regime has a stability property whereby these formulae are independent of $N$. In this paper we initiate a systematic study of the combinatorics in the non-semisimple regime of $ N = m +n - l $, with positive $l$. We introduce restricted Bratteli diagrams (RBD) which are useful as an instrument to process known data from the large $N$ regime to calculate representation theory data in the non-semisimple regime. We identify within the non-semisimple regime, a region of $(m,n)$-stability, where $ \min ( m, n ) \ge ( 2l -3) $ and the RBD take a stable form depending on $l$ only and not the choice of $ m,n$ within the region. In this regime, several aspects of the combinatorics of the RBD are controlled by a universal partition function for an infinite tower of simple harmonic oscillators closely related, but not identical, to the partition function of 2D non-chiral free scalar field theory.</description>

      <title>Integrability and lattice discretizations of all Topological Defect Lines in minimal CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss in this paper the lattice discretizations of all topological defect lines (TDLs) for diagonal, minimal CFTs, using integrable restricted solid-on-solid (RSOS) models. For these CFTs, the TDLs can be labeled by the Kac labels. In the case of $(1,s)$ TDLs, lines that are exactly topological on the lattice can be obtained using the centralizer of the underlying Temperley-Lieb algebra, all the other lines become topological in the continuum limit only. Our general construction relies on insertions of rows/columns of faces with modified spectral parameters, and can therefore be studied using integrability techniques. We determine the regions of spectral parameters realizing the different $(r,s)$ TDLs, and in particular calculate analytically all the associated eigenvalues (and degeneracy factors). We also show how fusion of TDLs can be obtained from fusion hierarchies in the algebraic approach to the Bethe-ansatz. All our results are checked numerically in detail for several minimal CFTs.</description>

      <title>Boundary reflection matrices of massive $\phi_{1,3}$-perturbed unitary minimal models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose explicit expressions for the boundary reflection matrices of the ${\cal A}_m+(r,s)$ series of massive scattering theories, obtained by perturbing the ${\cal A}_m$ unitary minimal models with $(r,s)$ boundary conditions with both bulk and boundary $\phi_{1,3}$ operators. We identify the vacua that live on the boundary with the allowed edges of the $(r,s)$ conformal boundary conditions of the $A_m$ Andrews-Baxter-Forrester model. The boundary reflection matrices are then ``direct sums'' of certain pairs of $A_{m-1}$ Behrend-Pearce solutions of the boundary Yang-Baxter equation and are consistent with the boundary bootstrap and the recently-introduced crossing, as well as the $Z_{2}$ (height-reversal), Kac table and non-invertible symmetries.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate radiation from near-extremal black holes formed by collapse, focusing on the role of large backreaction effects arising from gravitational fluctuations in the near-horizon region. Such effects have previously been identified from computations based on JT gravity and its Schwarzian description, most notably for the Euclidean partition function. Restricting attention to the s-wave sector, we integrate out gravity by solving the constraint equations in the Hamiltonian formalism, obtaining an effective scalar action with a coupling that grows at low temperature, thus enabling a real-time treatment of quantum backreaction. We then take initial steps toward evaluating the impact of this interaction on correlations of the outgoing radiation, and compare our findings with earlier results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate elliptical Wilson loops in ${\cal N}=4$ Super Yang--Mills theory at weak and strong coupling for small values of the eccentricity. We obtain analytical results for the vacuum expectation value of the Wilson loop in the form of a series in the eccentricity parameter. At weak coupling, we use perturbation theory in ${\cal N}=4$ Super Yang--Mills. At strong coupling, we use the AdS/CFT correspondence, which maps the Wilson loop to the minimal-area worldsheet of an open string in AdS space. We present a novel perturbative method to solve the Nambu--Goto equations allowing us to describe the minimal surface in terms of a coordinate parameterization in Euclidean AdS$_3$. Our results for the regularized area agree with those obtained by Dekel in [1] based on the Polyakov action.</description>

      <title>Quantum carrollian bosonic strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a recently discovered carrollian bosonic string, described classically by a sigma model where both the worldsheet and the target spacetime are carrollian. After fixing the carrollian analogue of the conformal gauge, we determine the Lie algebra of residual gauge symmetries and show it is isomorphic to the three-dimensional extended BMS algebra. We quantise the sigma model \`a la BRST and determine the spectrum of the corresponding string theory by computing the BRST cohomology. In contrast with the usual bosonic string, the spectrum of the carrollian string is finite-dimensional. The cohomology displays Poincar\'e duality and can be interpreted, for a given momentum, as inducing representations for unitary irreducible representations of the 26-dimensional Carroll group. Furthermore we interpret (most of) the cohomology as deformations of the spacetime carrollian structure augmented by the Kalb--Ramond field to which the carrollian string couples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heavy particle effective theory applied to spinning black holes provides a natural framework in which propagators linearize and numerators exponentiate. In this work, we exploit these two features to introduce Kerr generating functions, which describe the scattering of any probe on a Kerr black hole background to all loop orders. These generating functions can be used to perform the tensor reduction of multi-loop integrands simply by differentiation with respect to the spin. As a first application of the Kerr generating functions, we study a neutron star in a Kerr black hole background. We organize the integrand by the helicity configuration of the exchanged gravitons and provide compact all-loop-order results for several helicity sectors and a full four-loop $\mathcal{O}(G^5)$ result.</description>

      <title>Testing Seesaw and Leptogenesis via Gravitational Waves: Majorana versus Dirac</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the B-L gauge extension of the Standard Model that the Dirac seesaw mechanism with thermal Leptogenesis can be tested using the stochastic gravitational background (SGWB) emanating from a network of cosmic strings when B-L symmetry is broken. With right-handed neutrino mass lighter than the typical scale of grand unification, the B-L symmetry protecting the right-handed neutrinos leads to constraints on the Yukawa couplings for both Dirac and Majorana scenarios. Estimating the predicted gravitational wave background we find that future space-borne missions could probe the range concerning thermal Dirac Leptogenesis. In a comparative analysis between such probes of gravitational wave sourced from cosmic strings in Dirac and Majorana Leptogenesis in the B-L extension, based on the energy scales of the Leptogenesis, for instance, GW detectors will be able to probe the scale of Dirac Leptogenesis upto $ 10^{9}$ GeV, while for Majorana Leptogenesis it would be upto $ 10^{12}$ GeV.</description>

      <title>On-shell Matrix Elements of the EMT Trace in Gauge Theories and Heavy Quark Masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel diagrammatic proof of the identity between the forward matrix element of the energy-momentum-tensor (EMT) trace operator over a single particle's on-shell state and its perturbative pole mass to any loop orders in perturbative gauge theories (with gauge bosons and fermions), without appealing to any pre-laid operator renormalization conditions or Ward identities. The proof is based on the equation of mass-dimensional analysis in dimensional regularization, the topological properties of contributing Feynman diagrams and the on-shell renormalization condition. Considering for definiteness perturbative QED and QCD with at most one fermion kept massive, we have verified the aforementioned identity, up to three loops, for all elementary particles through direct computation of dimensionally-regularized matrix elements of the relevant bare operators. We observe interestingly that the trace-anomaly contribution seemingly contains all leading-renormalon effects (explicitly verified up to three loops), and we propose accordingly a new scheme- and scale-independent trace-anomaly-subtracted mass definition for heavy $t$-,$\,b$-,$\,c$-quarks and electrons. A list of amusing numbers is subsequently presented for the composition of their perturbative pole masses.</description>

      <title>Unveiling horizons in quantum critical collapse</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Critical gravitational collapse offers a unique window into regimes of arbitrarily high curvature, culminating in a naked singularity arising from smooth initial data -- thus providing a dynamical counterexample to weak cosmic censorship. Near the critical regime, quantum effects from the collapsing matter are expected to intervene before full quantum gravity resolves the singularity. Despite its fundamental significance, a self-consistent treatment has so far remained elusive. In this work, we perform a one-loop semiclassical analysis using the robust anomaly-based method in the canonical setup of Einstein gravity minimally coupled to a free, massless scalar field. Focusing on explicitly solvable critical solutions in both 2+1 and 3+1 dimensions, we analytically solve the semiclassical Einstein equations and provide definitive answers to several long-standing questions. We find that regularity uniquely selects a Boulware-like quantum state, encoding genuine vacuum polarization effects from the collapsing matter. Remarkably, the resulting quantum corrections manifest as a growing mode. Horizon-tracing analyses, incorporating both classical and quantum modes, reveal the emergence of a finite mass gap, signaling a phase transition from classical Type II to quantum-modified Type I behavior, thereby providing a quantum enforcement of the weak cosmic censorship. The most nontrivial aspect of our analysis involves dealing with non-conformal matter fields in explicitly time-dependent critical spacetimes. Along the way, we uncover intriguing and previously underexplored features of quantum field theory in curved spacetime.</description>

      <title>Quantum Critical Collapse Abhors a Naked Singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical critical collapse yields naked singularities from smooth initial data, challenging cosmic censorship and shaping the spectrum of primordial black holes. We show that one-loop vacuum polarization near the threshold alters this outcome. In analytically tractable Einstein-scalar critical spacetimes, regularity uniquely selects a Boulware-like state whose stress tensor supplies a universal quantum growing mode. Its backreaction competes with the classical unstable mode, producing a shift of the critical point and a finite mass gap at the new threshold, thereby enforcing horizon formation even under arbitrary fine-tuning. In primordial collapse, the threshold shift enters exponentially into the formation fraction, while the gap truncates the low-mass tail -- effects that may reshape the predicted mass spectrum. These results provide the first consistent quantum treatment of critical collapse, offering definitive predictions for several long-standing problems.</description>

      <title>Tracing the Neutrino-Induced Phase Shift in the 21-cm Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the phase shift that free-streaming neutrinos imprint on the 21-cm power spectrum during cosmic dawn, computing for the first time its effect on both density- and velocity-induced acoustic oscillations. Neutrinos are known to generate a characteristic phase shift in the acoustic oscillations of the photon-baryon plasma before recombination, a signature already detected in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) as well as the spectrum of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs) extracted from galaxy surveys. We show that in the 21-cm signal this phase shift is distinct from that observed in the CMB and BAO spectra, exhibiting a characteristic mode and redshift dependence arising from the additional contribution of the so-called velocity acoustic oscillations (VAOs), sourced by the baryon-dark matter relative velocities. Our results establish the phase of acoustic oscillations in the 21-cm spectrum as a promising new avenue for probing free-streaming light relics at cosmic dawn, complementary to existing CMB and BAO measurements.</description>

      <title>Perturbations of Plane Waves and Quadratic Quasinormal Modes on the Lightring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study second order gravitational perturbations on plane wave spacetimes from both the metric and curvature perturbation points of view. For the former, we explicitly use the isometries of the background to introduce tensor oscillator harmonics, which render Einstein's equations algebraic around symmetric plane waves. For the latter, we formulate the first and second order Teukolsky equations in a Geroch-Held-Penrose covariant way. Both approaches are useful in their own right, and together with our discussion on gauge freedom, they provide a foundation for the study of higher-order gravitational dynamics around plane wave spacetimes. Taking the perspective that these plane wave spacetimes arise from Penrose limits, we subsequently use these results to explore the nonlinear gravitational dynamics close to black hole lightrings. Specifically, we define and discuss quadratic quasinormal mode ratios, observe that they satisfy emergent selection rules, and make publicly available a code to compute them.</description>

      <title>From CREX to CEvNS: The Weak Radius of 40Ar</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite significant theoretical efforts, the CREX-PREX dilemma remains unresolved, preventing the reliable prediction of neutron (or weak-charge) radii that, besides their intrinsic nuclear-structure interest, often serve to quantify the impact of nuclear uncertainties in searches for new physics. Coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering is a clean and attractive portal to new physics whose sensitivity may be impacted by such nuclear uncertainties. In this paper we use CREX as our main anchor, together with a strong calcium-argon correlation, to provide a robust baseline for the weak radius of ${}^{40}$Ar: $R_{\rm wk}^{\,40} = 3.452 \pm 0.028~\text{(stat)} \pm 0.022~\text{(syst)}\,\text{fm}$.The weak radius of argon is an observable highly relevant to ongoing and future liquid-argon campaigns that encodes the loss of coherence at small momentum transfers.</description>

Abstract: In physics geometrical connections are the mean to create models with local symmetries (gauge connections), as well as general diffeomorphisms invariance (affine connections). Here we study the irreducible tensor decomposition of connections on the tangent bundle of an affine manifold as used in the polynomial affine model of gravity. This connection is the most general linear connection, which allows us to build metric independent, diffeomorphism invariant models. This set up includes parts of the connection that are associated with conformal and projective transformations.</description>

      <title>Stability analysis of two-fluid neutron stars featuring twin star and ultradense configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a detailed analysis of radial oscillations to discuss dynamical stability in two-fluid neutron stars composed of ordinary nuclear matter and a gravitationally coupled dark matter component. Using a fully relativistic two-fluid formalism, we solve the eigenvalue problem for a coupled system of equations with small-amplitude radial perturbations and derive the critical line corresponding to stability boundaries. We also compare these stability boundary lines obtained from the radial perturbations with those obtained from a generalized turning-point criterion based on extremization of mass and particle numbers, and find that the two methods agree to within better than $1\%$ across the parameter space explored. We consider both mirror dark matter and self-interacting fermionic dark matter models, and examine how microphysical properties$-$such as nuclear equations of state, dark matter mass, and vector coupling strength$-$reshape the topology of the stability boundary and gravitational mass contours. Our results reveal the emergence of ultra-dense and compact stars, with nuclear central densities exceeding single-fluid instability thresholds by factors of two or more, and the appearance of twin-star configurations with identical masses but distinct radii and internal fluid compositions. These findings have direct implications for the interpretation of neutron star observables and motivate future studies involving phase transitions, density discontinuities, or additional interactions in multi-component stellar systems. In particular, the emergence of exotic stable configurations beyond conventional stability limits underscores the need to reassess standard criteria in light of multi-fluid dynamics, with significant consequences for multimessenger probes of dense matter$-$including gravitational wave signals, mass-radius constraints, and post-merger remnants.</description>

      <title>Trace anomaly contributions to semi-classical wormhole geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate wormhole solutions within the framework of the semi-classical Einstein equations in the presence of the conformal anomaly (or trace anomaly). These solutions are sourced by a stress-energy tensor (SET) derived from the trace anomaly, and depend on two positive coefficients, $\alpha$ and $\lambda$, determined by the matter content of the theory and on the degrees of freedom of the involved quantum fields. For a Type B anomaly ($\alpha=0$), we obtain wormhole geometries assuming a constant redshift function and show that the SET components increase with the parameter $\lambda$. In the case of a Type A anomaly ($\lambda=0$), we generalize previously known solutions, yielding a family of geometries that includes Lorentzian wormholes, naked singularities, and the Schwarzschild black hole. Using isotropic coordinates, we identify parameter choices that produce traversable wormhole solutions. Extending to the full trace-anomaly contribution, we solve the differential equation near the throat to obtain the redshift function and demonstrate that both the Ricci and Kretschmann scalars remain finite at the throat. We further analyze the trajectories of null and timelike particles, showing that the height and width of the effective potential for null geodesics increase monotonically with $\alpha$, while the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) radius also grows with larger $\alpha$. These results illustrate the rich interplay between trace anomaly effects and the structure and dynamics of wormhole spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Topological charge and black hole photon spheres in massive gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the existence and nature of the photon spheres (PS) in the background of four dimensional static and spherically symmetric black holes in the de Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley (dRGT) massive gravity theory. Apart from the known case of one PS, there are regions in the parameter space of massive gravity where either two or no PS's exist outside the event horizon. Topological arguments show that, the case of one PS falls in the category of Einstein gravity (with topological charge $-1$), whereas, the cases with two or zero PS's belong to a different topological class with total charge zero. PS's of horizonless compact objects, also belong to the same class with total topological charge $0$, though, one distinction can be made with the black holes in massive gravity. While in the former case, the inner PS is stable, in the later case, it is the outer PS which is stable (the inner PS is unstable). We also study the landscape of possible regions of existence of standard and exotic photon spheres in the massive gravity parameter space, and correlate it with the horizon structure of the black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct the most general form of our previously proposed nonlinear extension of quantum mechanics that possesses three basic properties. Unlike the simpler model, the new version is not completely integrable, but it has an underlying Hamiltonian structure. We analyze a particular solution in detail, and we use a natural extension of the Born rule to compute particle trajectories. We find that closed particle orbits are possible.</description>

      <title>Nonrelativistic meson masses from the Curci-Ferrari model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the mass spectrum of nonrelativistic mesons composed of charm and bottom quarks within the framework of the Curci-Ferrari model in the Landau gauge, focusing on the influence of the gluon mass on our results. We derive the Hamiltonian from the scattering amplitude of a single massive gluon exchange. By incorporating a confining Cornell potential we solve the Schr\"odinger equation for the dominant terms of the Hamiltonian, which include the kinetic energy and a Yukawa-type potential. Corrections to the energy are then introduced perturbatively. By studying the parameter space of the model we fit the experimental mass spectrum of charmonium, bottomonium and charm-bottom mesons. From the five parameters of our approach, we allow the gluon mass and the gauge coupling to run with the energy scale according to the ultraviolet one-loop renormalization flows, computed in [1]. Our results show very good agreement with the data, suggesting that a nonvanishing gluon mass provides a better description of the spectrum of heavy mesons than the massless case.</description>

      <title>Chiral Graviton Theory of Fractional Quantum Hall States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent polarized Raman scattering experiments indicate that fractional quantum Hall systems host a chiral spin-2 neutral collective mode, the long-wavelength limit of the magnetoroton, which behaves as a condensed-matter graviton. We present a nonlinear, gauge-invariant effective theory by gauging area-preserving diffeomorphisms (APDs) with a unimodular spatial metric as the gauge field. A Stueckelberg construction introduces an APD-invariant local potential that aligns the dynamical metric with a reference geometry, opening a tunable gap while preserving gauge redundancy. Together with a geometric Maxwell kinetic sector and the Wen-Zee and gravitational Chern-Simons terms, the theory yields a gapped chiral spin-2 excitation consistent with universal long-wavelength constraints. The tunable gap emerges naturally from symmetry and provides a route to an isotropic-nematic quantum critical point where the spin-2 mode softens. We further establish a linear dictionary to quadrupolar deformations in composite Fermi liquid bosonization, and outline applications to fractional Chern insulators as well as higher-dimensional generalizations. Finally, the approach can be extended to non-Abelian fractional quantum Hall states, capturing both spin-2 and spin-3/2 neutral modes.</description>

Abstract: We perform (2{+}1)-D simulations of viscous anisotropic hydrodynamics (VAH) under boost-invariant and conformal conditions. Comparing both VAH and traditional viscous hydrodynamics with kinetic theory in the relaxation-time approximation as the underlying microscopic theory, we show that VAH provides a superior description of the evolution across a wide range of opacity, effectively extending the boundaries of the applicability of hydrodynamic modeling. Our results demonstrate VAH's potential for describing collective flow in small systems where traditional hydrodynamics faces challenges.</description>

      <title>Zero modes and index theorems for non-Hermitian Dirac fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dirac fermions, subject to external magnetic fields and in the presence of mass orders that assume topologically nontrivial spatial textures such as domain-wall and vortices, for example, bind robust mid-gap states at zero-energy, the number of which is governed by the Aharonov-Casher and Jackiw-Rebbi or Jackiw-Rossi index theorems, respectively. Here I extend the jurisdiction of these prominent index theorems to Lorentz invariant non-Hermitian (NH) Dirac operators, constructed by augmenting the celebrated Dirac Hamiltonian by a masslike anti-Hermitian operator that also scales linearly with momentum. The resulting NH Dirac operator manifests real eigenvalues over an extended NH parameter regime, characterized by a real effective Fermi velocity for NH Dirac fermions. From the explicit solutions of the zero-energy bound states, I show that in the presence of external magnetic fields of arbitrary shape such modes always exist when the system encloses a finite number of magnetic flux quanta, while in the presence of spatially non-trivial textures of the mass orders localized zero-energy modes can only be found in the spectrum when the effective Fermi velocity for NH Dirac fermions is real. These findings pave a concrete route to realize nucleation of competing orders from the topologically robust zero-energy manifold in NH or open Dirac systems. Possible experimental setups to test these predictions are discussed.</description>

Abstract: We derive one-point functions in 4d $\mathcal N=4$ SYM with $\tfrac{1}{2}$-BPS boundaries, defects and interfaces which host large numbers of defect degrees of freedom. The theories are engineered by Gaiotto-Witten D3/D5/NS5 brane setups with large numbers of D5 and NS5 branes, and have holographic duals with fully backreacted 5-branes. They include BCFTs with 3d SCFTs on the boundary which allow for the notion of double holography, as well as D3/D5 defects and interfaces with large numbers of D5-branes. Through a combination of supersymmetric localization and holography we derive one-point functions for 4d chiral primary operators.</description>

We further match them with the corresponding predictions from the matrix model descriptions.

      <title>Deciphering Coupled Scalar Dark Sectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coupled dark sector models have gained significant attention, motivated by recent advances in cosmology and the pressing need to address unresolved puzzles. In this work, we study coupled scalar dark sector models inspired by ultraviolet-complete frameworks such as supergravity and string theory. These models involve scalar couplings arising either from their kinetic terms, through a non-trivial field space metric, or from their scalar potential. We demonstrate how these couplings can be elegantly formulated in terms of an interacting vector, a standard tool in coupled dark sector studies, and analyse their distinct cosmological effects using a dynamical systems approach. Using this framework, we further investigate an axio-dilaton system recently explored in the literature, where the dilaton also couples to baryons. Intriguingly, we show that certain kinetic and potential interactions may mimic one another or even cancel out, making them observationally indistinguishable. If such a distinction becomes possible through observational constraints, it could provide valuable insights into the underlying field space metric and its connection to fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Observables and Unconstrained Spin Tensor Dynamics in General Relativity from Scattering Amplitudes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a previous Letter, we showed that physical scattering observables for compact spinning objects in general relativity can depend on additional degrees of freedom in the spin tensor beyond those described by the spin vector alone. In this paper, we provide further details on the physics of these additional degrees of freedom, whose commutation relations and Poisson brackets are inherited from the underlying Lorentz symmetry, and on their consequence on observables. In particular, we give the waveform at leading order in Newton's constant and up to second order in the components of the spin tensor, and the conservative impulse, boost and spin kick, exhibiting spin magnitude change, through next-to-leading-order in Newton's constant and third order in the components of the spin tensor. We provide explicit examples -- a Newtonian two-particle bound system and a certain black-hole solution in an exotic matter-coupled gravitational theory -- that exhibit these degrees of freedom and are described by our four-dimensional and worldline field theories. We also discuss connections between these degrees of freedom and dynamical worldline multipole moments. We construct effective two-body Hamiltonians, we demonstrate explicitly that the extra degrees of freedom beyond the spin vector are necessary to describe the complete dynamics, and we explicitly remove certain unphysical singularities. Moreover, we show that the previously proposed eikonal (or radial action) formula correctly captures observables derived from the classical Hamiltonian. Finally, we comment on possible descriptions of the additional degrees of freedom from the perspective of Goldstone's theorem.</description>

      <title>Equivalence Theorems and Double-Copy Structure in Scattering Amplitudes of Massive Kaluza-Klein States with Matter Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05199v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the scattering amplitudes of massive Kaluza-Klein (KK) states in compactified five-dimensional warped gauge and gravity theories. Focusing on tree-level $2\to2$ processes, we analyze the leading-order amplitudes involving bulk KK matter fields and KK gauge/gravitational Goldstone bosons. By imposing the gauge theory equivalence theorem (GAET) and the gravitational equivalence theorem (GRET) within warped KK theories, we systematically reconstruct the leading-order amplitudes for physical KK gauge bosons and gravitons, thereby circumventing the intricate energy cancellations inherent in physical amplitudes. Within this framework, the correspondence between GAET and GRET arises as a direct manifestation of the leading-order double-copy relation in the high-energy expansion. This connection provides a foundation for extending the BCJ double-copy construction to four-point amplitudes involving bulk KK matter fields, and further generalizes to arbitrary $N$-point cases, enabling a systematic derivation of the corresponding gravitational amplitudes with consistent incorporation of KK matter fields at leading order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03664v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intersecting D6-brane models without discrete torsion typically suffer from unstabilized open string moduli, arising from D-brane positions and Wilson lines. These moduli generate additional massless adjoint fields, obstructing the realization of negative beta functions necessary for asymptotic freedom unless they are decoupled around string scale. A viable solution involves utilizing rigid cycles, which eliminate these unwanted adjoint fields. In this work, we for the first time present a class of consistent three-family supersymmetric Pati-Salam models from rigid intersecting D6-branes on the factorizable $\mathbb{T}^6/(\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2^\prime)$ orientifold with discrete torsion. These models satisfy all the known consistency conditions, including $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetry, K-theory constraints, tadpole cancellation, and recent swampland bounds on the maximal gauge group rank. We provide detailed particle spectra, analyze their phenomenological implications, and discuss the decoupling of exotic states through strong dynamics in the hidden sector.</description>

Abstract: The relation between covariant fracton gauge theory and Moller-Hayashi-Shirafuji extension of teleparallel gravity is investigated. The former is the gauge theory of a rank-two symmetric tensor with gauge symmetry given by the double derivative of a scalar parameter; the latter is the most general theory, whose action is quadratic in the Weitzenb\"ock torsion. We show that the solutions of covariant fracton gauge theory describe a subsector of the space of solutions of Moller-Hayashi-Shirafuji theory, providing a new insight in the relation between covariant fractons and gravity, and elucidating the meaning of covariant fracton theory as a new type of gauge theory.</description>

      <title>Dyons in higher-dimensional gauge theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the 't Hooft-Polyakov (TP) monopole and then dyon in the framework of higher dimensional gauge theories, such as gauge-Higgs unification models. First, we point out that the Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) monopole is nothing but a self-dual gauge field in the 4-dimensional (4D) space including the extra dimension, which is argued to lead to a consequence that the mass of the BPS monopole $M_{{\rm TPM}}$ and therefore the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the Higgs field are topologically quantized. In literatures, there exist related arguments on the calorons, which may be understood to be a composition of a pair of constituent monopole and anti-monopole, with each constituent carrying fractional topological charge, while the net topological charge carried by the caloron is unity. From the viewpoint of the caloron, our conclusion of the quantized monopole mass corresponds to the special case, where only a single monopole exists that carries the net topological charge. Next, the argument is generalized to the case of dyon. The mass of the BPS dyon, $M_{{\rm BPS}}$, is still proportional to the quantized Higgs VEV, though it also depends on a parameter $\mu$, denoting the ratio of the electric and magnetic charges of the dyon. In the 5D gauge theories the Chern-Simons term is induced at the quantum level, which, after the extra space component of the gauge field is replaced by its VEV, produces the $\theta$ term. Then, through the Witten effect we reach to an interesting conclusion that the parameter $\mu$ and therefore $M_{{\rm BPS}}$ are discretized. In addition, we propose a numerical method to obtain the field configurations and the mass of the non-BPS dyons by use of ``modified" gradient flow equations.</description>

      <title>Building the Holographic Dictionary of the DSSYK from Chords, Complexity &amp; Wormholes with Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22716v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we formulate the holographic dictionary for the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) model with matter operators. Based on the two-sided Hartle-Hawking (HH) state, we derive several properties of the DSSYK model, without making assumptions about the specific dual theory, including its semiclassical thermodynamics, correlation functions, and Krylov complexity. We derive these quantities from the saddle points of the DSSYK path integral preparing the HH state. We also construct a Lanczos algorithm that simultaneously evaluates Krylov state and operator complexity in the two-sided Hamiltonian system including finite temperature effects. In the semiclassical limit, both measures are encoded in the saddle points of the path integral. They have a bulk interpretation in terms of minimal geodesic lengths in an effective AdS$_2$ space with matter backreaction. Different saddle points correspond to geodesic distances with different evolution, and they display different scrambling properties. We also discuss about the quantization of the bulk theory dual to the DSSYK model. At last, we formulate the double-scaled algebra in bulk terms, and the dual entry of the proper radial momentum of a bulk probe.</description>

      <title>Can Non-Relativistic Strings Propagate Without Geometric Baggage?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12506v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a minimal and dynamically consistent formulation of non-relativistic bosonic string theory in a Newton-Cartan (NC) background. Starting from a reparametrization-invariant Nambu-Goto action, we develop the Hamiltonian framework and perform a complete Dirac constraint analysis. The resulting structure exhibits first-class constraints that generate worldsheet diffeomorphisms, confirming the internal gauge consistency of the model. Using an interpolating Lagrangian, we derive a Polyakov-type action that enables a direct comparison with symmetry-based constructions known as gauging the algebra (GTA) approaches, which promote non-relativistic symmetry algebras to local symmetries. In contrast to GTA formulations, which require additional background fields to achieve algebraic closure, our model derives all necessary geometric data dynamically from the string evolution itself. This establishes that standard Newton-Cartan geometry is sufficient to support consistent non-relativistic string dynamics. Our results provide a conceptually transparent and technically robust foundation for future studies of non-relativistic string theory in curved backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Explicit construction of states in orbifolds of products of $N=2$ Superconformal ADE Minimal models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21992v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize the explicit construction of fields in orbifolds of products of $N=(2,2)$ minimal models, developed by A. Belavin, V. Belavin and S. Parkhomenko to include minimal models with D and E-type modular invariants. It is shown that spectral flow twisting by the elements of admissible group $G_{\text{adm}}$, which is used in the construction of the orbifold, is consistent with the nondiagonal pairing of D and E-type minimal models. We obtain the complete set of fields of the orbifold from the mutual locality and other requirements of the conformal bootstrap. The collection of mutually local primary fields is labeled by the elements of dual group $G^{*}_{\text{adm}}$. The permutation of $G_{\text{adm}}$ and $G^*_{\text{adm}}$ is given by the mirror spectral flow construction of the fields and maps the space of states of the original $G_{\text{adm}}$ orbifold onto the space of states of $G^*_{\text{adm}}$ orbifold. We show that this transformation is by construction a mirror isomorphism of spaces of states. Thus, mirror isomorphism of states is built into the construction. We illustrate our approach for the orbifolds of $\textbf{A}_{2}\textbf{E}_7^{3}$ model.</description>

      <title>$2$-split from Feynman diagrams and Expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the $2$-split behavior of tree-level amplitudes of bi-adjoint scalar (BAS), Yang-Mills (YM), non-linear sigma model (NLSM), and general relativity (GR) theories under certain kinematic conditions. Our approach begins with a proof, based on the Feynman diagram method, of the $2$-split property for tree-level BAS$\oplus$X amplitudes with $\mathrm{X}={\mathrm{YM},\mathrm{NLSM},\mathrm{GR}}$. The proof relies crucially on a particular pattern in the Feynmam rules of various vertices. Building on this, we use the expansion of X amplitudes into BAS$\oplus$X amplitudes to establish the $2$-split behavior. As a byproduct, we derive universal expansions of the resulting pure X currents into BAS currents, which closely parallel the corresponding on-shell amplitude expansions.</description>

      <title>Quantum-group-invariant $D^{(2)}_{n+1}$ models: Bethe ansatz and finite-size spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the quantum integrable spin chain models associated with the Jimbo R-matrix based on the quantum affine algebra $D^{(2)}_{n+1}$, subject to quantum-group-invariant boundary conditions parameterized by two discrete variables $p=0,\dots, n$ and $\varepsilon = 0, 1$. We develop the analytical Bethe ansatz for the previously unexplored case $\varepsilon = 1$ with any $n$, and use it to investigate the effects of different boundary conditions on the finite-size spectrum of the quantum spin chain based on the rank-$2$ algebra $D^{(2)}_3$. Previous work on this model with periodic boundary conditions has shown that it is critical for the range of anisotropy parameters $0&lt;\gamma&lt;\pi/4$, where its scaling limit is described by a non-compact CFT with continuous degrees of freedom related to two copies of the 2D black hole sigma model. The scaling limit of the model with quantum-group-invariant boundary conditions depends on the parameter $\varepsilon$: similarly as in the rank-$1$ $D^{(2)}_2$ chain, we find that the symmetry of the lattice model is spontaneously broken, and the spectrum of conformal weights has both discrete and continuous components, for $\varepsilon=1$. For $p=1$, the latter coincides with that of the $D^{(2)}_2$ chain, which should correspond to a non-compact brane related to one black hole CFT in the presence of boundaries. For $\varepsilon=0$, the spectrum of conformal weights is purely discrete.</description>

      <title>Coordinate light-cone-ordered perturbation theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review the development of light-cone-ordered perturbation theory in coordinate space (C-LCOPT). Compared to light-cone-ordered perturbation theory in momentum space (LCOPT), the role of intermediate states in LCOPT is played in C-LCOPT by paths, which are ordered sequences of lines and vertices that connect pairs of external points. Each path denominator of C-LCOPT equals the difference between the separation of the minus coordinates of the beginning and ending points of the path and the sum of the light-cone distances of all lines along the path computed from their plus and transverse coordinates. We observe that this method, originally applied to amplitudes, can be extended to cross sections, which are given in terms of closed paths reminiscent of Schwinger-Keldysh formalisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present WI2easy, a Mathematica package for high-precision analysis of warm inflation (WI) dynamics, enabling efficient computation of both background evolution and curvature perturbations. Designed with a user-friendly interface, the tool supports a broad spectrum of inflaton potentials--including large-field, small-field, and hybrid models--and accommodates arbitrary dissipation coefficients dependent on temperature, field amplitude, or both, encompassing canonical forms prevalent in WI studies. Users can define custom models through intuitive commands, generating full dynamical trajectories and perturbation spectra in a streamlined workflow. This facilitates rapid confrontation of theoretical predictions with observational constraints, empowering systematic exploration of WI parameter spaces. WI2easy bridges the gap between theoretical models and observational cosmology, offering a robust, adaptable framework for next-generation inflationary analyses.</description>

      <title>Goofy is the new Normal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the recently discovered global $\textit{goofy}$ transformations and conclude that their understanding is mandatory to describe the renormalization group (RG) fixed point structure of quantum field theories (QFTs) in general. Originally, goofy transformations were identified in the two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM), where their surprisingly RG stable parameter relations do not correspond to any $\textit{regular}$ symmetry. We unveil several new goofy transformations and their associated RG fixed points, which we have explicitly checked to be RG invariant to three-loop order in gauge-, and scalar quantum corrections. We give a general argument as to why the implied parameter relations are RG invariant to all orders, even though the corresponding goofy transformations are explicitly broken by the gauge-kinetic terms. Goofy transformations can prohibit bare scalar mass parameters and give rise to generation-dependent sensitivity on relative signs of gauge couplings, for what reason they may have important applications for the electroweak hierarchy problem and the Standard Model flavor puzzle. We also discuss the relevance of goofy-symmetric RG fixed points for a phenomenon of "dynamical classicalization" in QFT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Einstein-Cartan theory of gravity can arise from a mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking within the context of pre-geometric gauge theories. In this work, we develop the Hamiltonian analysis of such theories. By making contact with the ADM formalism, we show that all the results of canonical General Relativity are correctly recovered in the IR limit of the spontaneously broken phase. We then apply Dirac's algorithm to study the algebra of constraints and determine the number of degrees of freedom in the UV limit of the unbroken phase. We also discuss possible pathways toward a UV completion of General Relativity, including a pre-geometric generalisation of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation and an extended BF formulation of the pre-geometric theory.</description>

      <title>Gauge invariance and color charge fluctuations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nature of confinement is connected with color charge. Unfortunately, the color charge densities in QCD, the Noether charge densities associated with the global color invariance, are not invariant under local color rotations. This implies that the expectation values of the net color charge in any region of any physical state in QCD, states that satisfy the color Gauss law, are automatically zero for all components of color. In this paper it is shown that the expectation value of the square of the net color charge in a region, a measure of the color charge fluctuations, is necessarily nonzero when evaluated in physical states and the result, while depending on the scheme and scale by which the theory is regulated, is gauge invariant. This holds despite the formal lack of gauge invariance of the operator. Moreover, there is a particular combination of the color charge fluctuations for the vacuum and for a system describable by a non-trivial density matrix that is independent that has a well-defined continuum limit</description>

Abstract: The field equations of pre-geometric theories of gravity are derived and analysed, both without and with matter. After the spontaneous symmetry breaking that reduces the gauge symmetry of these theories \`a la Yang-Mills, a metric structure for spacetime emerges and the field equations recover both the Einstein and the Cartan field equations for gravity. A first exact solution of the pre-geometric field equations is also presented. This solution can be considered as a pre-geometric de Sitter universe and provides a possible resolution for the problem of the Big Bang singularity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reveal a hidden electrodynamical structure emerging from a general $2\times2$ pseudo-Hermitian system that exhibits real spectra. Even when the Hamiltonian does not explicitly depend on time, the Berry curvature can be mapped onto a $2+1$ dimensional electromagnetic field arising from an artificial spacetime instanton, in sharp contrast to the Hermitian systems where the Berry curvature is equivalent to the static magnetic field of a magnetic monopole in three spatial dimensions. The instanton appearing as a spacetime singularity carries a topological charge that quantizes the jump of magnetic flux of the Berry curvature at the time origin. Our findings are demonstrated in a simple example related to antiferromagnetic magnons.</description>

      <title>Identification of gapless phases by a twisting operator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a general necessary condition for a spin chain with SO(3) spin-rotation symmetry to be gapped. Specifically, we prove that the ground state(s) of an SO(3)-symmetric gapped spin chain must be spin singlet(s), and the expectation value of a twisting operator asymptotically approaches unity in the thermodynamic limit, where finite-size corrections are inversely proportional to the system size. This theorem provides (i) supporting evidence for various conjectured gapped phases, and (ii) a sufficient criterion for identifying gapless spin chains. We verify our theorem by numerical simulations for a variety of spin models and show that it offers a novel efficient way to identify gapless phases in spin chains with spin-rotation symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a Hilbert space approach to quantum mechanics (QM) where space and time are treated on an equal footing. Our approach replaces the standard dependence on an external classical time parameter with a spacetime-symmetric algebraic structure, thereby unifying the axioms that traditionally distinguish the treatment of spacelike and timelike separations. Standard quantum evolution can be recovered from timelike correlators, defined by means of a quantum action operator, a quantum version of the action of classical mechanics. The corresponding map also provides a novel perspective on the path integral (PI) formulation, which, in the case of fermions, yields an alternative to the use of Grassmann variables. In addition, the formalism can be interpreted in terms of generalized quantum states, codifying both the conventional information of a quantum system at a given time and its evolution. We show that these states are solutions to a quantum principle of stationary action enabled by the novel notion of timelike correlations.</description>
