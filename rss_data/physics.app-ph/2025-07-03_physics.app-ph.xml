      <title>Magnetism from Conductors, and Enhanced Non-Linear Phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that microstructures built from non-magnetic conducting sheets exhibit an effective magnetic permeability, /mu_meff, which can be tuned to values not accessible in naturally occurring materials, including large imaginary components of /mu_meff. The microstructure is on a scale much less than the wavelength of radiation, is not resolved by incident microwaves, and uses a very low density of metal so that structures can be extremely lightweight. Most of the structures are resonant due to internal capacitance and inductance, and resonant enhancement combined with compression of electrical energy into a very small volume greatly enhances the energy density at critical locations in the structure, easily by factors of a million and possibly by much more. Weakly non-linear materials placed at these critical locations will show greatly enhanced effects raising the possibility of manufacturing active structures whose properties can be switched at will between many states</description>

      <title>Microscale architected materials for elastic wave guiding: Fabrication and dynamic characterization across length and time scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an experimental protocol for the fabrication and characterization of scalable microarchitected elastic waveguides. Using silicon microfabrication techniques, we develop free-standing 2D truss-based architected waveguides with a maximum diameter of 80 mm, unit cells size of 100 micrometer, and minimum beam width of 5 micrometer, thus achieving scale separation. To characterize elastic wave propagation, we introduce a custom-built scanning optical pump-probe experiment that enables contactless excitation of elastic wave modes and full spatio-temporal reconstruction of wave propagation across hundreds of unit cells with sub-unit cell resolution. Results on periodic architectures show excellent agreement with finite element simulations and equivalent experimental data at larger length scales. Motivated by scalable computational inverse design, we fabricate a specific example of a spatially graded waveguide and demonstrate its ability to guide elastic waves along an arbitrary pre-designed path.</description>

      <title>Graded phononic metamaterials: Scalable design meets scalable microfabrication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metamaterials are a new generation of advanced materials, exhibiting engineered microstructures that enable customized material properties not found in nature. The dynamics of metamaterials are particularly fascinating, promising the capability to guide, attenuate, and focus waves at will. Phononic metamaterials aim to manipulate mechanical waves with broad applications in acoustics, elastodynamics, and structural vibrations. A key bottleneck in the advancement of phononic metamaterials is scalability -- in design, simulation, and especially fabrication (e.g., beyond tens of unit cells per spatial dimension). We present a framework for scalable inverse design of spatially graded metamaterials for elastic wave guiding, together with a scalable microfabrication method. This framework enables the design and realization of complex waveguides including hundreds of thousands of unit cells, with the potential to extend to millions with no change in protocol. Scalable design is achieved via optimization with a ray tracing model for waves in spatially graded beam lattices. Designs are fabricated by photolithography and etching of silicon wafers to create free-standing microarchitected films. Wave guiding is demonstrated experimentally, using pulsed laser excitation and an interferometer for displacement measurements. Broadband wave guiding is demonstrated, indicating the promise of our scalable design and fabrication methods for on-chip elastic wave manipulation.</description>

      <title>The impact of process steps on nearly ideal subthreshold slope in 300-mm compatible InGaZnO TFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While we demonstrate a back-gated (BG) amorphous Indium-Gallium-Zinc-Oxide (a-IGZO) transistors with a nearly ideal subthreshold slope (SS) ~ 60 mV/dec. However, SS degrades when a top-gated (TG) configuration is implemented. The energy distribution of traps inferred from temperature-dependent (T = 4 K - 300 K) and multi-frequency (f = 1 kHz - 100 kHz) admittance measurements, reveals a much higher trap density in TG devices. By analyzing the impact of each process step and conducting forming gas anneal (FGA) experiments, we reveal the role of hydrogen in the deterioration of the SS in the IGZO-based transistors.</description>

      <title>Low-dispersion low free-spectral-range Mach-Zehnder interferometer with long straight path lengths on silicon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiple Mach-Zehnder interferometers are constructed using fiber-Bragg grating couplers, y-branches, silicon waveguides, and/or broadband splitters in silicon on insulator strip waveguides to test the effect of variation in waveguide length between consecutive bends on the transmission gain spectrum, free-spectral range, group refractive index, and dispersion. Dispersion is mitigated by increasing the path length between consecutive bends of minimum radius. With long linear waveguide sections, a free spectral range of 0.41 nm is achieved.</description>

      <title>LOMS.cz: A computational platform for high-throughput Classical and Combinatorial Judd-Ofelt analysis and rare-earth spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present LOMS.cz (Luminescence, Optical and Magneto-optical Software), an open-source computational platform that addresses the long-standing challenge of standardizing Judd-Ofelt (JO) calculations in rare-earth spectroscopy. Despite JO theory's six-decade history as the fundamental framework for understanding $4f\leftrightarrow4f$ transitions, the field lacks standardized computational methodologies for precise and reproducible parameter determination. LOMS integrates three key innovations: (1) automated computation of JO parameters, transition probabilities, branching ratios, and theoretical radiative lifetimes, (2) a dynamically expanding database of experimentally validated parameters enabling direct comparison between computed and empirical results, and (3) a novel Combinatorial JO (C-JO) analysis algorithm that systematically identifies optimal absorption band combinations to ensure reliable parameter extraction. As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrate how this computational framework enables rapid screening of spectroscopic parameters, allowing researchers to predict optical properties with enhanced reliability. By combining automated analysis with experimental validation through its integrated database, LOMS.cz establishes a standardized platform for accelerating the discovery and optimization of rare-earth-based photonic and optoelectronic materials.</description>

      <title>TeO2-BaO-Bi2O3 tellurite optical glasses II. -- Linear and non-linear optical and magneto-optical properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present study investigates the linear and non-linear optical and magneto-optical properties of TeO$_2$-BaO-Bi$_2$O$_3$ (TeBaBi) glasses prepared by the conventional melt-quenching technique at 900 {\deg}C. Prepared glass composition ranges across the whole glass-forming-ability (GFA) region focusing on mutual substitution trends of constituent oxides, where TeO$_2$: 55-85 mol.%, BaO: 10-35 mol.%, Bi$_2$O$_3$: 5-15 mol.%. Studied glasses exhibit high values of linear ($n_{632} \approx$ 1.922-2.084) and non-linear refractive index ($n_2\approx$1.63-3.45$\times10^{-11}$ esu), Verdet constant ($V_{632} \approx$ 26.7-45.3 radT$^{-1}$m$^{-1}$) and optical band gap energy ($E_g \approx$ 3.1-3.6 eV). The introduction of TeO$_2$ and Bi$_2$O$_3$ results in increase of both linear/non-linear refractive index and Verdet constant, with a more pronounced influence of Bi$_2$O$_3$. Measured spectral dispersion of refractive index and Verdet constant were used for estimation of magneto-optic anomaly parameter ($\gamma \approx$ 0.71-0.92), which may be used for theoretical modelling of magneto-optic response in diamagnetic TeBaBi glasses. Additionally, the properties of the prepared TeBaBi glasses were directly compared to those of the TeO$_2$-ZnO-BaO glass system, which was prepared and characterized under similar experimental conditions. The compositional dependence of the refractive index in both glass systems was described using multilinear regression analysis, demonstrating high correlation and uniformity of estimation across the entire GFA region. This makes them highly promising for precise dispersion engineering and construction of optical devices operating from visible to mid-infrared spectral region.</description>

      <title>Exploiting complex 3D-printed surface structures for portable quantum technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Portable quantum technologies require robust, lightweight apparatus with superior performance. For techniques dependent upon high-vacuum environments, such as atom interferometers and atomic clocks, 3D-printing enables new avenues to tailor in-vacuum gas propagation dynamics. We demonstrate intricate, fine-scale surface patterning of 3D-printed vacuum components to increase the rate at which gas particles collide with the surface. By applying a non-evaporable getter coating for use as a surface pump, we show that the patterned surface pumps gas particles 3.8 times faster than an equivalent flat areas. These patterns can be directly integrated into additively manufactured components, enabling application in close proximity to key experimental regions and contributing to overall mass-reduction. We develop numerical simulations that show good agreement with this result and predict up to a ten-fold increase in pumping rate, for realistic surface structures. Our work has direct applications in enabling passively-pumped portable quantum technologies, but also establishes 3D-printing as a powerful technique for the creation of optimized surface patterning to provide enhanced control over high-vacuum gas dynamics for a broad range of applications.</description>

      <title>Topological Braiding of Bloch Eigenmodes Protected by Non-Abelian Quaternion Invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Braiding has attracted significant attention in physics because of its important role in describing the fundamental exchange of particles. Infusing the braiding with topological protection will make it robust against imperfections and perturbations, but such topological braiding is believed to be possible only in interacting quantum systems, e.g., topological superconductors. Here, we propose and demonstrate a new strategy of topological braiding that emerges from non-Abelian topological insulators, a class of recently discovered multi-band topological phase. We unveil a mathematical connection between braiding and non-Abelian quaternion invariants, by which Bloch eigenmodes under parallel transport produce braid sequences protected by the non-Abelian band topology. The braiding is also associated with geometric phases quantized over half the Brillouin zone. This new type of non-Abelian topological braiding is experimentally realized in acoustic systems with periodic synthetic dimensions. The results show that the principle discovered here is a new strategy towards topological braiding and can be extended for other types of classical waves and non-interacting quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Midveins regulate the shape formation of drying leaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dried leaves in nature often exhibit curled and crumpled morphologies, typically attributed to internal strain gradients that produce dome-like shapes. However, the origin of these strain gradients remains poorly understood. Although leaf veins--particularly the midvein--have been suggested to influence shape formation, their mechanical role has not been systematically investigated. Here, we demonstrate that mechanical constraints imposed by the midvein play a crucial role in generating the diverse morphologies that emerge during leaf drying. Combining numerical simulations and theoretical analysis, we show that a uniformly shrinking leaf lamina constrained by a non-shrinking midvein gives rise to two distinct types of configurations: curling-dominated and folding-dominated morphologies. In the curling-dominated regime, both S-curled and C-curled shapes emerge, with C-curled configurations more commonly observed due to their lower elastic energy. In contrast, the folding-dominated regime features folding accompanied by edge waviness. Theoretical modeling reveals a linear relationship between midvein curvature and mismatch strain, consistent with simulation results. Moreover, we find that the morphological outcome is governed by the ratio of bending stiffnesses between the lamina and the midvein. We construct a comprehensive phase diagram for the transitions between different configurations. These findings provide a mechanical framework for understanding shape formation in drying leaves, offering new insights into natural morphing processes and informing the design of bio-inspired morphable structures.</description>

      <title>Ge-based Quantum Sensors for Low-Energy Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present \textbf{GeQuLEP} (Germanium-based Quantum Sensors for Low-Energy Physics), a conceptual design for an advanced quantum sensing platform integrating high-purity germanium (Ge) crystals with engineered phononic crystal cavities. At cryogenic temperatures, these cavities naturally host dipole-bound states, effectively forming quantum dots coupled to radio-frequency quantum point contact (RF-QPC) readout systems. This innovative coupling approach promises ultra-sensitive phonon-mediated charge detection through phonon-induced charge displacement. GeQuLEP is specifically designed to achieve exceptionally low detection thresholds, theoretically enabling single primary phonon sensitivity with anticipated energy depositions as low as \textbf{0.00745~eV}. This unprecedented sensitivity, if realized experimentally, would provide unique access to searches for low-mass dark matter down to the keV/$c^2$ mass range via nuclear and electronic recoils. Additionally, GeQuLEP aims to facilitate the real-time detection of solar \textit{pp} neutrinos through coherent elastic neutrino--nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS). By combining phonon-based quantum transduction with quantum-classical hybrid readout schemes, the GeQuLEP architecture represents a scalable, contact-free phonon spectroscopy design that could significantly advance the capabilities of ultra-low-energy rare-event detection at the quantum limit.</description>

      <title>Frequency-Resolved Forward Capacitance in GaN-based LEDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16626v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study establishes a unified framework for interpreting dynamic capacitive responses in InGaN-based light-emitting diodes (LEDs) through forward-bias capacitance-voltage-frequency spectroscopy. A hybrid impedance model integrating series RL components and parallel C-G networks was developed to resolve distinct frequency-dependent capacitive regimes. The low-frequency regime (&lt;1 kHz) is governed by interfacial capacitance with characteristic reciprocal frequency dependence, while the mid-frequency range(10 kHz-6.4 MHz) demonstrates carrier diffusion and recombination dynamics. At MHz frequencies, negative capacitance manifests due to delayed carrier emission mediated by deep-level traps. The model achieved sub-1% fitting errors (R^2 &gt; 0.99)across a broad bandwidth(10 kHz-6.4 MHz) , conclusively attributing negative capacitance to intrinsic trap processes rather than extrinsic artifacts. Critical advances include quantum well cap thickness modulation reducing mid-frequency capacitance by 30% and the dominance of trap-mediated inductance over parasitic contributions by three orders of magnitude. This framework resolves persistent controversies in LED impedance interpretation. By bridging semiconductor physics with device engineering, this methodology provides essential tools for designing next-generation optoelectronic systems requiring ultralow-latency operation and precise charge-state control.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium friction and free energy estimates for kinetic coarse-graining -- Driven particles in responsive media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting the molecular friction and energy landscapes under nonequilibrium conditions is key to coarse-graining the dynamics of selective solute transport through complex, fluctuating and responsive media, e.g., polymeric materials such as hydrogels, cellular membranes or ion channels. The analysis of equilibrium ensembles already allows such a coarse-graining for very mild nonequilibrium conditions. Yet in the presence of stronger external driving and/or inhomogeneous setups, the transport process is governed apart from a potential of mean force also by a nontrivial position- and velocity-dependent friction. It is therefore important to find suitable and efficient methods to estimate the mean force and the friction landscape, which then can be used in a low-dimensional, coarse-grained Langevin framework to predict the system's transport properties and timescales. In this work, we evaluate different coarse-graining approaches based on constant-velocity constraint simulations for generating such estimates using two model systems, which are a 1D responsive barrier as a minimalistic model and a single tracer driven through a 3D bead-spring polymer membrane as a more sophisticated problem. Finally, we demonstrate that the estimates from 3D constant-velocity simulations yield the correct velocity-dependent friction, which can be directly utilized for coarse-grained (1D) Langevin simulations with constant external driving forces.</description>

      <title>Superconducting Coherence Peak in Near-Field Radiative Heat Transfer</title>

Abstract: Enhancement and peaks in near-field radiative heat transfer (NFRHT) typically arise due to surface phonon-polaritons, plasmon-polaritons, and electromagnetic (EM) modes in structured materials. However, the role of material quantum coherence in enhancing near-field radiative heat transfer remains unexplored. Here, we unravel that NFRHT in superconductor-ferromagnetic systems displays a unique peak at the superconducting phase transition that originates from the quantum coherence of Bogoliubov quasiparticles in superconductors. Our theory takes into account evanescent EM radiation emanating from fluctuating currents related to Cooper pairs and Bogoliubov quasiparticles in stark contrast to the current-current correlations induced by free electrons in conventional materials. Our proposed NFRHT configuration exploits ferromagnetic resonance at frequencies deep inside the superconducting band gap to isolate this superconducting coherence peak. Furthermore, we reveal that Cooper pairs and Bogoliubov quasiparticles have opposite effects on near-field thermal radiation and isolate their effects on many-body radiative heat transfer near superconductors. Our proposed phenomenon can have applications for developing thermal isolators and heat sinks in superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>An accurate measurement of parametric array using a spurious sound filter topologically equivalent to a half-wavelength resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12398</link>

Abstract: Parametric arrays (PA) offer exceptional directivity and compactness compared to conventional loudspeakers, facilitating various acoustic applications. However, accurate measurement of audio signals generated by PA remains challenging due to spurious ultrasonic sounds arising from microphone nonlinearities. Existing filtering methods, including Helmholtz resonators, phononic crystals, polymer films, and grazing incidence techniques, exhibit practical constraints such as size limitations, fabrication complexity, or insufficient attenuation. To address these issues, we propose and demonstrate a novel acoustic filter based on the design of a half-wavelength resonator. The developed filter exploits the nodal plane in acoustic pressure distribution, effectively minimizing microphone exposure to targeted ultrasonic frequencies. Fabrication via stereolithography (SLA) 3D printing ensures high dimensional accuracy, which is crucial for high-frequency acoustic filters. Finite element method (FEM) simulations guided filter optimization for suppression frequencies at 40 kHz and 60 kHz, achieving high transmission loss (TL) around 60 dB. Experimental validations confirm the filter's superior performance in significantly reducing spurious acoustic signals, as reflected in frequency response, beam pattern, and propagation curve measurements. The proposed filter ensures stable and precise acoustic characterization, independent of measurement distances and incidence angles. This new approach not only improves measurement accuracy but also enhances reliability and reproducibility in parametric array research and development.</description>

      <title>Self-heating electrochemical memory for high-precision analog computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analog computers hold promise to significantly reduce the energy consumption of artificial intelligence algorithms, but commercialization has been hampered by a fundamental scientific challenge - how to reliably store and process analog information with high precision. We present an approach based upon metal oxide memory cells that undergo controlled self-heating during programming with a newly developed, electro-thermo-chemical gate. The gate uniformly spreads heat and electrochemical reactions to enable wide, bulk-vacancy modulation which yields nine orders of magnitude in tunable analog resistance - three orders greater than other devices reported, with thousands of states. The gating profoundly reduces noise and drift to enable precision programming to targeted states within a few operations, lowering conductance errors by two orders of magnitude relative to other devices reported. Simulations show improvement in computational energy efficiency by at least 10x over other devices due to far greater scalability at higher precision. The results overturn long-held assumptions about the poor reliability and precision of analog resistance devices and opens the door to manufacturable, bulk metal-oxide devices and new applications that leverage high precision.</description>
