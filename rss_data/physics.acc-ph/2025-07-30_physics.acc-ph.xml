      <title>On operation and control of CW magnetrons for superconducting accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CW magnetrons, developed for industrial RF heaters, were suggested to feed RF cavities of superconducting accelerators due to higher efficiency and lower cost of RF power than provide traditionally used klystrons, IOTs or solid-state amplifiers. RF amplifiers driven by a master oscillator serve as coherent RF sources. CW magnetrons are regenerative RF auto generators with a huge regenerative gain. This causes regenerative instability with a notable noise when a magnetron operates as an auto generator i.e., with the anode voltage above the threshold of self-excitation. Traditionally, an injection locking by a small signal is used for phase stabilization of magnetrons. In this case CW magnetrons with the injection-locked (coherent) oscillations generate a notable level of noise. This may preclude use of CW magnetrons in this mode in the Superconducting RF (SRF) accelerators. This paper reviews PIC modeling and previously obtained experimental results for the operation and control of CW magnetrons, which led to the development of techniques most suitable for various SRF accelerators using forced RF oscillation of magnetrons, when the magnetron is launched by an injected forcing signal, and regenerative noise is suppressed.</description>

      <title>Impact of coherent wiggler radiation impedance in Tau-Charm factories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) has long been recognized as a significant source of longitudinal impedance driving microwave instability in electron storage rings. In the pursuit of higher luminosity, next-generation circular $e^+e^-$ colliders operating in the few-GeV energy range, such as B-factories and Tau-Charm factories, are being designed with low-emittance beams and high beam currents. Damping wigglers are commonly introduced to reduce damping times and control beam emittance. In this study, we systematically investigate the impact of coherent wiggler radiation (CWR), a specific form of CSR generated within wigglers, on beam stability in Tau-Charm factories. We revisit the threshold conditions for CWR-induced microwave instability and evaluate its effects under realistic lattice configurations of collider rings. Furthermore, we examine theoretical models of longitudinal CWR impedance and identify improved formulations that better capture its influence. As an illustrative example, the developed CWR impedance models are applied to simulate beam stability in the Super Tau-Charm Facility currently under design in China.</description>

      <title>femto-PIXAR: a neural network method for reconstruction of femtosecond X-ray free electron laser pulse energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16392v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: X-ray Free Electron Lasers (X\nobreakdash-FELs) operate in a wide range of lasing configurations for a broad variety of scientific applications at ultrafast time-scales such as structural biology, materials science, and atomic and molecular physics. Shot-by-shot characterization of the X-FEL pulses is crucial for analysis of many experiments as well as tuning the X-FEL performance. However, for the weak pulses found in advanced configurations, e.g. those needed for coherent, two-pulse studies of quantum materials, there is no current method for reliably resolving pulse profiles. Here we show that a physics-based U-net model can reconstruct the individual pulse power profiles for sub-picosecond pulse separation without the need for simulations. Using experimental data from weak X-FEL pulse pairs, we demonstrate we can learn the pulse characteristics on a shot-by-shot basis when conventional methods fail.</description>
