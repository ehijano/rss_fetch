      <title>A noise-tolerant, resource-saving probabilistic binary neural network implemented by the SOT-MRAM compute-in-memory system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a spin-orbit torque(SOT) magnetoresistive random-access memory(MRAM)-based probabilistic binary neural network(PBNN) for resource-saving and hardware noise-tolerant computing applications. With the presence of thermal fluctuation, the non-destructive SOT-driven magnetization switching characteristics lead to a random weight matrix with controllable probability distribution. In the meanwhile, the proposed CIM architecture allows for the concurrent execution of the probabilistic vector-matrix multiplication (PVMM) and binarization. Furthermore, leveraging the effectiveness of random binary cells to propagate multi-bit probabilistic information, our SOT-MRAM-based PBNN system achieves a 97.78\% classification accuracy under a 7.01\% weight variation on the MNIST database through 10 sampling cycles, and the number of bit-level computation operations is reduced by a factor of 6.9 compared to that of the full-precision LeNet-5 network. Our work provides a compelling framework for the design of reliable neural networks tailored to the applications with low power consumption and limited computational resources.</description>

      <title>Dataflow-Aware PIM-Enabled Manycore Architecture for Deep Learning Workloads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Processing-in-memory (PIM) has emerged as an enabler for the energy-efficient and high-performance acceleration of deep learning (DL) workloads. Resistive random-access memory (ReRAM) is one of the most promising technologies to implement PIM. However, as the complexity of Deep convolutional neural networks (DNNs) grows, we need to design a manycore architecture with multiple ReRAM-based processing elements (PEs) on a single chip. Existing PIM-based architectures mostly focus on computation while ignoring the role of communication. ReRAM-based tiled manycore architectures often involve many Processing Elements (PEs), which need to be interconnected via an efficient on-chip communication infrastructure. Simply allocating more resources (ReRAMs) to speed up only computation is ineffective if the communication infrastructure cannot keep up with it. In this paper, we highlight the design principles of a dataflow-aware PIM-enabled manycore platform tailor-made for various types of DL workloads. We consider the design challenges with both 2.5D interposer- and 3D integration-enabled architectures.</description>

      <title>Toward Practical Benchmarks of Ising Machines: A Case Study on the Quadratic Knapsack Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization has wide applications from industry to natural science. Ising machines bring an emerging computing paradigm for efficiently solving a combinatorial optimization problem by searching a ground state of a given Ising model. Current cutting-edge Ising machines achieve fast sampling of near-optimal solutions of the max-cut problem. However, for problems with additional constraint conditions, their advantages have been hardly shown due to difficulties in handling the constraints. The performance of Ising machines on such problems heavily depends on encoding methods of constraints into penalties, but the optimal choice is non-trivial. In this work, we focus on benchmarks of Ising machines on the quadratic knapsack problem (QKP). To bring out their practical performance, we propose to exploit the problem structure upon using Ising machines. Specifically, we apply fast two-stage post-processing to the outputs of Ising machines, which makes handling the constraint easier. Simulation on medium-sized test instances shows that the proposed method substantially improves the solving performance of Ising machines and the improvement is robust to a choice of the encoding methods. We evaluate an Ising machine called Amplify Annealing Engine with the proposed method and found that it achieves comparable results with existing heuristics.</description>

      <title>A Multi-hop Secure UWOC assisted Local Area Network for UIoT and Underwater Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Underwater environment is substantially less explored territory as compared to earth surface due to lack of robust underwater communication infrastructure. For Internet of Underwater things connectivity, underwater wireless optical communication can play a vital role, compared to conventional radio frequency communication, due to longer range, high data rate, low latency, and unregulated bandwidth. This study proposes underwater wireless optical communication driven local area network UWOC LAN, comprised of multiple network nodes with optical transceivers. Moreover, the temperature sensor data is encapsulated with individual authentication identity to enhance the security of the framework at the user end. The proposed system is evaluated in a specially designed water tank of 4 meters. The proposed system evaluation analysis shows that the system can transmit underwater temperature data reliably in real time. The proposed secure UWOC LAN is tested within a communication range of 16 meters by incorporating multi hop connectivity to monitor the underwater environment.</description>

      <title>Quantum computing in civil engineering: Potentials and Limitations</title>

Abstract: Quantum computing is a new computational paradigm with the potential to solve certain computationally challenging problems much faster than traditional approaches. Civil engineering encompasses many computationally challenging problems, which leads to the question of how well quantum computing is suitable for solving civil engineering problems and how much impact and implications to the field of civil engineering can be expected when deploying quantum computing for solving these problems. To address these questions, we will, in this paper, first introduce the fundamentals of quantum computing. Thereupon, we will analyze the problem classes to elucidate where quantum computing holds the potential to outperform traditional computers and, focusing on the limitations, where quantum computing is not considered the most suitable solution. Finally, we will review common complex computation use cases in civil engineering and evaluate the potential and the limitations of being improved by quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Designing a K-state P-bit Engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Probabilistic bit (p-bit)-based compute engines utilize the unique capability of a p-bit to probabilistically switch between two states to solve computationally challenging problems. However, when solving problems that require more than two states (e.g., problems such as Max-3-Cut, verifying if a graph is K-partite (K&gt;2) etc.), additional pre-processing steps such as graph reduction are required to make the problem compatible with a two-state p-bit platform. Moreover, this not only increases the problem size by entailing the use of auxiliary variables but can also degrade the solution quality. In this work, we develop a unique framework for implementing a K-state (K&gt;2) p-bit engine. Furthermore, from an implementation standpoint, we show that such a K-state p-bit engine can be implemented using N traditional (2-state) p-bits, and one multi-state p-bit -- a novel concept proposed here. Augmenting traditional p-bit platforms, our approach enables us to solve an archetypal combinatoric problem class requiring multiple states, namely Max-K-Cut (K=3, 4 shown here), without using any additional auxiliary variables. Thus, our work fundamentally advances the functional capability of p-bit engines, enabling them to solve a broader class of computationally challenging problems more efficiently.</description>

      <title>A pragma based C++ framework for hybrid quantum/classical computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02605v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computers promise exponential speed ups over classical computers for various tasks. This emerging technology is expected to have its first huge impact in High Performance Computing (HPC), as it can solve problems beyond the reach of HPC. To that end, HPC will require quantum accelerators, which will enable applications to run on both classical and quantum devices, via hybrid quantum-classical nodes. Hybrid quantum-HPC applications should be scalable, executable on Quantum Error Corrected (QEC) devices, and could use quantum-classical primitives. However, the lack of scalability, poor performances, and inability to insert classical schemes within quantum applications has prevented current quantum frameworks from being adopted by the HPC community.
  This paper specifies the requirements of a hybrid quantum-classical framework compatible with HPC environments, and introduces a novel hardware-agnostic framework called Q-Pragma. This framework extends the classical programming language C++ heavily used in HPC via the addition of pragma directives to manage quantum computations.</description>
