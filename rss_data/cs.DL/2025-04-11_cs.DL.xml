      <title>Quantum Machine Learning: Unveiling Trends, Impacts through Bibliometric Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is the intersection of two revolutionary fields: quantum computing and machine learning. It promises to unlock unparalleled capabilities in data analysis, model building, and problem-solving by harnessing the unique properties of quantum mechanics. This research endeavors to conduct a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of scientific information pertaining to QML covering the period from 2000 to 2023. An extensive dataset comprising 9493 scholarly works is meticulously examined to unveil notable trends, impact factors, and funding patterns within the domain. Additionally, the study employs bibliometric mapping techniques to visually illustrate the network relationships among key countries, institutions, authors, patent citations and significant keywords in QML research. The analysis reveals a consistent growth in publications over the examined period. The findings highlight the United States and China as prominent contributors, exhibiting substantial publication and citation metrics. Notably, the study concludes that QML, as a research subject, is currently in a formative stage, characterized by robust scholarly activity and ongoing development.</description>

      <title>Dynamic disruption index across citation and cited references windows: Recommendations for thresholds in research evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The temporal dimension of citation accumulation poses fundamental challenges for quantitative research evaluations, particularly in assessing disruptive and consolidating research through the disruption index (D). While prior studies emphasize minimum citation windows (mostly 3-5 years) for reliable citation impact measurements, the time-sensitive nature of D - which quantifies a paper' s capacity to eclipse prior knowledge - remains underexplored. This study addresses two critical gaps: (1) determining the temporal thresholds required for publications to meet citation/reference prerequisites, and (2) identifying "optimal" citation windows that balance early predictability and longitudinal validity. By analyzing millions of publications across four fields with varying citation dynamics, we employ some metrics to track D stabilization patterns. Key findings reveal that a 10-year window achieves &gt;80% agreement with final D classifications, while shorter windows (3 years) exhibit instability. Publications with &gt;=30 references stabilize 1-3 years faster, and extreme cases (top/bottom 5% D values) become identifiable within 5 years - enabling early detection of 60-80% of highly disruptive and consolidating works. The findings offer significant implications for scholarly evaluation and science policy, emphasizing the need for careful consideration of citation window length in research assessment (based on D).</description>

      <title>SemEval-2025 Task 5: LLMs4Subjects -- LLM-based Automated Subject Tagging for a National Technical Library's Open-Access Catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present SemEval-2025 Task 5: LLMs4Subjects, a shared task on automated subject tagging for scientific and technical records in English and German using the GND taxonomy. Participants developed LLM-based systems to recommend top-k subjects, evaluated through quantitative metrics (precision, recall, F1-score) and qualitative assessments by subject specialists. Results highlight the effectiveness of LLM ensembles, synthetic data generation, and multilingual processing, offering insights into applying LLMs for digital library classification.</description>

      <title>The Artificial Intelligence Disclosure (AID) Framework: An Introduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the use of Generative Artificial Intelligence tools have grown in higher education and research, there have been increasing calls for transparency and granularity around the use and attribution of the use of these tools. Thus far, this need has been met via the recommended inclusion of a note, with little to no guidance on what the note itself should include. This has been identified as a problem to the use of AI in academic and research contexts. This article introduces The Artificial Intelligence Disclosure (AID) Framework, a standard, comprehensive, and detailed framework meant to inform the development and writing of GenAI disclosure for education and research.</description>
