      <title>The planted directed polymer: inferring a random walk from noisy images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study the planted directed polymer, in which the path of a random walker is inferred from noisy 'images' accumulated at each timestep. Formulated as a nonlinear problem of Bayesian inference for a hidden Markov model, this problem is a generalization of the directed polymer problem of statistical physics, coinciding with it in the limit of zero signal to noise. For a 1D walker we present numerical investigations and analytical arguments that no phase transition is present. When formulated on a Cayley tree, methods developed for the directed polymer are used to show that there is a transition with decreasing signal to noise where effective inference becomes impossible, meaning that the average fractional overlap between the inferred and true paths falls from one to zero.</description>

      <title>Exact results for the Ising model on a small-world network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small-world networks provide an interesting framework for studying the interplay between regular and random graphs, where links are located in a regular and random way, respectively. On one hand, the random links make the model to obey some kind of mean-field behavior. On the other hand, the links of the regular lattice make the system to retain some related non trivial correlations. The coexistence of these two features in general prevent a closed analytical treatment. Here we consider a one-dimensional small-world Ising model and derive analytically its equation of state, critical point, critical behavior, and critical correlations. Despite being one of the simplest small-world models, our exact and intuitive analysis reveals some intriguing properties.</description>

      <title>Effects of phase separation on extinction times in population models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effect of phase separating diffusive dynamics on the mean time to extinction in several reaction-diffusion models with slow reactions. We consider a continuum theory similar to model AB, and a simple model where individual particles on two sites undergo on-site reactions and hopping between the sites. In the slow-reaction limit, we project the models' dynamics onto suitable one-dimensional reaction coordinates, which allows derivation of quasi-equilibrium effective free energies. For weak noise, this enables characterisation of the mean time to extinction. This time can be enhanced or suppressed by the addition of phase separation, compared with homogeneous reference cases. We also discuss how Allee effects can be affected by phase separation.</description>

      <title>Large-deviations approach to thermalization: the case of harmonic chains with conservative noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of characterizing the different thermalization pathways through a large-deviation approach. Specifically, we consider clean, disordered and quasi-periodic harmonic chains under energy and momentum-conserving noise. For their associated master equations, describing the dynamics of normal modes energies, we compute the fluctuations of activity and dynamical entropy in the corresponding biased ensembles. First-order dynamical phase transition are found that originates from different activity regions in action space. At the transitions, the steady-state in the biased ensembles changes from extended to localized, yielding a kind of condensation in normal-modes space. For the disordered and quasi-periodic models, we argue that the phase-diagram has a critical point at a finite value of the disorder or potential strength.</description>

      <title>Stability of mixed-state quantum phases via finite Markov length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For quantum phases of Hamiltonian ground states, the energy gap plays a central role in ensuring the stability of the phase as long as the gap remains finite. We propose Markov length, the length scale at which the quantum conditional mutual information (CMI) decays exponentially, as an equally essential quantity characterizing mixed-state phases and transitions. For a state evolving under a local Lindbladian, we argue that if its Markov length remains finite along the evolution, then it remains in the same phase, meaning there exists another quasi-local Lindbladian evolution that can reverse the former one. We apply this diagnostic to toric code subject to decoherence and show that the Markov length is finite everywhere except at its decodability transition, at which it diverges. CMI in this case can be mapped to the free energy cost of point defects in the random bond Ising model. This implies that the mixed state phase transition coincides with the decodability transition and also suggests a quasi-local decoding channel.</description>

      <title>Optimal run-and-tumble in slit-like confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Run-and-tumble is a basic model of persistent motion and a motility strategy widespread in micro-organisms and individual cells. In many natural settings, movement occurs in the presence of confinement. While accumulation at the surface has been extensively studied, the transport parallel to the boundary has received less attention. We consider a run-and-tumble particle confined inside a slit, where motion in the bulk alternates with intermittent sojourns at the wall. We first propose a discrete-direction model that is fully tractable and obtain the exact diffusion coefficient characterizing the long-time exploration of the slit. We then use numerical simulations to show that with an adequate choice of parameters, our analytical prediction provides a useful approximation for the diffusion coefficient of run-and-tumble with continuous direction. Finally, we identify the conditions that maximize diffusion within the slit and discuss the optimal mean run time. For swimming bacteria, we find that the optimum is typically reached when the mean run length is comparable to the confinement size.</description>

      <title>Two liquid states of distinguishable helium-4: the existence of another non-superfluid frozen by heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that there can exist two liquid states in distinguishable helium-4 ($^4$He) obeying Boltzmann statistics. This is an indication of quantum liquid polyamorphism induced by nuclear quantum effect. For 0.08-3.3 K and 1-500 bar, we extensively conducted the isothermal-isobaric path integral centroid molecular dynamics simulations to explore not only possible states and state diagram but the state characteristics. The distinguishable $^4$He below 25 bar does not freeze down to 0.08 K even though it includes no Bosonic exchange effect and therefore no Bose condensation. One liquid state, low quantum-dispersion liquid (LQDL), is nearly identical to normal liquid He-I of real $^4$He. The other is high quantum-dispersion liquid (HQDL) consisting of atoms with longer quantum wavelength. This is another non-superfluid existing below 0.5 K or the temperatures of LQDL. The HQDL is also a low-entropy and fragile liquid to exhibit, unlike conventional liquids, rather gas-like relaxation of velocity autocorrelation function, while there the atoms diffuse without noticeable contribution from quantum tunneling. The LQDL-HQDL transition is not a thermodynamic phase transition but a continuous crossover accompanied by the change of the expansion factor of quantum wavelength. Freezing of HQDL into the low quantum-dispersion amorphous solid occurs by heating from 0.2 to 0.3 K at 40-50 bar, while this $P$-$T$ condition coincides with the Kim-Chan normal-supersolid phase boundary of real $^4$He. It is suggested that HQDL has relevance to the non-superfluid states of confined subnano-scale $^4$He systems which are semi-Boltzmann-like owing to the suppression of Bosonic correlation.</description>

      <title>Using rare event algorithms to understand the statistics and dynamics of extreme heatwave seasons in South Asia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computing the return times of extreme events and assessing the impact of climate change on such return times is fundamental to extreme event attribution studies. However, the rarity of such events in the observational record makes this task a challenging one, even more so for "record-shattering" events that have not been previously observed at all. While climate models could be used to simulate such extremely rare events, such an approach entails a huge computational cost: gathering robust statistics for events with return time of centuries would require a few thousand years of simulation.
  In this study, we use an innovative tool, rare event algorithm, that allows to sample numerous extremely rare events at a much lower cost than direct simulations. We employ the algorithm to sample extreme heatwave seasons, corresponding to large anomalies of the seasonal average temperature, in a heatwave hotspot of South Asia using the global climate model Plasim. We show that the algorithm estimates the return levels of extremely rare events with much greater precision than traditional statistical fits. It also enables the computation of various composite statistics, whose accuracy is demonstrated through comparison with a very long control run. In particular, our results reveal that extreme heatwave seasons are associated with an anticyclonic anomaly embedded within a large-scale hemispheric quasi-stationary wave-pattern. Additionally, the algorithm accurately represents the intensity-duration-frequency statistics of sub-seasonal heatwaves, offering insights into both seasonal and sub-seasonal aspects of extreme heatwave seasons. This innovative approach could be used in extreme event attribution studies to better constrain the changes in event's probability and intensity with global warming, particularly for events with return times spanning centuries or millennia.</description>

      <title>Hilbert space fragmentation from lattice geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis describes how isolated many-body quantum systems reach thermal equilibrium. However, quantum many-body scars and Hilbert space fragmentation violate this hypothesis and cause nonthermal behavior. We demonstrate that Hilbert space fragmentation may arise from lattice geometry in a spin-1/2 model that conserves the number of domain walls. We generalize a known, one-dimensional, scarred model to larger dimensions and show that this model displays Hilbert space fragmentation on the Vicsek fractal lattice of arbitrary generation. Using Monte Carlo methods, the model is characterized as strongly fragmented on the Vicsek fractal lattice when the number of domain walls is either small or close to the maximal value. We show that the model displays signatures similar to Hilbert space fragmentation on the second-generation hexaflake fractal lattice, the two-dimensional lattice, and a modified two-dimensional lattice. We study the autocorrelation function of local observables and demonstrate that the model displays nonthermal dynamics.</description>

      <title>Artificial Chemotaxis under Electrodiffusiophoresis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusiophoretic motion induced by gradients of dissolved species has enabled the manipulation of colloids over large distances, spanning hundreds of microns. Nonetheless, studies have primarily focused on simple geometries that feature 1D gradients of solutes generated by reactions or selective dissolution. Thus, our understanding of 3D diffusiophoresis remains elusive despite its importance in wide-ranging scenarios, such as cellular transport and nanofluidics. Herein, we present a strategy to generate 3D chemical gradients under electric fields. In this approach, faradaic reactions at electrodes induce global pH gradients that drive long-range transport through electrodiffusiophoresis. Simultaneously, the electric field induces local pH gradients by driving the particle's double layer far from equilibrium. As a result, while global pH gradients lead to 2D focusing away from electrodes, local pH gradients induce aggregation in the third dimension. Resulting interparticle interactions display a strong dependence on surface chemistry, and particle size. Furthermore, pH gradients can be readily tuned by adjusting the voltage and frequency of the electric field. For large P\'eclet numbers, we observed a chemotactic-like collapse. Remarkably, such collapse occurs without reactions at a particle's surface. By mixing particles with different sizes, we also demonstrate the emergence of non-reciprocal interactions through experiments and Brownian dynamics simulations. These findings suggest a wide array of possibilities for the dynamic assembly of materials and the design of responsive matter.</description>

      <title>Actionable forecasting as a determinant of function in noisy biological systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous adaptation to variable environments is crucial for the survival of living organisms. Here, we analyze how adaptation, forecasting, and resource mobilization towards a target state, termed actionability, interact to determine biological function. We develop a general theory and show that it is possible for organisms to continuously track their optimal state in a dynamic environment by adapting towards an actionable target that incorporates just current information on the optimal state and its rate of change. If the environmental information is precise and readily actionable, it is possible to implement perfect tracking without anticipatory mechanisms, irrespective of the adaptation rate. In contrast, predictive functions, like those of circadian rhythms, are beneficial if sensing the environment is slow or unreliable, as they allow better adaptation with fewer resources. To explore potential actionable forecasting mechanisms, we develop a general approach that implements the adaptation dynamics with forecasting through a dynamics-informed neural network.</description>

      <title>Bootstrap percolation is local</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metastability thresholds lie at the heart of bootstrap percolation theory. Yet proving precise lower bounds is notoriously hard. We show that for two of the most classical models, two-neighbour and Frob\"ose, upper bounds are sharp to essentially arbitrary precision, by linking them to their local counterparts.
  In Frob\"ose bootstrap percolation, iteratively, any vertex of the square lattice that is the only healthy vertex of a $1\times1$ square becomes infected and infections never heal. We prove that if vertices are initially infected independently with probability $p\to0$, then with high probability the origin becomes infected after \[\exp\left(\frac{\pi^2}{6p}-\frac{\pi\sqrt{2+\sqrt2}}{\sqrt p}+\frac{O(\log^2(1/p))}{\sqrt[3]p}\right)\] time steps. We achieve this by proposing a new paradigmatic view on bootstrap percolation based on locality. Namely, we show that studying the Frob\"ose model is equivalent in an extremely strong sense to studying its local version. As a result, we completely bypass Holroyd's classical but technical hierarchy method, yielding the first term above and systematically used throughout bootstrap percolation for the last two decades. Instead, the proof features novel links to large deviation theory, eigenvalue perturbations and others.
  We also use the locality viewpoint to resolve the so-called bootstrap percolation paradox. Indeed, we propose and implement an exact (deterministic) algorithm which exponentially outperforms previous Monte Carlo approaches. This allows us to clearly showcase and quantify the slow convergence we prove rigorously.
  The same approach applies, with more extensive computations, to the two-neighbour model, in which vertices are infected when they have at least two infected neighbours and do not recover. We expect it to be applicable to a wider range of models and correspondingly conclude with a number of open problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of a quantum many-body system driven by two competing measurements, which induces a topological entanglement transition between two distinct area law phases. We employ a positive operator-valued measurement with variable coupling between the system and detector within free Fermion dynamics. This approach allows us to continuously track the universal properties of the transition between projective and continuous monitoring. Our findings suggest that the percolation universality of the transition in the projective limit is unstable when the system-detector coupling is reduced.</description>

      <title>Spectral Multifractality and Emergent Energyscales Across the Many-Body Localisation Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a scaling theory of the many-body localisation transition in terms of emergent, characteristic energyscales. The analysis is based on the decomposition of the eigenstates in the basis of trivially localised states, resolved in the energies of the latter, which we refer to as the spectral decomposition of the eigenstates. The characteristic energyscales emerge when the multifractal properties, or lack thereof, of the spectral decomposition are studied at different scales. These characteristic scales correspond to the ones, above which the spectral decompositions exhibit their global behaviour, namely full ergodicity in the ergodic phase and multifractality in the many-body localised phase. On the other hand, at scales below the characteristic ones, the decomposition in the ergodic phase shows finer (multi)fractal structures whereas in the localised phase, the decomposition picks out well-separated, localised resonant peaks. The scaling of these characteristic energyscales across the many-body localisation transition admits a scaling theory consistent with a Kosterlitz-Thouless type scenario and bears striking resemblances to that of inverse participation ratios of eigenstates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.07990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our research highlights the effectiveness of utilizing matrices akin to Wishart matrices, derived from magnetization time series data under specific dynamics, to elucidate phase transitions and critical phenomena in the Q-state Potts model. By employing appropriate statistical methods, we not only discern second-order transitions but also differentiate weaker first-order transitions through careful analysis of the density of eigenvalues and their fluctuations. Furthermore, we investigate the method's sensitivity to stronger first-order transition points. Importantly, we establish a robust correlation between the system's actual thermodynamics and the spectral thermodynamics encapsulated within the eigenvalues. Our findings are further substantiated by correlation histograms of the time series data, revealing insightful patterns. Expanding upon our core findings, we present a didactic analysis that draws parallels between the spectral properties of criticality in a spin system and matrices intentionally imbued with correlations (a toy model). Within this framework, we observe a universal behavior characterized by the distribution of eigenvalues into two distinct groups, separated by a gap dependent on the level of correlation, influenced by temperature-induced changes in the spin system.</description>

      <title>A Counterexample to the L\'evy Flight Foraging Hypothesis in the Narrow Capture Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.13976v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The L\'evy flight foraging hypothesis asserts that biological organisms have evolved to employ (truncated) L\'evy flight searches due to such strategies being more efficient than those based on Brownian motion. However, we provide here a concrete two-dimensional counterexample in which Brownian search is more efficient. In fact, we show that the efficiency of L\'evy searches worsens the farther the L\'evy flight tail index deviates from the Brownian limit. Our counterexample is based on the framework of the classic narrow capture problem in which a random search is performed for a small target within a confined search domain. Our results are obtained via three avenues: Monte Carlo simulations of the discrete search processes, finite difference solutions and a matched asymptotic analysis of the elliptic (pseudo)-differential equations of the corresponding continuum limits.</description>

      <title>Replica exchange of expanded ensembles: A generalized ensemble approach with enhanced flexibility and parallelizability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.06938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalized ensemble methods such as Hamiltonian replica exchange (HREX) and expanded ensemble (EE) have been shown effective in free energy calculations for various contexts, given their ability to circumvent free energy barriers via nonphysical pathways defined by states with different modified Hamiltonians. However, both HREX and EE methods come with drawbacks, such as limited flexibility in parameter specification, or the lack of parallelizability for more complicated applications. To address this challenge, we present the method of replica exchange of expanded ensembles (REXEE), which integrates the principles of HREX and EE methods by periodically exchanging coordinates of EE replicas sampling different yet overlapping sets of alchemical states. With the solvation free energy calculation of anthracene and binding free energy calculation of the CB7-10 binding complex, we show that the REXEE method achieves the same level of accuracy in free energy calculations as the HREX and EE methods, while offering enhanced flexibility and parallelizability. Additionally, we examined REXEE simulations with various setups to understand how different exchange frequencies and replica configurations influence the sampling efficiency in the fixed-weight phase and the weight convergence in the weight-updating phase. The REXEE approach can be further extended to support asynchronous parallelization schemes, allowing looser communications between larger numbers of loosely coupled processors such as cloud computing and therefore promising much more scalable and adaptive executions of alchemical free energy calculations. All algorithms for the REXEE method are available in the Python package ensemble_md, which offers an interface for REXEE simulation management without modifying the source code in GROMACS.</description>

      <title>Quantum propagating front and the edge of the Wigner function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the first part of the article, we study one-dimensional noninteracting fermions in the continuum and in the presence of the repulsive inverse power law potential, with an emphasis on the Wigner function in the semiclassical limit. In this limit, the Wigner function exhibits an edge called the Fermi surf that depends only on the classical one-particle Hamiltonian. Around the Fermi surf, under a well-defined semiclassical limit, the Wigner function can be expressed in terms of Airy functions which yield a smooth matching between the two regions delimited by the Fermi surf. In the second part of the article, the system is prepared in the ground state of the inverse power law potential where only the left half line is filled with fermions. Then the potential is switched off, resulting in the emergence of a propagating quantum front. We show that the power law decay of the pre-quench potential that separates the left and right half systems leads to the emergence of the Airy kernel (well known in Random Matrix Theory) at the quantum front in the long-time limit. This also comes with anomalous diffusive spreading around the front.</description>

      <title>Irreversibility as divergence from equilibrium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The entropy production is commonly used to gauge a system's distance from equilibrium, but this interpretation lacks a formal description due to the absence of a natural equilibrium measure. This analysis shows that the entropy production of a Markov system measures its separation from specific equilibrium dynamics. These reference dynamics correspond to the closest reversible systems in the information-theoretic sense. This result yields new lower bounds for the entropy production and novel links between thermodynamics and information geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.09150v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Depinning transitions occur when a threshold force must be applied to drive an otherwise immobile system. For the depinning of colloidal particles from a corrugated landscape, we show how active noise due to self-propulsion impacts the nature of this transition, depending on the speed and the dimensionality $d$ of rotational Brownian motion: the drift velocity exhibits the critical exponent 1/2 for quickly reorienting particles, which changes to $d/2$ for slow ones; in between these limits, the drift varies superexponentially. Different giant diffusion phenomena emerge in the two regimes. Our predictions extend to systems with a saddle-node bifurcation in the presence of a bounded noise. Moreover, our findings suggest that nonlinear responses are a sensitive probe of nonequilibrium behavior in active matter.</description>

      <title>Active fractal networks with stochastic force monopoles and force dipoles unravel subdiffusion of chromosomal loci</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the well-known fractal packing of chromatin, we study the Rouse-type dynamics of elastic fractal networks with embedded, stochastically driven, active force monopoles and force dipoles that are temporally correlated. We compute, analytically -- using a general theoretical framework -- and via Langevin dynamics simulations, the mean square displacement (MSD) of a network bead. Following a short-time superdiffusive behavior, force monopoles yield anomalous subdiffusion with an exponent identical to that of the thermal system. In contrast, force dipoles do not induce subdiffusion, and the early superdiffusive MSD crosses over to a relatively small, system-size-independent saturation value. In addition, we find that force dipoles may lead to ``crawling" rotational motion of the whole network, reminiscent of that found for triangular micro-swimmers and consistent with general theories of the rotation of deformable bodies. Moreover, force dipoles lead to network collapse beyond a critical force strength, which persists with increasing system size, signifying a true first-order dynamical phase transition. We apply our results to the motion of chromosomal loci in bacteria and yeast cells' chromatin, where anomalous sub-diffusion, MSD$\sim t^{\nu}$ with $\nu\simeq 0.4$, were found in both normal and ATP-depleted cells, albeit with different apparent diffusion coefficients. We show that the combination of thermal, monopolar, and dipolar forces in chromatin is typically dominated by the active monopolar and thermal forces, explaining the observed normal cells vs the ATP-depleted cells behavior.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous crumpling of active spherical shells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.06416v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existence of a crumpled phase for self-avoiding elastic surfaces was postulated more than three decades ago using simple Flory-like scaling arguments. Despite much effort, its stability in a microscopic environment has been the subject of much debate. In this paper we show how a crumpled phase develops reliably and consistently upon subjecting a thin spherical shell to active fluctuations. We find a master curve describing how the relative volume of a shell changes with the strength of the active forces, that applies for every shell independent of size and elastic constants. Furthermore, we extract a general expression for the onset active force beyond which a shell begins to crumple. Finally, we calculate how the size exponent varies along the crumpling curve.</description>

      <title>Glassy word problems: ultraslow relaxation, Hilbert space jamming, and computational complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a family of local models of dynamics based on ``word problems'' from computer science and group theory, for which we can place rigorous lower bounds on relaxation timescales. These models can be regarded either as random circuit or local Hamiltonian dynamics, and include many familiar examples of constrained dynamics as special cases. The configuration space of these models splits into dynamically disconnected sectors, and for initial states to relax, they must ``work out'' the other states in the sector to which they belong. When this problem has a high time complexity, relaxation is slow. In some of the cases we study, this problem also has high space complexity. When the space complexity is larger than the system size, an unconventional type of jamming transition can occur, whereby a system of a fixed size is not ergodic, but can be made ergodic by appending a large reservoir of sites in a trivial product state. This manifests itself in a new type of Hilbert space fragmentation that we call fragile fragmentation. We present explicit examples where slow relaxation and jamming strongly modify the hydrodynamics of conserved densities. In one example, density modulations of wavevector $q$ exhibit almost no relaxation until times $O(\exp(1/q))$, at which point they abruptly collapse. We also comment on extensions of our results to higher dimensions.</description>

Abstract: We construct $R$-matrices (with a multidimensional spectral parameter) that include additive as well as non-additive parameters. They satisfy the colored Yang-Baxter equation. The solutions depend on a set of commuting operators. They change with the representation of the latter. The associated Yang-Baxter algebra and the spectrum of the transfer matrix are also studied.</description>

      <title>Unified understanding of the breakdown of thermal mixing dynamic nuclear polarization: the role of temperature and radical concentration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reveal an interplay between temperature and radical concentration necessary to establish thermal mixing (TM) as an efficient dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) mechanism. We conducted DNP experiments by hyperpolarizing widely used DNP samples, i.e., sodium pyruvate-1-$^{13}$C in water/glycerol mixtures at varying nitroxide radical (TEMPOL) concentrations and microwave irradiation frequencies, measuring proton and carbon-13 spin temperatures. Using a cryogen consumption-free prototype-DNP apparatus, we could probe cryogenic temperatures between 1.5 and 6.5 K, i.e., below and above the boiling point of liquid helium. We identify two mechanisms for the breakdown of TM: (i) Anderson type of quantum localization for low radical concentration, or (ii) quantum Zeno localization occurring at high temperature. This observation allowed us to reconcile the recent diverging observations regarding the relevance of TM as a DNP mechanism by proposing a unifying picture and, consequently, to find a trade-off between radical concentration and electron relaxation times, which offers a pathway to improve experimental DNP performance based on TM.</description>

      <title>AdvNF: Reducing Mode Collapse in Conditional Normalising Flows using Adversarial Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15948v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep generative models complement Markov-chain-Monte-Carlo methods for efficiently sampling from high-dimensional distributions. Among these methods, explicit generators, such as Normalising Flows (NFs), in combination with the Metropolis Hastings algorithm have been extensively applied to get unbiased samples from target distributions. We systematically study central problems in conditional NFs, such as high variance, mode collapse and data efficiency. We propose adversarial training for NFs to ameliorate these problems. Experiments are conducted with low-dimensional synthetic datasets and XY spin models in two spatial dimensions.</description>

      <title>Neural population geometry and optimal coding of tasks with shared latent structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humans and animals can recognize latent structures in their environment and apply this information to efficiently navigate the world. However, it remains unclear what aspects of neural activity contribute to these computational capabilities. Here, we develop an analytical theory linking the geometry of a neural population's activity to the generalization performance of a linear readout on a set of tasks that depend on a common latent structure. We show that four geometric measures of the activity determine performance across tasks. Using this theory, we find that experimentally observed disentangled representations naturally emerge as an optimal solution to the multi-task learning problem. When data is scarce, these optimal neural codes compress less informative latent variables, and when data is abundant, they expand these variables in the state space. We validate our theory using macaque ventral stream recordings. Our results therefore tie population geometry to multi-task learning.</description>
