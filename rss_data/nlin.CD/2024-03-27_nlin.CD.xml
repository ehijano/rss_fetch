      <title>RLC resonator with diode nonlinearity: Bifurcation comparison of numerical predictions and circuit measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A nonlinear RLC resonator is investigated experimentally and numerically using bifurcation analysis. The nonlinearity is due to the parallel combination of a semiconductor rectifier diode and a fixed capacitor. The diode's junction capacitance, diffusion capacitance, and DC current-voltage relation each contribute to the nonlinearity. The closely related RL-diode resonator has been of interest for many years since its demonstration of period-doubling cascades to chaos. In this study a direct comparison is made of dynamical regime maps produced from simulations and circuit measurements. The maps show the variety of limit cycles, their bifurcations, and regions of chaos over the 2-d parameter space of the source voltage's frequency and amplitude. The similar structures of the simulated and experimental maps suggests that the diode models commonly used in circuit simulators (e.g., SPICE) work well in bifurcation analyses, successfully predicting complex and chaotic dynamics detected in the circuit. These results may be useful for applications of varactor-loaded split ring resonators.</description>

      <title>Critical Slowing Down in a Real Physical System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The behavior of a dynamical system can exhibit abrupt changes when it crosses a tipping point. To prevent catastrophic events, it is useful to analyze indicators of the incoming bifurcation, as the divergence of the relaxation time of the system when approaching the critical point. However, this phenomenon, called critical slowing down (CSD), is hardly measurable in real physical systems. In this paper we provide experimental evidence of CSD in a laser system crossing the emission threshold and we analyze how it is affected by a time changing parameter and by noise.</description>

      <title>Classical dynamics and semiclassical analysis of excitons in cuprous oxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Excitons, as bound states of electrons and holes, embody the solid state analogue of the hydrogen atom, whose quantum spectrum is explained within a classical framework by the Bohr-Sommerfeld atomic model. In a first hydrogenlike approximation the spectra of excitons are also well described by a Rydberg series, however, due to the surrounding crystal environment deviations from this series can be observed. A theoretical treatment of excitons in cuprous oxide needs to include the band structure of the crystal, leading to a prominent fine-structure splitting in the quantum spectra. This is achieved by introducing additional spin degrees of freedom into the system, making the existence and meaningfulness of classical exciton orbits in the physical system a non-trivial question. Recently, we have uncovered the contributions of periodic exciton orbits directly in the quantum mechanical recurrence spectra of cuprous oxide [J. Ertl et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 067401 (2022)] by application of a scaling technique and fixing the energy of the classical dynamics to a value corresponding to a principle quantum number $n=5$ in the hydrogenlike case. Here, we present a comprehensive derivation of the classical and semiclassical theory of excitons in cuprous oxide. In particular, we investigate the energy dependence of the exciton dynamics. Both the semiclassical and quantum mechanical recurrence spectra exhibit stronger deviations from the hydrogenlike behavior with decreasing energy, which is related to a growing influence of the spin-orbit coupling and thus a higher velocity of the secular motion of the exciton orbits. The excellent agreement between semiclassical and quantum mechanical exciton recurrence spectra demonstrates the validity of the classical and semiclassical approach to excitons in cuprous oxide.</description>

      <title>Natural convection in a vertical channel. Part 2. Oblique solutions and global bifurcations in a spanwise-extended domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vertical thermal convection is a non-equilibrium system in which both buoyancy and shear forces play a role in driving the convective flow. Beyond the onset of convection, the driven dissipative system exhibits chaotic dynamics and turbulence. In a three-dimensional domain extended in both the vertical and the transverse dimensions, Gao et al. (2018) have observed a variety of convection patterns which are not described by linear stability analysis. We investigate the fully non-linear dynamics of vertical convection using a dynamical-systems approach based on the Oberbeck-Boussinesq equations. We compute the invariant solutions of these equations and the bifurcations that are responsible for the creation and termination of various branches. We map out a sequence of local bifurcations from the laminar base state, including simultaneous bifurcations involving patterned steady states with different symmetries. This atypical phenomenon of multiple branches simultaneously bifurcating from a single parent branch is explained by the role of D4 symmetry. In addition, two global bifurcations are identified: first, a homoclinic cycle from modulated transverse rolls and second, a robust heteroclinic cycle linking two symmetry-related diamond-roll patterns. These are confirmed by phase space projections as well as the functional form of the divergence of the period close to the bifurcation points. The intricacy of this bifurcation diagram highlights the essential role played by dynamical systems theory and computation in hydrodynamic configurations.</description>

      <title>Spectral line shape in the limit of frequent velocity-changing collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The speed-dependent spectral line profiles collapse into a simple Lorentz profile in the regime dominated by the velocity-changing collisions. We derive general formulas for the effective width and shift of the Lorentzian for arbitrary speed-dependent collisional broadening and shift and velocity-changing collision operators. For a quadratic speed dependence of collisional broadening and shift, and the billiard ball model of velocity-changing collisions, we provide simple analytical expressions for the effective Lorentzian width and shift. We show that the effective Lorentzian width and shift split into components originating from the: well-known Dicke-narrowed Doppler width, speed-averaged collisional broadening and shift, their speed dependencies, and a product term that mixes the contributions of the broadening and shift speed dependencies. We show how the components depend on rates of speed-changing and velocity-changing collisions related to the perturber/absorber mass ratio. We validate analytical formulas numerically on example of H$_{2}$ transition perturbed by He.</description>
