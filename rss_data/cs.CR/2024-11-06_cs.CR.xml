      <title>Analysing the cultural dimensions of cybercriminal groups -- A case study on the Conti ransomware group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cybercriminal profiling and cyber-attack attribution have been elusive goals world-wide, due to their effects on societal and geopolitical balance and stability. Attributing actions to a group or state is a complex endeavour, with traditional established approaches including cyber threat intelligence and analysis of technical means such as malware analysis, network forensics and geopolitical intelligence. However, we propose an additional component for profiling threat actor groups through analysing cultural aspects of human behaviours and interactions. We utilise a set of variables which determine characteristics of national and organisational culture to create a cultural "footprint" of cybercriminal groups. As a case study, we conduct thematic analysis across the six dimensions of the Hofstede national culture classification and the eight dimensions of the Meyer classification on leaked internal communications of the ransomware group Conti. We propose that a systematic analysis of similar communications can serve as a practical tool for a) understanding the modus operandi of cybercrime and cyberwarfare-related groups, and b) profiling cybercriminal groups and/or nation-state actors. Insights from such applications can, first, assist in combating cybercrime and, second, if combined with additional cyber threat intelligence, can provide a level of confidence in nuanced cyber-attack attribution processes.</description>

      <title>Taming the Beast of User-Programmed Transactions on Blockchains: A Declarative Transaction Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blockchains are being positioned as the "technology of trust" that can be used to mediate transactions between non-trusting parties without the need for a central authority. They support transaction types that are native to the blockchain platform or user-defined via user programs called smart contracts. Despite the significant flexibility in transaction programmability that smart contracts offer, they pose several usability, robustness, and performance challenges.
  This paper proposes an alternative transaction framework that incorporates more primitives into the native set of transaction types (reducing the likelihood of requiring user-defined transaction programs often). The framework is based on the concept of declarative blockchain transactions whose strength lies in the fact that it addresses several of the limitations of smart contracts simultaneously. A formal and implementation framework is presented, and a subset of commonly occurring transaction behaviors are modeled and implemented as use cases, using an open-source blockchain database, BigchchainDB, as the implementation context. A performance study comparing the declarative transaction approach to equivalent smart contract transaction models reveals several advantages of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Efficacy of EPSS in High Severity CVEs found in KEV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS) is designed to assess the probability of a vulnerability being exploited in the next 30 days relative to other vulnerabilities. The latest version, based on a research paper published in arXiv, assists defenders in deciding which vulnerabilities to prioritize for remediation. This study evaluates EPSS's ability to predict exploitation before vulnerabilities are actively compromised, focusing on high severity CVEs that are known to have been exploited and included in the CISA KEV catalog. By analyzing EPSS score history, the availability and simplicity of exploits, the system's purpose, its value as a target for Threat Actors (TAs), this paper examines EPSS's potential and identifies areas for improvement.</description>

      <title>Fine Grained Insider Risk Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method to detect departures from business-justified workflows among support agents. Our goal is to assist auditors in identifying agent actions that cannot be explained by the activity within their surrounding context, where normal activity patterns are established from historical data. We apply our method to help audit millions of actions of over three thousand support agents.
  We collect logs from the tools used by support agents and construct a bipartite graph of Actions and Entities representing all the actions of the agents, as well as background information about entities. From this graph, we sample subgraphs rooted on security-significant actions taken by the agents. Each subgraph captures the relevant context of the root action in terms of other actions, entities and their relationships. We then prioritize the rooted-subgraphs for auditor review using feed-forward and graph neural networks, as well as nearest neighbors techniques. To alleviate the issue of scarce labeling data, we use contrastive learning and domain-specific data augmentations.
  Expert auditors label the top ranked subgraphs as ``worth auditing" or ``not worth auditing" based on the company's business policies. This system finds subgraphs that are worth auditing with high enough precision to be used in production.</description>

      <title>Visually Analyze SHAP Plots to Diagnose Misclassifications in ML-based Intrusion Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intrusion detection has been a commonly adopted detective security measures to safeguard systems and networks from various threats. A robust intrusion detection system (IDS) can essentially mitigate threats by providing alerts. In networks based IDS, typically we deal with cyber threats like distributed denial of service (DDoS), spoofing, reconnaissance, brute-force, botnets, and so on. In order to detect these threats various machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models have been proposed. However, one of the key challenges with these predictive approaches is the presence of false positive (FP) and false negative (FN) instances. This FPs and FNs within any black-box intrusion detection system (IDS) make the decision-making task of an analyst further complicated. In this paper, we propose an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) based visual analysis approach using overlapping SHAP plots that presents the feature explanation to identify potential false positive and false negatives in IDS. Our approach can further provide guidance to security analysts for effective decision-making. We present case study with multiple publicly available network traffic datasets to showcase the efficacy of our approach for identifying false positive and false negative instances. Our use-case scenarios provide clear guidance for analysts on how to use the visual analysis approach for reliable course-of-actions against such threats.</description>

      <title>FedBlock: A Blockchain Approach to Federated Learning against Backdoor Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a machine learning method for training with private data locally stored in distributed machines without gathering them into one place for central learning. Despite its promises, FL is prone to critical security risks. First, because FL depends on a central server to aggregate local training models, this is a single point of failure. The server might function maliciously. Second, due to its distributed nature, FL might encounter backdoor attacks by participating clients. They can poison the local model before submitting to the server. Either type of attack, on the server or the client side, would severely degrade learning accuracy. We propose FedBlock, a novel blockchain-based FL framework that addresses both of these security risks. FedBlock is uniquely desirable in that it involves only smart contract programming, thus deployable atop any blockchain network. Our framework is substantiated with a comprehensive evaluation study using real-world datasets. Its robustness against backdoor attacks is competitive with the literature of FL backdoor defense. The latter, however, does not address the server risk as we do.</description>

      <title>Brewing Vodka: Distilling Pure Knowledge for Lightweight Threat Detection in Audit Logs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are continuously evolving, leveraging their stealthiness and persistence to put increasing pressure on current provenance-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). This evolution exposes several critical issues: (1) The dense interaction between malicious and benign nodes within provenance graphs introduces neighbor noise, hindering effective detection; (2) The complex prediction mechanisms of existing APTs detection models lead to the insufficient utilization of prior knowledge embedded in the data; (3) The high computational cost makes detection impractical.
  To address these challenges, we propose Vodka, a lightweight threat detection system built on a knowledge distillation framework, capable of node-level detection within audit log provenance graphs. Specifically, Vodka applies graph Laplacian regularization to reduce neighbor noise, obtaining smoothed and denoised graph signals. Subsequently, Vodka employs a teacher model based on GNNs to extract knowledge, which is then distilled into a lightweight student model. The student model is designed as a trainable combination of a feature transformation module and a personalized PageRank random walk label propagation module, with the former capturing feature knowledge and the latter learning label and structural knowledge. After distillation, the student model benefits from the knowledge of the teacher model to perform precise threat detection. Finally, Vodka reconstructs attack paths from anomalous nodes, providing insight into the attackers' strategies. We evaluate Vodka through extensive experiments on three public datasets and compare its performance against several state-of-the-art IDS solutions. The results demonstrate that Vodka achieves outstanding detection accuracy across all scenarios and the detection time is 1.4 to 5.2 times faster than the current state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>TRANSPOSE: Transitional Approaches for Spatially-Aware LFI Resilient FSM Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finite state machines (FSMs) regulate sequential circuits, including access to sensitive information and privileged CPU states. Courtesy of contemporary research on laser attacks, laser-based fault injection (LFI) is becoming even more precise where an adversary can thwart chip security by altering individual flip-flop (FF) values. Different laser models, e.g., bit flip, bit set, and bit reset, have been developed to appreciate LFI on practical targets. As traditional approaches may incorporate substantial overhead, state-based SPARSE and transition-based TAMED countermeasures were proposed in our prior work to improve FSM resiliency efficiently. TAMED overcame SPARSE's limitation of being too conservative, and generating multiple LFI resilient encodings for contemporary LFI models on demand. SPARSE, however, incorporated design layout information into its vulnerability estimation which makes its vulnerability estimation metric more accurate. In this paper, we extend TAMED by proposing a transition-based encoding CAD framework (TRANSPOSE), that incorporates spatial transitional vulnerability metrics to quantify design susceptibility of FSMs based on both the bit flip model and the set-reset models. TRANSPOSE also incorporates floorplan optimization into its framework to accommodate secure spatial inter-distance of FF-sensitive regions. All TRANSPOSE approaches are demonstrated on 5 multifarious benchmarks and outperform existing FSM encoding schemes/frameworks in terms of security and overhead.</description>

      <title>NinjaDoH: A Censorship-Resistant Moving Target DoH Server Using Hyperscalers and IPNS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce NinjaDoH, a novel DNS over HTTPS (DoH) protocol that leverages the InterPlanetary Name System (IPNS), along with public cloud infrastructure, to create a censorship-resistant moving target DoH service. NinjaDoH is specifically designed to evade traditional censorship methods that involve blocking DoH servers by IP addresses or domains by continually altering the server's network identifiers, significantly increasing the complexity of effectively censoring NinjaDoH traffic without disruption of other web traffic. We also present an analysis that quantifies the DNS query latency and financial costs of running our implementation of this protocol as a service. Further tests assess the ability of NinjaDoH to elude detection mechanisms, including both commercial firewall products and advanced machine learning-based detection systems. The results broadly support NinjaDoH's efficacy as a robust, moving target DNS solution that can ensure continuous and secure internet access in environments with heavy DNS-based censorship.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Graph-Based Machine Learning with Fully Homomorphic Encryption for Collaborative Anti-Money Laundering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combating money laundering has become increasingly complex with the rise of cybercrime and digitalization of financial transactions. Graph-based machine learning techniques have emerged as promising tools for Anti-Money Laundering (AML) detection, capturing intricate relationships within money laundering networks. However, the effectiveness of AML solutions is hindered by data silos within financial institutions, limiting collaboration and overall efficacy. This research presents a novel privacy-preserving approach for collaborative AML machine learning, facilitating secure data sharing across institutions and borders while preserving privacy and regulatory compliance. Leveraging Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), computations are directly performed on encrypted data, ensuring the confidentiality of financial data. Notably, FHE over the Torus (TFHE) was integrated with graph-based machine learning using Zama Concrete ML. The research contributes two key privacy-preserving pipelines. First, the development of a privacy-preserving Graph Neural Network (GNN) pipeline was explored. Optimization techniques like quantization and pruning were used to render the GNN FHE-compatible. Second, a privacy-preserving graph-based XGBoost pipeline leveraging Graph Feature Preprocessor (GFP) was successfully developed. Experiments demonstrated strong predictive performance, with the XGBoost model consistently achieving over 99% accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall on the balanced AML dataset in both unencrypted and FHE-encrypted inference settings. On the imbalanced dataset, the incorporation of graph-based features improved the F1-score by 8%. The research highlights the need to balance the trade-off between privacy and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>FEDLAD: Federated Evaluation of Deep Leakage Attacks and Defenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning is a privacy preserving decentralized machine learning paradigm designed to collaboratively train models across multiple clients by exchanging gradients to the server and keeping private data local. Nevertheless, recent research has revealed that the security of Federated Learning is compromised, as private ground truth data can be recovered through a gradient inversion technique known as Deep Leakage. While these attacks are crafted with a focus on applications in Federated Learning, they generally are not evaluated in realistic scenarios. This paper introduces the FEDLAD Framework (Federated Evaluation of Deep Leakage Attacks and Defenses), a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating Deep Leakage attacks and defenses within a realistic Federated context. By implementing a unified benchmark that encompasses multiple state-of-the-art Deep Leakage techniques and various defense strategies, our framework facilitates the evaluation and comparison of the efficacy of these methods across different datasets and training states. This work highlights a crucial trade-off between privacy and model accuracy in Federated Learning and aims to advance the understanding of security challenges in decentralized machine learning systems, stimulate future research, and enhance reproducibility in evaluating Deep Leakage attacks and defenses.</description>

      <title>Flashy Backdoor: Real-world Environment Backdoor Attack on SNNs with DVS Cameras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While security vulnerabilities in traditional Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been extensively studied, the susceptibility of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) to adversarial attacks remains mostly underexplored. Until now, the mechanisms to inject backdoors into SNN models have been limited to digital scenarios; thus, we present the first evaluation of backdoor attacks in real-world environments.
  We begin by assessing the applicability of existing digital backdoor attacks and identifying their limitations for deployment in physical environments. To address each of the found limitations, we present three novel backdoor attack methods on SNNs, i.e., Framed, Strobing, and Flashy Backdoor. We also assess the effectiveness of traditional backdoor procedures and defenses adapted for SNNs, such as pruning, fine-tuning, and fine-pruning. The results show that while these procedures and defenses can mitigate some attacks, they often fail against stronger methods like Flashy Backdoor or sacrifice too much clean accuracy, rendering the models unusable.
  Overall, all our methods can achieve up to a 100% Attack Success Rate while maintaining high clean accuracy in every tested dataset. Additionally, we evaluate the stealthiness of the triggers with commonly used metrics, finding them highly stealthy. Thus, we propose new alternatives more suited for identifying poisoned samples in these scenarios. Our results show that further research is needed to ensure the security of SNN-based systems against backdoor attacks and their safe application in real-world scenarios. The code, experiments, and results are available in our repository.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Cybersecurity-Resilience Gap: An Analysis of Student Attitudes and Behaviors in Higher Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyberattacks frequently target higher educational institutions, making cybersecurity awareness and resilience critical for students. However, limited research exists on cybersecurity awareness, attitudes, and resilience among students in higher education. This study addresses this gap using the Theory of Planned Behavior as a theoretical framework. A modified Human Aspects of Information Security Questionnaire was employed to gather 266 valid responses from undergraduate and postgraduate students at a South African higher education institution. Key dimensions of cybersecurity awareness and behavior, including password management, email usage, social media practices, and mobile device security, were assessed. A significant disparity in cybersecurity awareness and practices, with postgraduate students demonstrating superior performance across several dimensions was noted. This research postulates the existence of a Cybersecurity-Education Inflection Point during the transition to postgraduate studies, coined as the Cybersecurity-Resilience Gap. These concepts provide a foundation for developing targeted cybersecurity education initiatives in higher education, particularly highlighting the need for earlier intervention at the undergraduate level.</description>

      <title>Formal Logic-guided Robust Federated Learning against Poisoning Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising solution to the privacy concerns associated with centralized Machine Learning (ML) by enabling decentralized, collaborative learning. However, FL is vulnerable to various security threats, including poisoning attacks, where adversarial clients manipulate the training data or model updates to degrade overall model performance. Recognizing this threat, researchers have focused on developing defense mechanisms to counteract poisoning attacks in FL systems. However, existing robust FL methods predominantly focus on computer vision tasks, leaving a gap in addressing the unique challenges of FL with time series data. In this paper, we present FLORAL, a defense mechanism designed to mitigate poisoning attacks in federated learning for time-series tasks, even in scenarios with heterogeneous client data and a large number of adversarial participants. Unlike traditional model-centric defenses, FLORAL leverages logical reasoning to evaluate client trustworthiness by aligning their predictions with global time-series patterns, rather than relying solely on the similarity of client updates. Our approach extracts logical reasoning properties from clients, then hierarchically infers global properties, and uses these to verify client updates. Through formal logic verification, we assess the robustness of each client contribution, identifying deviations indicative of adversarial behavior. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to existing baseline methods, highlighting its potential to enhance the robustness of FL to time series applications. Notably, FLORAL reduced the prediction error by 93.27\% in the best-case scenario compared to the second-best baseline.

      <title>Quantum-Computable One-Way Functions without One-Way Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a classical oracle relative to which $\mathsf{P} = \mathsf{NP}$ but quantum-computable quantum-secure trapdoor one-way functions exist. This is a substantial strengthening of the result of Kretschmer, Qian, Sinha, and Tal (STOC 2023), which only achieved single-copy pseudorandom quantum states relative to an oracle that collapses $\mathsf{NP}$ to $\mathsf{P}$. For example, our result implies multi-copy pseudorandom states and pseudorandom unitaries, but also classical-communication public-key encryption, signatures, and oblivious transfer schemes relative to an oracle on which $\mathsf{P}=\mathsf{NP}$. Hence, in our new relativized world, classical computers live in "Algorithmica" whereas quantum computers live in "Cryptomania," using the language of Impagliazzo's worlds.
  Our proof relies on a new distributional block-insensitivity lemma for $\mathsf{AC^0}$ circuits, wherein a single block is resampled from an arbitrary distribution.</description>

      <title>Relating Quantum Tamper-Evident Encryption to Other Cryptographic Notions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quantum tamper-evident encryption scheme is a non-interactive symmetric-key encryption scheme mapping classical messages to quantum ciphertexts such that an honest recipient of a ciphertext can detect with high probability any meaningful eavesdropping. This quantum cryptographic primitive was first introduced by Gottesman in 2003. Beyond formally defining this security notion, Gottesman's work had three main contributions: showing that any quantum authentication scheme is also a tamper-evident scheme, noting that a quantum key distribution scheme can be constructed from any tamper-evident scheme, and constructing a prepare-and-measure tamper-evident scheme using only Wiesner states inspired by Shor and Preskill's proof of security for the BB84 quantum key distribution scheme.
  In this work, we further our understanding of tamper-evident encryption by formally relating it to other cryptographic primitives in an information-theoretic setting. In particular, we show that tamper evidence implies encryption, answering a question left open by Gottesman, we show that it can be constructed from any encryption scheme with revocation and vice-versa, and we formalize an existing sketch of a construction of quantum money from any tamper-evident encryption scheme. These results also yield as a corollary that any scheme allowing the revocation of a message must be an encryption scheme. Finally, we show separations between tamper evidence and other primitives, notably that tamper evidence does not imply authentication and does not imply uncloneable encryption.</description>

      <title>Membership Inference Attacks against Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLLMs) exhibit promising capabilities for processing multi-modal tasks across various application scenarios. However, their emergence also raises significant data security concerns, given the potential inclusion of sensitive information, such as private photos and medical records, in their training datasets. Detecting inappropriately used data in VLLMs remains a critical and unresolved issue, mainly due to the lack of standardized datasets and suitable methodologies. In this study, we introduce the first membership inference attack (MIA) benchmark tailored for various VLLMs to facilitate training data detection. Then, we propose a novel MIA pipeline specifically designed for token-level image detection. Lastly, we present a new metric called MaxR\'enyi-K%, which is based on the confidence of the model output and applies to both text and image data. We believe that our work can deepen the understanding and methodology of MIAs in the context of VLLMs. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/LIONS-EPFL/VL-MIA.</description>

      <title>Region-Guided Attack on the Segment Anything Model (SAM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a cornerstone of image segmentation, demonstrating exceptional performance across various applications, particularly in autonomous driving and medical imaging, where precise segmentation is crucial. However, SAM is vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can significantly impair its functionality through minor input perturbations. Traditional techniques, such as FGSM and PGD, are often ineffective in segmentation tasks due to their reliance on global perturbations that overlook spatial nuances. Recent methods like Attack-SAM-K and UAD have begun to address these challenges, but they frequently depend on external cues and do not fully leverage the structural interdependencies within segmentation processes. This limitation underscores the need for a novel adversarial strategy that exploits the unique characteristics of segmentation tasks. In response, we introduce the Region-Guided Attack (RGA), designed specifically for SAM. RGA utilizes a Region-Guided Map (RGM) to manipulate segmented regions, enabling targeted perturbations that fragment large segments and expand smaller ones, resulting in erroneous outputs from SAM. Our experiments demonstrate that RGA achieves high success rates in both white-box and black-box scenarios, emphasizing the need for robust defenses against such sophisticated attacks. RGA not only reveals SAM's vulnerabilities but also lays the groundwork for developing more resilient defenses against adversarial threats in image segmentation.</description>

      <title>On the Detection of Non-Cooperative RISs: Scan B-Testing via Deep Support Vector Data Description</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of promptly detecting the presence of non-cooperative activity from one or more Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) with unknown characteristics lying in the vicinity of a Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) communication system using Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) transmissions. We first present a novel wideband channel model incorporating RISs as well as non-reconfigurable stationary surfaces, which captures both the effect of the RIS actuation time on the channel in the frequency domain as well as the difference between changing phase configurations during or among transmissions. Considering that RISs may operate under the coordination of a third-party system, and thus, may negatively impact the communication of the intended MIMO OFDM system, we present a novel RIS activity detection framework that is unaware of the distribution of the phase configuration of any of the non-cooperative RISs. In particular, capitalizing on the knowledge of the data distribution at the multi-antenna receiver, we design a novel online change point detection statistic that combines a deep support vector data description model with the scan $B$-test. The presented numerical investigations demonstrate the improved detection accuracy as well as decreased computational complexity of the proposed RIS detection approach over existing change point detection schemes.</description>

      <title>Oblivious Defense in ML Models: Backdoor Removal without Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As society grows more reliant on machine learning, ensuring the security of machine learning systems against sophisticated attacks becomes a pressing concern. A recent result of Goldwasser, Kim, Vaikuntanathan, and Zamir (2022) shows that an adversary can plant undetectable backdoors in machine learning models, allowing the adversary to covertly control the model's behavior. Backdoors can be planted in such a way that the backdoored machine learning model is computationally indistinguishable from an honest model without backdoors.
  In this paper, we present strategies for defending against backdoors in ML models, even if they are undetectable. The key observation is that it is sometimes possible to provably mitigate or even remove backdoors without needing to detect them, using techniques inspired by the notion of random self-reducibility. This depends on properties of the ground-truth labels (chosen by nature), and not of the proposed ML model (which may be chosen by an attacker).
  We give formal definitions for secure backdoor mitigation, and proceed to show two types of results. First, we show a "global mitigation" technique, which removes all backdoors from a machine learning model under the assumption that the ground-truth labels are close to a Fourier-heavy function. Second, we consider distributions where the ground-truth labels are close to a linear or polynomial function in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Here, we show "local mitigation" techniques, which remove backdoors with high probability for every inputs of interest, and are computationally cheaper than global mitigation. All of our constructions are black-box, so our techniques work without needing access to the model's representation (i.e., its code or parameters). Along the way we prove a simple result for robust mean estimation.</description>

      <title>Quantum One-Time Protection of any Randomized Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The meteoric rise in power and popularity of machine learning models dependent on valuable training data has reignited a basic tension between the power of running a program locally and the risk of exposing details of that program to the user. At the same time, fundamental properties of quantum states offer new solutions to data and program security that can require strikingly few quantum resources to exploit, and offer advantages outside of mere computational run time. In this work, we demonstrate such a solution with quantum one-time tokens.
  A quantum one-time token is a quantum state that permits a certain program to be evaluated exactly once. One-time security guarantees, roughly, that the token cannot be used to evaluate the program more than once. We propose a scheme for building quantum one-time tokens for any randomized classical program, which include generative AI models. We prove that the scheme satisfies an interesting definition of one-time security as long as outputs of the classical algorithm have high enough min-entropy, in a black box model.
  Importantly, the classical program being protected does not need to be implemented coherently on a quantum computer. In fact, the size and complexity of the quantum one-time token is independent of the program being protected, and additional quantum resources serve only to increase the security of the protocol. Due to this flexibility in adjusting the security, we believe that our proposal is parsimonious enough to serve as a promising candidate for a near-term useful demonstration of quantum computing in either the NISQ or early fault tolerant regime.</description>

      <title>LLMs for Domain Generation Algorithm Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work analyzes the use of large language models (LLMs) for detecting domain generation algorithms (DGAs). We perform a detailed evaluation of two important techniques: In-Context Learning (ICL) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), showing how they can improve detection. SFT increases performance by using domain-specific data, whereas ICL helps the detection model to quickly adapt to new threats without requiring much retraining. We use Meta's Llama3 8B model, on a custom dataset with 68 malware families and normal domains, covering several hard-to-detect schemes, including recent word-based DGAs. Results proved that LLM-based methods can achieve competitive results in DGA detection. In particular, the SFT-based LLM DGA detector outperforms state-of-the-art models using attention layers, achieving 94% accuracy with a 4% false positive rate (FPR) and excelling at detecting word-based DGA domains.</description>

      <title>Unclonable Cryptography with Unbounded Collusions and Impossibility of Hyperefficient Shadow Tomography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum no-cloning theorem gives rise to the intriguing possibility of quantum copy protection where we encode a program or functionality in a quantum state such that a user in possession of k copies cannot create k+1 copies, for any k. Introduced by Aaronson (CCC'09) over a decade ago, copy protection has proven to be notoriously hard to achieve. Previous work has been able to achieve copy-protection for various functionalities only in restricted models: (i) in the bounded collusion setting where k -&gt; k+1 security is achieved for a-priori fixed collusion bound k (in the plain model with the same computational assumptions as ours, by Liu, Liu, Qian, Zhandry [TCC'22]), or, (ii) only k -&gt; 2k security is achieved (relative to a structured quantum oracle, by Aaronson [CCC'09]).
  In this work, we give the first unbounded collusion-resistant (i.e. multiple-copy secure) copy-protection schemes, answering the long-standing open question of constructing such schemes, raised by multiple previous works starting with Aaronson (CCC'09).
  More specifically, we obtain the following results. - We construct (i) public-key encryption, (ii) public-key functional encryption, (iii) signature and (iv) pseudorandom function schemes whose keys are copy-protected against unbounded collusions in the plain model (i.e. without any idealized oracles), assuming (post-quantum) subexponentially secure iO and LWE.
  - We show that any unlearnable functionality can be copy-protected against unbounded collusions, relative to a classical oracle.
  - As a corollary of our results, we rule out the existence of hyperefficient quantum shadow tomography, * even given non-black-box access to the measurements, assuming subexponentially secure iO and LWE, or,
  * unconditionally relative to a quantumly accessible classical oracle, and hence answer an open question by Aaronson (STOC'18).</description>

      <title>An Interpretable Generalization Mechanism for Accurately Detecting Anomaly and Identifying Networking Intrusion Techniques</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), integrating Explainable AI (XAI) methodologies, have led to notable improvements in system performance via precise feature selection. However, a thorough understanding of cyber-attacks requires inherently explainable decision-making processes within IDS. In this paper, we present the Interpretable Generalization Mechanism (IG), poised to revolutionize IDS capabilities. IG discerns coherent patterns, making it interpretable in distinguishing between normal and anomalous network traffic. Further, the synthesis of coherent patterns sheds light on intricate intrusion pathways, providing essential insights for cybersecurity forensics. By experiments with real-world datasets NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and UKM-IDS20, IG is accurate even at a low ratio of training-to-test. With 10%-to-90%, IG achieves Precision (PRE)=0.93, Recall (REC)=0.94, and Area Under Curve (AUC)=0.94 in NSL-KDD; PRE=0.98, REC=0.99, and AUC=0.99 in UNSW-NB15; and PRE=0.98, REC=0.98, and AUC=0.99 in UKM-IDS20. Notably, in UNSW-NB15, IG achieves REC=1.0 and at least PRE=0.98 since 40%-to-60%; in UKM-IDS20, IG achieves REC=1.0 and at least PRE=0.88 since 20%-to-80%. Importantly, in UKM-IDS20, IG successfully identifies all three anomalous instances without prior exposure, demonstrating its generalization capabilities. These results and inferences are reproducible. In sum, IG showcases superior generalization by consistently performing well across diverse datasets and training-to-test ratios (from 10%-to-90% to 90%-to-10%), and excels in identifying novel anomalies without prior exposure. Its interpretability is enhanced by coherent evidence that accurately distinguishes both normal and anomalous activities, significantly improving detection accuracy and reducing false alarms, thereby strengthening IDS reliability and trustworthiness.</description>

      <title>Safe Unlearning: A Surprisingly Effective and Generalizable Solution to Defend Against Jailbreak Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LLMs are known to be vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, even after safety alignment. An important observation is that, while different types of jailbreak attacks can generate significantly different queries, they mostly result in similar responses that are rooted in the same harmful knowledge (e.g., detailed steps to make a bomb). Therefore, we conjecture that directly unlearn the harmful knowledge in the LLM can be a more effective way to defend against jailbreak attacks than the mainstream supervised fine-tuning (SFT) approaches. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the surprising generalizability of our unlearning-based approach: using only 20 raw harmful questions without any jailbreak prompt during training, our solution reduced the Attack Success Rate (ASR) in Vicuna-7B from 82.6% to 7.7% on out-of-distribution (OOD) harmful questions wrapped with various complex jailbreak prompts . This significantly outperforms Llama2-7B-Chat, which is fine-tuned on about 0.1M safety alignment samples but still has an ASR of 21.9% even under the help of an additional safety system prompt. Further analysis reveals that the generalization ability of our solution may stem from the intrinsic relatedness among harmful responses across harmful questions (e.g., response patterns, shared steps and actions in response, and similarity among their learned representations in the LLM). Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/thu-coai/SafeUnlearning}.</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient Transferable Preemptive Adversarial Defense</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15524v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning technology has brought convenience and advanced developments but has become untrustworthy because of its sensitivity to inconspicuous perturbations (i.e., adversarial attacks). Attackers may utilize this sensitivity to manipulate predictions. To defend against such attacks, we have devised a proactive strategy for "attacking" the medias before it is attacked by the third party, so that when the protected medias are further attacked, the adversarial perturbations are automatically neutralized. This strategy, dubbed Fast Preemption, provides an efficient transferable preemptive defense by using different models for labeling inputs and learning crucial features. A forward-backward cascade learning algorithm is used to compute protective perturbations, starting with forward propagation optimization to achieve rapid convergence, followed by iterative backward propagation learning to alleviate overfitting. This strategy offers state-of-the-art transferability and protection across various systems. With the running of only three steps, our Fast Preemption framework outperforms benchmark training-time, test-time, and preemptive adversarial defenses. We have also devised the first to our knowledge effective white-box adaptive reversion attack and demonstrate that the protection added by our defense strategy is irreversible unless the backbone model, algorithm, and settings are fully compromised. This work provides a new direction to developing proactive defenses against adversarial attacks. The proposed methodology will be made available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Beyond App Markets: Demystifying Underground Mobile App Distribution Via Telegram</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03482v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the thriving mobile app ecosystem ecosystem, a subset of apps provides illicit services such as gambling and pornography to pursue economic gains, collectively referred to as "underground economy apps". While previous studies have examined these apps' characteristics and identification methods, investigations into their distribution via platforms beyond app markets (like Telegram) remain scarce, which has emerged as a crucial channel for underground activities and cybercrime due to the robust encryption and user anonymity.
  This study provides the first comprehensive exploration of the underground mobile app ecosystem on Telegram. Overcoming the complexities of the Telegram environment, we build a novel dataset and analyze the prevalence, promotional strategies, and characteristics of these apps. Our findings reveal the significant prevalence of these apps on Telegram, with the total sum of subscription user numbers across channels promoting these apps equivalent to 1% of Telegram's user base. We find these apps primarily cater to gambling and pornography services. We uncover sophisticated promotional strategies involving complex networks of apps, websites, users, and channels, and identify significant gaps in Telegram's content moderation capabilities. Our analysis also exposes the misuse of iOS features for app distribution and the prevalence of malicious behaviors in these apps. This research not only enhances our understanding of the underground app ecosystem but also provides valuable insights for developing effective regulatory measures and protecting users from potential risks associated with these covert operations. Our findings provide implications for platform regulators, app market operators, law enforcement agencies, and cybersecurity professionals in combating the proliferation of underground apps on encrypted messaging platforms.</description>

      <title>Introducing Perturb-ability Score (PS) to Enhance Robustness Against Evasion Adversarial Attacks on ML-NIDS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As network security threats continue to evolve, safeguarding Machine Learning (ML)-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) from adversarial attacks is crucial. This paper introduces the notion of feature perturb-ability and presents a novel Perturb-ability Score (PS) metric that identifies NIDS features susceptible to manipulation in the problem-space by an attacker. By quantifying a feature's susceptibility to perturbations within the problem-space, the PS facilitates the selection of features that are inherently more robust against evasion adversarial attacks on ML-NIDS during the feature selection phase. These features exhibit natural resilience to perturbations, as they are heavily constrained by the problem-space limitations and correlations of the NIDS domain. Furthermore, manipulating these features may either disrupt the malicious function of evasion adversarial attacks on NIDS or render the network traffic invalid for processing (or both). This proposed novel approach employs a fresh angle by leveraging network domain constraints as a defense mechanism against problem-space evasion adversarial attacks targeting ML-NIDS. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our PS-guided feature selection defense in enhancing NIDS robustness. Experimental results across various ML-based NIDS models and public datasets show that selecting only robust features (low-PS features) can maintain solid detection performance while significantly reducing vulnerability to evasion adversarial attacks. Additionally, our findings verify that the PS effectively identifies NIDS features highly vulnerable to problem-space perturbations.</description>

      <title>Jailbreaking Large Language Models with Symbolic Mathematics</title>

Abstract: Recent advancements in AI safety have led to increased efforts in training and red-teaming large language models (LLMs) to mitigate unsafe content generation. However, these safety mechanisms may not be comprehensive, leaving potential vulnerabilities unexplored. This paper introduces MathPrompt, a novel jailbreaking technique that exploits LLMs' advanced capabilities in symbolic mathematics to bypass their safety mechanisms. By encoding harmful natural language prompts into mathematical problems, we demonstrate a critical vulnerability in current AI safety measures. Our experiments across 13 state-of-the-art LLMs reveal an average attack success rate of 73.6\%, highlighting the inability of existing safety training mechanisms to generalize to mathematically encoded inputs. Analysis of embedding vectors shows a substantial semantic shift between original and encoded prompts, helping explain the attack's success. This work emphasizes the importance of a holistic approach to AI safety, calling for expanded red-teaming efforts to develop robust safeguards across all potential input types and their associated risks.</description>

      <title>FoldMark: Protecting Protein Generative Models with Watermarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20354v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Protein structure is key to understanding protein function and is essential for progress in bioengineering, drug discovery, and molecular biology. Recently, with the incorporation of generative AI, the power and accuracy of computational protein structure prediction/design have been improved significantly. However, ethical concerns such as copyright protection and harmful content generation (biosecurity) pose challenges to the wide implementation of protein generative models. Here, we investigate whether it is possible to embed watermarks into protein generative models and their outputs for copyright authentication and the tracking of generated structures. As a proof of concept, we propose a two-stage method FoldMark as a generalized watermarking strategy for protein generative models. FoldMark first pretrain watermark encoder and decoder, which can minorly adjust protein structures to embed user-specific information and faithfully recover the information from the encoded structure. In the second step, protein generative models are fine-tuned with watermark Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules to preserve generation quality while learning to generate watermarked structures with high recovery rates. Extensive experiments are conducted on open-source protein structure prediction models (e.g., ESMFold and MultiFlow) and de novo structure design models (e.g., FrameDiff and FoldFlow) and we demonstrate that our method is effective across all these generative models. Meanwhile, our watermarking framework only exerts a negligible impact on the original protein structure quality and is robust under potential post-processing and adaptive attacks.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Markov Games: On Adaptive Decision-Based Attacks and Defenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite considerable efforts on making them robust, real-world ML-based systems remain vulnerable to decision based attacks, as definitive proofs of their operational robustness have so far proven intractable. The canonical approach in robustness evaluation calls for adaptive attacks, that is with complete knowledge of the defense and tailored to bypass it. In this study, we introduce a more expansive notion of being adaptive and show how attacks but also defenses can benefit by it and by learning from each other through interaction. We propose and evaluate a framework for adaptively optimizing black-box attacks and defenses against each other through the competitive game they form. To reliably measure robustness, it is important to evaluate against realistic and worst-case attacks. We thus augment both attacks and the evasive arsenal at their disposal through adaptive control, and observe that the same can be done for defenses, before we evaluate them first apart and then jointly under a multi-agent perspective. We demonstrate that active defenses, which control how the system responds, are a necessary complement to model hardening when facing decision-based attacks; then how these defenses can be circumvented by adaptive attacks, only to finally elicit active and adaptive defenses. We validate our observations through a wide theoretical and empirical investigation to confirm that AI-enabled adversaries pose a considerable threat to black-box ML-based systems, rekindling the proverbial arms race where defenses have to be AI-enabled too. Succinctly, we address the challenges posed by adaptive adversaries and develop adaptive defenses, thereby laying out effective strategies in ensuring the robustness of ML-based systems deployed in the real-world.</description>

      <title>Federated Unlearning: A Survey on Methods, Design Guidelines, and Evaluation Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05146v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training of a machine learning (ML) model across multiple parties, facilitating the preservation of users' and institutions' privacy by maintaining data stored locally. Instead of centralizing raw data, FL exchanges locally refined model parameters to build a global model incrementally. While FL is more compliant with emerging regulations such as the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), ensuring the right to be forgotten in this context - allowing FL participants to remove their data contributions from the learned model - remains unclear. In addition, it is recognized that malicious clients may inject backdoors into the global model through updates, e.g., to generate mispredictions on specially crafted data examples. Consequently, there is the need for mechanisms that can guarantee individuals the possibility to remove their data and erase malicious contributions even after aggregation, without compromising the already acquired "good" knowledge. This highlights the necessity for novel federated unlearning (FU) algorithms, which can efficiently remove specific clients' contributions without full model retraining. This article provides background concepts, empirical evidence, and practical guidelines to design/implement efficient FU schemes. This study includes a detailed analysis of the metrics for evaluating unlearning in FL and presents an in-depth literature review categorizing state-of-the-art FU contributions under a novel taxonomy. Finally, we outline the most relevant and still open technical challenges, by identifying the most promising research directions in the field.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Graph Diffusion with Applications in Personalized PageRanks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00077v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph diffusion, which iteratively propagates real-valued substances among the graph, is used in numerous graph/network-involved applications. However, releasing diffusion vectors may reveal sensitive linking information in the data such as transaction information in financial network data. However, protecting the privacy of graph data is challenging due to its interconnected nature. This work proposes a novel graph diffusion framework with edge-level differential privacy guarantees by using noisy diffusion iterates. The algorithm injects Laplace noise per diffusion iteration and adopts a degree-based thresholding function to mitigate the high sensitivity induced by low-degree nodes. Our privacy loss analysis is based on Privacy Amplification by Iteration (PABI), which to our best knowledge, is the first effort that analyzes PABI with Laplace noise and provides relevant applications. We also introduce a novel Infinity-Wasserstein distance tracking method, which tightens the analysis of privacy leakage and makes PABI more applicable in practice. We evaluate this framework by applying it to Personalized Pagerank computation for ranking tasks. Experiments on real-world network data demonstrate the superiority of our method under stringent privacy conditions.</description>

      <title>Privacy of the last iterate in cyclically-sampled DP-SGD on nonconvex composite losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05237v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differentially-private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) is a family of iterative machine learning training algorithms that privatize gradients to generate a sequence of differentially-private (DP) model parameters. It is also the standard tool used to train DP models in practice, even though most users are only interested in protecting the privacy of the final model. Tight DP accounting for the last iterate would minimize the amount of noise required while maintaining the same privacy guarantee and potentially increasing model utility. However, last-iterate accounting is challenging, and existing works require strong assumptions not satisfied by most implementations. These include assuming (i) the global sensitivity constant is known - to avoid gradient clipping; (ii) the loss function is Lipschitz or convex; and (iii) input batches are sampled randomly.
  In this work, we forego any unrealistic assumptions and provide privacy bounds for the most commonly used variant of DP-SGD, in which data is traversed cyclically, gradients are clipped, and only the last model is released. More specifically, we establish new Renyi differential privacy (RDP) upper bounds for the last iterate under realistic assumptions of small stepsize and Lipschitz smoothness of the loss function. Our general bounds also recover the special-case convex bounds when the weak-convexity parameter of the objective function approaches zero and no clipping is performed. The approach itself leverages optimal transport techniques for last iterate bounds, which is a nontrivial task when the data is traversed cyclically and the loss function is nonconvex.</description>

      <title>Privacy Risks of Speculative Decoding in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speculative decoding in large language models (LLMs) accelerates token generation by speculatively predicting multiple tokens cheaply and verifying them in parallel, and has been widely deployed. In this paper, we provide the first study demonstrating the privacy risks of speculative decoding. We observe that input-dependent patterns of correct and incorrect predictions can be leaked out to an adversary monitoring token generation times and packet sizes, leading to privacy breaches. By observing the pattern of correctly and incorrectly speculated tokens, we show that a malicious adversary can fingerprint queries and learn private user inputs with more than $90\%$ accuracy across three different speculative decoding techniques - REST (almost $100\%$ accuracy), LADE (up to $92\%$ accuracy), and BiLD (up to $95\%$ accuracy). We show that an adversary can also leak out confidential intellectual property used to design these techniques, such as data from data-stores used for prediction (in REST) at a rate of more than $25$ tokens per second, or even hyper-parameters used for prediction (in LADE). We also discuss mitigation strategies, such as aggregating tokens across multiple iterations and padding packets with additional bytes, to avoid such privacy or confidentiality breaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of quantum technologies calls for the design and deployment of quantum-safe cryptographic protocols and communication networks. There are two primary approaches to achieving quantum-resistant security: quantum key distribution (QKD) and post-quantum cryptography (PQC). While each offers unique advantages, both have drawbacks in practical implementation. In this work, we introduce the pros and cons of these protocols and explore how they can be combined to achieve a higher level of security and/or improved performance in key distribution. We hope our discussion inspires further research into the design of hybrid cryptographic protocols for quantum-classical communication networks.</description>

      <title>Practical hybrid PQC-QKD protocols with enhanced security and performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum resistance is vital for emerging cryptographic systems as quantum technologies continue to advance towards large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computers. Resistance may be offered by quantum key distribution (QKD), which provides information-theoretic security using quantum states of photons, but may be limited by transmission loss at long distances. An alternative approach uses classical means and is conjectured to be resistant to quantum attacks, so-called post-quantum cryptography (PQC), but it is yet to be rigorously proven, and its current implementations are computationally expensive. To overcome the security and performance challenges present in each, here we develop hybrid protocols by which QKD and PQC inter-operate within a joint quantum-classical network. In particular, we consider different hybrid designs that may offer enhanced speed and/or security over the individual performance of either approach. Furthermore, we present a method for analyzing the security of hybrid protocols in key distribution networks. Our hybrid approach paves the way for joint quantum-classical communication networks, which leverage the advantages of both QKD and PQC and can be tailored to the requirements of various practical networks.</description>
