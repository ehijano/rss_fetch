      <title>Understanding the two-step nucleation of iron at Earth's inner core conditions: a comparative molecular dynamics study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metastable phases can lead to multistep nucleation processes, influencing the liquid-to-solid transition in various systems. In this study, we investigate the homogeneous nucleation of iron's crystalline phases under Earth's inner core conditions, employing two previously developed interatomic potentials. We compare the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of iron relevant to the nucleation as predicted by these potentials. While the potentials differ in their predictions of melting temperature by a few hundred Kelvin, they show a consistent description of the relative Gibbs free energy between solid and liquid phases with respect to the undercooling. Both potentials also predict that the metastable bcc phase exhibits a significantly higher nucleation rate than the hcp phase over a wide range of undercooling temperatures below the melting point. This substantially lowers the undercooling thresholds required for the initial nucleation of Earth's inner core. The results validate the commonality of the two-step nucleation mechanism of iron under Earth's inner core conditions for two different potentials, providing a foundation for future studies about the influence of other elements on the nucleation of Earth's core.</description>

      <title>Fourier Neural Operator based surrogates for $CO_2$ storage in realistic geologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study aims to develop surrogate models for accelerating decision making processes associated with carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies. Selection of sub-surface $CO_2$ storage sites often necessitates expensive and involved simulations of $CO_2$ flow fields. Here, we develop a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) based model for real-time, high-resolution simulation of $CO_2$ plume migration. The model is trained on a comprehensive dataset generated from realistic subsurface parameters and offers $O(10^5)$ computational acceleration with minimal sacrifice in prediction accuracy. We also explore super-resolution experiments to improve the computational cost of training the FNO based models. Additionally, we present various strategies for improving the reliability of predictions from the model, which is crucial while assessing actual geological sites. This novel framework, based on NVIDIA's Modulus library, will allow rapid screening of sites for CCS. The discussed workflows and strategies can be applied to other energy solutions like geothermal reservoir modeling and hydrogen storage. Our work scales scientific machine learning models to realistic 3D systems that are more consistent with real-life subsurface aquifers/reservoirs, paving the way for next-generation digital twins for subsurface CCS applications.</description>
