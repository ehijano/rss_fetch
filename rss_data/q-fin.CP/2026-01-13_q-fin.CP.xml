      <title>The Limits of Complexity: Why Feature Engineering Beats Deep Learning in Investor Flow Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of machine learning to financial prediction has accelerated dramatically, yet the conditions under which complex models outperform simple alternatives remain poorly understood. This paper investigates whether advanced signal processing and deep learning techniques can extract predictive value from investor order flows beyond what simple feature engineering achieves. Using a comprehensive dataset of 2.79 million observations spanning 2,439 Korean equities from 2020--2024, we apply three methodologies: \textit{Independent Component Analysis} (ICA) to recover latent market drivers, \textit{Wavelet Coherence} analysis to characterize multi-scale correlation structure, and \textit{Long Short-Term Memory} (LSTM) networks with attention mechanisms for non-linear prediction. Our results reveal a striking finding: a parsimonious linear model using market capitalization-normalized flows (``Matched Filter'' preprocessing) achieves a Sharpe ratio of 1.30 and cumulative return of 272.6\%, while the full ICA-Wavelet-LSTM pipeline generates a Sharpe ratio of only 0.07 with a cumulative return of $-5.1\%$. The raw LSTM model collapsed to predicting the unconditional mean, achieving a hit rate of 47.5\% -- worse than random. We conclude that in low signal-to-noise financial environments, domain-specific feature engineering yields substantially higher marginal returns than algorithmic complexity. These findings establish important boundary conditions for the application of deep learning to financial prediction.</description>

      <title>Non-Convex Portfolio Optimization via Energy-Based Models: A Comparative Analysis Using the Thermodynamic HypergRaphical Model Library (THRML) for Index Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Portfolio optimization under cardinality constraints transforms the classical Markowitz mean-variance problem from a convex quadratic problem into an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. This paper introduces a novel approach using THRML (Thermodynamic HypergRaphical Model Library), a JAX-based library for building and sampling probabilistic graphical models that reformulates index tracking as probabilistic inference on an Ising Hamiltonian. Unlike traditional methods that seek a single optimal solution, THRML samples from the Boltzmann distribution of high-quality portfolios using GPU-accelerated block Gibbs sampling, providing natural regularization against overfitting.
  We implement three key innovations: (1) dynamic coupling strength that scales inversely with market volatility (VIX), adapting diversification pressure to market regimes; (2) rebalanced bias weights prioritizing tracking quality over momentum for index replication; and (3) sector-aware post-processing ensuring institutional-grade diversification. Backtesting on a 100-stock S and P 500 universe from 2023 to 2025 demonstrates that THRML achieves 4.31 percent annualized tracking error versus 5.66 to 6.30 percent for baselines, while simultaneously generating 128.63 percent total return against the index total return of 79.61 percent. The Diebold-Mariano test confirms statistical significance with p less than 0.0001 across all comparisons. These results position energy-based models as a promising paradigm for portfolio construction, bridging statistical mechanics and quantitative finance.</description>

      <title>OrderFusion: Encoding Orderbook for End-to-End Probabilistic Intraday Electricity Price Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06830v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Probabilistic intraday electricity price forecasting is becoming increasingly important with the growth of renewable generation and the rise in demand-side engagement. Their uncertainties have increased the trading risks closer to delivery and the subsequent imbalance settlement costs. As a consequence, intraday trading has emerged to mitigate these risks. Unlike auction markets, intraday trading in many jurisdictions is characterized by the continuous posting of buy and sell orders on power exchange platforms. This dynamic orderbook microstructure of price formation presents special challenges for price forecasting. Conventional methods represent the orderbook via domain features aggregated from buy and sell trades, or by treating it as a multivariate time series, but such representations neglect the full buy-sell interaction structure of the orderbook. This research therefore develops a new order fusion methodology, which is an end-to-end and parameter-efficient probabilistic forecasting model that learns a full interaction-aware representation of the buy-sell dynamics. Furthermore, as quantile crossing is often a problem in probabilistic forecasting, this approach hierarchically estimates the quantiles with non-crossing constraints. Extensive experiments on the market price indices across high-liquidity (German) and low-liquidity (Austrian) markets demonstrate consistent improvements over conventional baselines, and ablation studies highlight the contributions of the main modeling components. The methodology is available at: https://runyao-yu.github.io/OrderFusion/.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning for Optimum Order Execution: Mitigating Risk and Maximizing Returns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimal Order Execution is a well-established problem in finance that pertains to the flawless execution of a trade (buy or sell) for a given volume within a specified time frame. This problem revolves around optimizing returns while minimizing risk, yet recent research predominantly focuses on addressing one aspect of this challenge. In this paper, we introduce an innovative approach to Optimal Order Execution within the US market, leveraging Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to effectively address this optimization problem holistically. Our study assesses the performance of our model in comparison to two widely employed execution strategies: Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) and Time Weighted Average Price (TWAP). Our experimental findings clearly demonstrate that our DRL-based approach outperforms both VWAP and TWAP in terms of return on investment and risk management. The model's ability to adapt dynamically to market conditions, even during periods of market stress, underscores its promise as a robust solution.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Error Analysis of Multilevel Stochastic Approximations for the Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15333v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cr\'epey, Frikha, and Louzi (2023) introduced a nested stochastic approximation algorithm and its multilevel acceleration to compute the value-at-risk and expected shortfall of a random financial loss. We hereby establish central limit theorems for the renormalized estimation errors associated with both algorithms as well as their averaged versions. Our findings are substantiated through a numerical example.</description>

      <title>Black-Scholes Model, comparison between Analytical Solution and Numerical Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main purpose of this article is to give a general overview and understanding of the first widely used option-pricing model, the Black-Scholes model. The history and context are presented, with the usefulness and implications in the economics world. A brief review of fundamental calculus concepts is introduced to derive and solve the model. The equation is then resolved using both an analytical (variable separation) and a numerical method (finite differences). Conclusions are drawn in order to understand how Black-Scholes is employed nowadays. At the end a handy appendix (A) is written with some economics notions to ease the reader's comprehension of the paper; furthermore a second appendix (B) is given with some code scripts, to allow the reader to put in practice some concepts.</description>
