      <title>Modeling phononic band gap in microstructured solids using the Riemann-Cartan geometric framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling acoustic wave fields in microstructured elastic solids is discussed in the context of the Riemann-Cartan geometry. We consider a scenario where microstructural deformations occur much faster than those of the bulk material. This time-scale separation creates apparent geometric incompatibilities at the macroscopic level, even without any permanent inelastic deformation (at micro or macro-scale) or damage. We formalize this phenomenon using the concept of a non-holonomic tetrads to represent the macroscopic elastic deformations and the associated torsion field to characterize the resulting geometric incompatibilities. The spatial components of the torsion tensor quantify the instantaneous geometric incompatibility of the macroscopic elastic deformations, while its time components capture the inertial effects arising from the reversible energy exchange between the micro and macro scales. A key finding is that the model's dispersion relation predicts the existence of a complete frequency band gap. Furthermore, the governing equations exhibit a notable mathematical analogy to Maxwell's equations which can link the modeling of phononic and photonic metamaterials.</description>

      <title>10-plectic formulation of gravity and Cartan connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a Hamiltonian formulation of %the first order Weyl--Einstein--Cartan gravity which is covariant from the viewpoint of the geometry of the principal fiber bundle. The connection is represented by a $1$-form with values in the Poincar\'{e} Lie algebra, which is defined on the total space of the orthonormal frame bundle fibered over the space-time. Within the $10$-plectic framework we discover that the local equivariance property of the Cartan connection is a consequence of the Hamilton equations.</description>

      <title>An Operator-Algebraic Framework for Anyons and Defects in Quantum Spin Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this dissertation, we detail an operator algebraic approach to studying topological order in the infinite volume setting. We give a thorough and self-contained review of the DHR-style approach on quantum spin systems, which builds a category $\mathrm{\textbf{DHR}}$ of anyon sectors starting from microscopic lattice spin systems. In general, this category has the structure of a braided $\mathrm{C}^*$-tensor category. We will verify in full detail that $\mathrm{\textbf{DHR}}$ is the expected category in Kitaev's Quantum Double model, a paradigmatic model for studying topological order on the lattice. We will then extend the DHR-style analysis to systems in the presence of a global on-site symmetry, and introduce a category of symmetry defects, $G\mathsf{Sec}$, and show that it has the structure of a $G$-crossed braided $\mathrm{C}^*$-tensor category.</description>

      <title>The Self-Duality Equations on a Riemann Surface and Four-Dimensional Chern-Simons Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a Lagrangian formulation of Hitchin's self-duality equations on a Riemann surface $\Sigma$ using potentials for the connection and Higgs field. This two-dimensional action is then obtained from a four-dimensional Chern-Simons theory on $\Sigma\times \mathbb{CP}^1$ with an appropriate choice of meromorphic 1-form on $\mathbb{CP}^1$ and boundary conditions at its poles. We show that the symplectic structure induced by the four-dimensional theory coincides with the canonical symplectic form on the Hitchin moduli space in the complex structure corresponding to the moduli space of Higgs bundles. We further provide a direct construction of Hitchin Hamiltonians in terms of the four-dimensional gauge field. Exploiting the freedom in the choice of the meromorphic one-form, we construct a family of four-dimensional Chern-Simons theories depending on a $\mathbb{CP}^1$-valued parameter. Upon reduction to two dimensions, these descend to a corresponding family of two-dimensional actions on $\Sigma$ whose field equations are again Hitchin's equations. Furthermore, we obtain a family of symplectic structures from our family of four-dimensional theories and show that they agree with the hyperk\"ahler family of symplectic forms on the Hitchin moduli space, thereby identifying the $\mathbb{CP}^1$-valued parameter with the twistor parameter of the Hitchin moduli space. Our results place Hitchin's equations and their integrable structure within the framework of four-dimensional Chern-Simons theory and make the role of the twistor parameter manifest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give graphical presentations for the two quantum subgroups of type $G_2$. To do this we use a method of extending a tensor category by embedding the planar algebra of a $\otimes$-generating object into the graph planar algebra of this object's fundamental graph. This allows the use of computational methods to uncover relations we would have little hope of arriving at otherwise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the Segal-Bargmann representation, a generalized Rabi model is considered that includes both two-photon and asymmetric terms. It is shown that, through a suitable transformation, nearly exact solutions can be obtained using the Bethe ansatz approach. Applying this approach to the meromorphic structure of the resulting differential equation, solutions in exact analytical form of the fourth-order problem are presented for both an arbitrary state and for the restriction between the parameters.</description>

      <title>A Unified Spectral Framework for Aging, Heterogeneous, and Distributed Order Systems via Weighted Weyl-Sonine Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard fractional calculus has successfully modeled systems with power-law memory. However, complex phenomena in heterogeneous media often exhibit multi-scale memory effects and aging properties that classical operators cannot capture. In this work, we construct a unified framework by defining the \textit{Weighted Weyl-Sonine Operators}. This formalism offers a fundamental generalization of fractional calculus, freeing the theory from the constraints of power-law memory (via Sonine kernels), time-translation invariance (via scale and weight functions), and artificial history truncation (via Weyl integration).
  The main result is a Generalized Spectral Mapping Theorem, proving that the Weighted Fourier Transform acts as a universal diagonalization map for these operators. We rigorously characterize the admissible memory kernels through the class of \textit{Complete Bernstein Functions}, ensuring that the resulting operators preserve the fundamental properties of positivity and monotonicity. Furthermore, we establish a theoretical bridge between the algebraic Sonine definition and the analytical Marchaud representation involving L\'evy measures.
  Finally, we apply this theory to solve generalized relaxation equations and \textit{Weighted Distributed Order} evolution problems, demonstrating that phenomena of ultra-slow diffusion and retarded aging can be treated explicitly within this unified spectral framework.</description>

      <title>Fully local Reshetikhin-Turaev theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a symmetric tensor enhancement $\mathrm{E}\mathbb{F}$ with full duals of the 3-category $\mathbb{F}$ of fusion categories in which every Reshetikhin--Turaev theory has a fully local realization. Our $\mathrm{E}\mathbb{F}$ is a direct sum of invertible $\mathbb{F}$-modules, indexed by a $\mu_6$-extension of the Witt group $W$ of non-degenerate braided fusion categories. Similarly, we enhance the 3-category $S\mathbb{F}$ of fusion super-categories to a symmetric tensor 3-category $\mathrm{E} S\mathbb{F}$ with full duals, which is a sum of invertible $S\mathbb{F}$-modules, indexed by an extension of the super-Witt group $SW$ with kernel the Pontrjagin dual of the stable stem $\pi_3^s$. The unit spectrum of $\mathrm{E}S\mathbb{F}$ is the connective cover of the Pontrjagin dual of $\mathbb{S}^{-3}$. We discuss tangential structures and central charges of the resulting TQFTs. We establish Spin-invariance of fusion supercategories and relate SO-invariance structures to modular and spherical structures. This confirms some conjectures from arxiv:1312.7188.</description>

      <title>On consistency around a $3 \times 3\times 3$ cube and Q3 analogue of the lattice Boussinesq equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present two new aspects of lattice Boussinesq (BSQ) equations. First, we show that the lattice potential BSQ (lpBSQ) equation defined on a nine-point square lattice admits a natural extension of three-dimensional consistency to a $3\times 3\times 3$ cube\textemdash a cubic sublattice consisting of $27$ vertices. This extends the standard notion of three-dimensional consistency (defined on an elementary $2\times 2\times 2$ vertex cube for quadrilateral equations) to the non-quadrilateral, nine-point setting. Second, we construct a new three-component system which is referred to as the {\em lattice BSQ-Q3 system}, serving as the BSQ analogue of the Q3($\delta$) equation in the Adler-Bobenko-Suris (ABS) classification. The construction relies on a gauge transformation between Lax pairs of lpBSQ with the parameter $\delta$ arising from a $GL_3$ action. In a degeneration form, the system yields a $PGL_3$-invariant integrable lattice equation that generalises the $PGL_2$-invariant Schwarzian BSQ equation.</description>

      <title>Dimension gap and phase transition for one-dimensional random walks with reflective boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study $\mathbb Z$- and $\mathbb N$-extensions of interval maps with at most countably many full branches modelling one-dimensional random walks without and with a reflective boundary. We analyse the associated Gurevich pressure and explore the relations governing these two cases. For such extensions, we obtain variational formulae for the Gurevich pressure that depend only on the base system. As a consequence, we characterise the systems with a dimension gap and, in the presence of a reflective boundary, provide general conditions in terms of asymptotic covariances for a second order phase transition. As a by-product, we derive a variational formula for the spectral radius of infinite Hessenberg matrices.</description>

      <title>Metastable opinion dynamics with hidden preferences: an Ising model with neutral agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new Ising-type framework for opinion dynamics that explicitly separates private preferences from publicly expressed binary opinions and naturally incorporates neutral agents. Each individual is endowed with an immutable hidden preference, while public opinions evolve through Metropolis dynamics on a finite graph. This formulation extends classical sociophysical Ising models by capturing the tension between internal conviction, social conformity, and neutrality. Focusing on highly symmetric grid networks and spatially structured hidden-preference patterns, we analyze the resulting low-temperature dynamics using the pathwise approach to metastability. We provide a complete characterization of stable and metastable configurations, identify the maximal stability level of the energy landscape, and derive sharp asymptotics for hitting and mixing times. A central technical contribution is a new family of isoperimetric inequalities for polyominoes on the torus, which emerge from a geometric representation of opinion clusters and play a key role in determining critical configurations and energy barriers. Our results provide a quantitative understanding of how spatial heterogeneity in hidden preferences qualitatively reshapes collective opinion transitions and illustrate the power of geometric and probabilistic methods in the study of complex interacting systems.</description>

      <title>Covariant Lyapunov vectors as global solutions of a partial differential equation on the phase space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.12543v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a new tool to describe the behaviour of a dynamical system, we introduce the concept of "covariant Lyapunov field", i.e. a field which assigns all the components of covariant Lyapunov vectors at almost all points of the phase space. We focus on the case in which these fields are overall continuous and also differentiable along individual trajectories. We show that in ergodic systems such fields can be characterized as the global solutions of a differential equation on the phase space. Due to the arbitrariness in the choice of a multiplicative scalar factor for the Lyapunov vector at each point of the phase space, this differential equation exhibits a gauge invariance that is formally analogous to that of quantum electrodynamics. Under the hypothesis that the covariant Lyapunov field is overall differentiable, we give a geometric interpretation of our result: each 2-dimensional foliation of the space that contains whole trajectories is univocally associated with a Lyapunov exponent, and the corresponding covariant Lyapunov field is one of the generators of the foliation. In order to show with an example how this new approach can be applied to the study of concrete dynamical systems, we display an explicit solution of the differential equations that we have obtained for the covariant Lyapunov fields in a model involving a geodesic flow.</description>

      <title>Twists of superconformal algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19753v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We take first steps toward a theory of ``conformal twists'' for superconformal field theories in dimension 3 to 6, extending the well-known analysis of twists for supersymmetric theories. A conformal twist is a square-zero odd element in the superconformal Lie algebra, and we classify all twists and describe their orbits under the adjoint action of the superconformal group. We work mostly with the complexified superconformal algebras, unless explicitly stated otherwise; real forms of the superconformal algebra may have important physical implications, but we only discuss these subtleties in a few special cases. Conformal twists can give rise to interesting subalgebras and protected sectors of operators in a superconformal field theory, with the Donaldson--Witten topological field theory and the vertex operator algebras of 4-dimensional N=2 SCFTs being prominent examples. To obtain mathematical precision, we explain how to extract vertex algebras and E_n algebras from a twisted superconformal field theory using factorization algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.08672v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the large time asymptotic behavior of solutions to the linearized Vlasov-Poisson system near general spatially homogenous equilibria $\mu(\frac12|v|^2)$ with connected support on the torus $\mathbb{T}^3_x \times \mathbb{R}^3_v$ or on the whole space $\mathbb{R}^3_x \times \mathbb{R}^3_v$, including those that are non-monotone. The problem can be solved completely mode by mode for each spatial wave number, and their longtime dynamics is intimately tied to the ``survival threshold'' of wave numbers computed by $$\kappa_0^2 = 4\pi \int_0^\Upsilon \frac{u^2\mu(\frac12 u^2)}{\Upsilon^2-u^2} \;du$$ where $\Upsilon$ is the maximal speed of particle velocities. It is shown that purely oscillatory electric fields exist and obey a Klein-Gordon's type dispersion relation for wave numbers below { and up to} the threshold, thus rigorously confirming the existence of Langmuir's oscillatory waves { for a non-trivial range of spatial frequencies in this linearized setting}. At the threshold, the phase velocity of these oscillatory waves enters the range of admissible particle velocities, namely there are particles that move at the same propagation speed of the waves. It is this exact resonant interaction between particles and the oscillatory fields that causes the waves to be damped, classically known as Landau damping. Landau's law of decay is explicitly computed and is sensitive to the decaying rate of the background equilibria. The faster it decays at the maximal velocity, the weaker Landau damping is. Beyond the threshold, the electric fields are a perturbation of those generated by the free transport dynamics and thus decay rapidly fast due to the phase mixing mechanism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08924v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our motivation is to consider an electromagnetic Lagrangian density $\mathcal{L}_q$, depending on a parameter such that, for $q=1$ it corresponds to the Born-Infeld Lagrangian density and for $q=2$ it restores the Maxwell one. The model in the presence of given charge and current densities is investigated. We solve the pure magnetostatic problem for $q\in(6/5,2)$. We also study the electrostatic problem in the presence of an assigned magnetic field for $q\in[1,2)$.</description>

      <title>Stochastic interpretations of the oceanic primitive equations with relaxed hydrostatic assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14946v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how weakening the classical hydrostatic balance hypothesis impacts the well-posedness of the stochastic LU primitive equations. The models we consider are intermediate between the incompressible 3D LU Navier-Stokes equations and the LU primitive equations with standard hydrostatic balance. As such, they are expected to be numerically tractable, while accounting well for phenomena within the grey zone between hydrostatic balance and non-hydrostatic processes. Our main result is the well-posedness of a low-pass filtering-based stochastic interpretation of the LU primitive equations, with rigid-lid type boundary conditions, in the limit of ``quasi-barotropic'' flow. This assumption is linked to the structure assumption proposed in the work of Agresti et al., which can be related to the dynamical regime where the primitive equations remain valid. Furthermore, we present and study two eddy-(hyper)viscosity-based models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18285v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The real part of the focusing modified Korteweg-de Vries (MKdV) equation defined over the complex field $\mathbb{C}$ is reduced to the focusing gauged MKdV (FGMKdV) equation. In this paper, we construct the real hyperelliptic solutions of FGMKdV equation in terms of data of the hyperelliptic curves of genus $g$ and demonstrate the closed hyperelliptic plane curves of genus $g=5$ whose curvature obeys the FGMKdV equation by extending the previous results of genus three (Matsutani, {\it{J. Geom. Phys}} {\bf{215}} (2025) 105540). These are a generalization of Euler's elasticae.</description>

      <title>Computer-Assisted Proofs for Geometric Optimization: From Crystallization to Carbon Nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a framework based on computer-assisted proofs that turns standard geometry optimization simulations for atomistic structures into mathematical proofs. Starting from a numerically computed approximation of a local minimizer or saddle point, we use validated numerical computations to prove the existence of a critical point of the potential energy close to this approximation. We demonstrate this framework in two settings. In the first, we study capped carbon nanotubes modeled as minimizers of carbon interatomic potentials (harmonic, Tersoff, and a Huber potential) and obtain proven bounds on tube diameter, bond lengths, and bond angles. In particular, we show that caps induce diameter oscillations along the tube. As a second application, we consider a finite Lennard-Jones crystal in a face-centered cubic (fcc) lattice and provide computer-proofs of a local minimizer representing the perfect crystal, a local minimizer with a single vacancy defect, and a saddle point that connects two single-vacancy configurations on the energy landscape.</description>

      <title>On the asymptotic behavior of the spectral gap for discrete Schr\"odinger operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16353v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note we elaborate on the asymptotic behavior of the spectral gap of a class of discrete Schr\"odinger operators defined on a path graph in the limit of infinite volume. We confirm recent results and generalize them to a larger class of potentials using entirely different methods. Notably, we also resolve a conjecture previously proposed in this context. This then yields new insights into the rate at which the spectral gap tends to zero as the volume increases.</description>

      <title>Higher-Form Anomalies on Lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Higher-form symmetry in a tensor product Hilbert space is always emergent: the symmetry generators become genuinely topological only when the Gauss law is energetically enforced at low energies. In this paper, we present a general method for defining the 't Hooft anomaly of higher-form symmetries in lattice models built on a tensor product Hilbert space. In (2+1)D, for given Gauss law operators realized by finite-depth circuits that generate a finite 1-form $G$ symmetry, we construct an index representing a cohomology class in $H^4(B^2G, U(1))$, which characterizes the corresponding 't Hooft anomaly. This construction generalizes the Else-Nayak characterization of 0-form symmetry anomalies. More broadly, under the assumption of a specified formulation of the $p$-form $G$ symmetry action and Hilbert space structure in arbitrary $d$ spatial dimensions, we show how to characterize the 't Hooft anomaly of the symmetry action by an index valued in $H^{d+2}(B^{p+1}G, U(1))$.</description>

      <title>Generalized Wigner theorem for non-invertible symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25327v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the conditions under which a conservation law associated with a non-invertible operator may be realized as a symmetry in quantum mechanics. As established by Wigner, all quantum symmetries must be represented by either unitary or antiunitary transformations. Relinquishing an implicit assumption of invertibility, we demonstrate that the fundamental invariance of quantum transition probabilities under the application of symmetries mandates that all non-invertible symmetries may only correspond to {\it projective} unitary or antiunitary transformations, i.e., {\it partial isometries}. This extends the notion of physical states beyond conventional rays in Hilbert space to equivalence classes in an {\it extended, gauged Hilbert space}, thereby broadening the traditional understanding of symmetry transformations in quantum theory. We discuss consequences of this result and explicitly illustrate how, in simple model systems, whether symmetries be invertible or non-invertible may be inextricably related to the particular boundary conditions that are being used.</description>

      <title>Fibration Symmetries and Cluster Synchronization in Multi-Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on recent advances in fibration symmetry theory, we investigate how structural symmetries influence synchronization in systems with higher-order interactions (HOI). Using bipartite graph representations, we identify a node partition in fibres, based on equivalent incidence relations in hypergraphs. We study how identical nodes with an isomorphic input set can synchronize due to structural properties under our specific model assumptions, examining the dynamical model of Kuramoto with higher-order interactions and frustration parameters. Recent works established for directed hypergraphs that balanced partitions characterize robust synchrony, invariant under all admissible dynamics, whereas our contribution isolates the case of Kuramoto dynamics and shows that synchrony under homogeneous initial conditions and natural frequencies necessarily coincides with the fibration partition. As a conclusion, let us examine situations that require adjustments to the hypergraph topology to handle redundancy or to align with a target cluster configuration, especially in the presence of noise or incomplete information. These considerations open up new questions for future investigations. Our methodology combines theoretical modeling and simulations with applications to real-world data topologies, highlighting how representational choices and local input equivalence influence synchronization behavior.</description>

      <title>Initial-State Typicality in Quantum Relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01709v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relaxation in open quantum systems is fundamental to quantum science and technologies. Yet, the influence of the initial state on relaxation remains a central, largely unanswered question. Here, by systematically characterizing the relaxation behavior of generic initial states, we uncover a typicality phenomenon in high-dimensional open quantum systems: relaxation becomes nearly initial-state-independent as system size increases under verifiable conditions. Crucially, we prove this typicality for thermalization processes above a size-independent temperature. Our findings extend the typicality to open quantum dynamics, in turn identifying a class of systems where two widely used quantities -- the Liouvillian gap and the maximal relaxation time -- merit re-examination. We formalize this with two new concepts: the 'typical strong Mpemba effect' and the 'typical relaxation time'. Beyond these conceptual advances, our results provide practical implications: a scalable route to accelerating relaxation and a typical mixing-time benchmark that complements conventional worst-case metrics for quantum simulations and state preparation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02165v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $(\mathbf{U}, \mathbf{U}^\imath)$ be a quasi-split affine quantum symmetric pair of type $\mathsf{AIII}$. This case is of particular interest thanks to the existence of geometric realizations and Schur--Weyl dualities. We establish factorization and coproduct formulae for the Drinfeld--Cartan series $\boldsymbol\Theta_i(z)$ in the Lu--Pan--Wang--Zhang `new Drinfeld'-style presentation, generalizing the split type results from [Prz23, LP25a]. As an application, we construct a boundary analogue of the $q$-character map, and show that it is compatible with Frenkel and Reshetikhin's original $q$-character homomorphism.</description>

      <title>Hodge Decomposition Guides the Optimization of Synchronization over Simplicial Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04326v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite growing interest in synchronization dynamics over "higher-order" network models, optimization theory for such systems is limited. Here, we study a family of Kuramoto models inspired by algebraic topology in which oscillators are coupled over simplicial complexes (SCs) using their associated Hodge Laplacian matrices. We optimize such systems by extending the synchrony alignment function -- an optimization framework for synchronizing graph-coupled heterogeneous oscillators. Computational experiments are given to illustrate how this approach can effectively solve a variety of combinatorial problems including the joint optimization of projected synchronization dynamics onto lower- and upper-dimensional simplices within SCs. We also investigate the role of SC homology and develop bifurcation theory to characterize the extent to which optimal solutions are contained within (or spread across) the three Hodge subspaces. Our work extends optimization theory to the setting of higher-order networks, provides practical algorithms for Hodge-Laplacian-related dynamics including (but not limited to) Kuramoto oscillators, and paves the way for an emerging field that interfaces algebraic topology, combinatorial optimization, and dynamical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we present an intuitive construction of the quantum logical axiomatic system provided by George Mackey. The goal of this work is a detailed discussion of the results from the paper 'Physical justification for using the tensor product to describe two quantum systems as one joint system' [1] published by Diederik Aerts and Ingrid Daubechies. This means that we want to show how certain composed physical systems from classical and quantum mechanics should be described logically. To reach this goal, we will, like in [1], discuss a special class of axiomatically defined composed physical systems. With the help of certain results from lattice and c-morphism theory (see [2] and [23]), we will present a detailed proof of the statement, that in the quantum mechanical case, a composed physical system must be described via a tensor product space.</description>
