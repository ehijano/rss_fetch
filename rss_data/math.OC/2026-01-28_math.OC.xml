      <title>On the Convergence of HalpernSGD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HalpernSGD is a gradient-type optimizer obtained by combining the classical Halpern fixed-point iteration with a stochastic gradient step. While its empirical advantages have already been observed in \cite{colao2025optimizer,foglia2024halpernsgd}, this paper provides a theoretical analysis of the method. Assuming a convex $L$-smooth objective and standard stochastic-approximation conditions, we prove almost sure convergence of the iterates to a minimizer, characterized as the metric projection of the anchor onto the solution set. These results fill a gap in the literature on HalpernSGD and lay the groundwork for future extensions to adaptive schemes.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Decision-Making and Optimal Utilization of Pathfinding Flights during Convective Weather</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Air traffic operations are strongly influenced by convective weather, and one common response is pathfinder operations, in which a designated aircraft tests the viability of weather-impacted airspace and routes. Despite relatively routine use in practice, how pathfinder operations evolve under uncertainty and how the pathfinder decision-making process unfolds are largely treated as exogenous. Addressing this gap requires jointly modeling weather-driven system accessibility, flight responses to pathfinder offers, and the sequencing of those offers to improve outcomes. We develop a unified analytical framework that connects weather-driven system state transitions, flight acceptance decisions, and the sequencing of pathfinder offers. We first construct a four-state Markov chain to model stochastic closure and reopening of exit points, or fixes, out of the terminal departure airspace surrounding a major airport, pathfinder selection, and pathfinding execution, and analyze its steady-state behavior to characterize long-term capacity and delay implications. We introduce utility-based decision models for flights, air traffic control (ATC), and dispatchers, and analyze worst-case collective rejection to quantify system vulnerability under selfless behavior and uncertainty. Finally, we formulate optimization problems that model ATC-initiated and dispatcher-initated pathfinder offers, with the goal of optimizing the sequence of pathfinder offers. Using a discrete event simulation for a major US airport, we show that ATC- and dispatcher-driven objectives lead to distinct, near real-time sequencing strategies, providing the first formal decision models for pathfinder operations under weather uncertainty.</description>

      <title>A Local Discontinuous Galerkin Method for Dirichlet Boundary Control Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider control constrained $L^2-$Dirichlet boundary control of a convection-diffusion equation on a two dimensional convex polygonal domain. We discretize the control problem based on the local discontinuous Galerkin method with piecewise linear ansatz functions for the flux and potential. We derive a priori error estimates for the full as well as for the variational discrete control approximation. We present a selection of numerical results to demonstrate the performance of our approach and to underpin the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically tight Lagrangian dual of smooth nonconvex problems via improved error bound of Shapley-Folkman Lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In convex geometry, the Shapley-Folkman Lemma asserts that the nonconvexity of a Minkowski sum of $n$ dimensional bounded nonconvex sets does not accumulate once the number of summands exceeds the dimension $n$, and thus the sum becomes approximately convex. Originally published by Starr in the context of quasi-equilibrium in nonconvex market models in economics, the lemma has since found widespread use in optimization, particularly for estimating the duality gap of the Lagrangian dual of separable nonconvex problems. Given its foundational nature, we pose the following geometric question: Is it possible for the nonconvexity of the Minkowski sum of $n$-dimensional nonconvex sets to even diminish instead of just not accumulating as the number of summands increases, under some general conditions? We answer this affirmatively. First, we provide an elementary geometric proof of the Shapley-Folkman Lemma based on the facial structure of the convex hull of each set. This leads to refinement of the classical error bound derived from the lemma. Building on this new geometric perspective, we further show that when most of the sets satisfy a certain local smoothness condition which naturally arises in the epigraphs of smooth functions, their Minkowski sum converges directly to a convex set, with a vanishing nonconvexity measure. In optimization, this implies that the Lagrangian dual of block-structured smooth nonconvex problems with potentially additional sparsity constraints is asymptotically tight under mild assumptions, which contracts nonvanishing duality gap obtained via classical Shapley-Folkman Lemma.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Accelerated Gradient Descent Methods for Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes A$^2$GD, a novel adaptive accelerated gradient descent method for convex and composite optimization. Smoothness and convexity constants are updated via Lyapunov analysis. Inspired by stability analysis in ODE solvers, the method triggers line search only when accumulated perturbations become positive, thereby reducing gradient evaluations while preserving strong convergence guarantees. By integrating adaptive step size and momentum acceleration, A$^2$GD outperforms existing first-order methods across a range of problem settings.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Mirror Descent Method through Variable and Operator Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mirror descent uses the mirror function to encode geometry and constraints, improving convergence while preserving feasibility. Accelerated Mirror Descent Methods (Acc-MD) are derived from a discretization of an accelerated mirror ODE system using a variable--operator splitting framework. A geometric assumption, termed the Generalized Cauchy-Schwarz (GCS) condition, is introduced to quantify the compatibility between the objective and the mirror geometry, under which the first accelerated linear convergence for Acc-MD on a broad class of problems is established. Numerical experiments on smooth and composite optimization tasks demonstrate that Acc-MD consistently outperforms existing accelerated variants, both theoretically and empirically.</description>

      <title>On the SOS Rank of Simple and Diagonal Biquadratic Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the sum-of-squares (SOS) rank of simple and diagonal biquadratic forms. For simple biquadratic forms in $3 \times 3$ variables, we show that the maximum SOS rank is exactly $6$, attained by a specific six-term form. We further prove that for any $m \ge 3$, there exists an $m \times m$ simple biquadratic form whose SOS rank is exactly $2m$, providing a general lower bound that extends the $3\times3$ case. For diagonal biquadratic forms with nonnegative coefficients, we prove an SOS rank upper bound of $7$, improving the general bound of $8$ for $3 \times 3$ forms. In addition, we extend the techniques to a broader class of \textbf{sparse biquadratic forms}, obtaining combinatorial upper bounds and constructing explicit families whose SOS rank grows linearly with the number of terms. These results provide new lower and upper bounds on the worst-case SOS rank of biquadratic forms and highlight the role of structure in reducing the required number of squares.</description>

      <title>Continuous-time q-learning for Markov regime switching system under Tsallis entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the continuous-time q-learning (the continuous time counterpart of Q-learing) for Markov switching system under Tsallis entropy regularization. We address the difficulty in traditional RL algorithms where the Tsallis entropy regularization leads to an optimal policy distribution not necessarily a Gibbs measure, which often complicates algorithm design. Furthermore, to address the limited universality of current continuous time regime-switching RL algorithms (often restricted to the EMV framework), this study focuses on continuous-time q-learning for Markov regime-switching systems based on Tsallis entropy, aiming for a more universally applicable continuous-time RL method. We establish the martingale characterization of the q-function under Tsallis entropy for continuous-time Markov regime-switching systems. Based on this, we design two q-learning algorithms, distinguished by whether the Lagrange multiplier can be explicitly derived. We apply these algorithms to the continuous-time exploratory Mean-Variance (EMV) portfolio optimization problem in a regime-switching market. Numerical experiments demonstrate the satisfactory performance of our q-learning algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of asynchronous stochastic nonconvex optimization with heavy-tailed gradient noise and arbitrarily heterogeneous computation times across workers. We propose an asynchronous normalized stochastic gradient descent algorithm with momentum. The analysis show that our method achieves the optimal time complexity under the assumption of bounded $p$th-order central moment with $p\in(1,2]$. We also provide numerical experiments to show the effectiveness of proposed method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers decentralized nonsmooth nonconvex optimization problem with Lipschitz continuous local functions. We propose an efficient stochastic first-order method with client sampling, achieving the $(\delta,\epsilon)$-Goldstein stationary point with the overall sample complexity of ${\mathcal O}(\delta^{-1}\epsilon^{-3})$, the computation rounds of ${\mathcal O}(\delta^{-1}\epsilon^{-3})$, and the communication rounds of ${\tilde{\mathcal O}}(\gamma^{-1/2}\delta^{-1}\epsilon^{-3})$, where $\gamma$ is the spectral gap of the mixing matrix for the network. Our results achieve the optimal sample complexity and the sharper communication complexity than existing methods. We also extend our ideas to zeroth-order optimization. Moreover, the numerical experiments show the empirical advantage of our methods.</description>

      <title>Improved Convergence Rates of Muon Optimizer for Nonconvex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Muon optimizer has recently attracted attention due to its orthogonalized first-order updates, and a deeper theoretical understanding of its convergence behavior is essential for guiding practical applications; however, existing convergence guarantees are either coarse or obtained under restrictive analytical settings. In this work, we establish sharper convergence guarantees for the Muon optimizer through a direct and simplified analysis that does not rely on restrictive assumptions on the update rule. Our results improve upon existing bounds by achieving faster convergence rates while covering a broader class of problem settings. These findings provide a more accurate theoretical characterization of Muon and offer insights applicable to a broader class of orthogonalized first-order methods.</description>

      <title>Approximate controllability of a bilinear wave equation and minimum time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the global approximate controllability (GAC) of a Klein-Gordon wave equation, posed on the torus $\mathbb{T}^d$ of arbitrary dimension $d\in \mathbb{N}^*$, with bilinear control potentials supported on the first $(2d+1)$-Fourier modes. Let $Z(W_0)\subset \mathbb{T}^d$ be the set of essential zeroes of the initial state $W_0\in H^1\times L^2(\mathbb{T}^d)$, and $r(W_0)\geq 0$ be the maximum radius of a ball of $\mathbb{T}^d$ contained in $Z(W_0)$. Due to finite speed of propagation, the minimum control time starting from $W_0$ is necessarily larger than or equal to $r(W_0)$. We prove the following three facts.
  In low dimensions $d \in \{1,2\}$: the minimum time for GAC from $W_0 \neq 0$ is equal to $r(W_0)$.
  In any dimensions $d\geq 3$: the minimum time for GAC from $W_0$ is zero if $Z(W_0)$ has zero Lebesgue measure; and the GAC in sufficiently large time from all $W_0\neq 0$.
  The proof strategy consists in combining Lie bracket techniques \emph{\`a la Agrachev-Sarychev} with the propagation of well-prepared positive states.</description>

      <title>A framework for window design in delivery schedules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a structured framework for the design and dynamic updating of service time windows in delivery and appointment-based systems. We consider a single-server setting with stochastic service and travel times, where customers are promised a time window in which the provider will arrive. The first part of the paper introduces a static window construction method based on a probabilistic threshold criterion, using an analytical approximation of residual travel and service time distributions. Building on this, we develop a dynamic update mechanism that monitors residual system uncertainty, where time windows are revised during execution only when the remaining time until the window's start falls below a predefined threshold. This threshold-based approach enables communication-efficient scheduling while substantially improving delivery accuracy. Numerical experiments demonstrate significant performance gains of the dynamic approach in both stylized and real-world settings.</description>

      <title>An adjacency-based algorithm for computing all extreme-supported non-dominated points of a bi-objective combinatorial optimisation problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generally, multi-objective optimisation problems are solved exactly or approximated by solving a series of scalarisations, for example by dichotomic search. In this paper, we take a different approach and attempt to compute the set of all extreme-supported non-dominated points of a bi-objective combinatorial optimisation problem by using a neighbourhood-based approach. Whether or not this works depends on the definition of adjacency and we provide sufficient conditions that guarantee its success. The resulting generic algorithm is an alternative to dichotomic search in our setting.
  We then apply our generic algorithm to a specific example: the bi-objective minimum weight basis problem, in which we are given a matroid and want to find bases of minimum weight. We use the natural definition of adjacency, in which two bases are adjacent if they differ in exactly one element. Since this satisfies our sufficient condition on the adjacency relation, our generic algorithm works in this case and we analyse its running time, showing that it is polynomial. By tailoring this algorithm specifically to matroids, we obtain one that is faster but no longer transitions between adjacent solutions, instead swapping directly from one extreme-supported point to the next in a combinatorial fashion.</description>

      <title>A Multiobjective Water Allocation Model for Economic Efficiency and Environmental Sustainability: Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The management of irrigation water systems has become increasingly complex due to competing demands for agricultural production, groundwater sustainability, and environmental flow requirements, particularly under hydrologic variability and climate uncertainty. Addressing these challenges requires optimization frameworks that can jointly determine optimal crop allocation, groundwater pumping, and environmental flow releases while maintaining economic and hydrological feasibility. However, existing hydro-economic models, including the widely used Lewis and Randall formulation, may overestimate net benefits by allowing infeasible negative pumping and surface water allocations. We extend the Lewis and Randall framework by reformulating groundwater pumping and surface water use as non-negative, demand-driven decision variables and by explicitly incorporating environmental flow and canal capacity constraints. Three models are developed to maximize economic benefit, minimize environmental deficits, and a multiobjective model that evaluates the trade-offs between these two objectives. An illustrative test case examining optimal crop area allocation and environmental flow management across dry, average, and wet years, using data from the Rajshahi Barind Tract in northwestern Bangladesh, is presented. The results show that the proposed formulation produces economically and hydrologically consistent solutions, identifying optimal strategies when either net benefits or environmental protection is prioritized, as well as Pareto-optimal trade-offs when both objectives are considered together. These findings provide practical insights for balancing farm income, groundwater sustainability, and ecological protection, offering a robust decision-support tool for irrigation management in water-limited river basins.</description>

      <title>Unique Preference Aggregation in Design and Decision Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preference aggregation is a core operation in multi-objective design optimisation and group decision-making, as it determines the best-fit-for-common-purpose alternative within complex socio-technical contexts. Therefore, their aggregation requires a rigorous measurement-theoretic foundation to ensure mathematical validity, interpretability, and uniqueness. PFM establishes the principal axioms of unique preference aggregation, providing a rigorous basis on which aggregation can be demonstrated.
  In this paper, it is shown that commonly used aggregation approaches in MCDM - such as weighted arithmetic and geometric means, as well as weighted distance-based optimisation methods - often fail to produce consistent rankings and are therefore unsuitable for pure MCDM. In contrast, the unique preference aggregation presented here clarifies the mathematical limits of valid aggregation and provides a principled, implementable foundation for robust multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) and multi-objective design optimisation (MODO) in multi-faceted problems.</description>

      <title>Curve-Fitting to resolve overlapping voltammetric peaks: Model and examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A model is presented that is applicable to a wide range of peak-shaped voltammetric signals. It may be used, via curve-fitting, to resolve severely overlapped peaks, irrespective of the degree(s) of reversibility of the electrode processes. The resolution procedure has been thoroughly tested for several voltammetric and polarographic techniques (differential pulse, square wave and pseudo-derivative normal pulse), using reversible, quasireversible and irreversible electrochemical systems.</description>

      <title>Closing the gap around the essential minimum of height functions with linear programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For many common height functions, the explicit determination of the essential minimum is an open problem. We consider a classical method to obtain lower bounds that goes back at least to C.J. Smyth, and a method to obtain upper bounds based on the knowledge of the limit distribution of integral points. We use an infinite dimensional linear programming scheme to show that that both methods agree in the limit, by showing that the principle of strong duality holds in our situation. As a corollary we prove that the essential minimum can be attained by sequences of algebraic integers.
  Recent results by A. Smith and B. Orloski--N. Sardari, furnish a characterization of compactly supported measures that can be approximated by complete sets of conjugates of algebraic integers, in terms of infinitely many nonnegativity conditions. We establish an extension of this characterization to measures with non necessarily compact support. As an application of this result and of strong duality, we show that the essential minimum is a computable real number when the Green function used to define the height is computable. We systematically use potential theory for measures that can integrate functions with logarithmic growth.</description>

      <title>Attention-Enhanced Graph Filtering for False Data Injection Attack Detection and Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing deployment of Internet-of-Things (IoT)-enabled measurement devices in modern power systems has expanded the cyberattack surface of the grid. As a result, this critical infrastructure is increasingly exposed to cyberattacks, including false data injection attacks (FDIAs) that compromise measurement integrity and threaten reliable system operation. Existing FDIA detection methods primarily exploit spatial correlations and network topology using graph-based learning; however, these approaches often rely on high-dimensional representations and shallow classifiers, limiting their ability to capture local structural dependencies and global contextual relationships. Moreover, naively incorporating Transformer architectures can result in overly deep models that struggle to model localized grid dynamics. This paper proposes a joint FDIA detection and localization framework that integrates auto-regressive moving average (ARMA) graph convolutional filters with an Encoder-Only Transformer architecture. The ARMA-based graph filters provide robust, topology-aware feature extraction and adaptability to abrupt spectral changes, while the Transformer encoder leverages self-attention to capture long-range dependencies among grid elements without sacrificing essential local context. The proposed method is evaluated using real-world load data from the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) applied to the IEEE 14- and 300-bus systems. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed model effectively exploits both the state and topology of the power grid, achieving high accuracy in detecting FDIA events and localizing compromised nodes.</description>

      <title>A Probabilistic Interpretation of the Master Equation Arising from Mean Field Games with Jump Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the classical solution to the master equation arising from mean-field games (MFGs) driven by jump-diffusion processes. The master equation, a nonlinear partial differential equation on Wasserstein space, characterizes the value function of MFGs and is challenging to analyze directly due to its measure-valued derivatives. We propose a probabilistic interpretation using coupled McKean-Vlasov forward-backward stochastic differential equations (MV-FBSDEs) with jumps. Under suitable Lipschitz and differentiability assumptions on the coefficients, we first establish the well-posedness of the MV-FBSDEs on a small time interval via a contraction mapping argument. We then prove the existence and regularity of the first- and second-order derivatives of the solutions with respect to the spatial and measure variables, relying on careful estimates involving jump terms and measure derivatives. Finally, we show that the decoupling field of the MV-FBSDEs satisfies the master equation in the classical sense, providing both existence and uniqueness of the solution. Our work extends earlier results on diffusion-driven MFGs to the jump-diffusion setting and offers a probabilistic framework for analyzing and numerically solving such kind of master equations.</description>

      <title>Structural Monotonicity in Transmission Scheduling for Remote State Estimation with Hidden Channel Mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study treats transmission scheduling for remote state estimation over unreliable channels with a hidden mode. A local Kalman estimator selects scheduling actions, such as power allocation and resource usage, and communicates with a remote estimator based on acknowledgement feedback, balancing estimation performance and communication cost. The resulting problem is naturally formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). In settings with observable channel modes, it is well known that monotonicity of the value function can be established via investigating order-preserving property of transition kernels. In contrast, under partial observability, the transition kernels generally lack this property, which prevents the direct application of standard monotonicity arguments. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce a novel technique, referred to as state-space folding, which induces transformed transition kernels recovering order preservation on the folded space. This transformation enables a rigorous monotonicity analysis in the partially observable setting. As a representative implication, we focus on an associated optimal stopping formulation and show that the resulting optimal scheduling policy admits a threshold structure.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Muon with Newton-Schulz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze Muon as originally proposed and used in practice -- using the momentum orthogonalization with a few Newton-Schulz steps. The prior theoretical results replace this key step in Muon with an exact SVD-based polar factor. We prove that Muon with Newton-Schulz converges to a stationary point at the same rate as the SVD-polar idealization, up to a constant factor for a given number $q$ of Newton-Schulz steps. We further analyze this constant factor and prove that it converges to 1 doubly exponentially in $q$ and improves with the degree of the polynomial used in Newton-Schulz for approximating the orthogonalization direction. We also prove that Muon removes the typical square-root-of-rank loss compared to its vector-based counterpart, SGD with momentum. Our results explain why Muon with a few low-degree Newton-Schulz steps matches exact-polar (SVD) behavior at a much faster wall-clock time and explain how much momentum matrix orthogonalization via Newton-Schulz benefits over the vector-based optimizer. Overall, our theory justifies the practical Newton-Schulz design of Muon, narrowing its practice-theory gap.</description>

      <title>Output Feedback Stabilization of Linear Systems via Policy Gradient Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stabilizing a dynamical system is a fundamental problem that serves as a cornerstone for many complex tasks in the field of control systems. The problem becomes challenging when the system model is unknown. Among the Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms that have been successfully applied to solve problems pertaining to unknown linear dynamical systems, the policy gradient (PG) method stands out due to its ease of implementation and can solve the problem in a model-free manner. However, most of the existing works on PG methods for unknown linear dynamical systems assume full-state feedback. In this paper, we take a step towards model-free learning for partially observable linear dynamical systems with output feedback and focus on the fundamental stabilization problem of the system. We propose an algorithmic framework that stretches the boundary of PG methods to the problem without global convergence guarantees. We show that by leveraging zeroth-order PG update based on system trajectories and its convergence to stationary points, the proposed algorithms return a stabilizing output feedback policy for discrete-time linear dynamical systems. We also explicitly characterize the sample complexity of our algorithm and verify the effectiveness of the algorithm using numerical examples.</description>

Abstract: This paper assumes a robust stochastic model where a set $\mathcal{P}$ of probability measures replaces the single probability measure of dominated models. We introduce and study $\mathcal{P}$-sensitive functions defined on robust function spaces of random variables. We show that $\mathcal{P}$-sensitive functions are precisely those that admit a representation via so-called functional localization. The theory is applied to solving robust optimization problems, to convex risk measures, and to the study of no arbitrage in robust one-period financial models.</description>

      <title>Intersectional Fairness via Mixed-Integer Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The deployment of Artificial Intelligence in high-risk domains, such as finance and healthcare, necessitates models that are both fair and transparent. While regulatory frameworks, including the EU's AI Act, mandate bias mitigation, they are deliberately vague about the definition of bias. In line with existing research, we argue that true fairness requires addressing bias at the intersections of protected groups. We propose a unified framework that leverages Mixed-Integer Optimization (MIO) to train intersectionally fair and intrinsically interpretable classifiers. We prove the equivalence of two measures of intersectional fairness (MSD and SPSF) in detecting the most unfair subgroup and empirically demonstrate that our MIO-based algorithm improves performance in finding bias. We train high-performing, interpretable classifiers that bound intersectional bias below an acceptable threshold, offering a robust solution for regulated industries and beyond.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Prompt-Augmentation for Efficient LLM-Based Heuristic Design for A* Search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heuristic functions are essential to the performance of tree search algorithms such as A*, where their accuracy and efficiency directly impact search outcomes. Traditionally, such heuristics are handcrafted, requiring significant expertise. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and evolutionary frameworks have opened the door to automating heuristic design. In this paper, we extend the Evolution of Heuristics (EoH) framework to investigate the automated generation of guiding heuristics for A* search. We introduce a novel domain-agnostic prompt augmentation strategy that includes the A* code into the prompt to leverage in-context learning, named Algorithmic - Contextual EoH (A-CEoH). To evaluate the effectiveness of A-CeoH, we study two problem domains: the Unit-Load Pre-Marshalling Problem (UPMP), a niche problem from warehouse logistics, and the classical sliding puzzle problem (SPP). Our computational experiments show that A-CEoH can significantly improve the quality of the generated heuristics and even outperform expert-designed heuristics.</description>

      <title>Containments of Tensor Network Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building upon the work of Buczy\'nska et al., we study here tensor formats and their corresponding encoding of tensors via two-fold tensor products determined by the combinatorics of a binary tree. The set of all tensors representable by a given network forms the corresponding tensor network variety. A very basic question asks whether every tensor representable by one network is representable by another network, namely, when one tensor network variety is contained in another. Specific instances of this question became known as the Hackbusch Conjecture. Here, we propose a general framework for this question and take first steps, theoretical as well as experimental, towards a better understanding. In particular, given any two binary trees on $n$ leaves, we define (and prove existence of) a new measure, the containment exponent, which gauges how much one has to boost the parameters of one network for the containment to hold. We present an algorithm for bounding these containment exponents of tensor network varieties and report on an exhaustive search among trees on up to $n=8$ leaves.</description>

      <title>A refined nonlinear least-squares method for the rational approximation problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The adaptive Antoulas-Anderson (AAA) algorithm for rational approximation is a widely used method for the efficient construction of highly accurate rational approximations to given data. While AAA can often produce rational approximations accurate to any prescribed tolerance, these approximations may have degrees larger than what is actually required to meet the given tolerance. In this work, we consider the adaptive construction of interpolating rational approximations while aiming for the smallest feasible degree to satisfy a given error tolerance. To this end, we introduce refinement approaches to the linear least-squares step of the classical AAA algorithm that aim to minimize the true nonlinear least-squares error with respect to the given data. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze the derived approaches in terms of the corresponding gradients from the resulting minimization problems and use these insights to propose a new greedy framework that ensures monotonic error convergence. Numerical examples from function approximation and model order reduction verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm to construct accurate rational approximations of small degrees.</description>

      <title>Synchronization on circles and spheres with nonlinear interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the dynamics of $n$ points on a sphere in $\mathbb{R}^d$ ($d \geq 2$) which attract each other according to a function $\varphi$ of their inner products. When $\varphi$ is linear ($\varphi(t) = t$), the points converge to a common value (i.e., synchronize) in various connectivity scenarios: this is part of classical work on Kuramoto oscillator networks. When $\varphi$ is exponential ($\varphi(t) = e^{\beta t}$), these dynamics correspond to a limit of how idealized transformers process data, as described by Geshkovski et al. (2025). Accordingly, they ask whether synchronization occurs for exponential $\varphi$.
  The answer depends on the dimension $d$. In the context of consensus for multi-agent control, Markdahl et al. (2018) show that for $d \geq 3$ (spheres), if the interaction graph is connected and $\varphi$ is increasing and convex, then the system synchronizes. We give a separate proof of this result.
  What is the situation on circles ($d=2$)? First, we show that $\varphi$ being increasing and convex is no longer sufficient (even for complete graphs). Then we identify a new condition under which we do have synchronization on the circle (namely, if the Taylor coefficients of $\varphi'$ are decreasing). As a corollary, this provide synchronization for exponential $\varphi$ with $\beta \in (0, 1]$. The proofs are based on nonconvex landscape analysis.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Overlap Information in Chance-constrained Program with Random Right-hand Side</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the chance-constrained program (CCP) with random right-hand side under a finite discrete distribution. It is known that the standard mixed integer linear programming (MILP) reformulation of the CCP is generally difficult to solve by general-purpose solvers as the branch-and-cut search trees are enormously large, partly due to the weak linear programming relaxation. In this paper, we identify another reason for this phenomenon: the intersection of the feasible regions of the subproblems in the search tree could be nonempty, leading to a wasteful duplication of effort in exploring the uninteresting overlap in the search tree. To address the newly identified challenge and enhance the capability of the MILP-based approach in solving CCPs, we first show that the overlap in the search tree can be completely removed by a family of valid nonlinear if-then constraints, and then propose two practical approaches to tackle the highly nonlinear if-then constraints. In particular, we use the concept of dominance relations between different scenarios of the random variables, and propose a novel branching, called dominance-based branching, which is able to create a valid partition of the problem with a much smaller overlap than the classic variable branching. Moreover, we develop overlap-oriented node pruning and variable fixing techniques, applied at each node of the search tree, to remove more overlaps in the search tree. Computational results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed dominance-based branching with the overlap-oriented node pruning and variable fixing techniques in reducing the search tree size and improving the overall solution efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04562v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Price promotion optimization is a computationally challenging problem central to supermarket operations, requiring simultaneous pricing decisions across multiple products and periods. This paper introduces a novel formulation for supermodular functions and univariate compositions using explicit convex hull descriptions derived from simplotope triangulations, departing from prior reliance on rectangular domains. Leveraging this reformulation with Gurobi, we achieve substantial performance gains, with average solve times for problems with 10 products and 5 price levels reducing from 434 to 0.06 seconds, enabling significant instance scaling. We demonstrate conditions for a tight linear programming relaxation extending previous results from two to multiple price levels and from additive to multiplicative historical effects. Our approach is broadly applicable to nonlinear discrete optimization, and we contribute techniques for convexifying compositions of arbitrary univariate functions and a framework for convexifying a superclass of L natural functions, providing powerful tools for revenue management. This work advances the tractability of price promotion optimization, offering a practical and theoretically grounded solution for large-scale supermarket operations.</description>

      <title>Convergence of energy-based learning in linear resistive networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Energy-based learning algorithms are alternatives to backpropagation and are well-suited to distributed implementations in analog electronic devices. However, a rigorous theory of convergence is lacking. We make a first step in this direction by analysing a particular energybased learning algorithm, Contrastive Learning, applied to a network of linear adjustable resistors. It is shown that, in this setup, Contrastive Learning is equivalent to projected gradient descent on a convex function with Lipschitz continuous gradient, giving a guarantee of convergence of the algorithm for a range of stepsizes. This convergence result is then extended to a stochastic variant of Contrastive Learning.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Model Predictive Control: Asymptotic Stability despite Approximation Errors exemplified in the Koopman framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze stability of nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) using data-driven surrogate models in the optimization step. First, we establish asymptotic stability of the origin, a controlled steady state, w.r.t. the MPC closed loop without stabilizing terminal conditions for sufficiently long prediction horizons. To this end, we prove that cost controllability of the original system is preserved if sufficiently accurate proportional bounds on the approximation error hold. Here, proportional refers to state and control. The proportionality of the error bounds is a key element to derive asymptotic stability in presence of modeling errors and not only practical asymptotic stability. Second, we exemplarily verify the imposed assumptions for data-driven surrogates generated with kernel extended dynamic mode decomposition based on Koopman operator theory. Hereby, we do not impose invariance assumptions on finite dictionaries, but rather derive all conditions under non-restrictive conditions. Finally, we demonstrate our findings with numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Model-free policy gradient for discrete-time mean-field control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study model-free policy learning for discrete-time mean-field control (MFC) problems with finite state space and compact action space. In contrast to the extensive literature on value-based methods for MFC, policy-based approaches remain largely unexplored due to the intrinsic dependence of transition kernels and rewards on the evolving population state distribution, which prevents the direct use of likelihood-ratio estimators of policy gradients from classical single-agent reinforcement learning. We introduce a novel perturbation scheme on the state-distribution flow and prove that the gradient of the resulting perturbed value function converges to the true policy gradient as the perturbation magnitude vanishes. This construction yields a fully model-free estimator based solely on simulated trajectories and an auxiliary estimate of the sensitivity of the state distribution. Building on this framework, we develop MF-REINFORCE, a model-free policy gradient algorithm for MFC, and establish explicit quantitative bounds on its bias and mean-squared error. Numerical experiments on representative mean-field control tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Have ASkotch: A Neat Solution for Large-scale Kernel Ridge Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10070v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kernel ridge regression (KRR) is a fundamental computational tool, appearing in problems that range from computational chemistry to health analytics, with a particular interest due to its starring role in Gaussian process regression. However, full KRR solvers are challenging to scale to large datasets: both direct (i.e., Cholesky decomposition) and iterative methods (i.e., PCG) incur prohibitive computational and storage costs. The standard approach to scale KRR to large datasets chooses a set of inducing points and solves an approximate version of the problem, inducing points KRR. However, the resulting solution tends to have worse predictive performance than the full KRR solution. In this work, we introduce a new solver, ASkotch, for full KRR that provides better solutions faster than state-of-the-art solvers for full and inducing points KRR. ASkotch is a scalable, accelerated, iterative method for full KRR that provably obtains linear convergence. Under appropriate conditions, we show that ASkotch obtains condition-number-free linear convergence. This convergence analysis rests on the theory of ridge leverage scores and determinantal point processes. ASkotch outperforms state-of-the-art KRR solvers on a testbed of 23 large-scale KRR regression and classification tasks derived from a wide range of application domains, demonstrating the superiority of full KRR over inducing points KRR. Our work opens up the possibility of as-yet-unimagined applications of full KRR across a number of disciplines.</description>

      <title>Stochastic optimal control of L\'evy tax processes with bailouts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16385v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider controlling the paths of a spectrally negative L\'evy process by two means: the subtraction of `taxes' when the process is at an all-time maximum, and the addition of `bailouts' which keep the value of the process above zero. We solve the corresponding stochastic optimal control problem of maximising the expected present value of the difference between taxes received and cost of bailouts given. Our class of taxation controls is larger than has been considered up till now in the literature and makes the problem truly two-dimensional rather than one-dimensional. Along the way, we define and characterise a large class of controlled L\'evy processes to which the optimal solution belongs, which extends a known result for perturbed Brownian motions to the case of a general L\'evy process with no positive jumps.</description>

      <title>Freidlin-Wentzell solutions of discrete Hamilton Jacobi equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12505v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a sequence of finite irreducible Markov chains with exponentially small transition rates: the transition graph is a fixed, finite, strongly connected directed graph; the transition rates decay exponentially on a paramenter N with a given rate that varies from edge to edge. The stationary equation uniquely identifies the invariant measure for each N, but at exponential scale in the limit as N goes to infinity reduces to a discrete equation for the large deviation rate functional of the invariant measure, that in general has not an unique solution. In analogy with the continuous case of diffusions, we call such equation a discrete Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Likewise in the continuous case we introduce a notion of viscosity supersolutions and viscosity subsolutions and give a detailed geometric characterization of the solutions in terms of special faces of the polyedron of Lipschitz functions on the transition graph. This parallels the weak KAM theory in a purely discrete setting. We identify also a special vanishing viscosity solution obtained in the limit from the combinatorial representation of the invariant measure given by the matrix tree theorem. The result gives a selection principle on the set of solutions to the discrete Hamilton-Jacobi equation obtained by the Freidlin and Wentzell minimal arborescences construction; this enlightens and parallels what happens in the continuous setting.</description>

      <title>Sharp regularity of sub-Riemannian length-minimizing curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A longstanding open question in sub-Riemannian geometry is the smoothness of (the arc-length parameterization of) length-minimizing curves. In [6], this question is negative answered, with an example of a $C^2$ but not $C^3$ length-minimizer of a real-analytic (even polynomial) sub-Riemannian structure. In this paper, we study a class of examples of sub-Riemannian structures that generalizes that presented in [6], and we prove that length-minimizing curves must be at least of class $C^2$ within these examples. In particular, we prove that Theorem 1.1 in [6] is sharp.</description>
