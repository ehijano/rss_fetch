      <title>Product Geometries on Cholesky Manifolds with Applications to SPD Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents two new metrics on the Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) manifold via the Cholesky manifold, i.e., the space of lower triangular matrices with positive diagonal elements. We first unveil that the existing popular Riemannian metric on the Cholesky manifold can be generally characterized as the product metric of a Euclidean metric and a Riemannian metric on the space of n-dimensional positive vectors. Based on this analysis, we propose two novel metrics on the Cholesky manifolds, i.e., Diagonal Power Euclidean Metric and Diagonal Generalized Bures-Wasserstein Metric, which are numerically stabler than the existing Cholesky metric. We also discuss the gyro structures and deformed metrics associated with our metrics. The gyro structures connect the linear and geometric properties, while the deformed metrics interpolate between our proposed metrics and the existing metric. Further, by Cholesky decomposition, the proposed deformed metrics and gyro structures are pulled back to SPD manifolds. Compared with existing Riemannian metrics on SPD manifolds, our metrics are easy to use, computationally efficient, and numerically stable.</description>

      <title>The structure of deformed double complexes on the Iwasawa manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kuranishi family of the Iwasawa manifold give rise naturally to a family of (deformed) double complexes. By using the structure theorem of double complexes due to Stelzig and Qi-Khovanov, we show there are exactly $3$ isomorphism types in this family and determine explicitly structures of these $3$ types. As an application, we computed the Fr\"olicher spectral sequence for each fiber in the Kuranishi family of the Iwasawa manifold.</description>

      <title>Geodesic loops and orthogonal geodesic chords without self-intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for a generic Riemannian metric on a compact manifold of dimension $n\ge 3$ all geodesic loops based at a fixed point have no self-intersections. We also show that for an open and dense subset of the space of Riemannian metrics on an $n$-disc with $n \ge 3$ and with a strictly convex boundary there are $n$ geometrically distinct orthogonal geodesic chords without self-intersections. We use a perturbation result for intersecting geodesic segments of the author and a genericity statement due to Bettiol and Giamb\`o and existence results for orthogonal geodesic chords by Giamb\`o, Giannoni, and Piccione.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that if a simply connected non-conformally flat conformal Lorentzian manifold $(M,c)$ admits an essential transitive group of conformal transformations, then there exists a metric $g\in c$ such that $(M,g)$ is a complete homogeneous plane wave. We also prove that the group of conformal transformations of a non-conformally flat simply connected homogeneous plane wave $(M,g)$ consists of homotheties, hence it is a 1-dimensional extension of the group of isometries.</description>

      <title>Flows of SU(2)-structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper initiates a classification programme of flows of $\mathrm{SU}(2)$-structures on $4$-manifolds which have short-time existence and uniqueness. Our approach adapts a representation-theoretic method originally due to Bryant in the context of $\mathrm{G}_2$ geometry. We show how this strategy can also be used to deduce the number of geometric flows of a given $H$-structure; we illustrate this in the $\mathrm{G}_2$, $\mathrm{Spin}(7)$ and $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ cases. Our investigation also leads us to derive explicit expressions for the Ricci and self-dual Weyl curvature in terms of the intrinsic torsion of the underlying $\mathrm{SU}(2)$-structure. We compute the first variation formulae of all the quadratic functionals in the torsion; these provide natural building blocks for $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ gradient flows. In particular, our results demonstrate that both the negative gradient flow of the Dirichlet energy of the intrinsic torsion and the Ricci harmonic flow are parabolic after a modified DeTurck's trick.</description>

      <title>On $\delta$-Stable Minimal Hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend several results established for stable minimal hypersurfaces to $\delta$-stable minimal hypersurfaces. These include the regularity and compactness theorems for immersed $\delta$-stable minimal hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ when $n \geq 3$ and $\delta &gt; \frac{n-2}{n}$, as well as the $\delta$-stable Bernstein theorem for $n=3$ and $n=4$ for properly immersion. The range of $\delta$ is optimal, as the $n$-dimensional catenoid in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ is $\frac{n-2}{n}$-stable.</description>

      <title>Moment maps and stability of holomorphic submersions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a finite-dimensional moment map property for certain canonical relatively K\"ahler metrics on holomorphic fibrations, called optimal symplectic connections. We then relate the existence of zeroes of this moment map to the stability of the fibration, where the stability property we consider is a version of K-stability that takes into account the fibration structure, first introduced by Dervan--Sektnan. In particular, we prove that a stable deformation of a fibration admitting an optimal symplectic connection still admits an optimal symplectic connection, through a new approach using the finite-dimensional moment map properties and the moment map flow.
  We include an appendix with a proof of a result considered by Sz\'ekelyhidi that a K-polystable deformation of a constant scalar curvature K\"ahler manifold still admits a constant scalar curvature metric, using the same technique.</description>

      <title>Duals of Higher Vector Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of dual $n$-groupoid to a simplicial vector space for any $n\ge 0$. This has a canonical duality pairing which we show to be non-degenerate up to homotopy for homotopy $n$-types. As a result this notion of duality is reflexive up to homotopy for $n$-types. In particular the same properties hold for $n$-groupoid objects, whose $n$-duals are again $n$-groupoids. We study this construction in the context of the Dold-Kan correspondence and we reformulate the Eilenberg-Zilber theorem, which classically controls monoidality of the Dold-Kan functors, in terms of mapping complexes. We compute explicitly the 1-dual of a groupoid object and the 2-dual of a 2-groupoid object in the category of vector spaces. As the 1-dual of a groupoid object we recover its dual as a $\mathsf{VB}$ groupoid over the point.</description>

      <title>Topics in Weyl Geometry and Quantum Anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first part of this thesis focuses on the Weyl-covariant nature of holography. We generalize the Fefferman-Graham (FG) ambient construction for conformal geometry to a corresponding construction for Weyl geometry. Through the Weyl-ambient construction, we investigate Weyl-covariant quantities on the Weyl manifold and define Weyl-obstruction tensors. We show that Weyl-obstruction tensors appear as poles in the Fefferman-Graham expansion of the ALAdS bulk metric for even boundary dimensions. Under holographic renormalization in the Weyl-Fefferman-Graham gauge, we compute the Weyl anomaly of the boundary theory in multiple dimensions and demonstrate that Weyl-obstruction tensors can be used as the building blocks for the Weyl anomaly of the dual quantum field theory (QFT). The holographic calculation with a background Weyl geometry also suggests an underlying geometric interpretation of the Weyl anomaly.
  The second part of this thesis is devoted to understanding the geometric nature of the BRST formalism and quantum anomalies. Using the language of Lie algebroids, the BRST complex can be encoded in the exterior algebra of an Atiyah Lie algebroid derived from the principal bundle of the gauge theory. We showed that the cohomology of an Atiyah Lie algebroid in a trivialization gives rise to the BRST cohomology. We then apply the Lie algebroid cohomology in studying quantum anomalies and demonstrate the computation for chiral and Lorentz-Weyl anomalies. In particular, we pay close attention to the fact that the geometric intuition afforded by the Lie algebroid (which was absent in the traditional BRST complex) provides hints of a deeper picture that simultaneously geometrizes the consistent and covariant forms of the anomaly. In the algebroid construction, the difference between the consistent and covariant anomalies is simply a different choice of basis.</description>

      <title>Closed geodesics and the first Betti number</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that, on any closed manifold of dimension at least two with non-trivial first Betti number, a $C^\infty$ generic Riemannian metric has infinitely many closed geodesics, and indeed closed geodesics of arbitrarily large length. We derive this existence result combining a theorem of Ma\~n\'e together with the following new theorem of independent interest: the existence of minimal closed geodesics, in the sense of Aubry-Mather theory, implies the existence of a transverse homoclinic, and thus of a horseshoe, for the geodesic flow of a suitable $C^\infty$-close Riemannian metric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Five dimensional super conformal field theories can be studied using their geometric realisation as a limit of $M$-theory on a metrically conical Calabi-Yau threefold. We utilise this framework to investigate the phases of such theories that arise by varying the couplings away from the conformal point. We demonstrate that many 5d SCFTs, including strongly coupled gauge theories, have couplings giving rise to massive, confining vacua with confining strings and corresponding unbroken 1-form symmetries. The simplest examples arise by considering the parameter space of {\it complete} Ricci flat metrics on discrete quotients of the standard conifold singularity. Varying other couplings produces coupled 5d SCFTs interacting via massive BPS instanton particle states.</description>

      <title>Lattices, Gates, and Curves: GKP codes as a Rosetta stone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes are a promising candidate for implementing fault tolerant quantum computation in quantum harmonic oscillator systems such as superconducting resonators, optical photons and trapped ions, and in recent years theoretical and experimental evidence for their utility has steadily grown. It is known that logical Clifford operations on GKP codes can be implemented fault tolerantly using only Gaussian operations, and several theoretical investigations have illuminated their general structure. In this work, we explain how GKP Clifford gates arise as symplectic automorphisms of the corresponding GKP lattice and show how they are identified with the mapping class group of suitable genus $n$ surfaces. This correspondence introduces a topological interpretation of fault tolerance for GKP codes and motivates the connection between GKP codes (lattices), their Clifford gates, and algebraic curves, which we explore in depth. For a single-mode GKP code, we identify the space of all GKP codes with the moduli space of elliptic curves, given by the three sphere with a trefoil knot removed, and explain how logical degrees of freedom arise from the choice of a level structure on the corresponding curves. We discuss how the implementation of Clifford gates corresponds to homotopically nontrivial loops on the space of all GKP codes and show that the modular Rademacher function describes a topological invariant for certain Clifford gates implemented by such loops. Finally, we construct a universal family of GKP codes and show how it gives rise to an explicit construction of fiber bundle fault tolerance as proposed by Gottesman and Zhang for the GKP code. On our path towards understanding this correspondence, we introduce a general algebraic geometric perspective on GKP codes and their moduli spaces, which uncovers a map towards many possible routes of future research.</description>

Abstract: Given a pair $(X,\nabla)$, consisting of a closed Riemann surface $X$ and a holomorphic connection $\nabla$ on the trivial principal bundle $X\times\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})\to X$, the Riemann-Hilbert map sends $(X,\nabla)$ to its monodromy representation. We compute the derivative of this map, and provide a simple description of the locus where it is injective, recovering in the process several previously obtained results.</description>

Abstract: We develop a reduction scheme for the $L_\infty$-algebra of observables on a premultisymplectic manifold $(M,\omega)$ in the presence of a compatible Lie algebra action $\mathfrak{g}\curvearrowright M$ and subset $N\subset M$. This reproduces in the symplectic setting the Poisson algebra of observables on the Marsden-Weinstein-Meyer symplectic reduced space, whenever the reduced space exists, but is otherwise distinct from the Dirac, \'Sniatycki-Weinstein, and Arms-Cushman-Gotay observable reduction schemes. We examine various examples, including multicotangent bundles and multiphase spaces, and we conclude with a discussion of applications to classical field theories and quantization.</description>

Abstract: Consider the smooth sections of the tangent bundle of a reductive homogeneous space. This is a vector space over the field of real numbers. The canonical connection acts as a linear binary operator on this vector space, making it an algebra. If we include another binary operator defined as the negative of the torsion, the resulting algebraic structure is a post-Lie-Yamaguti algebra. This structure is closely related to Lie-Yamaguti algebras.</description>

Abstract: We show that every closed nonpositively curved surface satisfies Loewner's systolic inequality. The proof relies on a combination of the Gauss-Bonnet formula with an averaging argument using the invariance of the Liouville measure under the geodesic flow. This enables us to find a disk with large total curvature around its center yielding a large area.</description>

      <title>Prescribing scalar curvatures: loss of minimizability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prescribing conformally the scalar curvature on a closed manifold with negative Yamabe invariant as a given function $K$ is possible under smallness assumptions on $K_{+}=\max\{K,0\}$ and in particular, when $K&lt;0$. In addition, while solutions are unique in case $K\leq 0$, non uniqueness generally holds, when $K$ is sign changing and $K_{+}$ sufficiently small and flat around its critical points. These solutions are found variationally as minimizers. Here we study, what happens, when the relevant arguments fail to apply, describing on one hand the loss of minimizability generally, while on the other we construct a function $K$, for which saddle point solutions to the conformally prescribed scalar curvature problem still exist.</description>

      <title>Fattening in mean curvature flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For each $g\ge 3$, we prove existence of a compact, connected, smoothly embedded, genus-$g$ surface $M_g$ with the following property: under mean curvature flow, there is exactly one singular point at the first singular time, and the tangent flow at the singularity is given by a shrinker with genus $(g-1)$ and with two ends. Furthermore, we show that if $g$ is sufficiently large, then $M_g$ fattens at the first singular time. As $g\to\infty$, the shrinker converges to a multiplicity $2$ plane.</description>

      <title>Contextuality in the Bundle Approach, n-Contextuality, and the Role of Holonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.14132v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contextuality can be understood as the impossibility to construct a globally consistent description of a model even if there is local agreement. In particular, quantum models present this property. We can describe contextuality with the bundle approach, where the scenario is represented as a simplicial complex, the fibers being the sets of outcomes, and contextuality as the non-existence of global section in the measure bundle. Using the generalization to non-finite outcome fibers, we built in details the concept of measure bundle, demonstrating the Fine-Abramsky-Brandenburger theorem for the bundle formalism. We introduce a hierarchy called n-contextuality to explore the dependence of contextual behavior of a model to the topology of the scenario, following the construction of it as a simplicial complex. With it we exemplify the dependence on higher homology groups and show that GHZ models, thus quantum theory, has all levels of the hierarchy. Also, we give an example of how non-trivial topology of the scenario result an increase of contextual behavior. For the first level of the hierarchy, we construct the concept of connection through Markov operators for the measure bundle. Taking the case of equal fibers we can identify the outcomes as the basis of a vector space, that transform according to a group extracted from the connection. We thus show that contextuality has a relationship with the non-triviality of the holonomy group in the respective frame bundle.</description>

      <title>Prime geodesic theorem and closed geodesics for large genus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.10415v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{M}_g$ be the moduli space of hyperbolic surfaces of genus $g$ endowed with the Weil-Petersson metric. In this paper, we show that for any $\epsilon&gt;0$, as $g\to \infty$, for a generic surface in $\mathcal{M}_g$, the error term in the Prime Geodesic Theorem is bounded from above by $g\cdot t^{\frac{3}{4}+\epsilon}$, up to a uniform constant multiplication. The expected value of the error term in the Prime Geodesic Theorem over $\mathcal{M}_g$ is also studied. As an application, we show that as $g\to \infty$, on a generic hyperbolic surface in $\mathcal{M}_g$ most closed geodesics of length significantly less than $\sqrt{g}$ are simple and non-separating, and most closed geodesics of length significantly greater than $\sqrt{g}$ are not simple, which confirms a conjecture of Lipnowski-Wright.
  A novel effective upper bound for intersection numbers on $\mathcal{M}_{g,n}$ is also established, when certain indices are large compared to $\sqrt{g+n}$.</description>

      <title>Diameter of Compact Riemann Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.10844v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diameter is one of the most basic properties of a geometric object, while Riemann surfaces are one of the most basic geometric objects. Surprisingly, the diameter of compact Riemann surfaces is known exactly only for the sphere and the torus. For higher genuses, only very general but loose upper and lower bounds are available. The problem of calculating the diameter exactly has been intractable since there is no simple expression for the distance between a pair of points on a high-genus surface. Here we prove that the diameters of a class of simple Riemann surfaces known as generalized Bolza surfaces of any genus greater than $1$ are equal to the radii of their fundamental polygons. This is the first exact result for the diameter of a compact hyperbolic manifold.</description>

      <title>Null hypersurface data and ambient vector fields: Killing horizons of order zero/one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study null hypersurfaces admitting a privileged vector field $\eta$ which is null and tangent at the hypersurface. We derive an identity that relates the deformation tensor of $\eta$ with tensor fields codifying the intrinsic and extrinsic geometry of the hypersurface. This is done without imposing restrictions either on the topology of the hypersurface or on the (possibly empty) subset of points where $\eta$ vanishes. We introduce a generalized notion of surface gravity $\kappa$ that extends smoothly the usual one to the fixed points. We also analyze the properties of the Lie derivative of the Levi-Civita connection along $\eta$. This analysis allows us to introduce three new notions of abstractly defined horizons (i.e. not necessarily viewed as embedded submanifolds) that we then compare with the standard concepts of non-expanding, weakly isolated and isolated horizons. The former generalize the latter to completely general topologies and to horizons admitting fixed points. Finally, we study the structure of the fixed points on these new horizons.</description>

      <title>Upper bound for Steklov eigenvalues of warped products with fiber of dimension 2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13620v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we investigate the Steklov spectrum of the warped product $[0,L]\times_h \Sigma$ equipped with the metric $dt^2+h(t)^2g_\Sigma$, where $\Sigma$ is a compact surface. We find sharp upper bounds for the Steklov eigenvalues in terms of the eigenvalues of the Laplacian on $\Sigma$. We apply our method to the case of metric of revolution on the 3-dimensional ball and we obtain a sharp estimate on the spectral gap between two consecutive Steklov eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>Differential equations on a $k$-dimensional torus: Poincar\'e type results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15887v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ordinary differential equations of the first order on the torus have been investigated in detail by H. Poincar\'e and A. Denjoy. The long-standing problem of generalising these results for the equations of the order $k&gt;1$ (or for the systems of equations) is both important and difficult, requiring an essentially new approach. (See, e.g., an interesting old paper by P. Bohl.)
  In this paper, we propose a new (non-Hamiltonian) and promising approach. We use Hamiltonians, that is, ordinary differential systems of equations of the first order, only for heuristics. In the main scheme and corresponding proofs we do not use these systems. Instead of differential systems, we study sets of continuous vector functions $\phi(t,\eta)$ satisfying important conditions, which follow from the analogy with the solutions in the case $k=1$. Some of our results are new even in the case $k=1.$</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional fluids via matrix hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14282v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2-D) incompressible, inviscid fluids produce fascinating patterns of swirling motion. How and why the patterns emerge are long-standing questions, first addressed in the 19th century by Helmholtz, Kirchhoff, and Kelvin. Countless researchers have since contributed to innovative techniques and results, but the overarching problem of swirling 2-D motion and its long-time behavior remains largely open. Here we advocate an alternative view-point that sheds light on this problem via a link to isospectral matrix flows. The link is established through V. Zeitlin's beautiful model for the numerical discretization of Euler's equations in 2-D. When considered on the sphere, Zeitlin's model enables a deep connection between 2-D hydrodynamics and unitary representation theory of Lie algebras as pursued in quantum theory. Consequently, it provides a dictionary that maps hydrodynamical concepts to matrix Lie theory, which in turn gives connections to matrix factorizations, random matrices, and integrability theory, for example. The transferal of outcomes, from finite-dimensional matrices to infinite-dimensional fluids, is then supported by hard-fought results in quantization theory -- the field which describes the limit between quantum and classical physics. We demonstrate how the dictionary is constructed and how it unveils techniques for 2-D hydrodynamics. We also give accompanying convergence results for Zeitlin's model on the sphere.</description>

      <title>Flux Quantization on M5-branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The M5-brane has been argued to potentially provide much-needed theoretical underpinning for various non-perturbative phenomena in strongly-coupled quantum systems and yet the primary non-perturbative effect already in its classical on-shell formulation has received little attention: The flux-quantization of the higher gauge field on its worldvolume.
  This problem appears subtle because of (1a.) the notorious self-duality of the 3-form flux density in the small field limit, combined with (1b.) its highly non-linear self-duality for strong fields, and (2a.) the twisting of its Bianchi identity by the pullback of the 11d SuGra C-field flux density, which (2b.) is subject to its own subtle flux quantization law on the ambient spacetime.
  These subtleties call into question the tacit assumption that the M5 brane's 3-flux is quantized in ordinary cohomology and hence leaves open the rather fundamental question of what the M5-brane's worldvolume higher gauge field really is.
  Here we characterize the valid quantization laws of the M5-brane's 3-flux in (non-abelian) generalized twisted cohomology. The key step is to pass to super-spacetime and there to combine the character map with the "super-embedding"-construction of the on-shell M5-brane fields, of which we give a rigorous and streamlined re-rederivation.
  We show that one admissible quantization law of the 3-flux on M5-branes is by 4-Cohomotopy-twisted 3-Cohomotopy, as predicted by "Hypothesis H". Besides quantizing the bulk fluxes (G4,G7) and the brane's H3-flux themselves, this law also implies the (level-)quantization of the induced Page-charge/Hopf-WZ term on the M5-brane, necessary for its action functional to be globally well-defined.
  Finally, we demonstrate how with this flux quantization imposed, there generically appear skyrmionic solitons on M5-branes and anyonic topological quantum states on open M5-branes.</description>
