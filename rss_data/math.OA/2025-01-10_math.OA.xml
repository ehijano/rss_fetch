      <title>Hyperrigidity III</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study hyperrigidity for $C^*$-algebras. We will show that hyperrigidity can be expressed solely in terms of representations, without the need to involve general unital completely positive maps.</description>

      <title>Weighted norm estimates of noncommutative Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to studying weighted endpoint estimates of operator-valued singular integrals. Our main results include weighted weak-type $(1,1)$ estimate of noncommutative maximal Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund operators, corresponding version of square functions and a weighted $H_1- L_1$ type inequality. All these results are obtained under the condition that the weight belonging to the Muchenhoupt $A_1$ class and certain regularity assumptions imposed on kernels which are weaker than the Lipschitz condition.</description>

      <title>Fredholm anomalies on manifold with corners of low codimensions and conormal corner cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a connected manifold with corners $X$ of any codimension there is a very basic and computable homology theory called conormal homology defined in terms of faces and orientations of their conormal bundles, and whose cycles correspond geometrically to corner's cycles, these conormal homology groups are denoted by $H^{cn}_*(X)$. Using our previous works we define an index morphism $$K^0(^bT^*X)\stackrel{Ind_{ev,cn}^X}{\longrightarrow}H_{ev}^{cn}(X)$$ for $X$ a manifold with corners of codimension less or equal to three and called here the even conormal index morphism. In the case that $X$ is compact and connected and $D$ is an elliptic $b-$pseudodifferential operator in the associated $b-$calculus of $X$ we know, by our previous works and other authors works, that, up to adding an identity operator, $D$ can be perturbed (with a regularizing operator in the calculus) to a Fredholm operator iff $Ind_{ev,cn}^X([\sigma_D])$ (where $[\sigma_D]\in K^0(^bT^*X)$ is the principal symbol class) vanishes in the even conormal homology group $H_{ev}^{cn}(X)$. The main result of this paper is the explicit computation of the even and odd conormal index morphisms $Ind_{ev/odd,cn}^X(\sigma)\in H_{ev/odd}^{cn}(X)$ for $X$ a manifold with corners of codimension less or equal to three. The coefficients of the conormal corner cycles $Ind_{ev/odd,cn}^X(\sigma)$ are given in terms of some suspended Atiyah-Singer indices of the maximal codimension faces of $X$ and in terms of some suspended Atiyah-Patodi-Singer indices of the non-maximal codimension faces of $X$. As a corollary we give a complete caracterization to the obstruction of the Fredholm perturbation property for closed manifolds with corners of codimension less or equal to three in terms of the above mentioned indices of the faces, this allows us as well to give such a characterization in terms of the respective topological indices.</description>

      <title>Essential groupoid amenability and nuclearity of groupoid C*-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a new construction of the essential $C^*$-algebra of an \'etale groupoid, along with an "amenability" notion for such groupoids that characterizes the nuclearity of this essential $C^*$-algebra. In order to do this we first introduce a maximal version of the essential $C^*$-algebra, and prove that every function with dense co-support can only be supported in the set of "dangerous" arrows. We then introduce an essential amenability condition for a groupoid, which is (strictly) weaker than its (topological) amenability, and still implies that the essential $C^*$-algebra is nuclear (and isomorphic to its maximal counterpart). As an application, we describe the Bruce-Li algebras arising from algebraic actions of cancellative semigroups as exotic essential $C^*$-algebras. Moreover, we characterize when these $C^*$-algebras are nuclear.</description>
