      <title>A new partial differential nonlinear system containing quasivariational and parabolic variational inequalities and its application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a new nonlinear system which contains a partial differential equation, a quasivariational inequality and a parabolic variational inequality in Banach spaces. We obtain the unique solvability of the coupled system under moderate conditions by using the Banach's fixed point theorem. We employ the main results to investigate a viscoelastic frictional contact problem with long-memory effects, wear processes, and damage phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Dimension reduction for gradient damage models in slender rods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a method for reducing a three-dimensional gradient damage model to a one-dimensional model for slender rods (with a small radius-to-length ratio, $\delta = R/L \to 0$). The 3D model minimizes an energy functional that includes elastic strain energy, a damage-dependent degradation function $a_\eta(\alpha)$, a damage energy term $w(\alpha)$, and a gradient term penalizing abrupt damage variations. After non-dimensionalizing and rescaling, the problem is reformulated on a unit cylinder, and the behaviour of the energy functional is analyzed as $\delta$ approaches zero. Using $\Gamma$-convergence, we show that the sequence of 3D energy functionals converges to a 1D functional, defined over displacement and damage fields that are independent of transverse coordinates. Compactness results guarantee the weak convergence of strains and damage gradients, while lower and upper bound inequalities confirm the energy limit. Minimizers of the 3D energy are proven to converge to the minimizers of the 1D energy, with strains approaching a diagonal form indicative of uniaxial deformation.</description>

      <title>Irregular Diffusions and Loss of Regularity in Polyconvex Gradient Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate diffusion-type partial differential equations that are irregular in the sense that they admit weak solutions which are nowhere smooth, even for prescribed smooth data. By reformulating these equations as first-order partial differential relations and adapting the method of convex integration, we develop a construction scheme based on new geometric structures, referred to as $\mathcal{T}_N$-configurations, together with a simplified structural hypothesis on the diffusion functions, termed Condition $O_N$. Under this condition, we show that the associated initial and boundary value problems with certain smooth initial-boundary data admit infinitely many Lipschitz weak solutions that are nowhere $C^1$. We further analyze specific $\mathcal{T}_N$-configurations and establish nondegeneracy conditions that are essential for verifying Condition $O_N$. As an application, we construct examples of strongly polyconvex energy functionals whose gradient flows generate irregular diffusion equations, thereby revealing a failure of regularity and uniqueness even within the class of polyconvex gradient flows.</description>

      <title>Normalized Solutions for Schr\"odinger-Bopp-Podolsky Systems with Critical Choquard-Type Nonlinearity on Bounded Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study normalized solutions for the following critical Schr\"odinger-Bopp-Podolsky system: $$-\Delta u + q(x)\phi u = \lambda u + |u|^{p-2}u + \bigl(I_\alpha * |u|^{3+\alpha}\bigr)|u|^{1+\alpha}u,\quad \text{in } \Omega_r,$$ $$-\Delta\phi + \Delta^2\phi = q(x)u^2, \ \qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\ \text{ in } \Omega_r,$$ where $\Omega_r \subset \mathbb R^3$ is a smooth bounded domain, $p \in \left(2, \frac{8}{3}\right)$, $q(x) \in C(\bar\Omega_r) \backslash \{0\}$ and $\lambda \in \mathbb R$ is the Lagrange multiplier associated with the constraint $\int_{\Omega_r} |u|^2\, \mathrm d x = b^2$ for some $b &gt; 0$. Here $\alpha &gt; 0$, $I_\alpha$ denotes the Riesz potential, and the domain parameter $r$ reflects the size of $\Omega_r$ whose precise definition will be given in Section 3. By applying a special minimax principle together with a truncation technique, we prove that there exists $b^* &gt; 0$ such that the system admits multiple normalized solutions whenever $b \in (0, b^*)$ under Navier boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic stability of steady states for the compressible Navier-Stokes-Riesz system in the presence of vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a one-dimensional physical vacuum free boundary problem on the compressible Navier-Stokes-Riesz system for an attractive Riesz potential $|x|^{2s-1}/(2s-1)$ with $0&lt;s&lt;1/2$. It is proved that for the adiabatic constant $\gamma$ satisfying $2(1-s)&lt;\gamma&lt;1+2s/3$ under the additional condition that $3/8&lt;s&lt;1/2$, there exists a unique global-in-time strong solution. Specifically, we establish the Lyapunov-type stability of the compactly supported steady states in the Lagrangian coordinates and we also obtain the time rate of convergence for the strong solution to steady states with the same mass in weighted Sobolev spaces where the weights indicate the behavior of solutions near the vacuum free boundary. The difficulties and challenges in the proof are caused not only by the degeneracy due to the vacuum free boundary but also by the non-local feature of the Riesz potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the well-posedness and stability of degenerate Schr\"{o}dinger equation with a fractional boundary damping. First, we establish the well-posedness of the degenerate problem $\psi_t(x,t)-\imath(\tau(x) \psi_x(x,t))_x=0, \hbox{ with } x \in (0,1)$, controlled by Dirichlet-Neumann conditions. Then, exponential and polynomial decay rate of the solution are established using multiplier method.</description>

      <title>The unique limit of the Glimm-Lax construction for Sobolev data and obstructions to 1-d convex integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a genuinely nonlinear $1$-d system of hyperbolic conservation laws with two unknowns. A famous construction of Glimm &amp; Lax shows that global-in-time "Glimm-Lax" weak entropy solutions exist in this setting for any initial data with small $L^\infty$ norm [Mem. Amer. Math. Soc. (1970), no. 101]. Recent work in the $L^1$-stability theory by Bressan, Marconi &amp; Vaidya has given the first partial uniqueness and stability results for these solutions [Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal. (2025), vol. 249]. In this paper, we build on these results by combining them with recent advances in the $L^2$-theory. We show that solutions with initial data in the Sobolev space $H^s$ for $s&gt;0$ are unique in the full class of Glimm--Lax solutions that decay in total variation at a rate of $1/t$. As a secondary result, our techniques are also used to show the recent non-uniqueness result of Chen, Vasseur &amp; Yu for continuous solutions (arxiv:2407.02927) cannot extend to $C^\alpha$ solutions for $\alpha &gt; 1/2$, alongside some appropriate fractional Sobolev spaces $W^{s,p}$. An auxiliary result of independent interest is the development of a weighted relative entropy contraction for perturbations of rarefaction waves.</description>

      <title>On the well-posedness of two-dimensional Muskat problem with an elastic interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the two-dimensional Muskat problem with a nonlinear elastic interface, for both one-phase and two-phase scenarios. Following the framework developed by Nguyen [35,36], we demonstrate that the problem is locally well-posed in $H^s$ for $s\geq 2$ for arbitrary initial data. Furthermore, for the one-phase case and the stable two-phase case $(\rho^+ \leq \rho^-)$, we establish global well-posedness for small initial data in $H^s$ when $s&gt; \frac{3}{2}$.</description>

      <title>Construction of Solutions with Extraordinary Gradient Amplification and Localization for Schr\"odinger Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper constructs solutions to linear and nonlinear Schr\"odinger-type equations in two and three spatial dimensions that exhibit prescribed, extraordinary gradient amplification and localization. For any finite time interval $[0,T]$, any prescribed collection of $n\in\mathbb{N}$ distinct points on $\partial D$, where $D$ is the compact support of the anisotropic coefficients, lower-order terms, or nonlinearities, and any amplitude threshold $\mathcal{M}&gt;0$, we show that one can design smooth initial and/or boundary data such that the spatial gradients of the resulting solutions exceed $\mathcal{M}$ in neighborhoods of these points outside $D$ for almost every $t\in[0,T]$. Moreover, the ratio between the local $C^{1,\frac12}$-norm of the solution near each prescribed point outside $D$ and the $C^{1,\frac12}$-norm inside $D$ is bounded from below by $\mathcal{M}/2$ for almost every $t\in[0,T]$.
  We further prove that the spatial measure of the regions where the gradient magnitude exceeds $\mathcal{M}$ tends to zero as $\mathcal{M}\to\infty$, demonstrating that the amplification phenomenon is highly localized. This effect arises from the structure of the
  Schr\"odinger-type equation combined with carefully designed input profiles. From a physical perspective, the results provide a deterministic analogue of localization phenomena observed in quantum scattering and Anderson localization. In addition, the observed trade-off between extreme spatial localization and large gradient amplification is fully consistent with the spirit of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: while the latter is traditionally formulated in a global $L^2$ space--frequency framework, our results offer a complementary deterministic manifestation at the level of localized spatial gradients in Schr\"odinger dynamics.</description>

      <title>Fragmentation-coagulation processes with advection or diffusion in space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a continuous fragmentation--coagulation model in which the reacting particles can be transported in physical space through either advection or diffusion. We prove new results on the generation of $C_0$-semigroups with parameter and use them to show that the Abstract Cauchy Problem associated with a more general version of the advection/diffusion--fragmentation problem generates a positive $C_0$-semigroup in spaces $L_1(\mathbb R_+, X_x, (1+m^r)dm),$ where $m$ is the particle mass, $X_x$ is either the space of integrable or continuous functions with respect to the spatial variable, and the weight exponent $r$ is sufficiently large. These results enable us to prove the classical solvability of a wide range of advection/diffusion--fragmentation--coagulation equations with unbounded coagulation kernels.</description>

      <title>Interpolative Refinement of Gap Bound Conditions for Singular Parabolic Double Phase Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider inhomogeneous singular parabolic double phase equations of type $$ u_t-\operatorname{div}(|Du|^{p-2}Du + a(x,t)|Du|^{q-2}Du)=-\operatorname{div} (|F|^{p-2}F + a(x,t)|F|^{q-2}F) $$ in $\Omega_T := \Omega \times (0,T)\subset \mathbb{R}^n\times \mathbb{R}$, where $\frac{2n}{n+2}&lt;p\leq 2$, $p&lt;q$ and $0\leq a(\cdot)\in C^{\alpha,\frac{\alpha}{2}}(\Omega_T)$. We establish gradient higher integrability results for weak solutions to the above problems under one of the following two assumptions: $$ u\in L^\infty (\Omega_T) \quad\text{and}\quad q\leq p +\frac{\alpha(p(n+2)-2n)}{4}, $$ or $$ u\in C(0,T;L^s(\Omega)),\quad s\geq 2 \quad\text{and}\quad q\leq p+\frac{\alpha \mu_s}{n+s}, $$ where $\mu_s := \frac{(p(n+2)-2n)s}{4}$. These results yield an interpolation refinement of gap bounds in the singular parabolic double phase setting.</description>

      <title>Free boundary problem for two-dimensional ElectroHydroDynamic Equations with a gravity field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a two-phase free boundary problem governed by the ElectroHydroDynamic equations, which describes a perfectly conducting, incompressible, irrotational fluid with gravity, surrounded by a dielectric gas. The interface separating fluid and gas is referred to as the free boundary. 
It is known that the free surface remains smooth away from the stagnation points, where the relative velocity of the incompressible fluid vanishes. In the presence of gravity, the Stokes conjecture, proved by Varvaruca and Weiss [Acta. Math. 206, 363-403, (2011)], implies that the corner type singularity will occur in the one-phase incompressible fluid. It is natural to ask whether this conjecture still holds in the two-phase flow problem. As a consequence, the primary objective of this work is to characterize the possible singular profiles of the free interface near the stagnation points in the presence of an electric field. 
Our main result is the discovery of a critical decay rate of the electric field near the stagnation points which indicates the classification of the singular profiles of the free surface. More precisely, we showed that when the decay rate of the electric field is faster than the critical decay rate, its negligible effect implies that the singular profile must be the well-known Stokes corner. When the electric field decays as the critical decay rate, the symmetry of the corner region may be broken, giving rise to either a Stokes corner or an asymmetric corner as the possible singular profile. If the decay rate is slower than the critical decay rate, the electric field dominates and completely destroys the corner structure, resulting in a cusp singularity. The analysis of these singularities relies on variational principles and geometric methods. Key technical tools include a Weiss-type monotonicity formula, a frequency formula, and a concentration-compactness argument.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the energy decay of the solution to a viscoelastic wave equation with variable exponents logarithmic nonlinearity and weak damping in a bounded domain. We establish an explicit general decay result under mild conditions on the relaxation function $g$. Furthermore, under the general assumption $g'(t)\leq-\zeta(t)G(g(t))$ with some suitably given $\zeta$ and $G$, we derive a refined decay estimate improving existing results. In particular, uniform exponential and polynomial decay rates are obtained under a further special situation $g'(t)\leq-\xi(t)g^q(t)$ with $1\leq q&lt;2$, extending earlier studies that were restricted to the case $1\leq q&lt;\frac{3}{2}$.</description>

      <title>Self-Similar Solutions and Global Existence for Nonlinear Reaction-Diffusion Systems in Industrial Ammonia Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a system of nonlinear reaction-diffusion equations modeling the industrial synthesis of ammonia. By applying Lie group analysis, we construct self-similar solutions and derive a reduced system of ordinary differential equations. Using comparison principles and barrier techniques, we establish sufficient conditions for the existence of global-in-time solutions in both slow-diffusion ($\gamma_i &gt; 0$) and fast-diffusion ($\gamma_i &lt; 0$) regimes. Detailed asymptotic analysis near the diffusion front reveals power-law behavior of concentration profiles, with explicit expressions for the decay exponents. The theoretical results are illustrated by numerical simulations, demonstrating the spatio-temporal evolution of reactant concentrations under realistic parameter values. The study provides rigorous mathematical foundations for predicting and optimizing ammonia production in catalytic reactors, with potential extensions to other chemically reacting systems.</description>

      <title>Liouville type theorems for some $(p,q)$-Laplace equations with gradient dependent reaction on Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we combine Bochner formula, Saloff-Coste's Sobolev inequality and the Nash-Moser iteration method to study the local and global behaviors of solutions to the nonlinear elliptic equation $\Delta_pu+\Delta_qu+h(u,|\nabla u|^2)=0$ defined on a complete Riemannian manifold $\left(M,g\right)$, where $q\ge p&gt;1$, $h\in C^1(\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}^{+})$ and $\Delta_z u=\mathrm{div}\left(\left|\nabla u\right|^{z-2}\nabla u\right)$, with $z\in\{ p,~q\}$, is the usual $z$-Laplace operator. Under some assumptions on $p$, $q$ and $h(x,y)$, we derive concise gradient estimates for solutions to the above equation and then obtain some Liouville type theorems. In particular, we use integral estimate method to show that, if $u$ is a non-negative entire solution to $\Delta_p u +\Delta_q u=0$ ($n\le p\le q$) on a complete non-compact Riemannian manifold $M$ with non-negative Ricci curvature and $\dim M = n\ge2$, then $u$ is a trivial constant solution.</description>

      <title>Qualitative Aspects of Periodic Traveling Waves for the Sinh-Gordon equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of several aspects of the sinh-Gordon equation within a periodic setting. Our investigation proceeds in three main stages. First we establish the existence of periodic solutions for a fixed wave speed and varying periods by applying the mountain pass theorem. Subsequently, for a fixed period, we construct a family of periodic solutions that depend smoothly on the wave speed; this is achieved via the implicit function theorem. The spectral stability of these waves is then rigorously addressed. We perform a detailed spectral analysis of the linearized operator around the wave of fixed period. A key element in this analysis is the monotonicity of the period map, which, when combined with Morse index theory, enables us to fully characterize the non-positive spectrum of the projected operator in the space of zero-mean periodic functions. Finally, by employing the Hamiltonian-Krein index analysis, we determine the spectral stability and instability of the constructed waves. We additionally discuss qualitative aspects of the Cauchy problem associated with the sinh-Gordon equation, including local well-posedness and blow-up phenomena. The former supports a new linearization of the problem, while the latter predicts the spectral instability of the wave.</description>

      <title>A linear model of separation for western boundary currents with bathymetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the asymptotic analysis of strongly rotating and stratified fluids, under a $\beta$-plane approximation, and within a three-dimensional spatial domain with strong topography. Our purpose is to propose a linear idealized model, which is able to capture one of the key features of western boundary currents, in spite of its simplicity: the separation of the currents from the coast. Our simplified framework allows us to perform explicit computations, and to highlight the intricate links between rotation, stratification and bathymetry. In fact, we are able to construct approximate solutions at any order for our system, and to justify their validity. Each term in the asymptotic expansion is the sum of an interior part and of two boundary layer parts: a ``Munk'' type boundary layer, which is quasi-geostrophic, and an ``Ekman part'', which is not. Even though the Munk part of the approximation bears some similarity with previously studied 2D models, the analysis of the Ekman part is completely new, and several of its properties differ strongly from the ones of classical Ekman layers. Our theoretical analysis is supplemented with numerical illustrations, which exhibit the desired separation behavior.</description>

      <title>Global Hilbert expansion for the ionic Vlasov-Poisson-Boltzmann system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We justify the global-in-time validity of Hilbert expansion for the ionic Vlasov-Poisson-Boltzmann system in $\mathbb{R}^3$, a fundamental model describing ion dynamics in dilute collisional plasmas. As the Knudsen number approaches zero, we rigorously derive the compressible Euler-Poisson system governing global smooth irrotational ion flows. The truncated Hilbert expansion exhibits a multi-layered mathematical structure: the expansion coefficients satisfy linear hyperbolic systems, while the remainder equation couples with a nonlinear Poisson equation for the electrostatic potential. This requires refined elliptic estimates addressing the exponential nonlinearities and some new enclosed $L^2\cap W^{1,\infty}$ estimates for the potential-dependent terms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the hydrodynamics of compressible active nematic liquid crystals in a three-dimensional and bounded domain, with a nonlinear viscosity tensor and nonhomogeneous boundary data, in a Landau-de Gennes framework. We prove the existence of dissipative solutions within a Beris-Edwards type model for active nematodynamics, which are weak solutions satisfying the underlying equations modulo a defect measure. The proof follows from a three level approximation scheme -- the Galerkin approximation, the classical parabolic regularization of the continuity equation, and the convex regularization of the potential generating the viscous stress. New techniques are required to deal with non-Newtonian stress tensor, larger classes of admissible pressure potentials and nonhomogeneous boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Optimal Spectral Inequality for the Higher-Dimensional Landau Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove optimal spectral inequalities for Landau operators in full space and in arbitrary dimension. Spectral inequalities are lower bounds on the L 2 -mass of functions in spectral subspaces of finite energy when integrated over a sampling set S $\subset$ R d . Landau operators are Schr{\"o}dinger operators associated with a constant magnetic field of the form (-$\nabla$ + A(x)) 2 where A is a -in case of non-vanishing magnetic field -unbounded vector potential. Our strategy relies on so-called magnetic Bernstein estimates and analyticity, adapting an approach used by Kovrijkine in the context of the Logvinenko-Sereda theorem. We generalize results previously only known in dimension d = 2. The main difficulty in dimension d $\ge$ 3 are the magnetic Bernstein inequalities which, in comparison to the twodimensional case, lead to additional complications and require more delicate estimates. Our results have immediate consequences for control theory, spectral theory and mathematical physics which we comment on.</description>

Abstract: We study ionic electrodiffusion modeled by the Nernst--Planck equations describing the evolution of $N$ ionic species in a three-dimensional incompressible fluid flowing through a porous medium. We address the long-time dynamics of the resulting system in the three-dimensional whole space $\mathbb{R}^3$. We prove that the $k$-th spatial derivatives of each ionic concentration decays to zero in $L^2$ with a sharp rate of order $t^{-\frac{3}{4}-\frac{k}{2}}$. Moreover, we investigate the behavior of the relative entropy associated with the model and show that it blows up in time with a sharp growth rate of order $\log t$.</description>

      <title>Semi-Classical Localization of the Schr\"odinger Resolvent on Closed Riemann Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the localization properties of solutions to the semi-classical Schr\"odinger equation on closed Riemann surfaces. Unlike classical studies that assume a smooth potential, our work addresses the challenges arising from irregular potentials, specifically those that are merely bounded. We employ a regularization technique to manage the potential's lack of smoothness and establish a local-to-global estimate. This result provides a quantitative measure of how the local regularity of the potential influences the global concentration of the solution, thereby bridging the gap between smooth and non-continuous regimes in semi-classical analysis.</description>

      <title>Another look at regularity in transport-commutator estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are interested in how regular a transport velocity field must be in order to control Riesz-type commutators. Estimates for these commutators play a central role in the analysis of the mean-field limit and fluctuations for systems of particles with pairwise Riesz interactions, which we start by reviewing. Our first new result shows that the usual $L^\infty$ assumption on the gradient of the velocity field cannot, in general, be relaxed to a BMO assumption. We construct counterexamples in all dimensions and all Riesz singularities $-2&lt; s&lt;d$, except for the one-dimensional logarithmic endpoint $s=0$. At this exceptional endpoint, such a relaxation is possible, a fact related to the classical Coifman-Rochberg-Weiss commutator bound for the Hilbert transform. Our second result identifies a trade-off between the singularity of the interaction potential and the required regularity of the velocity field. Roughly speaking, smoother (less singular) interactions require stronger velocity control if one wants a commutator estimate in the natural energy seminorm determined by the potential. We formulate this principle for a broad class of potentials and show that, in the sub-Coulomb Riesz regime, the velocity regularity appearing in the known commutator inequality is sharp. Despite these negative findings, we show as our third result that a defective commutator estimate holds for almost-Lipschitz transport fields. Such a defective estimate, which is a consequence of the celebrated Brezis-Wainger-Hansson inequality, allows us to prove rates of convergence when the mean-field density belongs to the scaling-critical Sobolev space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the fractional Hardy inequality on the integer lattice. We prove null-criticality of the Hardy weight and hence optimality of the constant. More specifically, we present a family of Hardy weights with respect to a parameter and show that below a certain threshold the Hardy weight is positive critical while above the threshold it is subcritical. In particular, the Hardy weight at the threshold is optimal in the sense that any larger weight would fail to be a Hardy weight and the Hardy inequality does not allow for a minimizer. A crucial ingredient in our proof is an asymptotic expansion of the fractional discrete Riesz kernel.</description>

      <title>The inverse eigenvalue problems for perturbed Bessel operator with mixed data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider inverse eigenvalue problems for the perturbed Bessel operator in $L^{2}(0,1)$. (1) For the case where the angular-momentum quantum number $\ell\in\mathbb{N}\cup\{0\}$, we establish a uniqueness result for the inverse spectral problem by utilizing the closedness condition of a certain function system constructed based on the eigenvalues and the norming constants. (2) For the broader case where $\ell \geq -1/2$, we provide a uniqueness result for the inverse problem by using the density condition satisfied by the eigenvalues and the norming constants, where an additional smoothness condition may be imposed on the potential. (3) In the last section of this article, we present some corollaries based on (2). The results in these corollaries have already been established for the case $\ell=0$ by Gesztesy, Simon, Wei, Xu, Hatino\v{g}lu, et al., and we extend these results to the general case $\ell \geq -1/2$.</description>

Abstract: We give a simple construction of smooth, asymptotically flat vacuum initial data modeling a relativistic collapsing $N$--body system, with independently prescribed ADM energy, linear momentum, and angular momentum for each component, subject to the timelike condition $\E&gt;|\P|$. The initial data contain no trapped surfaces, and the future development contains multiple causally independent trapped regions that dynamically form from localized subsets of the initial slice. In particular, the maximal development of data with well-separated collapsing components and relative motion is expected to yield spacetimes containing multiple black holes.</description>

This completes a central component of our program of using topological methods to enumerating minimal surfaces with prescribed genus.
  As an application, we show that every 3-sphere of positive Ricci curvature contains at least 4 embedded minimal surfaces of genus 2.</description>

      <title>Latent Space Element Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How can we build surrogate solvers that train on small domains but scale to larger ones without intrusive access to PDE operators? Inspired by the Data-Driven Finite Element Method (DD-FEM) framework for modular data-driven solvers, we propose the Latent Space Element Method (LSEM), an element-based latent surrogate assembly approach in which a learned subdomain ("element") model can be tiled and coupled to form a larger computational domain. Each element is a LaSDI latent ODE surrogate trained from snapshots on a local patch, and neighboring elements are coupled through learned directional interaction terms in latent space, avoiding Schwarz iterations and interface residual evaluations. A smooth window-based blending reconstructs a global field from overlapping element predictions, yielding a scalable assembled latent dynamical system. Experiments on the 1D Burgers and Korteweg-de Vries equations show that LSEM maintains predictive accuracy while scaling to spatial domains larger than those seen in training. LSEM offers an interpretable and extensible route toward foundation-model surrogate solvers built from reusable local models.</description>

      <title>Quasi-linear equation $\Delta_pv+av^q=0$ on manifolds with integral bounded Ricci curvature and geometric applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider nonexistence and gradient estimate for solutions to $\Delta_pv +av^{q}=0$ defined on a complete Riemannian manifold with {\it $\chi$-type Sobolev inequality}. A Liouville theorem on this equation is established if the lying manifold $(M, g)$ supports a {\it $\chi$-type Sobolev inequality} and the $L^{\frac{\chi}{\chi-1}}$ norm of $\ric_-(x)$ of $(M, g)$ is bounded from upper by some constant depending on $\dim(M)$, Sobolev constant $\mathbb{S}_\chi(M)$ and volume growth order of geodesic ball $B_r\subset M$. This extends and improves some conclusions obtained recently by Ciraolo, Farina and Polvara \cite{CFP}, but our method employed in this paper is different from their ``P-function" method. In particular, for such manifold with a {\it $\chi$-type Sobolev inequality}, we give the lower estimate of volume growth of geodesic ball. If $\chi\leq n/(n-2)$, we also establish the local logarithm gradient estimate for positive solutions to this equation under the condition $\ric_-(x)$ is $L^\gamma$-integrable where $\gamma&gt;{\frac{\chi}{\chi-1}}$.
  As topological applications of main results(see \corref{main5}) we show that for a complete noncompact Riemannian manifold on which the Sobolev inequality \eqref{chi-n} holds true, $\dim(M)=n\geq 3$ and $\ric(x)\geq 0$ outside some geodesic ball $B(o,R_0)$, there exists a positive constant $C(n)$ depending only on $n$ such that, if $$\|\ric_-\|_{L^{\frac{n}{2}}}\leq C(n)\mathbb{S}_{\frac{n}{n-2}}(M),$$ then $(M, g)$ is of a unique end.</description>

      <title>Sub-Laplacian generalized curvature dimension inequalities on Riemannian foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a Bochner theory and Bakry-Emery calculus for horizontal Laplacians associated with general Riemannian foliations. No bundle-like assumption on the metric, nor any total geodesicity or minimality condition on the leaves is imposed. Using a metric connection adapted to the horizontal-vertical splitting, we derive explicit Bochner formulas for the horizontal Laplacian acting on horizontal and vertical gradients, as well as a unified identity for the full gradient. These formulas involve horizontal Ricci curvature, torsion and vertical mean curvature terms intrinsic to the foliated structure. From these identities, we establish generalized curvature dimension inequalities, extending earlier results in sub-Riemannian geometry. As applications, we obtain horizontal Laplacian comparison theorems, Bonnet-Myers type compactness results with explicit diameter bounds, stochastic completeness, first eigenvalue estimates and gradient and regularization estimates for the horizontal heat semigroup. The framework applies, in particular, to contact manifolds and Carnot groups of arbitrary step.</description>

      <title>Broadband quasistatic passive cloaking: bounds and limitations in the near-field regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider here several aspects of the following challenging question: is it possible to use a passive cloak to make invisible a dielectric inclusion on a finite frequency interval in the quasistatic regime of Maxwell's equations for an observer close to the object? In this work, by considering the Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) map, we not only answer negatively this question, but we go further and provide some quantitative bounds on this map that provide fundamental limits to both cloaking as well as approximate cloaking. These bounds involve the following physical parameters: the length and center of the frequency interval, the volume of the cloaking device, the volume of the obstacle, and the relative permittivity of the object. Our approach is based on two key tools: i) variational principles from the abstract theory of composites and ii) the analytic approach to deriving bounds from sum rules for passive systems. To use i), we prove a new representation theorem for the DtN map which allows us to interpret this map as an effective operator in the abstract theory of composites. One important consequence of this representation is that it allows one to incorporate the broad and deep results from the theory of composites, such as variational principles, and to apply the bounds derived from them to the DtN map. These results could be useful in other contexts other than cloaking. Next, to use ii), we show that the passivity assumption allows us to connect the DtN map (as function of the frequency) with two important classes of analytic functions, namely, Herglotz and Stieltjes functions. The sum rules for these functions, combined with the variational approach, allows us to derive new inequalities on the DtN map which impose fundamental limitations on passive cloaking, both exact and approximate, over a frequency interval. We consider both cases of lossy and lossless cloaks.</description>

      <title>Pointwise Regularity for Fully Nonlinear Elliptic Equations in General Forms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2012.00324v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop systematically the pointwise regularity for viscosity solutions of fully nonlinear elliptic equations in general forms. In particular, the equations with quadratic growth (called natural growth) in the gradient are covered. We obtain a series of interior and boundary pointwise $C^{k,\alpha}$ regularity ($k\geq 1$ and $0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$). In addition, we also derive the pointwise $C^k$ regularity ($k\geq 1$) and $C^{k,\mathrm{lnL}}$ regularity ($k\geq 0$), which correspond to the end points $\alpha=0$ and $\alpha=1$ respectively. Some regularity results are new even for the linear equations. Moreover, the minimum requirements are imposed to obtain above regularity and our proofs are simple.</description>

      <title>On the large-time asymptotics of the defocusing mKdV equation with step-like initial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.01299v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Cauchy problem for the defocusing modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equation with step-like initial data approaching nonzero constants $c_l$ and $c_r$ as $x \to -\infty$ and $x\to+\infty$, respectively. Assuming $c_l&gt;c_r&gt;0$, the solution exhibits a rarefaction wave structure. We first develop the inverse scattering transform for the solution satisfying these step-like boundary conditions. Using the associated scattering data, we prove that there exists a unique global solution of the Cauchy problem and characterize it in terms of a Riemann-Hilbert (RH) problem. By applying the nonlinear steepest descent method to this RH problem, we rigorously obtain large-time asymptotics of rarefaction wave solution in three distinct space-time regions, each characterized by a different leading order behavior. They are: (I) a left-field region where the solution approaches the left background constant, modulo a small oscillatory correction, (II) a central region where the solution exhibits a slowly varying profile that transitions between the two constants, and (III) a right-field region where the solution tends to the right background constant, up to an algebraically small correction. Rigorous derivations of the leading terms, sub-leading terms as well as the error bounds are presented.</description>

      <title>Global existence and pointwise decay for nonlinear waves under the null condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.03626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.03626v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proves global existence and sharp pointwise decay for solutions to nonlinear wave equations satisfying the semilinear null condition, on a class of three-dimensional, asymptotically flat, and notably, non-stationary spacetimes. We consider nonlinearities satisfying a generalized null condition which does not necessarily retain its structure when commuted with vector fields. For sufficiently small initial data, and under the assumption that the underlying linear operator satisfies an integrated local energy decay estimate, we prove that solutions exist for all time and we establish sharp pointwise decay estimates for the solution $\phi$ and its vector-fields. The solution itself decays as $|\phi(t,x)| \lesssim \langle t+r \rangle^{-1} \langle t-r \rangle^{-1}$. This rate matches that of the nonlinear equation on a flat background. This rate is sharp, as this behavior holds already for certain time-dependent perturbations of the classical null form on Minkowski space, which we specify.</description>

      <title>The combined non-equilibrium diffusion and low Mach number limits of the compressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier-P1 approximation radiation model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.10970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the combined non-equilibrium diffusion and low Mach number limits of the compressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier-P1 (NSF-P1) model with general initial data, which arises in the radiation hydrodynamics. Compared to the classical compressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier system, the NSF-P1 model has an asymmetric singular structure caused by the radiation field. To handle these singular terms, we introduce an equivalent pressure and an equivalent velocity to balance the order of singularity and establish the uniform estimates of solutions by designating appropriate weighted norms as well as carrying out delicate energy analysis. We conclude that, for partially general initial data and the strong scattering effect, the NSF-P1 model converges to the system of low Mach number heat-conducting viscous flows coupled with a diffusion equation. We also discuss the variations of the limit equations as the scattering intensity changes. Furthermore, when the scattering effect is sufficiently weak, we can obtain the singular limits of the NSF-P1 model with fully general initial data.</description>

      <title>Calder\'on problem for nonlocal viscous wave equations: Unique determination of linear and nonlinear perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main goal of this article is to study a Calder\'on type inverse problem for certain viscous nonlocal wave equations. We show that the partial Dirichlet to Neumann map uniquely determines on the one hand linear perturbations and on the other hand homogeneous nonlinearities $f(u)$ whenever the latter satisfy a certain growth assumption. As a preliminary step we discuss the well-posedness in each case, where for the nonlinear setting we invoke the implicit function theorem after establishing the differentiability of the associated Nemytskii operator $f(u)$. In the linear case we establish a Runge approximation theorem in $L^2(0,T;\widetilde{H}^{s}(\Omega))$, which allows us to uniquely determine potentials that belong only to $L^{\infty}(0,T;L^p(\Omega))$ for some $1&lt;p\leq \infty$ satisfying suitable restrictions. In the nonlinear case, we first derive an appropriate integral identity and combine this with the differentiability of the solution map around zero to show that the nonlinearity is uniquely determined by the Dirichlet to Neumann map. To make this linearization technique work, it is essential that we have a Runge approximation in $L^2(0,T;\widetilde{H}^s(\Omega))$ instead of $L^2(\Omega_T)$ at our disposal.</description>

Abstract: The existence of decompositions of the form $f=P\cdot q+r$ with $P_k^{\ast}\left( D\right) r=0$, where $f$ is entire, $P$ a polynomial and $P^{\ast}_k$ the principal part of $P$ with its coefficients conjugated, was achieved in \cite{AlRe23} under certain restrictions on the order of $f$. Here we prove uniqueness, thereby obtaining Fischer decompositions, under conditions that sometimes match those required for existence, and sometimes are more restrictive, depending on the parameters involved.</description>

      <title>Strong stabilization of damped nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equation with saturation on unbounded domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the damped nonlinear Schr\''{o}dinger equation with saturation: i.e., the complex evolution equation contains in its left hand side, besides the potential term $V(x)u,$ a nonlinear term of the form $\mathrm{i}\mu u(t,x)/|u(t,x)|$ for a given parameter $\mu &gt;0$ (arising in optical applications on non-Kerr-like fibers). In the right hand side we assume a given forcing term $f(t,x).$ The important new difficulty, in contrast to previous results in the literature, comes from the fact that the spatial domain is assumed to be unbounded. We start by proving the existence and uniqueness of weak and strong solutions according the regularity of the data of the problem. The existence of solutions with a lower regularity is also obtained by working with a sequence of spaces verifying the Radon-Nikod\'{y}m property. Concerning the asymptotic behavior for large times we prove a strong stabilization result. For instance, in the one dimensional case we prove that there is extinction in finite time of the solutions under the mere assumption that the $L^\infty$-norm of the forcing term $f(t,x)$ becomes less than $\mu$ after a finite time. This presents some analogies with the so called feedback \textit{bang-bang controls} $v$ (here $v=-\mathrm{i}\mu u/|u|+f).$</description>

      <title>Liouville type theorems for dual nonlocal evolution equations involving Marchaud derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05577v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a Liouville type theorem for the homogeneous dual fractional parabolic equation \begin{equation}
  \partial^\alpha_t u(x,t)+(-\Delta)^s u(x,t) = 0\ \ \mbox{in}\ \ \mathbb{R}^n\times\mathbb{R} . \end{equation} where $0&lt;\alpha,s&lt;1$. Under an asymptotic assumption $$\liminf_{|x|\rightarrow\infty}\frac{u(x,t)}{|x|^\gamma}\geq 0 \; ( \mbox{or} \; \leq 0) \,\,\mbox{for some} \;0\leq\gamma\leq 1, $$ in the case $\frac{1}{2}&lt;s &lt; 1$, we prove that all solutions in the sense of distributions of above equation must be constant by employing a method of Fourier analysis. Our result includes the previous Liouville theorems on harmonic functions \cite{ABR} and on $s$-harmonic functions \cite{CDL} as special cases and it is still novel even restricted to one-sided Marchaud fractional equations, and our methods can be applied to a variety of dual nonlocal parabolic problems.
  In the process of deriving our main result, through very delicate calculations, we obtain an optimal estimate on the decay rate of $\left[D_{\rm right}^\alpha+(-\Delta)^s\right] \varphi(x,t)$ for functions in Schwartz space. This sharp estimate plays a crucial role in defining the solution in the sense of distributions and will become a useful tool in the analysis of this family of equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17261v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the time asymptotic stability of composite waves formed by two shock waves within the context of one-dimensional relaxed compressible Navier-Stokes equations. We demonstrate that the composite waves consisting of two viscous shocks achieve asymptotic nonlinear stability under the condition of having two small, independent wave strengths and the presence of minor initial perturbations. Furthermore, the solutions of the relaxed system are observed to globally converge over time to those of the classical system as the relaxation parameter approaches zero. The methodologies are grounded in relative entropy, the $a$-contraction with shifts theory and fundamental energy estimates.</description>

Abstract: This paper is concerned with a three-component chemotaxis model accounting for indirect signal production,reading as $u_t = \nabla\cdot(\nabla u - u\nabla v)$,$v_t = \Delta v - v + w$ and $0 = \Delta w - w + u$,posed in a ball of $\mathbb R^n$ with $n\geq5$,subject to homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions.The system is a Nagai-type variant of its fully parabolic version that has a four-dimensional critical mass phenomenon concerning blowup in finite or infinite time according to the seminal works of Fujie and Senba [J. Differential Equations, 263 (2017), 88--148; 266 (2019), 942--976].We prove that for any prescribed mass $m &gt; 0$, there exist radially symmetric and positive initial data $(u_0,v_0)\in C^0(\overline{\Omega})\times C^2(\overline{\Omega})$ with $\int_\Omega u_0 = m$ such that the corresponding solutions blow up in finite time.</description>

      <title>Boundary regularity theory of the singular Lane-Emden-Fowler equation in a Lipschitz domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16095v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the singular Lane-Emden-Fowler equation \begin{equation}
  -\Delta u=f(X)\cdot u^{-\gamma} \end{equation} in a bounded Lipschitz domain $\Omega$, with the Dirichlet boundary condition and a positive, bounded function $f(X)$. A distinguishing feature is that the vanishing boundary condition introduces a singularity in the equation.
  We focus on the well-posedness of the equation and the growth rate of solutions near the boundary. The key is to classify the limiting cone of a boundary point into three categories based on its "frequency", and obtain distinct growth rate estimates for each case.
  Additionally, we discuss the boundary Harnack principle for the singular Lane-Emden-Fowler equation, which is essential in deriving the boundary growth rate estimate. To our knowledge, the boundary Harnack principle we derive is the first Kemper-type estimate for singular semi-linear equations. It notably differs from the classical one for linear equations, in particular, the boundedness of the ratio \(u/v\) does not imply its continuity.
  To address the lack of a suitable upper barrier, we introduce new techniques, including constructing upper barriers iteratively. We also construct a subharmonic auxiliary function $V(X)$ related to the solution $u$ in the limiting cone. The growth rate of $u(X)$ is then obtained inductively from the growth rate of the auxiliary function $V(X)$. Our results and methods offer novel insights into the behavior of singular elliptic equations in non-smooth domains.</description>

      <title>A nonvariational form of the acoustic single layer potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12349v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a bounded open subset $\Omega$ of ${\mathbb{R}}^n$ of class $C^{1,\alpha}$ for some $\alpha\in]0,1[$ and the space $V^{-1,\alpha}(\partial\Omega)$ of (distributional) normal derivatives on the boundary of $\alpha$-H\"{o}lder continuous functions in $\Omega$ that have Laplace operator in the Schauder space with negative exponent $C^{-1,\alpha}(\overline{\Omega})$. Then we prove those properties of the acoustic single layer potential that are necessary to analyze the Neumann problem for the Helmholtz equation in $\Omega$ with boundary data in $V^{-1,\alpha}(\partial\Omega)$ and solutions in the space of $\alpha$-H\"{o}lder continuous functions in $\Omega$ that have Laplace operator in $C^{-1,\alpha}(\overline{\Omega})$, \textit{i.e.}, in a space of functions that may have infinite Dirichlet integral. Namely, a Neumann problem that does not belong to the classical variational setting.</description>

      <title>Monotonicity of the Laplace Transform for Tomography in Dissipative Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of tomography for the interior of dissipative materials, with a focus on Magnetic Induction Tomography (MIT), a proven technique for imaging the interior of conductive materials using low-frequency electromagnetic fields.
  Processing MIT data is mathematically challenging because of the non-linear and ill-posed nature of the underlying inverse problem. On the other hand, the Monotonicity Principle is recognized as the basis for developing effective approaches.
  In this framework, the paper presents a principle of monotonicity for the Transfer Operator in Magnetic Induction Tomography, i.e. the operator mapping the Laplace transform of the applied source onto the Laplace transform of the measured quantity. Specifically, it is proved that the Transfer Operator satisfies a Monotonicity Principle when evaluated on a proper real semi-axis of the complex plane. The description of the related (real-time) imaging method is also given.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15795v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a drift-diffusion process of $N$ stochastic particles and show that its empirical measure converges, as $N\rightarrow \infty$, to the solution of the Landau equation. We work in the regime of very soft and Coulomb potentials using a tightness/uniqueness method. To claim uniqueness, we need high integrability estimates that we obtain by crucially exploiting the dissipation of the Fisher information at the level of the particle system. To be able to exploit these estimates as $N\rightarrow \infty$, we prove the affinity in infinite dimension of the entropy production and Fisher information dissipation (and other first and second-order versions of the Fisher information through a general theorem), results which were up to now only known for the entropy and the usual Fisher information.</description>

Abstract: In the note, various scenarios of potential Type II blowups of suitable weak solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations are studied. It is shown, that under some assumptions, such type of blowups cannot happen. In this case, corresponding statements may be interpreted as regularity results. Their justification is based on a technique making use of a certain Euler scaling and Liouville type theorems for ancient solutions to the Euler system.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the propagation of wave packets close to conical intersections with respect to a system of two Schr{\"o}dinger equations presenting a codimension 2 crossing. We focus on the dynamics that occur when the wave packets pass through an area close to the crossing, and our main results provide an explicit formula for the outgoing wave packet in terms of the incoming one, with a complete description of its phase and of the classical trajectories it follows, including a drift.</description>

      <title>A relativistic quantum Euler-Poisson system derived from the Klein-Gordon-Poisson equation: hyperbolic-elliptic structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the Klein-Gordon equation, quantum and relativistic parameters are strongly coupled, which poses significant analytical challenges in the derivation and analysis of related classical fluid models. In this paper, starting from the Klein-Gordon-Poisson system, we formally derive a relativistic quantum hydrodynamic (RQHD) system via the Madelung transformation, in which the relativistic and quantum correction terms in the Euler-Poisson framework are clearly exhibited. In particular, at a formal level, the RQHD system reduces to the relativistic hydrodynamics system in the semiclassical regime and to the quantum hydrodynamics system in the non-relativistic regime. These limiting procedures highlight the unified structure of the proposed model and clarify the role played by the coupled relativistic and quantum effects. From an analytical point of view, by reformulating the RQHD system as a coupled hyperbolic-elliptic system with a nonlocal Poisson interaction, we establish the local-in-time existence and uniqueness of classical solutions to the associated Cauchy problem. The initial density is assumed to be a small perturbation of a positive constant state, while the remaining initial data are taken to be general smooth functions. The analysis relies on energy estimates and suitable estimates for the nonlocal terms, and provides a rigorous well-posedness result in the natural energy space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22003v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work aims to study the rates in the context of periodic homogenization of parabolic problems with large lower order terms (both drift and potential). We demonstrate that the solution is a product of three terms: (i) a function of time, (ii) the ground-state of an exponential cell eigenvalue problem and (iii) the solution to a parabolic equation with zero effective drift. For the latter, we derive $\mathrm L^2$ rates in the homogenization limit.</description>

      <title>An almost-almost-Schur lemma on the 3-sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the conformal class of the standard metric on the $3$-sphere, we prove a quantitative refinement of the Andrews-De Lellis-Topping inequality in terms of a two-term distance to the set of minimizing conformal factors. This inequality is itself a stability result for the well-known Schur lemma and is therefore referred to as almost-Schur lemma. Hence, our stability result may be viewed as an almost-almost-Schur lemma.
  As a consequence, we deduce via interpolation the quantitative stability of an entire family of nonlinear Yamabe-type inequalities, including an inequality for the total volume-normalized $\sigma_2$-curvature $\mathcal F_2$. This extends a recent result by Frank and the second author for $d &gt; 4$ to the case $d=3$. While the standard metric minimizes $\mathcal F_2$ if $d &gt; 4$, it maximizes $\mathcal F_2$ if $d=3$. This is the main challenge in treating the case $d=3$ as it turns the related functional inequality into a reverse Sobolev-type inequality.</description>

Abstract: We study a class of fourth-order quasilinear degenerate parabolic equations under both time-and space-dependent and time-and space-independent forces, modeling non-Newtonian thin-film flow over a solid surface in the "complete wetting" regime. By analyzing the quantitative properties of solutions to non-autonomous differential inequalities and employing refined integral estimates, we derive two-sided convergence rate estimates for the solution. Numerical simulations are further provided to illustrate the consistency of our main results with the observed physical phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove some Liouville-type theorems for positive harmonic functions on compact Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature and strictly convex boundary, thereby confirming some cases of Wang's conjecture (J. Geom. Anal. 31, 2021).
  We further investigate Wang's conjecture on warped product manifolds and provide a partial verification of this conjecture, which also yields an alternative proof of Gu-Li's resolution of the conjecture in the $\mathbb{B}^n$ case (Math. Ann. 391, 2025). Our approach is based on a general principle of employing the P-function method to such Liouville-type results, with particular emphasis on the role of a closed conformal vector field inherent to such manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the first quantitative Runge approximation theorem, with explicit $L^2$-estimates, for the 3d nonstationary Stokes system on a bounded spatial domain. This result addresses the two primary limitations of the qualitative result [H.-Sueur, 2025] obtained in collaboration with Franck Sueur: first, it bypasses the non-constructive Hahn-Banach theorem used in [H.-Sueur, 2025], precluding quantitative estimates; and second, it extends the scope of the theory from interior approximations to the physically important initial-boundary value problem. Our proof is founded on the modern quantitative framework of [R\"{u}land-Salo, 2019], which we adapt to the Stokes system by combining semigroup theory with a quantitative approximation for the associated resolvent problem.</description>

Abstract: We show existence and optimal growth estimate for the weak inverse mean curvature flow issuing from a point, on manifolds with certain curvature and isoperimetric conditions. These theorems imply analogous ones for the flow issuing from relatively compact sets. Some of the results are obtained by proving new decay estimates for the Green kernel of the $p$-Laplacian which fix a gap in the literature. Additionally, we address the convergence of renormalized $p$-capacitary potentials to the inverse mean curvature flow with outer obstacle.</description>

Abstract: We study the internal non null-controllability properties of the heat equation on 2-dimensional almost-Riemannian manifolds with an interior singularity, and under the assumption that the closure of the control zone does not contain the whole singularity. We show that if locally, around the singularity, the sub-Riemannian metric can be written in a Grushin form, or equivalently the sub-Laplacian writes as a generalized Grushin operator, then, achieving null-controllability requires at least a minimal amount of time. As locally the manifold looks like a rectangular domain, we consequently focus ourselves on the non null-controllability properties of the generalized Grushin-like heat equation on various Euclidean domains.</description>

Abstract: We establish a general min-max type theorem that produces minimal surfaces with prescribed genus in 3-manifolds with positive Ricci curvature. An important intermediate step is to show that, in a generic metric with positive Ricci curvature, any family of smooth embedded surfaces, possibly with finitely many singularities, can be deformed into a certain ``topologically optimal family".
  Results in this paper will be crucial to our program on the construction of multiple minimal surfaces with prescribed genus in 3-spheres via topological methods.</description>

      <title>Semi-analytical pricing of American options with hybrid dividends via integral equations and the GIT method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a semi-analytical method for pricing American options on assets (stocks, ETFs) that pay discrete and/or continuous dividends. The problem is notoriously complex because discrete dividends create abrupt price drops and affect the optimal exercise timing, making traditional continuous-dividend models unsuitable. Our approach utilizes the Generalized Integral Transform (GIT) method introduced by the author and his co-authors in a number of papers, which transforms the pricing problem from a complex partial differential equation with a free boundary into an integral Volterra equation of the second or first kind. In this paper we illustrate this approach by considering a popular GBM model that accounts for discrete cash and proportional dividends using Dirac delta functions. By reframing the problem as an integral equation, we can sequentially solve for the option price and the early exercise boundary, effectively handling the discontinuities caused by the dividends. Our methodology provides a powerful alternative to standard numerical techniques like binomial trees or finite difference methods, which can struggle with the jump conditions of discrete dividends by losing accuracy or performance. Several examples demonstrate that the GIT method is highly accurate and computationally efficient, bypassing the need for extensive computational grids or complex backward induction steps.</description>

We prove a one-parameter family of weighted Bakry-\'Emery $\Gamma_2$ criterion inequalities which in the limit case yields the improved constant due to Ji \cite{Ji24}. Furthermore, we establish a modified weighted $\Gamma_2$ criterion inequality which could be interpreted as a monotonicity of the Tsallis entropy under the heat flow and yields a family of sharp Sobolev inequalities.</description>
