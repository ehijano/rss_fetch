      <title>Negative non-Gaussianity as a salvager for PBHs with PTAs in bounce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Gaussianity in the primordial curvature perturbation is a crucial element of the early universe due to its significant impact on the primordial black hole (PBH) production. In this work, we focus on the effects of negative non-Gaussianity on PBH abundance through the lens of the compaction function criterion for PBH formation. Our setup utilizes an effective field theory of non-singular bounce, including the standard slow-roll inflation with an ultra-slow roll phase for amplifying the curvature perturbations to form PBHs. We investigate with two separate values of the non-Gaussianity parameter, $f_{\rm NL}=(-39.95,-35/8)$, found within the ekpyrotic contraction and the matter bounce scenarios, respectively, and show that a negatively large amount of $f_{\rm NL}$ can provide sizeable abundance, $10^{-3}\leq f_{\rm PBH}\leq 1$, and completely mitigates the PBH overproduction issue. We also highlight that the case with the effective sound speed $c_{s}=1$, coupled with $f_{\rm NL}=-39.95$, provides an agreement under $1\sigma$ for the scalar-induced gravitational wave explanation of the latest PTA (NANOGrav15 and EPTA) signal. Lastly, we extract an upper bound on the most negative value of, $f_{\rm NL}\sim -60$, below which we show breaching of the underlying perturbativity constraints on the power spectrum amplitude.</description>

      <title>BullFrog: Multi-step perturbation theory as a time integrator for cosmological simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modelling the cosmic large-scale structure can be done through numerical N-body simulations or by using perturbation theory. Here, we present an N-body approach that effectively implements a multi-step forward model based on Lagrangian Perturbation Theory (LPT) in a $\Lambda$CDM Universe. This is achieved by introducing the second-order accurate BullFrog integrator, which performs 2LPT time steps (before shell-crossing) to second order without requiring the explicit computation of 2LPT displacements, while the higher-order terms rapidly approach the exact solution as the number of time steps increases. As a validation test, we compare BullFrog against other N-body integrators and high-order LPT, both for a realistic $\Lambda$CDM cosmology and for simulations with a sharp UV cutoff in the initial conditions. The latter scenario enables controlled experiments against LPT and, in practice, is particularly relevant for modelling coarse-grained fluids arising in the context of effective field theory. We demonstrate that BullFrog significantly improves upon other LPT-inspired integrators, such as FastPM and COLA, without incurring any computational overhead compared to standard N-body integrators. Implementing BullFrog in any existing N-body code is straightforward, particularly if FastPM is already integrated.</description>

      <title>Constraining primordial non-Gaussianity by combining photometric galaxy and 21cm intensity mapping surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fluctuations produced during cosmic inflation may exhibit non-Gaussian characteristics that are imprinted in the large-scale structure of the Universe. This non-Gaussian imprint is an ultra-large scale signal that can be detected using the power spectrum. We focus on the local-type non-Gaussianity $f_{\rm{NL}}$ and employ a multi-tracer analysis that combines different probes in order to mitigate cosmic variance and maximize the non-Gaussian signal. In our previous paper, we showed that combining spectroscopic galaxy surveys with 21cm intensity mapping surveys in interferometer mode could lead to a $\sim 20-30\%$ improvement in the precision on this non-Gaussian signal. Here we combine the same 21 cm experiments, including also single-dish surveys, with photometric galaxy surveys. The 21 cm single-dish surveys are based on MeerKAT and SKAO and the interferometric surveys are alike to HIRAX and PUMA. We implement foreground-avoidance filters and utilize models for the 21 cm thermal noise associated with single-dish and interferometer modes. The photometric galaxy surveys are similar to the DES and LSST. Our multi-tracer Fisher forecasts show a better precision for the combination of the photometric galaxy surveys and 21 cm interferometric surveys than with the 21 cm single-dish surveys -leading to at most an improvement of $23\%$ in the former case and $16\%$ in the latter case. Furthermore, we examine the impact of varying the foreground filter parameter, redshift range and sky area on the derived constraint. We find that the $f_{\rm{NL}}$ constraint is highly sensitive to both the redshift range and sky area. The foreground filter parameter shows negligible effect.</description>

      <title>Testing the framework of the halo occupation distribution with assembly bias modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate theoretical systematics caused by the application of the halo occupation distribution (HOD) to the study of galaxy clustering at non-linear scales. To do this, we repeat recent cosmological analyses using extended HOD models based on both the Aemulus and Aemulus $\nu$ simulation suites, allowing for variations in the dark matter halo shape, incompleteness, baryonic effects and position bias of central galaxies. We fit to the galaxy correlation function including the projected correlation function, redshift space monopole and quadrupole, and consider how the changes in HOD affect the retrieval of cosmological information. These extensions can be understood as an evaluation of the impact of the secondary bias in the clustering analysis. In the application of BOSS galaxies, these changes do not have a significant impact on the measured linear growth rate. But, we do find weak to mild evidence for some of the effects modeled by the empirical parameterizations adopted. The modeling is able to make the HOD approach more complete in terms of cosmological constraints. We anticipate that the future and better data can provide tighter constraints on the new prescriptions of the HOD model.</description>

      <title>Non-Gaussian Statistics of Nanohertz Stochastic Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent detection of nHz stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) by multiple pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) has stimulated intensive discussions about its physical origin. In principle, either supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) or processes in the early universe may be the sources. One key difference between the two lies in the statistics of the SGWB frequency power spectrum. In particular, the often assumed Gaussian random SGWB does not accurately describe the distribution of the collective SMBHB emission. In this work, we present a semi-analytical framework for calculating the non-Gaussian statistics of SGWB power expected from SMBHBs. We find that (a) wave interference between individual SMBHBs with indistinguishable observed frequencies and (b) the Poisson fluctuation of the source numbers, together shape the non-Gaussian statistics. Implementing the non-Gaussian statistics developed in this work, we investigate the sensitivity of current and future PTA datasets in distinguishing the origin of the SGWB through non-Gaussian information. Additionally, we find an interesting approximation of the non-Gaussian statistics, which has implications for accurately and practically treating non-Gaussianity in PTA Bayesian analyses.</description>

      <title>The Necessity of Individually Validated Beam Models for an Interferometric Epoch of Reionization Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A first statistical detection of the 21-cm Epoch of Reionization (EoR) is on the horizon, as cosmological volumes of the Universe become accessible via the adoption of low-frequency interferometers. We explore the impact which non-identical instrumental beam responses can have on the calibrated power spectrum and a future EoR detection. All-sky satellite measurements of Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) beams have revealed significant sidelobe deviations from cutting-edge electromagnetic simulations at the ~10% zenith power level. By generating physically motivated deformed beam models, we emulate real measurements of the MWA which inherently encode the imprints of varied beams. We explore two calibration strategies: using a single beam model across the array, or using a full set of deformed beams. Our simulations demonstrate beam-induced leakage of foreground power into theoretically uncontaminated modes, at levels which exceed the expected cosmological signal by factors of over ~1000 between the modes k=0.1-1 $hMpc^{-1}$. We also show that this foreground leakage can be mitigated by including measured models of varied beams into calibration frameworks, reducing the foreground leakage to a sub-dominant effect and potentially unveiling the EoR. Finally, we outline the future steps necessary to make this approach applicable to real measurements by radio interferometers.</description>

      <title>Explanation of high redshift luminous galaxies from JWST by early dark energy model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have uncovered massive galaxies at high redshifts, with their abundance significantly surpassing expectations. This finding poses a substantial challenge to both galaxy formation models and our understanding of cosmology. Additionally, discrepancies between the Hubble parameter inferred from high-redshift cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations and those derived from low-redshift distance ladder methods have led to what is known as the ``Hubble tension''. Among the most promising solutions to this tension are Early Dark Energy (EDE) models. In this study, we employ an axion-like EDE model in conjunction with a universal Salpeter initial mass function to fit the luminosity function derived from JWST data, as well as other cosmological probes, including the CMB, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), and the SH0ES local distance ladder. Our findings indicate that JWST observations favor a high energy fraction of EDE, $ f_\text{EDE} \sim 0.2 \pm 0.03 $, and a high Hubble constant value of $ H_0 \sim 74.6 \pm 1.2 $ km/s/Mpc, even in the absence of SH0ES data. This suggests that EDE not only addresses the $ H_0 $ tension but also provides a compelling explanation for the observed abundance of massive galaxies identified by JWST.</description>

      <title>Cross-correlation between the curvature perturbations and magnetic fields in pure ultra slow roll inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the aim of producing significant number of primordial black holes, over the past few years, there has been a considerable interest in examining models of inflation involving a single, canonical field, that permit a brief period of ultra slow roll. Earlier, we had examined inflationary magnetogenesis - achieved by breaking the conformal invariance of the electromagnetic action through a coupling to the inflation - in situations involving departures from slow roll. We had found that a transition from slow roll to ultra slow roll inflation can lead to a strong blue tilt in the spectrum of the magnetic field over small scales and also considerably suppress its strength over large scales. In this work, we consider the scenario of pure ultra slow roll inflation and show that scale invariant magnetic fields can be obtained in such situations with the aid of a non-conformal coupling function that depends on the kinetic energy of the inflaton. Apart from the power spectrum, an important probe of the primordial magnetic fields are the three-point functions, specifically, the cross-correlation between the curvature perturbations and the magnetic fields. We calculate the three-point cross-correlation between the curvature perturbations and the magnetic fields in pure ultra slow roll inflation for the new choice of the non-conformal coupling function. In particular, we examine the validity of the consistency condition that is expected to govern the three-point function in the squeezed limit and comment on the wider implications of the results we obtain.</description>

      <title>StratLearn-z: Improved photo-$z$ estimation from spectroscopic data subject to selection effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A precise measurement of photometric redshifts (photo-z) is key for the success of modern photometric galaxy surveys. Machine learning (ML) methods show great promise in this context, but suffer from covariate shift (CS) in training sets due to selection bias where interesting sources are underrepresented, and the corresponding ML models show poor generalisation properties. We present an application of the StratLearn method to the estimation of photo-z, validating against simulations where we enforce the presence of CS to different degrees. StratLearn is a statistically principled approach that relies on splitting the source and target datasets into strata based on estimated propensity scores (i.e. the probability for an object to be in the source set given its observed covariates). After stratification, two conditional density estimators are fit separately to each stratum, then combined via a weighted average. We benchmark our results against the GPz algorithm, quantifying the performance of the two codes with a set of metrics. Our results show that the StratLearn-z metrics are only marginally affected by the presence of CS, while GPz shows a significant degradation of performance in the photo-z prediction for fainter objects. For the strongest CS scenario, StratLearn-z yields a reduced fraction of catastrophic errors, a factor of 2 improvement for the RMSE and one order of magnitude improvement on the bias. We also assess the quality of the conditional redshift estimates with the probability integral transform (PIT). The PIT distribution obtained from StratLearn-z features fat fewer outliers and is symmetric, i.e. the predictions appear to be centered around the true redshift value, despite showing a conservative estimation of the spread of the conditional redshift distributions. Our julia implementation of the method is available at \url{https://github.com/chiaramoretti/StratLearn-z}.</description>

      <title>A holistic exploration of the potentially recoverable redshift information of Stage IV galaxy surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extragalactic science and cosmology with Stage IV galaxy surveys will rely almost exclusively on redshift measurements derived solely from photometry, which are subject to systematic and statistical uncertainties with numerous analysis choices, such as that of an estimator and prior information and no universal solution. Single-survey photometric redshift estimates ought to be improved by combining data from multiple surveys, with common wisdom asserting that optical data benefits from additional infrared coverage but not from additional ultraviolet coverage. The degree of improvement for either case is not well-characterized and attempts to quantify it necessitate assumptions of a chosen estimator and its prior information. We apply an information theoretic metric of potentially recoverable redshift information to assess the impact of multi-survey photometry combinations without assuming an estimator nor priors in the context of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) in the optical, Roman and Euclid Surveys in the infrared, and Cosmological Advanced Survey Telescope for Optical-UV Research (CASTOR) in the ultraviolet. We conclude that the addition of UV photometry can benefit redshift determination of certain galaxy populations, but that gain is tempered by their decreased chance of meeting detection criteria at higher wavelengths. We explore the spectral energy distribution (SEDs) of galaxies whose potentially recoverable redshift information is most impacted by additional photometry to provide a basis for future evaluation of which science cases may motivate which combinations. The holistic assessment approach we develop here is generic and may be applied to quantify the impact of combining photometric datasets, changing experimental design choices, including observing strategy optimization, and evaluating systematics mitigation procedures.</description>

      <title>Kinetic field theory: effects of modified gravity theories with screening mechanisms on non-linear cosmic density fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a mean-field approximation within Kinetic Field Theory, it is possible to derive an accurate analytic expression for the power spectrum of present-day non-linear cosmic density fluctuations. It depends on the theory of gravity and the cosmological model via the expansion function of the background space-time, the growth factor derived from it, and the gravitational coupling strength, which may deviate from Newton's constant in a manner depending on time and spatial scale. In earlier work [1], we introduced a functional Taylor expansion around general relativity and the cosmological standard model to derive the effects of a wide class of modified-gravity theories on the non-linear power spectrum, assuming that such effects need to be small given the general success of the standard model. Here, we extend this class towards theories with small-scale screening, modeling screening effects by a suitably flexible interpolating function. We compare the Taylor expansion with full mean-field solutions and find good agreement where expected. We find typical relative enhancements of the non-linear power spectrum between a few and a few ten per cent in a broad range of wave numbers between $k\gtrsim0.1-10\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}$, in good qualitative agreement with results of numerical simulations. This extends the application of our analytic approach to non-linear cosmic structure formation to essentially all classes of modified-gravity theories.</description>

      <title>Constraining Cosmology with Simulation-based inference and Optical Galaxy Cluster Abundance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We test the robustness of simulation-based inference (SBI) in the context of cosmological parameter estimation from galaxy cluster counts and masses in simulated optical datasets. We construct ``simulations'' using analytical models for the galaxy cluster halo mass function (HMF) and for the observed richness (number of observed member galaxies) to train and test the SBI method. We compare the SBI parameter posterior samples to those from an MCMC analysis that uses the same analytical models to construct predictions of the observed data vector. The two methods exhibit comparable performance, with reliable constraints derived for the primary cosmological parameters, ($\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$), and richness-mass relation parameters. We also perform out-of-domain tests with observables constructed from galaxy cluster-sized halos in the Quijote simulations. Again, the SBI and MCMC results have comparable posteriors, with similar uncertainties and biases. Unsurprisingly, upon evaluating the SBI method on thousands of simulated data vectors that span the parameter space, SBI exhibits worsened posterior calibration metrics in the out-of-domain application. We note that such calibration tests with MCMC is less computationally feasible and highlight the potential use of SBI to stress-test limitations of analytical models, such as in the use for constructing models for inference with MCMC.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Cartography: Bayesian reconstruction of the galaxy density informed by large-scale structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dark sirens method combines gravitational waves and catalogs of galaxies to constrain the cosmological expansion history, merger rates and mass distributions of compact objects, and the laws of gravity. However, the incompleteness of galaxy catalogs means faint potential host galaxies are unobserved, and must be modeled to avoid inducing a bias. The majority of dark sirens analyses to date assume that the missing galaxies are distributed uniformly across the sky, which is clearly unphysical. We introduce a new Bayesian approach to the reconstruction of galaxy catalogs, which makes full use of our knowledge of large-scale structure. Our method quantifies the uncertainties on the estimated true galaxy number count in each voxel, and is marginalized over cosmological parameters and bias parameters. Crucially, our method further assesses the (absolute) magnitude distribution of galaxies, which is not known from the galaxy catalog itself. We present the details of our method and validate our approach on a galaxy catalog associated to the Millennium Simulation. The tools developed here generate physically-informed and robust host galaxy reconstructions, enabling more informative dark sirens analyses. Stage IV galaxy surveys will display greater redshift overlap with GW observations, whilst remaining incomplete -- emphasizing the importance of our work.</description>

      <title>Inflation does not create entanglement in local observables</title>

Abstract: Using modern tools of relativistic quantum information, we compare entanglement of a free, massive scalar field in the Bunch-Davies vacuum in the cosmological patch of de Sitter spacetime with that in Minkowski spacetime. There is less entanglement between spatially localized field modes in de Sitter, despite the fact that there is more entanglement stored in the field on large scales. This shows that inflation does not produce entanglement between local observables.</description>

      <title>Quarks to Cosmos: Particles and Plasma in Cosmological evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe in the context of the particle physics (PP) standard model (SM) `PP-SM' the understanding of the primordial properties and composition of the Universe in the temperature range $130\GeV&gt;T&gt;20\keV$. The Universe evolution is described using FLRW cosmology. We present a global view on particle content across time and describe the different evolution eras using deceleration parameter $q$. We follow the arrow of time in the expanding and cooling Universe: After the PP-SM heavies $(t, h, W, Z)$ diminish in abundance below $T\simeq 50\GeV$, the PP-SM plasma in the Universe is governed by the strongly interacting Quark-Gluon content. Once the temperature drops below $T\simeq 150\MeV$, quarks and gluons hadronize into strongly interacting matter particles. Rapid disappearance of baryonic antimatter completes at $T_\mathrm{B}=38.2\MeV$. We study the ensuing disappearance of strangeness and mesons in general. We show that the different eras defined by particle populations are barely separated from each other with abundance of muons fading out just prior to $T=\mathcal{O}(2.5)\MeV$, the era of emergence of the free-streaming neutrinos. We discuss the two relevant fundamental constants controlling the decoupling of neutrinos. We subsequently follow the primordial Universe as it passes through the hot dense electron-positron plasma epoch. The high density of positron antimatter disappears near $T=20.3\keV$: Nuclear reactions occur in the presence of a highly mobile and relatively strongly interacting electron-positron plasma phase. We apply plasma theory methods to describe the strong screening effects between heavy dust particle (nucleons). We analyze the paramagnetic characteristics of the electron-positron plasma when exposed to an external primordial magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Introducing cosmosTNG: simulating galaxy formation with constrained realizations of the COSMOS field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the new cosmological simulation project cosmosTNG, a first-of-its-kind suite of constrained galaxy formation simulations for the universe at Cosmic Noon ($z\sim 2$). cosmosTNG simulates a $0.2$ deg$^2$ patch of the COSMOS field at $z \simeq 2.0-2.2$ using an initial density field inferred from galaxy redshift surveys and the CLAMATO Lyman-alpha forest tomography survey, reconstructed by the TARDIS algorithm. We evolve eight different realizations of this volume to capture small-scale variations. All runs use the IllustrisTNG galaxy formation model with a baryonic mass resolution of $10^6$ M$_\odot$, equal to TNG100-1. In this initial study, we demonstrate qualitative agreement between the evolved large-scale structure and the spatial distribution of observed galaxy populations in COSMOS, emphasizing the zFIRE protocluster region. We then compare the statistical properties and scaling relations of the galaxy population, covering stellar, gaseous, and supermassive black hole (SMBH) components, between cosmosTNG, observations in COSMOS, and $z \sim 2$ observational data in general. We find that galaxy quenching and environmental effects in COSMOS are modulated by its specific large-scale structure, particularly the collapsing protoclusters in the region. With respect to a random region of the universe, the abundance of high-mass galaxies is larger, and the quenched fraction of galaxies is significant lower at fixed mass. This suggests an accelerated growth of stellar mass, as reflected in a higher cosmic star formation rate density, due to the unique assembly histories of galaxies in the simulated COSMOS subvolume. The cosmosTNG suite will be a valuable tool for studying galaxy formation at cosmic noon, particularly when interpreting extragalactic observations with HST, JWST, and other large multi-wavelength survey programs of the COSMOS field.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous Dust Biases Photometric Redshifts and Stellar Masses for LSST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling is one of the main methods to estimate galaxy properties, such as photometric redshifts, $z$, and stellar masses, $M_*$, for extragalactic imaging surveys. SEDs are currently modeled as light from a composite stellar population attenuated by a uniform foreground dust screen, despite evidence from simulations and observations that find large spatial variations in dust attenuation due to the detailed geometry of stars and gas within galaxies. In this work, we examine the impact of this simplistic dust assumption on inferred $z$ and $M_*$ for Rubin LSST. We first construct synthetic LSST-like observations ($ugrizy$ magnitudes) from the NIHAO-SKIRT catalog, which provides SEDs from high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations using 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer. We then infer $z$ and $M_*$ from the synthetic observations using the PROVABGS Bayesian SED modeling framework. Overall, the uniform dust screen assumption biases both $z$ and $M_*$ in galaxies, consistently and significantly for galaxies with dust attenuation $A_V \gtrsim 0.5$, and likely below. The biases depend on the orientation in which the galaxies are observed. At $z=0.4$, $z$ is overestimated by $\sim$0.02 for face-on galaxies and $M_*$ is underestimated by $\sim$0.4 dex for edge-on galaxies. The bias in photo-$z$ is equivalent to the desired redshift precision level of LSST "gold sample" and will be larger at higher redshifts. Our results underscore the need for SED models with additional flexibility in the dust parameterization to mitigate significant systematic biases in cosmological analyses with LSST.</description>

      <title>Lyman-$\alpha$ feedback prevails at Cosmic Dawn: Implications for the first galaxies, stars, and star clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiation pressure from Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) scattering is a potentially dominant form of early stellar feedback, capable of injecting up to $\sim 100 \, \times$ more momentum into the interstellar medium (ISM) than UV continuum radiation pressure and stellar winds. Ly$\alpha$ feedback is particularly strong in dust-poor environments and is thus especially important during the formation of the first stars and galaxies. As upcoming galaxy formation simulations incorporate Ly$\alpha$ feedback, it is crucial to consider processes that can limit it to avoid placing $\Lambda$CDM in apparent tension with recent \textit{JWST} observations indicating efficient star formation at Cosmic Dawn. We study Ly$\alpha$ feedback using a novel analytical Ly$\alpha$ radiative transfer solution that includes the effects of continuum absorption, gas velocity gradients, Ly$\alpha$ destruction (e.g. by $2p \rightarrow 2s$ transitions), ISM turbulence, and atomic recoil. We verify our solution for uniform clouds using extensive Monte Carlo radiative transfer (MCRT) tests, and resolve a previous discrepancy between analytical and MCRT predictions. We then study the sensitivity of Ly$\alpha$ feedback to the aforementioned effects. While these can dampen Ly$\alpha$ feedback by a factor $\lesssim \textrm{few} \times 10$, we find it remains $\gtrsim 5 - 100 \, \times$ stronger than direct radiation pressure and therefore cannot be neglected. We provide an accurate fit for the Ly$\alpha$ force multiplier $M_{\rm F}$, suitable for implementation in subgrid models for galaxy formation simulations. Our findings highlight the critical role of Ly$\alpha$ feedback in regulating star formation at Cosmic Dawn, and underscore the necessity of incorporating it into simulations to accurately model early galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>A simulation study on the sub-threshold joint gravitational wave-electromagnetic wave observation on binary neutron star mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coalescence of binary neutron stars (BNS) is a prolific source of gravitational waves (GWs) and electromagnetic (EM) radiation, offering a dual observational window into the Universe. Lowering the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) threshold is a simple and cost-effective way to enhance the detection probability of GWs from BNS mergers. In this study, we introduce a metric of the purity of joint GW and EM detections $P_{\rm joint}$, which is in analogue to $P_{\rm astro}$ in GW only observations. By simulating BNS merger GWs jointly detected by the HLV network and EM counterparts (kilonovae and short Gamma-ray bursts, sGRBs) with an assumed merger rate density of BNS, we generate catalogs of GW events and EM counterparts. Through this simulation, we analyze joint detection pairs, both correct and misidentified. We find the following: 1. For kilonovae, requiring $P_{\rm joint}&gt;$ 95\% instead of $P_{\rm astro}&gt;95\%$ reduces the S/N from 9.2 to 8.5-8.8, allowing 5-13 additional joint detections per year and increasing the GW detection volume by 9-17\%; 2. For sGRBs, requiring $P_{\rm joint}&gt;$ 95\% instead of $P_{\rm astro}$ reduces the S/N from 9.2 to 8.1-8.5; 3. Increasing kilonova or sGRB detection capability does not improve $P_{\rm joint}$ due to a higher rate of misidentifications. We also show that sub-threshold GW and kilonova detections can reduce the uncertainty in measuring the Hubble constant to 89-92\% of its original value, and sub-threshold GW and sGRB observations can enhance the precision of constraining the speed of GWs to 88\% of previously established values.</description>

      <title>The density of states method for symplectic gauge theories at finite temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the finite-temperature behaviour of the $Sp(4)$ Yang-Mills lattice theory in four dimensions, by applying the Logarithmic Linear Relaxation (LLR) algorithm. We demonstrate the presence of coexisting (metastable) phases, when the system is in the proximity of the transition. We measure observables such as the free energy, the expectation value of the plaquette operator and of the Polyakov loop, as well as the specific heat, and the Binder cumulant. We use these results to obtain a high-precision measurement of the critical coupling at the confinement-deconfinement transition, and assess its systematic uncertainty, for one value of the lattice extent in the time direction. Furthermore, we perform an extensive study of the finite-volume behaviour of the lattice system, by repeating the measurements for fixed lattice time extent, while increasing the spatial size of the lattice. We hence characterise the first-order transition on the lattice, and present the first results in the literature on this theory for the infinite volume extrapolation of lattice quantities related to latent heat and interface tension.
  Gauge theories with $Sp(4)$ group have been proposed as new dark sectors to provide a fundamental origin for the current phenomenological evidence of dark matter. A phase transition at high temperature, in such a new dark sector, occurring in the early universe, might have left a relic stochastic background of gravitational waves. Our results represent a milestone toward establishing whether such a new physics signal is detectable in future experiments, as they enter the calculation of the parameters, $\alpha$ and $\beta$, controlling the power spectrum of gravitational waves. We also outline the process needed in the continuum extrapolation of our measurements, and test its feasibility on one additional choice of temporal extent of the lattice.</description>

      <title>Stable massless scalar polarization of f(R) gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polarization is a prominent feature of gravitational wave observation, and it can be used to distinguish different modified gravities. Compared to General Relativity, f(R) gravity has an additional polarization coming from scalar field, which is a mix of the longitudinal and the breathing modes. When the scalar mass of f(R) is zero, the mixed mode will reduce to a pure breathing mode with the disappearance of the longitudinal mode. However, the reducing seems not to be allowed because a positive scalar mass is often needed to maintain the stability of the cosmological perturbation. In fact, the massless case is possible to lead to a stable perturbation, but more detailed constraints need to be considered. For the completeness of the polarization analysis, we explore the possibility that there is a stable massless scalar polarization in viable f(R) models for dark energy. We find that the existence of the massless scalar polarization depends not only on the number of free parameters but also on the model structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a space-borne gravitational wave observatory, TianQin can observe a large variety of gravitational wave sources. The rich signals can be composed by different types of astronomical systems, like Galactic compact binaries, inspiral of stellar mass black holes, merger of massive black holes, and extreme mass ratio inspirals. The incoherent summation of these signals can also form a stochastic gravitational wave background. Using the future TianQin observation, it is possible to put stringent constraints on fundamental science, like the expansion history of our universe. In this work, we provide a brief review of these topics that contributes to the 7th International Workshop on the TianQin Science Mission.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The opening of the gravitational wave window has significantly enhanced our capacity to explore the universe's most extreme and dynamic sector. In the mHz frequency range, a diverse range of compact objects, from the most massive black holes at the farthest reaches of the Universe to the lightest white dwarfs in our cosmic backyard, generate a complex and dynamic symphony of gravitational wave signals. Once recorded by gravitational wave detectors, these unique fingerprints have the potential to decipher the birth and growth of cosmic structures over a wide range of scales, from stellar binaries and stellar clusters to galaxies and large-scale structures. The TianQin space-borne gravitational wave mission is scheduled for launch in the 2030s, with an operational lifespan of five years. It will facilitate pivotal insights into the history of our universe. This document presents a concise overview of the detectable sources of TianQin, outlining their characteristics, the challenges they present, and the expected impact of the TianQin observatory on our understanding of them.</description>

      <title>Analytical and Numerical Methods for Circumbinary Disk Dynamics -- II: Inclined Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: (Abridged) To gain insight into the dynamical influence of a supermassive black hole binary on a circumbinary accretion disk, we investigate the binary and viscous torque densities throughout such a disk, with emphasis on the final density distribution, particularly the size and stability of the central gap between the binary and the inner edge of the disk. We limit ourselves to the simplified case of a massless viscous thin accretion disk under the influence of the gravitational potential from a binary system whose orbital plane is inclined relative to the disk. The orbital plane could be inclined if it is not coeval with the disk, or the black holes have spin angular momentum misaligned with respect to the disk's orbital angular momentum, so that the binary can precess to an inclined orientation. We employ 2D Newtonian hydrodynamics simulations to examine the influence of two model parameters: the mass ratio of the binary and the inclination angle between the binary and the disk. We investigate their impact on the density and torque distribution. In our analytical approach, we consider the stability of epicycles induced by the perturbative effect of the asymmetric inclined binary gravitational potential on Keplerian circular orbits. Through our simulations, we observe that certain configurations never attain a quasi-steady state, where the density profile averaged over many orbits stabilizes. This instability occurs when the inclination is close to 45 degrees. Furthermore, we identify configurations where there is never a persistent balance between the dynamical and viscous torque densities, as well as cases where the location of this balance oscillates or exhibits other time-dependent behavior over viscous timescales. These findings have implications for understanding both the expected gravitational-wave signal and electromagnetic counterparts from supermassive black hole binaries.</description>

      <title>Towards a complete census of luminous Compton-thick Active Galactic Nuclei in the local Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray surveys provide the most efficient means for the detection of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). However, they face difficulties in detecting the most heavily obscured Compton-thick AGN. The BAT detector on board the Gehrels/Swift mission, operating in the very hard 14-195 keV band, has provided the largest samples of Compton-thick AGN in the local Universe. However, even these flux limited samples can miss the most obscured sources among the Compton-thick AGN population. A robust way to find these local sources is to systematically study volume-limited AGN samples detected in the IR or the optical part of the spectrum. Here, we utilize a local sample (&lt;100 Mpc) of mid-IR selected AGN, unbiased against obscuration, to determine the fraction of Compton-thick sources in the local universe. When available we acquire X-ray spectral information for the sources in our sample from previously published studies. Additionally, to maximize the X-ray spectral information for the sources in our sample, we analyse, for the first time, eleven unexplored XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations, identifying four new Compton-thick sources. Our results reveal an increased fraction of Compton-thick AGN among the sources that have not been detected by BAT of 44 %. Overall we estimate a fraction of Compton thick sources in the local universe of 25-30% among mid-IR selected AGN. We find no evidence for evolution of the AGN Compton-thick fraction with luminosity.</description>

Abstract: Pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations have recently reported evidence of stochastic gravitational waves. Besides gravitational wave signals from cosmological or astrophysical origins, PTAs are also capable of detecting coherently oscillating ultralight dark matter in our galaxy. This paper investigates pulsar timing influenced by ultralight vector dark matter, based on the pure gravitational effect of the vector field. We extensively consider the finite dark matter velocity $v$ for ultralight vector dark matter in PTAs, rather than the limit $v\rightarrow0$ in previous studies. It is found that the leading-order shift in pulsar timing turns out to be proportional to negative slope of $v$. Consequently, one can not distinguish between ultralight vector dark matter and ultralight scalar dark matter with the timing residual amplitude. Assuming the existence of stochastic vector dark matter in our galaxy, the corresponding angular correlation curve in PTAs is found to be similar to that of scalar dark matter. We find that it can be distinguishable, only when the pulsar pairs are distant from the earth.</description>

      <title>Bubble wall velocity from number density current in (non)equilibrium</title>

Abstract: Cosmological first-order phase transitions (FOPTs) serve as comprehensive probes into our early Universe with associated generations of stochastic gravitational waves and superhorizon curvature perturbations or even primordial black holes. In characterizing the FOPT, phenomenological parameters like transition temperatures, strength factors, bubble separations, and energy budgets can be easily extracted from the macroscopic equilibrium features of the underlying particle physics models except for the terminal wall velocity of the bubble expansion, making it the last key parameter to be determined most difficultly due to the non-equilibrium nature of the microscopic transition model. In this paper, we propose a new model-independent approach to calculate the bubble wall velocity by two fundamental conservation equations in the first-order hydrodynamics from not only the usual energy-momentum tensor but also the number density current in terms of a few phenomenological parameters from field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The MAgnetized Disk and Mirror Axion eXperiment (MADMAX) is a future experiment aiming to detect dark matter axions from the galactic halo by resonant conversion to photons in a strong magnetic field. It uses a stack of dielectric disks in front of a mirror, called booster, to enhance the potential signal from axion-photon conversion over a significant mass range. Several small scale prototype systems have been developed and tested to verify the experimental principles. The current status of the experiment and its prototypes, including the ongoing research and development and remaining challenges, are presented in this contribution.</description>

      <title>Wideband Monitoring of FRB 180916.J0158+6 Across a Half-Decade Bandwidth Using the Upgraded GMRT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the uGMRT having unprecedented sensitivity and unique capability of providing instantaneous frequency coverage of 250$-$1460 MHz, we studied ${\rm FRB}\,180916.J0158+65$ over four months sampling during its active phase. We report the detection of $74$ bursts at Band-3 (i.e. 250$-$500 MHz) and $4$ bursts at Band-4 (i.e. 550$-$750 MHz) of uGMRT providing a burst rate of $\sim 4$ bursts/hour above a fluence of 0.05 Jy ms. We find that the source emits maximum energy and luminosity up to a fractional bandwidth of 70 MHz near the middle of its activity window consistent with earlier studies. We see a strong correlation between the excess dispersion measure and excess scattering width where both of them attains their maximum value near the middle of the activity window. We find that the normalized cumulative distribution of the waiting time can be well-fitted by an exponential function, indicating a stochastic emission process. We also notice that the cumulative burst rate changes rapidly with the intrinsic energy of the bursts near the middle of the activity window considering the full observed window of 0.4-0.6 of this FRB, where this change is much steeper for the high-energy bursts and shallower for the low-energy bursts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: According to the microscopic formulation of Landauer's principle, when information is deleted the Von Neumann entropy of the system gets reduced with a corresponding energy cost. Although within the same perspective the growth of the entropy should remain unconstrained we show that during quantum amplification the heat flow does restrict the increase of the Von Neumann entropy. When applied to the case of relic gravitons (with frequencies between the aHz region and the THz domain) the bounds obtained here set a limit on initial thermal gravitons and on the total duration of inflation.</description>

      <title>The eventful life of a luminous galaxy at z = 14: metal enrichment, feedback, and low gas fraction?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: JADES-GS-z14-0 is the most distant spectroscopically confirmed galaxy so far, at $z&gt;14$. With a UV magnitude of -20.81, it is one of the most luminous galaxies at cosmic dawn and its half-light radius of 260 pc means that stars dominate the observed UV emission. We report the ALMA detection of [OIII]88$\mu$m line emission with a significance of 6.67$\sigma$ and at a frequency of 223.524 GHz, corresponding to a redshift of $14.1796\pm0.0007$, which is consistent with the candidate CIII] line detected in the NIRSpec spectrum. At this spectroscopic redshift, the Lyman break identified with NIRSpec requires a damped Lyman-$\alpha$ absorber with a column density of $\log(N_{\rm HI}/\mathrm{cm}^{-2})=22.23$. The total [OIII]88$\mu$m luminosity (log($(L_{\rm [OIII]}/L_\odot) = 8.3\pm0.1$) is fully consistent with the local $L_{\rm [OIII]}-SFR$ relation. Based on the ${L_{\rm [OIII]}/SFR}$, we infer a gas-phase metallicity $&gt;0.1~{\rm Z_{\rm \odot}}$, which is somewhat unexpected given the weakness of the UV emission lines. Using prospector SED modeling and combining the ALMA data with JWST observations, we find $Z=0.17~{Z_{\rm \odot}}$ and an escape fraction of ionizing photons of 20%, which is necessary to explain the UV spectrum. We measure an [O III]5007\r{A}/[O III]88$\mu$m line flux ratio between 1 and 10, resulting in an upper limit to the electron density of roughly 300 cm$^{-3}$, which is lower than those measured in other high-$z$ luminous galaxies. The [OIII]88$\mu$m emission line is spectrally resolved, with a FWHM of 100 km/s, resulting in a dynamical mass of $\log$(M$_{\rm dyn}/M_\odot$) = 9.0$\pm0.2$. This value is comparable to the stellar mass derived from the SED fitting, which implies a very low gas fraction. Past radiation-driven outflows may have cleared the galaxy from the gas, reducing the gas fraction and thus increasing the escape fraction of ionizing photons.</description>

      <title>Accurate Computation of the Screening of Scalar Fifth Forces in Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Screening mechanisms allow light scalar fields to dynamically avoid the constraints that come from our lack of observation of a long-range fifth force. Galactic scale tests are of particular interest when the light scalar is introduced to explain the dark matter or dark energy that dominates our cosmology. To date, much of the literature that has studied screening in galaxies has described screening using simplifying approximations. In this work, we calculate numerical solutions for scalar fields with screening mechanisms in galactic contexts, and use these to derive new, precise conditions governing where fifth forces are screened. We show that the commonly used binary screened/unscreened threshold can predict a fifth force signal in situations where a fuller treatment does not, leading us to conclude that existing constraints might be significantly overestimated. We show that various other approximations of the screening radius provide a more accurate proxy to screening, although they fail to exactly reproduce the true screening surface in certain regions of parameter space. As a demonstration of our scheme, we apply it to an idealised Milky Way and thus identify the region of parameter space in which the solar system is screened.</description>

      <title>Union Through UNITY: Cosmology with 2,000 SNe Using a Unified Bayesian Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) were instrumental in establishing the acceleration of the universe's expansion. By virtue of their combination of distance reach, precision, and prevalence, they continue to provide key cosmological constraints, complementing other cosmological probes. Individual SN surveys cover only over about a factor of two in redshift, so compilations of multiple SN datasets are strongly beneficial. We assemble an up-to-date "Union" compilation of 2087 cosmologically useful SNe Ia from 24 datasets ("Union3"). We take care to put all SNe on the same distance scale and update the light-curve fitting with SALT3 to use the full rest-frame optical. Over the next few years, the number of cosmologically useful SNe Ia will increase by more than a factor of ten, and keeping systematic uncertainties subdominant will be more challenging than ever. We discuss the importance of treating outliers, selection effects, light-curve shape and color populations and standardization relations, unexplained dispersion, and heterogeneous observations simultaneously. We present an updated Bayesian framework, called UNITY1.5 (Unified Nonlinear Inference for Type-Ia cosmologY), that incorporates significant improvements in our ability to model selection effects, standardization, and systematic uncertainties compared to earlier analyses. As an analysis byproduct, we also recover the posterior of the SN-only peculiar-velocity field, although we do not interpret it in this work. We compute updated cosmological constraints with Union3 and UNITY1.5, finding weak 1.7--2.6 sigma tension with LambdaCDM and possible evidence for thawing dark energy (w0 &gt; -1, wa &lt; 0). We release our SN distances, light-curve fits, and UNITY1.5 framework to the community.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Early matter-dominated eras (EMDEs) are a natural feature arising in many models of the early universe and can generate a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) during the transition from an EMDE to the radiation-dominated universe required by the time of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. While there are calculations of the SGWB generated in the linear regime, no detailed study has been made of the nonlinear regime. We perform the first comprehensive calculation of GW production in the nonlinear regime, using a hybrid $N$-body and lattice simulation to study GW production from both a metastable matter species and the radiation produced in its decay. We find that nonlinearities significantly enhance GW production up to frequencies at least as large as the inverse light-crossing time of the largest halos that form prior to reheating. The resulting SGWB is within future observational reach for curvature perturbations as small as those probed in the cosmic microwave background, depending on the reheating temperature. Out-of-equilibrium dynamics could further boost the induced SGWB, while a fully relativistic gravitational treatment is required to resolve the spectrum at even higher frequencies.</description>

Abstract: Primordially formed extended dark objects would accrete baryonic matter and impact the ionisation history of the Universe. Insisting on consistency with the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background, we derive constraints on the dark matter fraction for various classes of objects, of different sizes. We introduce a novel scaling technique to speed up numerical calculations and release our calculation framework in the form of a Mathematica notebook. Conservatively, we focus on spherical accretion and collisional ionisation. We find strong constraints limiting the dark matter fraction to subpercent level for objects of up to $10^4$ AU in size.</description>

      <title>Neural network reconstruction of density and velocity fields from the 2MASS Redshift Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reconstruct the 3D matter density and peculiar velocity fields in the local Universe up to a distance of 200$\,h^{-1}\,$Mpc from the Two-Micron All-Sky Redshift Survey (2MRS), using a neural network (NN). We employed an NN with a U-net autoencoder architecture and a weighted mean squared error loss function trained separately to output either the density or velocity field for a given input grid of galaxy number counts. The NN was trained on mocks derived from the Quijote N-body simulations, incorporating redshift-space distortions (RSDs), galaxy bias, and selection effects closely mimicking the characteristics of 2MRS. The trained NN was benchmarked against a standard Wiener filter (WF) on a validation set of mocks before applying it to 2MRS. The NN reconstructions effectively approximate the mean posterior estimate of the true density and velocity fields conditioned on the observations. They consistently outperform the WF in terms of reconstruction accuracy and effectively capture the nonlinear relation between velocity and density. The NN-reconstructed bulk flow of the total survey volume exhibits a significant correlation with the true mock bulk flow, demonstrating that the NN is sensitive to information on super-survey scales encoded in the RSDs. When applied to 2MRS, the NN successfully recovers the main known clusters, some of which are partially in the Zone of Avoidance. The reconstructed bulk flows in spheres of different radii less than 100$\,h^{-1}\,$Mpc are in good agreement with a previous 2MRS analysis that required an additional external bulk flow component inferred from directly observed peculiar velocities. The NN-reconstructed peculiar velocity of the Local Group closely matches the observed Cosmic Microwave Background dipole in amplitude and Galactic latitude, and only deviates by 18${}^\circ$ in longitude. The NN-reconstructed fields are publicly available.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The violation of the null energy condition (NEC) may play a crucial role in enabling a scalar field to climb over high potential barriers, potentially significant in the very early universe. We propose a single-field model where the universe sequentially undergoes a first stage of slow-roll inflation, NEC violation, and a second stage of slow-roll inflation. Through the NEC violation, the scalar field climbs over high potential barriers, leaving unique characteristics on the primordial gravitational wave power spectrum, including a blue-tilted nature in the middle-frequency range and diminishing oscillation amplitudes at higher frequencies. Additionally, the power spectrum exhibits nearly scale-invariant behavior on both large and small scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Explaining the origin of supermassive black holes via a primordial origin is severely challenged by the tight spectral distortion constraints on the amplitude of the primordial perturbations. Following the first calculation of how the $\mu$ constraints are modified by non-Gaussianity in a companion paper, we here make the first robust constraints on primordial black hole formation under large non-Gaussianity. Even the infinite $f_{\rm NL}$ limit is insufficiently non-Gaussian but much higher-order non-Gaussianity of the form ${\cal R}={\cal R}_{\rm G}^5$ may allow the formation of any mass primordial black hole without conflicting with distortion constraints. We caution that such extreme models face other challenges.</description>

      <title>Extracting parity-violating gravitational waves from projected tidal force tensor in three dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) may be produced by various mechanisms in the early universe. In particular, if parity is violated, it may lead to the production of parity-violating GWs. In this paper, we focus on GWs on the scale of the large-scale structure. Since GWs induce tidal deformations of the shape of galaxies, one can extract such GW signals by observing images of galaxies in galaxy surveys. Conventionally the detection of such signals is discussed by considering the three-dimensional power spectra of the $E/B$-modes. Here, we develop a complementary new technique to estimate the contribution of GWs to the tidal force tensor field projected on the celestial sphere, which is a directly observable quantity. We introduce two two-dimensional vector fields constructed by taking the divergence and curl of the projected tidal field in three dimensions. Their auto-correlation functions naturally contain contributions of the scalar-type tidal field. However, we find that the divergence of the curl of the projected tidal field, which is a pseudo-scalar quantity, is free from the scalar contribution and thus enables us to extract GW signals. We also find that we can detect parity-violating signals in the GWs by observing the nonzero cross-correlation between the divergence of the projected tidal field and the curl of it. It roughly corresponds to measuring the cross-power spectrum of E and B-modes, but these are complementary to each other in the sense that our estimator can be naturally defined locally in position space. Finally we present expressions of the correlation functions in the form of Fourier integrals, and discuss the properties of the kernels specific to the GW case, which we call the overlap reduction function, borrowing the terminology used in the pulsar timing array experiments.</description>

      <title>Constrain the linear scalar perturbation theory of Cotton gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a cosmological test of Cotton gravity, which describes gravity by cotton tensor. We assume in Cotton gravity the background evolution is the same as the flat FLRW background. We derive the cosmological perturbation theory of the scalar mode at the linear level, where the difference from the $\Lambda$CDM model is characterized by the parameter $\beta$. We incorporate Cotton gravity with a neutrino model and perform a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) analysis using data from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The analysis constrains parameter $\beta=-0.00008^{+0.00080}_{-0.00104}$ at the 1-$\sigma$ confidence level. We conclude that currently, there is no obvious deviation between Cotton gravity and the $\Lambda$CDM model in the linear cosmological perturbation level for observations.</description>

      <title>Impact of extragalactic point sources on the low-frequency sky spectrum and cosmic dawn global 21-cm measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contribution of resolved and unresolved extragalactic point sources to the low-frequency sky spectrum is a potentially non-negligible part of the astrophysical foregrounds for cosmic dawn 21-cm experiments. The clustering of such point sources on the sky, combined with the frequency-dependence of the antenna beam, can also make this contribution chromatic. By combining low-frequency measurements of the luminosity function and the angular correlation function of extragalactic point sources, we develop a model for the contribution of these sources to the low-frequency sky spectrum. Using this model, we find that the contribution of sources with flux density $&gt;10^{-6}\,$Jy to the sky-averaged spectrum is smooth and of the order of a few kelvins at 50--$200\,$MHz. We combine this model with measurements of the galactic foreground spectrum and weigh the resultant sky by the beam directivity of the conical log-spiral antenna planned as part of the Radio Experiment for the Analysis of Cosmic Hydrogen (REACH) project. We find that the contribution of point sources to the resultant spectrum is $\sim0.4\%$ of the total foregrounds, but still larger by at least an order of magnitude than the standard predictions for the cosmological 21-cm signal. As a result, not accounting for the point-source contribution leads to a systematic bias in 21-cm signal recovery. We show, however, that in the REACH case, this reconstruction bias can be removed by modelling the point-source contribution as a power law with a running spectral index. We make our code publicly available as a Python package labelled epspy.</description>

      <title>Refractive lensing of scintillating FRBs by sub-parsec cloudlets in the multi-phase CGM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the refractive lensing effects of ionized cool ($T \sim 10^4\,{\rm K}$) gas cloudlets in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of galaxies. In particular, we discuss the combined effects of lensing from these cloudlets and scintillation from plasma screens in the Milky Way interstellar medium (ISM). We show that, if the CGM comprises a mist of sub-parsec cloudlets with column densities of order $10^{17}\,{\rm cm}^{-2}$ (as predicted by McCourt et al. 2018), then FRBs whose sightlines pass within a virial radius of a CGM halo will may be lensed into tens of refractive images with a $\sim 10\,{\rm ms}$ scattering timescale. When these images are formed, they will be resolved by scintillating screens in the Milky Way ISM, and will suppress the observed scintillation. We illustrate this effect in refractive lensing and argue that positive detections of FRB scintillation may constrain the properties of these cool-gas cloudlets, with current scintillation observation weakly disfavouring the cloudlet model. We propose that sheet-like geometries for the cool gas in the CGM can reconcile quasar absorption measurements (from which we infer the presence of the cool gas with structure on sub-parsec scales) and the unexpected lack of lensing signals from this gas thus far observed.</description>

      <title>The haloes that reionized the Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12132v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the reionization of the Universe due to haloes that host galaxies undergoing bursts of star formation. By comparing the recent results from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) with the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation EAGLE at $z\ge 6$, we find that bursty galaxies have specific star formation rate, sSFR $&gt;10^{-2}$ Myr$^{-1}$, and magnitude, $M_{\rm UV}\leq -17$. Most of them reside in haloes of mass $\sim 10^9$ M$_\odot$ and some in more massive haloes. We then construct the models of escape fraction and find that a skewed Gaussian function with a flat tail towards the high mass end best describes the mean dependence of escape fraction on halo mass, considering the haloes hosting bursty galaxies as the primary drivers of reionization. We implement the models of escape fraction in the code 21cmFAST to study the progress of reionization and derive the evolution of the mean ionized fraction that agrees well with observations. We also calculate the brightness temperature, spin temperature, and kinetic temperature and further study the spatial fluctuations in these quantities to gain insights into the progress of reionization. We compute the 21 cm power spectrum and predict a peak in power at $180$ MHz corresponding to redshift, $z\approx 6.8$, that is testable by the upcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Our findings suggest that the Universe was reionized by the haloes of $\gtrsim 10^{9}$ M$_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Ultralight scalar dark matter versus non-adiabatic perfect fluid dark matter in pulsar timing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent evidence for stochastic gravitational waves reported by pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations might open a new window for studying cosmology and astrophysical phenomena. In addition to signals from gravitational waves, there is motivation to explore residual signals from oscillating dark matter, which might partially comprise the galactic halo. We investigate fluctuations in pulsar timing originating from the coherent oscillation of scalar dark matter up to the subleading-order correction of $\mathcal{O}(k/m)$, as well as from acoustic oscillations of non-adiabatic perfect fluid dark matter. Both types of dark matter can induce the Newtonian potential and curvature perturbations, thereby affecting pulsar timing. We show distinctive signatures in pulsar timing residuals and angular correlations in the PTA frequency band and considering the known distances of pulsars. For scalar dark matter, both the timing residuals and the angular correlation are sensitive to small variations in the distance, $\delta L$, due to the subleading-order correction of $\mathcal{O}(k/m)$. In contrast, for perfect fluid dark matter, it is insensitive to the $\delta L$. For deterministic source from scalar dark matter, the distance of a pulsar has influence on the degree of directional dependence of timing residuals, significantly. For stochastic source from perfect fluid dark matter, the angular correlation tends to a constant and enhances only when the pulsar pair is very close to each other. In this sense, perfect fluid dark matter is shown to be a more suitable physical origin for monopolar signals in angular correlations compared to the scalar dark matter.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave signatures of post-fragmentation reheating</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: After cosmic inflation, coherent oscillations of the inflaton field about a monomial potential $V(\phi)\sim \phi^k$ result in an expansion phase characterized by a stiff equation-of-state $w\simeq(k-2)/(k+2)$. Sourced by the oscillating inflaton condensate, parametric (self)resonant effects can induce the exponential growth of inhomogeneities eventually backreacting and leading to the fragmentation of the condensate. In this work, we investigate realizations of inflation giving rise to such dynamics, assuming an inflaton weakly coupled to its decay products. As a result, the transition to a radiation-dominated universe, i.e. reheating, occurs after fragmentation. We estimate the consequences on the production of gravitational waves by computing the contribution induced by the stiff equation-of-state era in addition to the signal generated by the fragmentation process for $k=4,6,8,10$. We find that the signal generated during the fragmentation process gives a larger contribution than the one induced by the stiff equation-of-state era in given frequency ranges for all values of $k$. Our results are independent of the reheating temperature provided that reheating is achieved posterior to fragmentation. Our work shows that the dynamics of such weakly-coupled inflaton scenario can actually result in characteristic gravitational wave spectra with frequencies from Hz to GHz, in the reach of future gravitational wave observatories, in addition to the complementarity between upcoming detectors in discriminating (post)inflation scenarios. We advocate the need of developing high-frequency gravitational wave detectors to gain insight into the dynamics of inflation and reheating.</description>

      <title>Gravitational collapse, primordial black hole, and gravitational wave in Einstein--Gauss-Bonnet theory with two scalar fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00936v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the gravitational collapse to form the black hole in the acceleratingly expanding universe in the frame of Einstein--Gauss-Bonnet theory having two scalar fields and we study the propagation of the gravitational wave (GW). This may describe the creation of the primordial black holes in the early stages of the universe and the impact of their creation on the propagation of primordial gravitational waves. The collapsing spacetime can be obtained by using the formulation of the ``reconstruction'', that is, we find a model that realises the desired or given geometry. In the reconstructed models, ghosts often appear, which could be eliminated by imposing constraints. We show that the standard cosmological solutions or self-gravitating objects such as a planet, the Sun, various types of stars, etc., in Einstein's gravity, are also solutions in this model. Using the dynamical value of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling, the propagation of the high-frequency GW is investigated. The propagating speed changes due to the coupling during the period of the black hole formation. The speed of the GW propagation going into the black hole is different from that of the wave going out.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inflationary models with a non-zero background curvature require additional hypothesis or parameters compared to flat inflation and the procedure to construct them cannot be as simple as in the flat case. For this reason, there is no consensus on the primordial power spectrum that should be considered at large scales in a curved Universe. In this letter, we propose a model of curved inflation in which the usual canonical quantization and Bunch-Davies vacuum choice of the flat case can be considered. The framework is a recently proposed modification of general relativity in which a non-dynamical topological term is added to the Einstein equation. The model is universal as it is the same for any background curvature, and no additional parameters or hypothesis on the initial spatial curvature are introduced. This gives a natural and simple solution to the problem of constructing curved inflation, and at the same time provides an additional argument for this topological modification of general relativity.</description>

      <title>Searching for cosmological stochastic backgrounds by notching out resolvable compact binary foregrounds with next-generation gravitational-wave detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds can be of either cosmological or astrophysical origin. The detection of an astrophysical stochastic gravitational-wave background with ground-based interferometers is expected in the near future. Perhaps even more excitingly, the detection of stochastic backgrounds of cosmological origin by future ground-based interferometers could reveal invaluable information about the early Universe. From this perspective, the astrophysical background is a {\it foreground} that can prevent the extraction of this information from the data. In this paper, we revisit a time-frequency domain notching procedure previously proposed to remove the astrophysical foreground in the context of next-generation ground-based detectors, but we consider the more realistic scenario where we remove individually detectable signals by taking into account the uncertainty in the estimation of their parameters. We find that time-frequency domain masks can still efficiently remove the astrophysical foreground and suppress it to about $5\%$ of its original level. Further removal of the foreground formed by unresolvable events (in particular, unresolvable binary neutron stars), which is about $10$ times larger than the residual foreground from realistic notching, would require detector sensitivity improvements. Therefore, the main limitation in the search for a cosmological background is the unresolvable foreground itself, and not the residual of the notching procedure.</description>

      <title>Cold Darkogenesis: Dark Matter and Baryon Asymmetry in Light of the PTA Signal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We build upon the intriguing possibility that the recently reported nano-Hz gravitational wave signal by Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) experiments is sourced by a strong first-order phase transition from a nearly conformal dark sector. The phase transition has to be strongly supercooled to explain the signal amplitude, while the critical temperature has to be in the $\cal{O}$(GeV) range, as dictated by the peak frequency of the gravitational wave spectrum. However, the resulting strong supercooling exponentially dilutes away any pre-existing baryon asymmetry and dark matter, calling for a new paradigm of their productions. We then develop a mechanism of cold darkogenesis that generates a dark asymmetry during the phase transition from the textured dark $SU(2)_{\rm D}$ Higgs field. This dark asymmetry is transferred to the visible sector via neutron portal interactions, resulting in the observed baryon asymmetry. Furthermore, the mechanism naturally leads to the correct abundance of asymmetric dark matter, with self-interaction of the scale that is of the right order to solve the diversity problem in galactic rotation curves. Collider searches for mono-jets and dark matter direct detection experiments can dictate the viability of the model.</description>

Abstract: The DArk Matter In CCDs at Modane (DAMIC-M) experiment is designed to search for light dark matter (m$_{\chi}$&lt;10\,GeV/c$^2$) at the Laboratoire Souterrain de Modane (LSM) in France. DAMIC-M will use skipper charge-coupled devices (CCDs) as a kg-scale active detector target. Its single-electron resolution will enable eV-scale energy thresholds and thus world-leading sensitivity to a range of hidden sector dark matter candidates. A DAMIC-M prototype, the Low Background Chamber (LBC), has been taking data at LSM since 2022. The LBC provides a low-background environment, which has been used to characterize skipper CCDs, study dark current, and measure radiopurity of materials planned for DAMIC-M. It also allows testing of various subsystems like readout electronics, data acquisition software, and slow control. This paper describes the technical design and performance of the LBC.</description>

      <title>Constraining string cosmology with the gravitational-wave background using the NANOGrav 15-year data set</title>

Abstract: The North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) collaboration has recently reported strong evidence for a signal at nanohertz, potentially the first detection of the stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB). We investigate whether the NANOGrav signal is consistent with the SGWB predicted by string cosmology models. By performing Bayesian parameter estimation on the NANOGrav 15-year data set, we constrain the key parameters of a string cosmology model: the frequency $f_s$ and the fractional energy density $\Omega_\mathrm{gw}^{s}$ of gravitational waves at the end of the dilaton-driven stage, and the Hubble parameter $H_r$ at the end of the string phase. Our analysis yields constraints of $f_s = 1.2^{+0.6}_{-0.6}\times 10^{-8} \mathrm{Hz}$ and $\Omega_\mathrm{gw}^{s} = 2.9^{+5.4}_{-2.3}\times 10^{-8}$, consistent with theoretical predictions from string cosmology. However, the current NANOGrav data is not sensitive to the $H_r$ parameter. We also compare the string cosmology model to a simple power-law model using Bayesian model selection, finding a Bayes factor of $2.2$ in favor of the string cosmology model. Our results demonstrate the potential of pulsar timing arrays to constrain cosmological models and study the early Universe.</description>
