      <title>ajdmom: a Python Package for Deriving Moment Formulas of Affine Jump Diffusion Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce ajdmom, a Python package designed for automatically deriving moment formulas for the well-established affine jump diffusion (AJD) processes. ajdmom can produce explicit closed-form expressions for moments or conditional moments of any order, significantly enhancing the usability of AJD models. Additionally, ajdmom can compute partial derivatives of these moments with respect to the model parameters, offering a valuable tool for sensitivity analysis. The package's modular architecture makes it easy for adaptation and extension by researchers. ajdmom is open-source and readily available for installation from GitHub or the Python package index (PyPI).</description>

      <title>Schur Complementary Allocation: A Unification of Hierarchical Risk Parity and Minimum Variance Portfolios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite many attempts to make optimization-based portfolio construction in the spirit of Markowitz robust and approachable, it is far from universally adopted. Meanwhile, the collection of more heuristic divide-and-conquer approaches was revitalized by Lopez de Prado where Hierarchical Risk Parity (HRP) was introduced. This paper reveals the hidden connection between these seemingly disparate approaches.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Heavy-Tailed Hawkes Processes and the Microstructure of Rough Volatility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the weak convergence of the intensity of a nearly-unstable Hawkes process with heavy-tailed kernel. Our result is used to derive a scaling limit for a financial market model where orders to buy or sell an asset arrive according to a Hawkes process with power-law kernel. After suitable rescaling the price-volatility process converges weakly to a rough Heston model. Our convergence result is much stronger than previously established ones that have either focused on light-tailed kernels or the convergence of integrated volatility process. The key is to establish the tightness of the family of rescaled volatility processes. This is achieved by introducing a new methods to establish the $C$-tightness of c\`adl\`ag processes based on the classical Kolmogorov-Chentsov tightness criterion for continuous processes.</description>

      <title>Optimal Design of Automated Market Markers on Decentralized Exchanges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automated market makers are a popular mechanism used on decentralized exchange, through which users trade assets with each other directly and automatically through a liquidity pool and a fixed pricing function. The liquidity provider contributes to the liquidity pool by supplying assets to the pool, and in return, they earn trading fees from investors who trade in the pool. We propose a model of optimal liquidity provision in which a risk-averse liquidity provider decides the amount of wealth she would invest in the decentralized market to provide liquidity in a two-asset pool, trade in a centralized market, and consume in multiple periods. We derive the liquidity provider's optimal strategy and the optimal design of the automated market maker that maximizes the liquidity provider's utility. We find that the optimal unit trading fee increases in the volatility of the fundamental exchange rate of the two assets. We also find that the optimal pricing function is chosen to make the asset allocation in the liquidity pool efficient for the liquidity provider.</description>

      <title>Risk-neutral valuation of options under arithmetic Brownian motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On April 22, 2020, the CME Group switched to Bachelier pricing for a group of oil futures options. The Bachelier model, or more generally the arithmetic Brownian motion (ABM), is not so widely used in finance, though. This paper provides the first comprehensive survey of options pricing under ABM. Using the risk-neutral valuation, we derive formulas for European options for three underlying types, namely an underlying that does not pay dividends, an underlying that pays a continuous dividend yield, and futures. Further, we derive Black-Scholes-Merton-like partial differential equations, which can in principle be utilized to price American options numerically via finite difference.</description>
