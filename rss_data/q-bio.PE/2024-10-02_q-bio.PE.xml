      <title>PREPARE: PREdicting PAndemic's REcurring Waves Amidst Mutations, Vaccination, and Lockdowns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study releases an adaptable framework that can provide insights to policymakers to predict the complex recurring waves of the pandemic in the medium postemergence of the virus spread, a phase marked by rapidly changing factors like virus mutations, lockdowns, and vaccinations, offering a way to forecast infection trends and stay ahead of future outbreaks even amidst uncertainty. The proposed model is validated on data from COVID-19 spread in Germany.</description>

      <title>An evolutionary process without variation and selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural selection successfully explains how organisms accumulate adaptive change despite that traits acquired over a lifetime are eliminated at the end of each generation. However, in some domains that exhibit cumulative, adaptive change -- e.g., cultural evolution, and earliest life -- acquired traits are retained; these domains do not face the problem that Darwin's theory was designed to solve. Lack of transmission of acquired traits occurs when germ cells are protected from environmental change, due to a self-assembly code used in two distinct ways: (i) actively interpreted during development to generate a soma, and (ii) passively copied without interpretation during reproduction to generate germ cells. Early life and cultural evolution appear not to involve a self-assembly code used in these two ways. We suggest that cumulative, adaptive change in these domains is due to a lower-fidelity evolutionary process, and model it using Reflexively Autocatalytic and Foodset-generated networks. We refer to this more primitive evolutionary process as Self-Other Reorganisation (SOR) because it involves internal self-organising and self-maintaining processes within entities, as well as interaction between entities. SOR encompasses learning but in general operates across groups. We discuss the relationship between SOR and Lamarckism, and illustrate a special case of SOR without variation.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Modeling of Seasonal Dengue Dynamics in Bangladesh: A Bayesian-Stochastic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bangladesh's worsening dengue crisis, fueled by its tropical climate, poor waste management infrastructure, rapid urbanization, and dense population, has led to increasingly deadly outbreaks, posing a significant public health threat. To address this, we propose a nonlinear, time-nonhomogeneous SEIR model incorporating seasonality through a novel transmission rate function. The model parameters are estimated using Bayesian inference with the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm in a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework, calibrated with real-life dengue data from Bangladesh. To account for stochasticity and better assess outbreak probabilities, we extend the model to a time-nonhomogeneous continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) framework. Our model provides new insights that can guide policymakers and offer a robust mathematical framework to better combat this crisis.</description>

      <title>A primer on the use of probability generating functions in infectious disease modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05136</link>
      <description>arXiv:1803.05136v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the application of probability generating functions (PGFs) to invasive processes, focusing on infectious disease introduced into large populations. Our goal is to acquaint the reader with applications of PGFs, moreso than to derive new results. PGFs help predict a number of properties about early outbreak behavior while the population is still effectively infinite, including the probability of an epidemic, the size distribution after some number of generations, and the cumulative size distribution of non-epidemic outbreaks. We show how PGFs can be used in both discrete-time and continuous-time settings, and discuss how to use these results to infer disease parameters from observed outbreaks. In the large population limit for susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) epidemics PGFs lead to survival-function based models that are equivalent the the usual mass-action SIR models but with fewer ODEs. We use these to explore properties such as the final size of epidemics or even the dynamics once stochastic effects are negligible. We target this tutorial to biologists and public health researchers who want to learn how to apply PGFs to invasive diseases, but it could also be used in an introductory mathematics course on PGFs. We include many exercises to help demonstrate concepts and to give practice applying the results. We summarize our main results in a few tables. Additionally we provide a small python package which performs many of the relevant calculations.</description>

      <title>A conceptual predator-prey model with super-long transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Drawing on the understanding of the logistic map, we propose a simple predator-prey model where predators and prey adapt to each other, leading to the co-evolution of the system. The special dynamics observed in periodic windows contribute to the coexistence of multiple time scales, adding to the complexity of the system. Typical dynamics in ecosystems, such as the persistence and coexistence of population cycles and chaotic behaviors, the emergence of super-long transients, regime shifts, and the quantifying of resilience, are encapsulated within this single model. The simplicity of our model allows for detailed analysis, reinforcing its potential as a conceptual tool for understanding ecosystems deeply.</description>

      <title>AgentBasedModeling.jl: a tool for stochastic simulation of structured population dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19294v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Agent-based models capture heterogeneity among individuals in a population and are widely used in studies of multi-cellular systems, disease, epidemics and demography to name a few. However, existing frameworks consider discrete time-step simulation or assume that agents' states only change as a result of discrete events. In this note, we present AgentBasedModeling$.$jl, a Julia package for simulating stochastic agent-based population models in continuous time. The tool allows to easily specify and simulate agents evolving through generic continuous-time jump-diffusions and interacting via continuous-rate processes. AgentBasedModeling$.$jl provides a powerful methodology for studying the effects of stochasticity on structured population dynamics.</description>

      <title>Labelled partitions in action: recombination, selection, mutation, and more</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.10874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the evolution of an (infinitely large) population under recombination and additional evolutionary forces, modelled by a measure-valued ordinary differential equation. We provide a stochastic representation for the solution of this model via duality to a new labelled partitioning process with Markovian labels. In the special case of single-crossover, this leads to a recursive solution formula. This extends (and unifies) previous results on the selection-recombination equation. As a concrete example, we consider the selection-mutation-recombination equation.</description>

      <title>Random evolutionary games and random polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.13831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we discover that the class of random polynomials arising from the equilibrium analysis of random asymmetric evolutionary games is \textit{exactly} the Kostlan-Shub-Smale system of random polynomials, revealing an intriguing connection between evolutionary game theory and the theory of random polynomials. Through this connection, we analytically characterize the statistics of the number of internal equilibria of random asymmetric evolutionary games, namely its mean value, probability distribution, central limit theorem and universality phenomena. Biologically, these quantities enable prediction of the levels of social and biological diversity as well as the overall complexity in a dynamical system. By comparing symmetric and asymmetric random games, we establish that symmetry in group interactions increases the expected number of internal equilibria. Our research establishes new theoretical understanding of asymmetric evolutionary games and highlights the significance of symmetry and asymmetry in group interactions.</description>

      <title>Polynomial growth in degree-dependent first passage percolation on spatial random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11880v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study a version of (non-Markovian) first passage percolation on graphs, where the transmission time between two connected vertices is non-iid, but increases by a penalty factor polynomial in their expected degrees. Based on the exponent of the penalty-polynomial, this makes it increasingly harder to transmit to and from high-degree vertices. This choice is motivated by awareness or time-limitations. For the iid part of the transmission times we allow any nonnegative distribution with regularly varying behaviour at $0$. For the underlying graph models we choose spatial random graphs that have power-law degree distributions, so that the effect of the penalisation becomes visible: (finite and infinite) Geometric Inhomogeneous Random Graphs, and Scale-Free Percolation. In these spatial models, the connection probability between two vertices depends on their spatial distance and on their expected degrees. We prove that upon increasing the penalty exponent, the transmission time between two far away vertices $x,y$ sweeps through four universal phases even for a single underlying graph: explosive (tight transmission times), polylogarithmic, polynomial but sublinear ($|x-y|^{\eta_0+o(1)}$ for an explicit $\eta_0&lt;1$), and linear ($\Theta(|x-y|)$) in their Euclidean distance. Further, none of these phases are restricted to phase boundaries, and those are non-trivial in the main model parameters: the tail of the degree-distribution, a long-range parameter, and the exponent of regular variation of the iid part of the transmission times. In this paper we present proofs of lower bounds for the latter two phases and the upper bound for the linear phase. These complement the matching upper bounds for the polynomial regime in our companion paper.</description>

      <title>A Guide to Tracking Phylogenies in Parallel and Distributed Agent-based Evolution Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computer simulations are an important tool for studying the mechanics of biological evolution. In particular, in silico work with agent-based models provides an opportunity to collect high-quality records of ancestry relationships among simulated agents. Such phylogenies can provide insight into evolutionary dynamics within these simulations. Existing work generally tracks lineages directly, yielding an exact phylogenetic record of evolutionary history. However, direct tracking can be inefficient for large-scale, many-processor evolutionary simulations. An alternate approach to extracting phylogenetic information from simulation that scales more favorably is post hoc estimation, akin to how bioinformaticians build phylogenies by assessing genetic similarities between organisms. Recently introduced ``hereditary stratigraphy'' algorithms provide means for efficient inference of phylogenetic history from non-coding annotations on simulated organisms' genomes. A number of options exist in configuring hereditary stratigraphy methodology, but no work has yet tested how they impact reconstruction quality. To address this question, we surveyed reconstruction accuracy under alternate configurations across a matrix of evolutionary conditions varying in selection pressure, spatial structure, and ecological dynamics. We synthesize results from these experiments to suggest a prescriptive system of best practices for work with hereditary stratigraphy, ultimately guiding researchers in choosing appropriate instrumentation for large-scale simulation studies.</description>

      <title>Dimensional reduction and adaptation-development-evolution relation in evolved biological systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Life systems are complex and hierarchical, with diverse components at different scales, yet they sustain themselves, grow, and evolve over time. How can a theory of such complex biological states be developed? Here we note that for a hierarchical biological system to be robust, it must achieve consistency between micro-scale (e.g. molecular) and macro-scale (e.g. cellular) phenomena. This allows for a universal theory of adaptive change in cells based on biological robustness and consistency between cellular growth and molecular replication. Here, we show how adaptive changes in high-dimensional phenotypes (biological states) are constrained to low-dimensional space, leading to the derivation of a macroscopic law for cellular states. The theory is then extended to evolution, leading to proportionality between evolutionary and environmental responses, as well as proportionality between phenotypic variances due to noise and due to genetic changes. The universality of the results across several models and experiments is demonstrated. Then, by further extending the theory of evolutionary dimensional reduction to multicellular systems, the relationship between multicellular development and evolution, in particular the developmental hourglass, is demonstrated. Finally, the possibility of collapse of dimensional reduction under nutrient limitation is discussed.</description>
