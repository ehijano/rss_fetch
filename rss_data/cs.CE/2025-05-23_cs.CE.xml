      <title>A finite element solver for a thermodynamically consistent electrolyte model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we present a finite element solver for a thermodynamically consistent electrolyte model that accurately captures multicomponent ionic transport by incorporating key physical phenomena such as steric effects, solvation, and pressure coupling. The model is rooted in the principles of non-equilibrium thermodynamics and strictly enforces mass conservation, charge neutrality, and entropy production. It extends beyond classical frameworks like the Nernst-Planck system by employing modified partial mass balances, the electrostatic Poisson equation, and a momentum balance expressed in terms of electrostatic potential, atomic fractions, and pressure, thereby enhancing numerical stability and physical consistency. Implemented using the FEniCSx platform, the solver efficiently handles one- and two-dimensional problems with varied boundary conditions and demonstrates excellent convergence behavior and robustness. Validation against benchmark problems confirms its improved physical fidelity, particularly in regimes characterized by high ionic concentrations and strong electrochemical gradients. Simulation results reveal critical electrolyte phenomena, including electric double layer formation, rectification behavior, and the effects of solvation number, Debye length, and compressibility. The solver's modular variational formulation facilitates its extension to complex electrochemical systems involving multiple ionic species with asymmetric valences.</description>

      <title>From Local Patterns to Global Understanding: Cross-Stock Trend Integration for Enhanced Predictive Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stock price prediction is a critical area of financial forecasting, traditionally approached by training models using the historical price data of individual stocks. While these models effectively capture single-stock patterns, they fail to leverage potential correlations among stock trends, which could improve predictive performance. Current single-stock learning methods are thus limited in their ability to provide a broader understanding of price dynamics across multiple stocks. To address this, we propose a novel method that merges local patterns into a global understanding through cross-stock pattern integration. Our strategy is inspired by Federated Learning (FL), a paradigm designed for decentralized model training. FL enables collaborative learning across distributed datasets without sharing raw data, facilitating the aggregation of global insights while preserving data privacy. In our adaptation, we train models on individual stock data and iteratively merge them to create a unified global model. This global model is subsequently fine-tuned on specific stock data to retain local relevance. The proposed strategy enables parallel training of individual stock models, facilitating efficient utilization of computational resources and reducing overall training time. We conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed method, demonstrating that it outperforms benchmark models and enhances the predictive capabilities of state-of-the-art approaches. Our results highlight the efficacy of Cross-Stock Trend Integration (CSTI) in advancing stock price prediction, offering a robust alternative to traditional single-stock learning methodologies.</description>

      <title>SGLDBench: A Benchmark Suite for Stress-Guided Lightweight 3D Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the Stress-Guided Lightweight Design Benchmark (SGLDBench), a comprehensive benchmark suite for applying and evaluating material layout strategies to generate stiff, lightweight designs in 3D domains. SGLDBench provides a seamlessly integrated simulation and analysis framework, including six reference strategies and a scalable multigrid elasticity solver to efficiently execute these strategies and validate the stiffness of their results. This facilitates the systematic analysis and comparison of design strategies based on the mechanical properties they achieve. SGLDBench enables the evaluation of diverse load conditions and, through the tight integration of the solver, supports high-resolution designs and stiffness analysis. Additionally, SGLDBench emphasizes visual analysis to explore the relationship between the geometric structure of a design and the distribution of stresses, offering insights into the specific properties and behaviors of different design strategies. SGLDBench's specific features are highlighted through several experiments, comparing the results of reference strategies with respect to geometric and mechanical properties.</description>

      <title>A New DAPO Algorithm for Stock Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning, such as Dynamic Sampling Policy Optimization (DAPO), show strong performance when paired with large language models (LLMs). Motivated by this success, we ask whether similar gains can be realized in financial trading. We design a trading agent that combines an improved Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, augmented with ideas from DAPO, with LLM-based risk and sentiment signals extracted from financial news. On the NASDAQ-100 index (FNSPID dataset), our agent attains a cumulative return of 230.49 percent and an information ratio of 0.37, outperforming the CPPO-DeepSeek baseline. It also cuts training time from about 8 hours to 2.5 hours over 100 epochs while markedly reducing RAM usage. The proposed RL-LLM framework offers a scalable path toward data-efficient trading agents. Code: https://github.com/Ruijian-Zha/FinRL-DAPO-SR/</description>

      <title>SHAP zero Explains Biological Sequence Models with Near-zero Marginal Cost for Future Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19236v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growing adoption of machine learning models for biological sequences has intensified the need for interpretable predictions, with Shapley values emerging as a theoretically grounded standard for model explanation. While effective for local explanations of individual input sequences, scaling Shapley-based interpretability to extract global biological insights requires evaluating thousands of sequences--incurring exponential computational cost per query. We introduce SHAP zero, a novel algorithm that amortizes the cost of Shapley value computation across large-scale biological datasets. After a one-time model sketching step, SHAP zero enables near-zero marginal cost for future queries by uncovering an underexplored connection between Shapley values, high-order feature interactions, and the sparse Fourier transform of the model. Applied to models of guide RNA efficacy, DNA repair outcomes, and protein fitness, SHAP zero explains predictions orders of magnitude faster than existing methods, recovering rich combinatorial interactions previously inaccessible at scale. This work opens the door to principled, efficient, and scalable interpretability for black-box sequence models in biology.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Dynamic Network Model of the Space Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work proposes to model the space environment as a stochastic dynamic network where each node is a group of objects of a given class, or species, and their relationship is represented by stochastic links. A set of stochastic dynamic equations, governing the evolution of the network, are derived from the network structure and topology. It will be shown that the proposed system of stochastic dynamic equations well reproduces existing results on the evolution of the space environment. The analysis of the structure of the network and relationships among node can help to understand which species of objects and orbit regimes are more critical and affect the most the future evolution of the space environment. In analogy with ecological networks, we develop a theory of the carrying capacity of space based on the stability of equilibria of the network dynamics. Some examples are presented starting from the current population of resident objects and different launch traffic forecast models. It will be shown how the proposed network model can be used to study the effect of the adoption of different policies on the execution of collision avoidance and post mission disposal manoeuvres.</description>

      <title>FlowHFT: Imitation Learning via Flow Matching Policy for Optimal High-Frequency Trading under Diverse Market Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05784v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-frequency trading (HFT) is an investing strategy that continuously monitors market states and places bid and ask orders at millisecond speeds. Traditional HFT approaches fit models with historical data and assume that future market states follow similar patterns. This limits the effectiveness of any single model to the specific conditions it was trained for. Additionally, these models achieve optimal solutions only under specific market conditions, such as assumptions about stock price's stochastic process, stable order flow, and the absence of sudden volatility. Real-world markets, however, are dynamic, diverse, and frequently volatile. To address these challenges, we propose the FlowHFT, a novel imitation learning framework based on flow matching policy. FlowHFT simultaneously learns strategies from numerous expert models, each proficient in particular market scenarios. As a result, our framework can adaptively adjust investment decisions according to the prevailing market state. Furthermore, FlowHFT incorporates a grid-search fine-tuning mechanism. This allows it to refine strategies and achieve superior performance even in complex or extreme market scenarios where expert strategies may be suboptimal. We test FlowHFT in multiple market environments. We first show that flow matching policy is applicable in stochastic market environments, thus enabling FlowHFT to learn trading strategies under different market conditions. Notably, our single framework consistently achieves performance superior to the best expert for each market condition.</description>
