      <title>Neutrino Mass Induced $n$-$\overline{n}$ Oscillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Georgi-Glashow model is the simplest possible attempt at grand unification. However, due to its particle content, it preserves a global $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry, where $B$ and $L$ are baryon and lepton numbers, respectively. It thus leaves neutrinos massless just as in the Standard Model. Extensions of the Georgi-Glashow model that break lepton number by two units, i.e., scenarios with $|\Delta L|=2$ operator(s), naturally generate potentially viable Majorana neutrino masses. Consequently, $B-L$ breaking via the same dynamics that yields $|\Delta L| = 2$ interactions unavoidably induces $|\Delta B| = 2$ transitions, leading to intriguing processes such as neutron-antineutron ($n$-$\overline{n}$) oscillation. We demonstrate this intrinsic connection between neutrino mass generation and $n$-$\overline{n}$ oscillation within tree-level seesaw mechanisms of the Type I, II, and III varieties, as well as in the one-loop and two-loop radiative neutrino mass models. Our study exhausts the simplest possible extensions of the Georgi-Glashow model that yield realistic neutrino masses and mixing parameters and, in the process, induce $n$-$\overline{n}$ oscillation.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Heavy Neutral Leptons: Measuring Parameters, Discriminating Majorana versus Dirac, and Using FASER2 as a Trigger for ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores the potential of the proposed FASER2 experiment at the LHC to determine the properties of a discovered heavy neutral lepton (HNL), including its mass, couplings, and whether it is a Majorana or Dirac fermion. We first consider a Majorana HNL with mass $m_N = 1.84\,\rm{GeV}$ that is primarily produced through decays $D \to \mu N$ at the ATLAS interaction point. Such HNLs may travel macroscopic distances in the far-forward direction and then decay, yielding approximately 8600 $N \to \mu \pi$ decays in FASER2 at the High-Luminosity LHC. With FASER2 measurements alone, the HNL's mass and couplings can be measured to fractional uncertainties of approximately 0.1% and 3% at 95% CL, respectively, and the Dirac fermion hypothesis can be rejected at 99.8% CL. We then consider a second, more difficult, case of a Majorana HNL with mass $m_N = 2.00\,\rm{GeV}$, yielding only 80 $N \to \mu \pi$ decays in FASER2. With FASER2 alone, measurements of HNL properties are still possible, but somewhat less precise. However, by using FASER2 as a trigger for ATLAS and measuring the charge of the muon produced in association with the HNL at ATLAS to search for lepton number violation, one can precisely measure the HNL's properties and reject the Dirac fermion hypothesis at 99.7% CL. These results show that FASER2, sometimes in coordination with ATLAS, can precisely determine HNL properties, with far-reaching implications for our understanding of neutrino masses, baryogenesis, and the fundamental symmetries of nature.</description>

      <title>A new determination of $\alpha_s (M_\tau^2)$ and higher-order QCD corrections to hadronic $\tau$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ \textit{Levin-type sequence transformations} to accelerate the convergence of the perturbative fixed-order expansion of the QCD correction $\delta^{(0)}$ in terms of the strong coupling $\alpha_s$, and of the inverted series expressing $\alpha_s$ in powers of $\delta^{(0)}$. The method efficiently resums the divergent inverted series, yielding a stable and self-consistent determination of the strong coupling at the $\tau$ mass scale. It also provides reliable estimates of higher-order QCD corrections to hadronic $\tau$ decays, consistent with existing results. We find $\alpha_s^{\text{Levin-FOPT}} = 0.3159 \pm 0.0018 \, \pm 0.0023 \, $, and predict $c_{5,1} = 269^{+47}_{-45}, \quad c_{6,1} = 3185^{+117}_{-279}, \quad c_{7,1} = (1.9^{+0.9}_{-0.8}) \times 10^4.$ Our results demonstrate that Levin-type transformations provide an efficient framework for analyzing asymptotic perturbative series and improving the extraction of $\alpha_s(M_\tau^2)$ from hadronic $\tau$ decays.</description>

      <title>Determination of proton PDF uncertainties with Markov Chain Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the proton using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. The MCMC approach naturally implements Bayes' theorem and thus provides a means to directly sample the underlying probability distribution - in this case the probability distribution of the PDF parameters. This allows for a straightforward propagation of the resulting uncertainties into any PDF-dependent observable, preserving their simple probabilistic interpretation. In our analysis we include a broad set of deep inelastic scattering data from HERA, BCDMS and NMC experiments along with the Drell-Yan, $W$ and $Z$ boson data from LHC and Tevatron experiments, which combined with theoretical calculations at next-to-next-to-leading order in QCD allow for realistic determination of PDFs. The main focus of this analysis is to explore alternative methods for PDF uncertainty estimation that are more firmly grounded in statistical principles. We show that the flexibility of the Bayes framework, allowing e.g. to account for non-Gaussianity or inconsistencies of data sets, is crucial to extract realistic uncertainties when such assumptions are not fulfilled. We also demonstrate that MCMC allows one to determine the $\Delta \chi^2$ value corresponding to a given confidence level in the sample, which can in turn be used as a statistically well-founded tolerance criterion used in the Hessian method, thus addressing one of its main long-standing drawbacks.</description>

      <title>Axion condensates in neutron stars and radial oscillation modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light QCD axions, introduced to solve the strong CP problem, may form condensates inside neutron stars, giving rise to a novel ground state of dense matter. We investigate how such axion condensates modify the equilibrium structure and radial oscillation spectrum of NSs. Using a realistic NS model with the BSk26 equation of state, and solving the coupled Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff and Klein-Gordon equations together with a linear perturbation analysis, we find two distinct families of quasi-normal modes: weakly damped fluid-dominated oscillations and highly damped axion modes. The coupling between the fluid and the axion field introduces axion-induced damping of radial oscillations, with decay timescales of order seconds for kHz axion masses. Modes with frequencies above the axion mass are strongly damped, while those below remain unaffected. These results suggest that stellar oscillations could provide a novel probe of axion properties, opening prospects for axion asteroseismology in neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Nucleon axial form factors in generalized nonlocal chiral effective theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we first investigate the chiral transformation properties of the nonlocal pion field operator and construct a generalized nonlocal chiral Lagrangian that is invariant under $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ chiral symmetry transformations. As a simple application, we then calculate the leading and next-leading order pion one loop corrections to the nucleon axial form factors within nonlocal chiral perturbation theory. Then, we fit the next leading order and next-next leading order low energy coupling constants (LECs) to lattice QCD data. The fitted results show that the nonlocal LECs are comparatively smaller than their local counterparts. Finally, using these LECs, we compute the $Q^{2}$ dependence of the nucleon axial form factors. The numerical results indicate that the nonlocal nucleon axial form factors are consistent with lattice QCD data in a wide $\rm Q^{2}$ range, up to $\rm Q^{2} = 1~\mathrm{GeV}^{2}$</description>

      <title>Semileptonic decay and form factors of $\Omega_b^- \rightarrow \Omega_c^0\,e\,\bar{\nu_e}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the heavy-to-heavy semileptonic decay $\Omega_b^- \rightarrow \Omega_c^0\,e\,\bar{\nu_e}$ within the framework of the Hypercentral Constituent Quark Model (HCQM). The ground state masses of the involved baryons are evaluated by numerically solving the six-dimensional hyperradial Schr\"{o}dinger equation, incorporating both hyper-Coulomb and linear confinement potentials along with spin-dependent interactions. The Heavy Quark Effective Field Theory (HQET) form factors are computed up to the subleading order, incorporating $1/m_Q$ corrections that account for finite mass effects beyond the heavy quark symmetry limit. These form factors are then employed to analyse the heavy-to-heavy semileptonic decay rate via helicity formalism. Our results for the decay width and branching ratio are compared with those from various theoretical approaches.</description>

      <title>Heavy flavor transport in the QGP medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I review recent developments on heavy flavor transport in the QGP medium, along two directions. The first is the transport of individual open heavy quarks. Leveraging the tools of heavy quark effective theory, recent work revealed a novel connection between the evolution equation of the heavy quark phase space distribution, the conditions for kinetic equilibration to take place, and a non-perturbatively defined expectation value of a Wilson loop characterized by the heavy quark velocity. Using these developments, I discuss results from a first exploration of the ensuing stopping and equilibration dynamics of heavy quarks in a strongly coupled environment. The second direction is the transport of quarkonia, bound states of heavy quarks, where novel Generalized Gluon Distributions have been recently defined and calculated in the framework of potential non-relativistic QCD. I discuss their application to the dynamics of quarkonium in heavy-ion collisions, highlighting the need to account for non-Markovian effects in the interactions between the heavy quark pair and quark-gluon plasma -- which have thus far resisted a systematic characterization.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Oscillation Prospects with a Dual-Baseline Beam from BNL to SNOLAB and SURF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) is a next-generation accelerator primarily designed to study the internal structure of nucleons through high-precision electron-hadron collisions. In this work, we explore the feasibility of employing a 1 MW fraction of the EIC proton beam to generate a high-intensity GeV-scale neutrino beam for long-baseline oscillation studies. We have simulated proton-target interactions and optimize the resulting neutrino fluxes for water-based liquid scintillator (WbLS) detectors located at distinct baselines of 900 km and at 2900 km. Oscillation analyses performed with GLoBES show that extended baselines allow access to multiple oscillation maxima, significantly enhancing sensitivity to leptonic CP violation. The study also examines the interplay between matter effects and the intrinsic CP violating phase in shaping observable asymmetries. These results suggest that the EIC proton beam could provide a novel and complementary source for precision neutrino physics, extending the scientific reach of the EIC program.</description>

      <title>A Way of Axion Detection with Mass $10^{-4} \text{-}10^{-3}$eV Using Cylindrical Sample with Low Electric Conductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A dark matter axion with mass $m_a$ induces an oscillating electric field in a cylindrical sample placed under a magnetic field $B$ parallel to the cylinder axis. When the cylinder is made of a highly electrically conductive material, the induced oscillating current primarily dissipates the axion energy at the surface. In contrast, if the cylinder is composed of a material with low conductivity, e.g. $\sigma = 10^{-3}\text{eV}$, the axion energy is dissipated mainly inside the bulk of the cylinder. Within the QCD axion model, the dissipated power $P$ is estimated as $P \simeq 2.8\times 10^{-28}\text{W} g_{\gamma}^2 \left(L/100\text{cm}\right)\left(R/2\text{cm}\right)^2 \left(m_a/10^{-4}\text{eV}\right) \left(B/10\text{T}\right)^2\left(10/\epsilon\right) \left(\rho_a/0.3\text{GeVcm}^{-3}\right)$, with $\sigma= 10^{-3}$eV, radius $R$, length $L$, electric permittivity $\epsilon = 10$ of the cylinder and axion energy density $\rho_a$, where $g_{\gamma}(\text{KSVZ}) = -0.96$ and $g_{\gamma}(\text{DFSZ}) = 0.37$. Using an LC circuit appropriately tuned to a quality factor $Q = 10^6$, the signal-to-noise ratio at low temperature $100$mK and observation time $60$sec. is so large $\sim 10$ that the detection of dark matter axions is feasible in the mass range $m_a =10^{-4}\text{-}10^{-3}\text{eV}$.</description>

      <title>Possible mixing between elementary and bound state fields in the $t\bar{t}$ production excess at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent report by CMS Collaboration on the excess of top and anti-top pair production is studied, under the hypothesis of the coexistence of a toponium $(\eta_t)$ and an additional elementary field $(\Psi)$. We examine the scenario where toponium and an additional field are mixed, and consider the plausible scenarios in that case. Two scenarios are examined: one is the minimal model with $\Psi$ close to the inert Higgs doublet, and the other is embedded into the two Higgs doublet models (2HDM), where $\Psi$ is one of the two Higgs scalars after transforming the basis. The value of the each coupling constant is restricted by the Multicritical Point Principle (MPP). Consistency with the data gives constraints on a mixing angle $\theta\ (-45^\circ\le\theta\le45^\circ)$, with which the mass eigenstate $\Psi^\prime$ contributing to the excess is defined by $\Psi^\prime=\Psi\cos \theta + \eta_t\sin \theta$. The obtained results are $|\theta| \le 17^{\circ}$ for the minimum scenario, and $|\theta| \le 1^{\circ}$ for the second scenario of 2HDM(Type II and Y). We also briefly discuss the comparison with Type I and X.</description>

      <title>Bayesian inference of the magnetic component of quark-gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chromo-magnetic monopoles (CMM), emergent topological excitations of non-Abelian gauge fields carrying chromo-magnetic charge, have long been postulated to play an important role in the vacuum confinement of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the deconfinement transition at temperature $T_c\approx 160\rm MeV$, as well as the strongly coupled nature of quark-gluon plasma (QGP). While such CMMs have been found to provide solutions for challenging puzzles from heavy-ion collision measurements, they were typically introduced as model assumptions in the past. Here we show how their very existence can be determined and their abundance extracted in a data-driven way for the first time. Using the \textsc{cujet3} framework for calculations of jet energy loss and analyzing a comprehensive experimental data set for nuclear modification factor ($R_{\mathrm{AA}}$) and elliptic flow ($v_2$) of high-transverse-momentum hadrons, the fraction of CMMs in the QGP is obtained by Bayesian inference and is found to be substantial in the $1\sim 2 T_c$ region. The posterior CMM fraction is further validated by excellent agreement with additional data and is also shown to predict QGP transport properties quantitatively consistent with the state-of-the-art knowledge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine high-density axion clusters under gravitational compression. These are transient events in which the majority of axions are rapidly converted into photons, with some configurations producing photon signals with distinctive and characteristic patterns. We estimated the mass of the remnant objects and note that some could be black holes while in some cases it may be possible to identify the emitted photons with a robust class of fast radio bursts.</description>

      <title>Imprints of a Second Order Electroweak Phase Transition on the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we shall study the impact of a second order electroweak phase transition occurring at $\sim 150\,$GeV on the energy spectrum of the stochastic gravitational background. Specifically, we assume that the non-minimally coupled Higgs field controls the inflationary era, we find the reheating temperature for the Higgs inflationary model and we demonstrate that the Higgs effective potential exhibits a very weak first order phase transition. This weak first order phase transition is an indication that the electroweak phase transition may not actually proceed as a first order phase transition, but it will proceed as a crossover or second order phase transition. This second order phase transition proceeds with the Higgs field slow-rolling its potential toward to its new minimum. This slow-rolling may deform the radiation domination total equation of state, and the aim of this work is to pinpoint the observational imprints of this total equation of state deformation on the energy spectrum of the primordial gravitational waves, that affects modes that enter the horizon at temperatures $T\sim 150\,$GeV or lower.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As members of the $J^{PC}=3^{++}$ light meson family, the assignments of the $a_3(1875)$, $a_3(2030)$, $a_3(2275)$, $f_3(2050)$, and $f_3(2300)$ states remain unclear. In this work, we investigate the mass spectra and the Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka-allowed two-body strong decays of the $3^{++}$ light meson family using the modified Godfrey-Isgur quark model and the quark-pair creation model. We explore the identification of the $a_3(1875)$, $a_3(2030)$, $a_3(2275)$, $f_3(2050)$, and $f_3(2300)$ states. Additionally, we predict the masses and widths of the higher excitations in the $3^{++}$ light meson family.</description>

      <title>Possibility To Study Photon Scattering By Proton In The Reaction e+p -&gt; e+p+gamma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A theoretical possibility to determine the proton Compton scattering cross section from the reaction $ep\rightarrow ep\gamma$ is studied in the kinematics with a small transversal momentum transfer in the electron leg. With the exception of the region of forward photon directions and extreme photon energies close to the maximum ones or zero, registration of the particles $\gamma$ and $p$ in the final state can enable one to distinguish the sub-process of the Compton scattering from the electron bremsstrahlung background and, owing to complete kinematical reconstruction of each individual event, measure in detail energy and angular dependence of the $\gamma p$-scattering cross section. The count rate expected with a storage ring like NEP having luminosity $L \approx 2 \cdot 10^{35}$ cm$^{-2}\cdot$ sec$^{-1}$ as projected is $\approx 10^3$ events/hour. Such measurements might help to determine proton polarizabilities with high statistical accuracy.</description>

      <title>The window on heavy charged dark matter was never open</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a claim in the literature that charged dark matter particles in the mass range $100 (q_{\rm X}/e)^2~\mathrm{TeV} \leq m_{\rm X} \leq 10^8 (q_{\rm X}/e)~\mathrm{TeV}$ are allowed, based on arguing that heavy charged particles cannot reach the Earth from outside the magnetized region of the Milky Way (Chuzhoy-Kolb, 2009). We point out that this claim fails for physical models for the Galactic magnetic field. We explicitly confirm our argument by simulating with the software CRPropa the trajectories of heavy charged dark matter in models of the Galactic magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Searching for generalized neutrino interactions in direct detection experiments with E{\nu}ES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the sensitivity of present and future direct detection experiments to generalized neutrino interactions (GNI) through elastic neutrino electron scattering. Using data from LUX-ZEPLIN, PandaX-4T, and XENONnT, we derive constraints on vector, axial-vector, scalar, and tensor effective couplings, and compare them with existing limits. Our results show that current xenon-based detectors already provide competitive bounds, with XENONnT offering the most stringent constraints due to its larger exposure and reduced backgrounds. Among the GNI couplings, the scalar contributions remain more weakly constrained, while tensor interactions yield the strongest limits. We also present projected sensitivities for the DARWIN experiment, showing potential improvements. These results demonstrate the capability of direct detection experiments, originally designed for dark matter searches, to provide complementary and competitive constraints on generalized neutrino interactions.</description>

      <title>The Lorentz-Violating effects in charged particle systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the relativistic dynamics of a spin half particle in the presence of a Lorentz violating background within the framework of effective field theory. A modified Dirac Hamiltonian is considered, arising from a CPT odd coupling involving the Lorentz violating gauge tensor of the Standard Model Extension (SME). The velocity and effective force operators are derived from the Heisenberg equations of motion. Using Ehrenfest s theorem and the correspondence principle, we obtain the classical limit of the dynamics and identify an effective force exhibiting a generalized Lorentz force structure. This formalism is applied to a Penning trap system, known for its high precision measurements of charged particle properties. Our analysis shows that the effective cyclotron frequency acquires a correction due to the Lorentz violating term, leading to deviations in the particle trajectory and offering a potentially observable signature of Lorentz violation in precision experiments. By comparing our results with current bounds from high precision Penning traps, we establish an upper limit on the Lorentz violating coupling, $gu\leq 10^{-18}\text{eV}^{-1}$. These results highlight the potential of relativistic effective models to probe new physics and reinforce the role of Penning traps as sensitive tools for testing Lorentz symmetry.</description>

      <title>Radiative lepton model in a non-invertible fusion rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a radiatively induced lepton mass model introducing a $Z_2$ gauging $Z_5$ fusion rule. In our framework, the charged-lepton mass matrix is generated at one loop level via dynamical breaking of the fusion rule. On the other hand, the neutrino mass matrix is induced at one-loop level without breaking the fusion rule. As a direct consequence of the loop induced charged lepton masses, we can also consider lepton flavor violations, electron and muon $g-2$, and charged-lepton electric dipole moments that come into our valid phenomenological discussion. Then, we perform numerical analysis and show some interesting tendency on Dirac CP phase, two Majorana phases, charged-lepton electric dipole moments and the neutrinoless double beta decay, all of which depends on their arguments where we fix the absolute values of our free parameters in order to satisfy experimental data of the lepton masses and mixing angles.</description>

      <title>Deep Neural Network extraction of Unpolarized Transverse Momentum Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on the first-ever application of neural networks in TMD phenomenology: "Extraction of the Sivers function with deep neural networks", we now present a momentum space, physics-informed deep learning framework for the direct extraction of unpolarized transverse momentum dependent parton distributions (TMDs) from fixed target Drell-Yan data (E288, E605). Rather than transforming to impact-parameter space, we remain in k and embed a normalized integrand s(x, k; Q) whose auto-convolution produces the observed qT spectra. The extraction proceeds in two steps. Stage I learns the structure kernel S(qT , x1, x2; QM ) by regressing the cross-section with known kinematic prefactors and charge-weighted PDF combinations factored out; experimental and PDF uncertainties are propagated with Monte Carlo replicas. Stage II reconstructs s(x, k; Q) with an end-to-end differentiable k quadrature layer. Applied to Fermilab cross-section data from experiments E288 and E605, the method reproduces the measured qT spectra across Q and yields x and Q dependent TMDs that broaden with Q, with uncertainty bands that consistently propagate experimental, PDF, algorithmic and methodological components. The approach is minimally biased (no factorized Ansatze and no bT transform) and provides a transferable template for polarized TMDs and related QCD inverse problems.</description>

      <title>Predicting charmed-strange molecular tetraquarks with $K^{(*)}$ and $T$-doublet (anti-)charmed meson</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we systematically investigate the charmed-strange molecular tetraquarks composed of a $K^{(*)}$ meson and a $T$-doublet (anti-)charmed meson. Our analysis is performed within the one-boson-exchange model, with a careful treatment of $S$-$D$ wave mixing and coupled-channel effects. We identify the $X_1(2900)$ resonance, observed by LHCb, as a molecular state in the coupled $K \bar{D}_1 / K^* \bar{D}_1 / K^* \bar{D}_2^*$ system with quantum numbers $I(J^P)=0(1^-)$. This state is dominated by the $K \bar{D}_1$ component but exhibits a significant admixture from the $K^* \bar{D}_1$ channel. Furthermore, we predict several partner states of the $X_1(2900)$ in the $K^*\bar{D}_1$ and $K^{(*)}\bar{D}_2^*$ systems. We also extend our framework to the $K^{(*)} {D}_1/K^{(*)} {D}_2^*$ systems, where our results suggest a series of $T_{c \bar s}$-type charmed-strange molecular tetraquark candidates. These findings provide a comprehensive picture of the molecular spectrum in the charmed-strange sector and can be tested in future experimental studies.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from Phase Transition in a Supersymmetric Left-Right Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the cosmological phase transition dynamics in a supersymmetric left-right symmetric model based on the gauge group $SU(3)_C \times SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \times U(1)_{B-L}$ that addresses the strong CP problem through extended parity symmetry and doublet-doublet splitting. We compute the finite temperature effective potential including one-loop Coleman-Weinberg corrections, thermal contributions, and daisy resummation to determine whether the $SU(2)_R \times U(1)_{B-L} \to U(1)_Y$ symmetry breaking transition can produce observable gravitational waves. For phenomenologically viable parameters satisfying current LHC constraints, we find that the phase transition is strongly first-order with nucleation temperature $T_n \sim 0.5 v_R$, transition strength parameter $\alpha \sim 0.01-0.3$, and inverse duration $\beta/H \sim 100$. The resulting stochastic gravitational wave background peaks at frequencies $f \sim 0.1-1$ Hz with amplitude $h^2\Omega_{GW} \sim 10^{-14}-10^{-12}$. We find that there is a parameter region where the gravitational wave spectrum overlaps with DECIGO/BBO sensitivity curves, providing a potentially observable signature connecting the theoretical solution to the strong CP problem with gravitational wave experiments.</description>

      <title>A radiative seesaw model in a non-invertible selection rule with the assistance of a non-holomorphic modular $A_4$ symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a two-loop neutrino mass model where fermionic and bosonic dark matter (DM) candidates are simultaneously connected to the neutrinos. But the fermionic DM candidate is favored compared to the bosonic one due to generating the fermionic DM mass at one-loop level. In order to obtain our desired Lagrangian and Higgs potential, we introduce a $Z_3$ gauging TY non-invertible fusion rule with the assistance of a non-holomorphic modular $A_4$ symmetry. The fusion rule forbids the mass of DM candidate at tree level but its mass is generated at one-loop level where the DM mass term dynamically violates the fusion rule. After that, the neutrino mass matrix is induced at one-loop level where a remnant $Z_2$ symmetry is still remained. The symmetry assures the stability of our DM candidate. The non-holomorphic modular $A_4$ symmetry plays a role in forbidding the interactions between the SM particles and heavier fermions $X_R$ and an isospin singlet inert scalar boson $S_0$ that run in the DM mass loop, in addition to reduction our free parameters that leads to our predictions for lepton sector. We perform $\chi^2$ numerical analysis for the lepton masses, mixing angles, and phases, and we show several predictions for NH and IH. Then, we demonstrate our lepton flavor violations, muon anomalous magnetic dipole moment, and the relic density of the DM candidate fixing the best fit point of the lepton sector.</description>

      <title>A dispersive approach to the CP conserving $K\to\pi\ell^+\ell^-$ radiative decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reconsider the constraints on the form factors $W_+ (s)$ and $W_S (s)$, describing the radiative decay modes $K^+\to\pi^+ \ell^+\ell^-$ and $K_S\to\pi^0 \ell^+\ell^-$, associated with the general properties of analyticity and unitarity. Starting from the simple consideration of the asymptotic behaviours of the two combinations $2 W_+ (s) - W_S (s)$ and $W_+ (s) + W_S (s)$, we derive a minimal pair of dispersive representations which involves only two free parameters. An important input for these representations consists of the $K\to3\pi$ decay amplitudes, for which we use a set of solutions of the Khuri-Treiman equations obtained recently. These solutions provide an extrapolation from the physical $K\to3\pi$ decay region up to the resonant $K\pi\to\pi\pi$ scattering regions. We show that the experimental energy dependence of $|W_+|^2$ can be well reproduced and that the sign of $W_+$ is unambiguously determined. We also show that the yet unknown $\Delta{I}=1/2$ part of the $K_S\to \pi^+ \pi^- \pi^0$ amplitude can be determined from the value of $W_+(0) + W_S(0)$. The possibility of fixing the sign of $W_S(0)$ using experimental data on both $|W_+|^2$ and $|W_S|^2$ is discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the axion is the most compelling solution to the strong CP problem, the ad hoc introduced global Peccei-Quinn symmetry suffers from a severe fine-tuning problem known as the quality problem. In this Letter, we show that the discrete gauge symmetry $\mathbb Z_4 \times \mathbb Z_3$ motivated from the internal structure of the Standard Model can naturally predict a high-quality axion, leading to a distinct and testable parameter space. Remarkably, this minimal framework simultaneously accounts for neutrino masses, baryon asymmetry, and dark matter.</description>

      <title>One-loop QED and Weak Corrections to $\gamma \gamma \to H^\pm H^\mp$ in the Inert Doublet Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17387v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a complete one-loop analysis of charged scalar boson pair production in photon-photon collisions, $\gamma\gamma \to H^\pm H^\mp$, within the framework of the Inert Doublet Model (IDM). The calculation is carried out in the on-shell renormalization scheme and incorporates both weak corrections and QED effects, including soft and hard photon radiation. Virtual loop contributions and real emission processes are computed using the Feynman diagrammatic method, ensuring the cancellation of ultraviolet and infrared divergences. To properly account for the Coulomb singularity that arises in the QED sector near threshold, we introduce the resummed cross section based on the Sommerfeld factor. The IDM parameter space is explored under theoretical consistency conditions, collider limits, and dark matter constraints, and three representative scenarios are studied in detail. We find that the magnitude of the quantum corrections is strongly controlled by the absolute value of the trilinear scalar coupling $\lambda_{h^0 H^+ H^-}$, which correlates with the charged scalar mass. When all constraints are applied, the weak corrections are typically in the range of $-12\%$ to $-7\%$ at $\sqrt{s}=250$~GeV, and between $-15\%$ and $6\%$ at $\sqrt{s}=500$~GeV. At higher energies, such as $\sqrt{s}=1$~TeV, the corrections can become very large, ranging from about $-20\%$ up to $+60\%$. Our findings highlight the significant role of higher-order effects in photon-photon collisions and establish $\gamma\gamma \to H^\pm H^\mp$ as a promising process to investigate the charged scalar sector of the IDM at future high-energy photon colliders. Several benchmark points are proposed to facilitate future experimental searches.</description>

      <title>The inclusive Higgs boson cross-section in gluon-gluon fusion in soft-virtual approximation at fourth order in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present precise results for the inclusive Higgs boson cross-section in gluon-gluon fusion at the LHC considering state-of-the-art fourth-order results in perturbative QCD arising from the dominant soft and virtual gluon emissions. Utilizing four-loop QCD results for the gluon-form factor, the splitting function and related anomalous dimensions, we study the effects of threshold enhanced soft gluon emissions and estimate their impact on the total cross-section at the fourth order. Our study highlights the role of these higher-order contributions in improving the perturbative convergence and in significantly reducing the renormalization and factorization scale uncertainties. The results provide strong evidence for the perturbative stability and reliability of Higgs boson cross-section predictions at the LHC, thereby reinforcing the robustness of theoretical inputs in precision Higgs phenomenology. We also provide cross-section predictions using a large set of available parton distribution functions and show that, together with the value of the strong coupling $\alpha_s(m_Z)$, they cause the largest residual uncertainty for the Higgs boson cross-section in gluon-gluon fusion.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic properties of the $D_{s1}^{+}(2460)$, $D_{s1}^{+}(2536)$, and their bottom partners in a molecular configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the electromagnetic properties of the axial-vector molecular states $D^* K$, $DK^*$, $B^* K$, and $BK^*$, which are used to model the charmed states $D_{s1}^{+}(2460)$, $D_{s1}^{+}(2536)$, and their bottom partners with quantum numbers $J^P = 1^+$. To our knowledge, this presents the first comprehensive calculation of the magnetic and quadrupole moments for these specific molecular configurations. Employing the QCD light-cone sum rule method with molecular-type interpolating currents, we compute these moments and perform a detailed flavor decomposition to reveal the internal distribution of the electromagnetic charge and spin. Our results demonstrate that the light up and down quarks dominate the electromagnetic response, with negligible contributions from the heavy quarks. The $D^* K$ and $B^* K$ states exhibit negative quadrupole moments and slightly oblate charge distributions, whereas the $DK^*$ and $BK^*$ states possess positive quadrupole moments and prolate distributions, with significant contributions from the strange quark. The predicted moments provide benchmarks for lattice QCD calculations and are testable through their influence on radiative transitions and photo- and electro-production observables at high-luminosity facilities, offering crucial insights into the internal structure and nature of these axial-vector states.</description>

      <title>Colour coherence in small collision systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observation of collectivity in collisions of small systems has constituted a challenge for the heavy-ion community for over a decade now. The absence of jet quenching in those systems presents an apparent contradiction to the presence of an azimuthal anisotropy of high-$p_\perp$ particles. In the present work, we investigate the role of colour coherence in this puzzle. For that, we use the \textsc{Jewel} Monte Carlo model in its latest version, which includes effects of colour coherence in the jet-medium interactions. We then compare the two scenarios, with and without colour coherence, and quantify the effect on hadron and jet $R_{AA}$ as well as on high-$p_\perp$ $v_2$. The results indicate that, although coherence effects do account for an increase in $R_{AA}$, they do not affect $v_2$ to the same extent. Using hydrodynamic profiles generated with \textit{Trajectum} we compare O+O and Pb+Pb collisions at the same charged particle multiplicity and find that the nuclear modification factors are the same in both systems despite their different shapes.</description>

      <title>Leptonic first-row correlation and non-unitarity waiting for direct JUNO and Daya Bay precision tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conjecture that there exists a remarkable correlation among the three elements in the first row of the $3\times 3$ lepton flavor mixing matrix $U$: $|U^{}_{e1}|^2 = 2 \left(|U^{}_{e2}|^2 + |U^{}_{e3}|^2\right)$, which holds even though $U$ is non-unitary in the canonical seesaw mechanism. This ``first-row correlation" is fully consistent with $\sin^2\theta^{}_{12} = \left(1 - 2\tan^2\theta^{}_{13}\right)/3$ for the two active neutrino mixing angles derived from the TM1 flavor mixing pattern, and it will be {\it directly} tested by the upcoming JUNO precision data combined with the Daya Bay precision measurement.</description>

      <title>Probing the Higgs Portal to a Strongly-Interacting Dark Sector at the FCC-ee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores exotic signatures from confining dark sectors that may arise in the e+e- collision mode at the Future Circular Collider. Assuming the Higgs boson mediates the interaction between the Standard Model and the dark sector, dark quarks can be produced in e+e- collisions. The ensuing strong dynamics may lead to semi-visible jet final states, containing both visible and invisible particles. We investigate semi-visible jets with different fractions of invisible states, and enriched in leptons and photons. When the invisible component is large, selections based on kinematic features, such as the missing energy in the event, already provide good signal-to-background discrimination. For smaller invisible fractions, the reduced missing energy makes these signals more similar to Standard Model events, and we therefore employ a graph neural network jet tagger exploiting differences in jet substructure. This machine learning strategy improves sensitivity and enhances the discovery prospects of Higgs boson-induced semi-visible jets at the Future Circular Collider. Our results show that the proposed strategy can effectively probe a wide parameter space for the models considered, and a variety of signatures, constraining the Higgs boson exotic branching ratios into dark quarks at the permille-level.</description>

      <title>Automated computation of spin-density matrices and quantum observables for collider physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a fully automated framework to compute production spin-density matrices for generic collider processes at tree level within \textsc{MadGraph5\_aMC@NLO}. The method assembles helicity amplitudes into event-by-event production matrices. These are written to the LHE file in a compact form, together with run metadata, enabling direct post-processing of quantum observables. The implementation supports bi- and multipartite qubit and qutrit final states, configurable reference frames, and both polarised and unpolarised initial states. A companion, easy-to-extend library provides analysis routines to determine key quantum-information measures and witnesses. These include purity, concurrence, and entanglement of formation for qubits; Peres--Horodecki tests and negativity; spin-polarisation vectors and correlation matrices; $D$-coefficients; and stabiliser-based ``magic'' measures. As a result, multi-particle quantum correlations can be quantified systematically. We validate the implementation against known results for $t\bar t$ and $VV$ ($V=W^\pm,Z$) production in $pp$ and $e^+e^-$ collisions and in heavy-resonance decays. We then consider new applications and study quantum correlations in several LHC final states: $t\bar t W^\pm$, $tW^-$ vs.\ $t(\bar t\to W^- \bar b)$, and $t\bar t t$ vs. $t\bar t t\bar t$.</description>

      <title>B-Meson Anomalies: Effective Field Theory Meets Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrepancies between experimental measurements and Standard Model predictions in $B$-meson decays, especially in lepton flavor universality ratios like $R_{D^{(*)}}$, $R_{J/\psi}$ and branching ratios for processes like $B\to K^+\nu\bar\nu$, suggest possible new physics (NP). In this study, we use an effective field theory framework, assuming NP effects only affect a single generation in the interaction basis, leading to non-universal mixing when rotating to the mass basis. We perform a global fit to the current experimental data, exploring three scenarios characterized by different mixing patterns and constraints. Our analysis finds that the best fit involves mixing between the second and third quark generations, with no lepton sector mixing and independent coefficients for singlet and triplet four-fermion operators. To accurately capture the non-Gaussian nature of the resulting parameter distributions, we use a Machine Learning-based Monte Carlo algorithm, enabling the generation of representative samples that reflect the true underlying distributions. This work highlights the valuable role of Machine Learning in accurately modeling complex parameter distributions in particle physics analyses.</description>

      <title>Higher-order corrections for $t{\bar t}Z$ production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present calculations of higher-order QCD and electroweak (EW) corrections to the associated production of a top-antitop quark pair and a $Z$ boson, i.e. $t{\bar t}Z$ production, in proton collisions. We find that the contributions from soft-gluon corrections are numerically dominant and large. We present approximate NNLO (aNNLO) and approximate N$^3$LO (aN$^3$LO) cross sections that include soft corrections on top of the exact NLO QCD result. We also add electroweak corrections through NLO. We compare our aN$^3$LO QCD + NLO EW theoretical results to measurements of total cross sections from the LHC, and we also calculate top-quark differential distributions in transverse momentum and rapidity.</description>

      <title>Out-of-Equilibrium Dynamics in a U(1) Lattice Gauge Theory via Local Information Flows: Scattering and String Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce local information flows as a diagnostic tool for characterizing out-of-equilibrium quantum dynamics in lattice gauge theories. We employ the information lattice framework, a local decomposition of total information into spatial- and scale-resolved contributions, to characterize the propagation and buildup of quantum correlations in real-time processes. Focusing on the Schwinger model, a canonical $(1+1)$-dimensional U(1) lattice gauge theory, we apply this framework to two scenarios. First, in the near-threshold scattering of two vector mesons, we demonstrate that the emergence of correlations at a longer length scale in the information lattice marks the production of heavier scalar mesons. Second, in the dynamics of electric field strings, we clearly distinguish between the confining regime, which evolves towards a steady state with a static correlation profile, and the string-breaking sector. The latter is characterized by dynamic correlation patterns that reflect the sequential formation and annihilation of strings. This information-centric approach provides a direct, quantitative, and interpretable visualization of complex many-body phenomena, offering a promising tool for analyzing dynamics in higher-dimensional gauge theories and experiments on quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>A Practical Framework for Estimating the Repetition Likelihood of Fast Radio Bursts from Spectral Morphology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The repeating behavior of fast radio bursts (FRBs) is regarded as a key clue to understanding their physical origin, yet reliably distinguishing repeaters from apparent non-repeaters with current observations remains challenging. Here we propose a physically interpretable and practically quantifiable classification framework based on spectral morphology. Using dimensionality reduction, clustering, and feature-importance analysis, we identify the spectral running $r$ and spectral index $\gamma$ as the most critical parameters for distinguishing repeaters from apparent non-repeaters in the CHIME/FRB sample. In the $\gamma$-$r$ space, repeaters preferentially occupy regions with steeper, narrower-band spectra, whereas non-repeaters cluster in flatter, broader-band regions, resulting in a clear density separation. We further construct an empirical probability map in the $\gamma$-$r$ space, showing a clear gradient of repetition likelihood, from $\sim 65\%$ in the high-repetition region to $\sim 5\%$ in the low-repetition region. Combining this with Gaussian Mixture Model posterior analysis, we identify several apparent non-repeaters with high inferred repetition probability, recommending them as priority targets for future monitoring. This framework provides a simple and generalizable tool for assessing repeatability in the CHIME/FRB sample and highlights the diagnostic power of spectral morphology in unveiling FRB origins.</description>

      <title>Localization mechanism of the Kalb-Ramond field on brane with codimension-two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $2$-form Kalb-Ramond (KR) field, together with the metric tensor and dilaton, arises as one of the massless excitation mode of a closed string. Subsequently, this field plays an important role in both string theory and field theory. In this paper, we investigate the localization of the KR field on the brane with codimension-2. A general Kaluza-Klein (KK) decomposition is adopted, wherein the six-dimensional KR field is expanded into one four-dimensional (4D) KR field, two 4D vector fields, and one 4D scalar field. Then, for the case of the extra dimensions $\mathcal{R}_1\times\mathcal{R}_1$, only the 4D scalar field can be localized on the brane. In contrast, for the case of extra dimensions $\mathcal{R}_1\times\mathcal{S}_1$, one 4D vector field and the 4D scalar field can be localized on the brane at the same time. In both cases, the mass of the 4D scalar field remains zero. Next, we examine the localization of the KR field within a specific six-dimensional brane model with extra dimensions $\mathcal{R}_1\times\mathcal{S}_1$. By introducing the background scalar coupling, we show that the 4D KR field, along with the other three 4D fields, can be localized on the brane under the condition of the coupling parameter $t&gt;v^2/12$. Additionally in this case, for both the 4D KR field and the one 4D vector field which acquires its mass from the non-compact extra dimension, the resonant KK modes could exist near the origin of this extra dimension.</description>

      <title>The deep-MOND limit -- a study in Primary vs secondary predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In default of a fundamental MOND theory -- a FUNDAMOND -- I advocate that, alongside searching for one, we should try to identify predictions that follow from wide classes of MOND theories, if not necessarily from all. In particular, predictions that follow from only the basic tenets of MOND -- ``primary predictions'' -- are shared by all MOND theories, and are especially valuable. Such predictions permit us to test the MOND paradigm itself, or at least large parts of it, without yet having a FUNDAMOND. Concentrating on the deep-MOND limit, I discuss examples of either type of predictions. For some examples of primary predictions, I demonstrate how they follow from the basic tenets (which I first formulate). I emphasize that even predictions that pertain to the deep-MOND limit - namely, those that concern gravitating systems that have low accelerations everywhere -- require the full set of MOND tenets, including the existence of a Newtonian limit close to the deep-MOND regime. This is because Newtonian dynamics is a unique theory that all MOND theories must tend to in the limit of high accelerations, and it strongly constrains aspects of the deep-MOND regime, if the transition between the limits is fast enough, which is one of the MOND tenets.</description>

      <title>Search for a hypothetical gauge boson and dark photons in charmonium transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a direct search for a new gauge boson, $X$, with a mass of $17~\text{MeV}/c^2$, which could explain the anomalous excess of $e^+e^-$ pairs observed in the $^8\text{Be}$ nuclear transitions. The search is conducted in the charmonium decay $\chi_{cJ}\to X J/\psi~(J=0,1,2)$ via the radiative transition $\psi(3686)\to\gamma\chi_{cJ}$ using $\left(2712.4\pm 14.3 \right)\times 10^6$ $\psi(3686)$ events collected with the BESIII detector at the BEPCII collider. No significant signal is observed, and the new upper limit on the coupling strength of charm quark and the new gauge boson, $\epsilon_c$, at $17~\text{MeV}/c^2$ is set to be $|\epsilon_c|&lt;1.2\times 10^{-2}$ at $90\%$ confidence level. We also report new constraints on the mixing strength $\epsilon$ between the Standard Model photon and dark photon $\gamma^\prime$ in the mass range from $5~\text{MeV}/c^2$ to $300~\text{MeV}/c^2$. The upper limits at $90\%$ confidence level vary within $(2.5-17.5)\times 10^{-3}$ depending on the $\gamma^\prime $ mass.</description>

      <title>Short-Range Correlations and Transverse Response Enhancement from Meson-Exchange Currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of short-range correlations (SRC) in the transverse nuclear response within the quasielastic peak region, focusing on the 1p1h channel. The calculation is performed in nuclear matter by solving the Bethe-Goldstone equation with the realistic Granada 2013 nucleon-nucleon potential, including both one-body and two-body meson-exchange currents (MEC) of seagull, pion-in-flight, and $\Delta$ types. We find that MEC produce a sizable enhancement of the transverse response in the 1p1h channel when acting on correlated nucleon pairs with high-momentum components generated by SRC. This contrasts with the uncorrelated case, where MEC, dominated by the $\Delta$ current, can even yield a negative effect. The results are consistent with previous findings based on the correlated basis function approach, supporting the interpretation that SRC play a central role in the transverse response enhancement from MEC.</description>

      <title>Axion inflation in the regime of homogeneous backreaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background (SGWB) produced in models of axion inflation coupled to gauge fields. Achieving a detectable signal at Pulsar Timing Array, astrometry, or interferometer frequencies requires a sufficiently strong amplification of the gauge fields, at a level that induces significant backreaction on the inflaton background dynamics. Numerical studies based on the approximation of homogeneous backreaction (i.e., neglecting inhomogeneities of the inflaton field) exhibit oscillations in the inflaton velocity, with corresponding peaks in the SGWB spectrum. The most recent lattice simulations have questioned the validity of this regime, showing examples characterized by a rapid increase in the inflaton gradient energy and the breakdown of homogeneous backreaction. We compute this energy density perturbatively within the assumption of homogeneous backreaction, obtaining examples with a detectable SGWB and with an inflaton gradient energy that remains subdominant to the inflaton zero-mode kinetic energy throughout inflation.</description>

      <title>The Dark Matters at ICRC 2025</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dark matter track at ICRC~2025 showed a field in transition. Direct detection has entered the \emph{neutrino-floor era}, with XENONnT and PandaX-4T now limited by Solar neutrinos. Indirect searches have become truly \emph{multimessenger}, combining $\gamma$-rays, neutrinos, cosmic rays, and radio data under unified likelihoods and shared systematics. Non-WIMP candidates -- axions, sub-GeV particles, primordial black holes, macroscopic relics -- are becoming central. Across all fronts, progress depends as much on new detectors as on the coherence of shared data, methods, and analysis frameworks. Here, I distill the main experimental and conceptual shifts behind these trends, noting how assumptions have evolved since ICRC~2023 and where the next decisive advances are likely to come.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic form factors and structure of the $T_{bb}$ tetraquark from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first lattice QCD determination of the electromagnetic form factors of the exotic tetraquark $T_{bb} \ (bb \bar u \bar d)$ with quantum numbers $I( J^P ) = 0( 1^+ )$. The extracted form factors encode information about its internal structure, including the charge distribution and the magnetic dipole moments, determined separately for the light and heavy quarks. Our results provide evidence in favor of it being a bound state consisting of a compact heavy diquark $[bb]$ in a color-antitriplet with spin one, and a light antidiquark $[\bar u \bar d]$ in a color-triplet with spin zero. The charge radius of $T_{bb}$ is found to be significantly smaller than the combined charge radii of $B$ and $B^*$ mesons. These two comprise the lowest-lying threshold $BB^*$ in the channel we are considering, and their electric charge form factors are also determined. The computations were performed on a single CLS ensemble with $N_f = 2+1$ dynamical quarks and a lattice spacing of approximately $a \approx0.064 \ \mathrm{fm}$ at the pion mass $m_\pi \approx 290 \ \mathrm{MeV}$.</description>

      <title>Production of gravitational waves by inflationary transitions in aligned natural inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The original axion natural inflation model predicts a tensor-to-scalar ratio exceeding experimental limits. Conversely, in aligned axion inflation, inflation can proceed along trajectories emerging from near a saddle point of the two-field potential and ending through an instability in the orthogonal direction. Such solutions satisfy present observational limits and will be tested by future CMB experiments. Previous studies have suggested the possibility of two distinct inflationary stages separated by a transition characterized by rapid oscillations of the fields. In this work, we demonstrate that the existence of these two stages is a generic feature of the model. We explore a possible phenomenological signature of the transition when a U(1) gauge field is coupled to the axions, namely, the production of gravitational waves (GWs) sourced by gauge quanta generated during the transition. This mechanism produces a feature similar to those seen in spectator axion models or axion inflation with appropriate potentials, i.e. a strongly scale-dependent power spectrum. The scale at which the GW spectrum is produced is determined by the duration of the second inflationary phase. Consequently, the spectrum may peak at different frequencies, potentially detectable by future GW experiments.</description>

      <title>Prospects for Measuring $CP$-Violation in $B_s^0 \rightarrow \phi \mu^+\mu^-$ via Time-Dependent Angular Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the prospects for performing a time-dependent angular analysis of $B_s^0 \rightarrow \phi \mu^+\mu^-$ decays at hadron colliders, and introduces new optimised angular observables associated with $B_s^0$-mixing in the decay rate. The time-dependent normalised decay rate and corresponding probability density function is presented both for when the flavour of the $B_s^0$ meson at production is tagged and when it is untagged. The normalised angular terms linked to $B_s^0$-mixing in the tagged (untagged) case are denoted $\mathcal{Z}_i$ ($\mathcal{H}_i$), and their optimised counterparts as $Q_i$ ($\mathcal{M}_i$).
  The expected sensitivities of these observables at the end of Run 3, Run 4, and Run 5 of the LHC are determined using pseudoexperiments generated with a decay-time resolution, background level, and signal yield similar to those reported by the LHCb collaboration. It is found that all observables can be extracted with Run 3 statistics, and that the $\mathcal{H}_i$ and $\mathcal{Z}_i$ observables have similar sensitivity, despite the former being suppressed by mixing terms. Moreover, the angular observables only accessible via flavour tagging, such as the equivalent of $P_5^{\prime}$ in the $B^0_s$ system, are found to exhibit sensitivities comparable to current measurements in $B^0 \rightarrow K^{\ast 0} \mu^+\mu^-$ decays once Run 5 datasets are available. Fits to the observables to extract the Wilson coefficients show a significant increase in precision when either the observables accessible via time-dependent analysis, or flavour tagging, are included. A marked increase in sensitivity to $CP$-violating short-distance effects is observed for a subset of the new optimised $M_i$ and $Q_i$ observables.</description>

      <title>Exorcising ghosts with gravitational waves: cases of ghostful and ghost-free fourth-order gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General Relativity (GR) is an effective field theory valid in the infrared regime. Quadratic curvature extensions intended to probe ultraviolet physics generically propagate a massive spin-$2$ ghost and are therefore non-unitary. One route to remove ghost is by enlarging the geometric sector (torsion, non-metricity). We investigate the infrared phenomenology of both the standard (ghostful) and ghost-free fourth-order gravity theories by computing Gravitational Wave (GW) emission and confronting the results with observations such as the orbital-period decay of quasi-stable binaries such as PSR B1913+16 and PSR J1738+0333 and the chirp-mass evolution of GW170817. In the ghostful theory, besides the theoretical inconsistency due to non-unitarity, there are also phenomenological problems: the massless spin-$2$ GW flux cancels the combined GW fluxes of the massive spin-$2$ ghost and massive spin-$0$ scalar in the vanishing-mass limit, so the GR quadrupole formula is not recovered at the leading order. As a result, we obtain the GW constraint on the ghostful theory as $m\gtrsim 10^{-11}~\mathrm{eV}$, where $m$ is the mass of the massive modes. By contrast, the ghost-free theory smoothly reproduces the Newtonian potential and GR quadrupole formulae when the two coupling constants $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ vanish, independently of the mass $m$. Therefore, GW observations put mass-dependent upper bounds on the size of the coupling constants. For example, if we assume $\alpha_1\simeq\alpha_2$ for simplicity, then we obtain $\alpha_{1,2}\lesssim 4.2\times 10^{83}$ for $m\sim 3\times 10^{-16}\,\mathrm{eV}$ and $\alpha_{1,2}\lesssim 1.3\times 10^{75}$ for $m\sim 10^{-11}\,\mathrm{eV}$. To our knowledge, these are the first astrophysical-scale bounds reported for ghostful and ghost-free fourth-order gravity.</description>

      <title>Cogenesis by a sliding pNGB with symmetry non-restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04180v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB) with an initial misalignment angle can drive successful spontaneous baryogenesis and serve as a dark matter (DM) candidate, provided the corresponding global symmetry is non-restored at high temperature. A key feature of this mechanism is the presence of a slowly sliding phase in the pNGB's motion, during which it traverses rapidly diminishing potential barriers, generating and freezing the baryon asymmetry, while transitioning into the kination phase and then an oscillatory phase. Just before the `would-be' oscillation temperature, parametric resonance effectively fragments the homogeneous mode into fluctuations that ultimately constitute the final DM abundance. By considering a dimension-five explicit breaking operator, we find that the predicted pNGB mass and decay constant are approximately $5\,{\rm eV}$ and $3\times10^6\,{\rm GeV}$, respectively, while the radial mode has a light mass $\mathcal{O}(10)\,{\rm MeV}$ and a small mixing $\mathcal{O}(10^{-4})$ with the Higgs boson. Applied to the Majoron in the type-I seesaw model, this scenario requires the heaviest right-handed neutrino to be as light as $0.1$ to $100\,{\rm GeV}$. These predictions can be tested through kaon experiments, heavy neutral lepton searches, the LHC, and future colliders.</description>

      <title>Flavor and path-length dependence of jet quenching from inclusive jet and {\gamma}-jet suppression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ the parametric approach to analyze jet suppression measured using the nuclear modification factor of inclusive jets, $b$-jets, and jets from $\gamma$-jet events. With minimum model assumptions, we quantify the magnitude of the average energy loss and its transverse momentum dependence. Then, we quantify the impact of fluctuations in the energy loss and nuclear PDFs on the measured jet suppression. The Glauber and Trajectum models are used to estimate the average path length that a jet is expected to traverse in the medium. With this information, we quantify the path-length dependence of the average energy loss, which is found to support the physics picture of the radiative nature of parton energy loss. Using the obtained parameterizations, we evaluate jet $v_2$, quantifying its sensitivity to details of path-length modeling. We also provide model-independent predictions for the magnitude of energy loss expected in upcoming oxygen-oxygen collisions and briefly discuss the path-length dependence of energy loss of $b$-jets. Finally, we analyze intriguing features seen in the suppression of jets in the $\gamma$-jet system.</description>

      <title>No Warm Inflation From a Vanilla Axion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At finite temperature, the coupling of an axion to non-Abelian gauge fields causes dissipation due to sphaleron heating. This mechanism has been considered as ideal for realizing warm inflation since it can lead to large thermal friction while preserving the flatness of the potential. We show, however, that requiring standard properties of an axion -- in particular a discrete shift symmetry -- excludes the strong regime of warm slow-roll inflation, in which thermal friction dominates. The present argument, which does not rely on any phenomenological input, leaves room for the weak regime of warm axion inflation, but in this case a super-Planckian decay constant represents a well-known issue. Finally, we discuss non-minimal and axion-like models as way out.</description>

      <title>Aspects of holographic Langevin diffusion in the presence of anisotropic magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the holographic Langevin diffusion coefficients of a heavy quark, when traveling through a strongly coupled anisotropic plasma in the presence of magnetic field~$\mathcal{B}$. In particular, we clarified how motion velocities shape momentum broadening and its directional dependence. It is observed that the transverse Langevin diffusion coefficients depend more on the direction of motion rather than the directions of momentum diffusion at the ultra-fast limit, while an opposite conclusion is found when the moving speed is sufficiently low. For the Longitudinal Langevin diffusion coefficient, we find that motion perpendicular to~$\mathcal{B}$ affects the Langevin coefficients stronger at any fixed velocity. We should also emphasize that all five Langevin coefficients are becoming larger with increasing velocity. We find that the universal relation~$\kappa^{\parallel}&gt;\kappa^{\perp}$ in the isotropic background, is broken in a different new case that a quark moving paralleled to~$\mathcal{B}$. This is one more particular example where the violation of the universal relation occurs for the anisotropic background. Further, we find the critical velocity of the violation will become larger with increasing~$\mathcal{B}$.</description>

      <title>On the Effects of Elementary and Bound State Fields on Vacuum Stability in $t\bar{t}$ Production at the LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04672v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent report by the CMS Collaboration on the excess of top and anti-top pair production is examined with regard to the improvement of vacuum stability under two simple scenarios: one with the existence of toponium $(\eta_t)$, and the other with an additional elementary field $(\Psi)$. In both cases, the values of each coupling constant are restricted by the Multicritical Point Principle (MPP).
  Two scenarios are considered. The first incorporates the effect of toponium $(\eta_t)$, inspired by the Bardeen-Hill-Lindner (BHL) framework, and the second embeds $\Psi$ into the Standard Model (SM) as a minimal model close to an inert doublet model. From these analyses, it is found that toponium cannot satisfy the MPP, whereas the additional elementary field can.</description>

      <title>The quark gap equation in light-cone gauge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the quark self-energy correction in light-cone gauge motivated by distribution amplitudes whose definition implies a Wilson line. The latter serves to preserve the gauge invariance of the hadronic amplitudes and becomes trivial in light-cone gauge. Therefore, the calculation of the distribution amplitudes simplifies significantly provided that wave functions and propagators are obtained in that gauge. In here, we explore the corresponding Dyson-Schwinger equation in its leading truncation and with a dressed vertex derived from a Ward identity in light-cone gauge. The quark's mass and wave renormalization functions, as well as a third complex-valued amplitude, are found to depend on the relative orientation of the quark momentum and a light-like four-vector, which expresses a geometric gauge dependence of the propagator.</description>

Abstract: In this work, radial Schrodinger equation with a non-relativistic quark potential model (NRQPM) is solved numerically by employing the shooting method. Calculated numerical wave functions (or solutions) are used to compute the masses, root mean square (RMS) radii, $E1$ and $M1$ radiative transitions, and branching ratios of $S, P, D$ and $F$ states of toponium mesons ($t\overline{t}$). Calculated results are compared with recently available theoretical data. This work will be helpful for experimentalists in gaining a deeper understanding of toponium states.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the anomalous Higgs boson couplings in $Z\gamma\gamma$ production at muon collider</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the sensitivities on the Wilson coefficients of dimension-six operators associated with the anomalous $H\gamma\gamma$, $H\gamma Z$ and $HZZ$ vertices through the process $\mu^- \mu^+ \rightarrow Z\gamma\gamma$ at future muon collider. Signal events involving Higgs-gauge boson interactions and relevant backgrounds events at the muon collider designed with a center-of-mass energy of 10 TeV and an integrated luminosity of 10 ab$^{-1}$ are generated in Madgraph within the framework of the model-independent Standard Model effective field theory. Realistic detector effects of the muon collider detector are simulated by Delphes. The limits at 95% C.L., $3\sigma$ and $5\sigma$ on the coefficients $\overline{c}_{HB}$ and $\overline{c}_{HW}$ are obtained without and with systematic uncertainty of 15% and compared with the present experimental and phenomenological limits.</description>

      <title>Higgs-Induced Gravitational Waves: the Interplay of Non-Minimal Couplings, Kination and Top Quark Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore a minimal scenario where the sole Standard-Model Higgs is responsible for reheating the Universe after inflation, produces a significant background of gravitational waves and maintains the full classical stability of the electroweak vacuum. As the Higgs self-coupling runs toward negative values at high energy scales, a non-minimal interaction with curvature during a stiff background expansion era drives the Higgs fluctuations closer to the instability scale. This curvature-induced tachyonic instability leads to an intense production of Higgs particles, accompanied by a stochastic gravitational-wave background. The characteristic features of such signal can be directly correlated to the inflationary scale, the non-minimal coupling parameter and the top quark Yukawa coupling. We distinguish between three possible scenarios: absolute stability with low top quark masses, potential vacuum instability, and absolute stability with new physics above the instability scale. Our findings suggest that the detection of a peaked background of gravitational waves together with its inflationary tail has the potential to unveil the features of the Higgs effective potential at very high energy scales while providing a minimal explanation for the reheating phase and the emergence of the Standard-Model plasma in the early Universe. Unlike other studies in the literature, the generation of gravitational waves in our scenario does not depend on the quantum instability of the Standard Model vacuum.</description>

      <title>Axial current as the origin of quantum intrinsic orbital angular momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the axial current density is the physical origin (generator) of quantum intrinsic orbital angular momentum (IOAM). Without the axial current, the IOAM of particles vanishes. Broadly speaking, we argue that the spiral or interference characteristics of the axial current density determine the occurrence of nonlinear or tunneling effects in any spacetime-dependent quantum systems. Our findings offer a comprehensive theoretical framework that addresses the limitations of Keldysh's ionization theory and provides new insights into the angular momentum properties of quantum systems, particularly in tunneling-dominated regimes. Using Wigner function methods, fermionic generalized two-level model, and Berry phase simulations, we predict that IOAM effect can persist even in pure quantum tunneling processes. These results open the door for experimental verification of IOAM effects in future high-intensity QED experiments, such as those using X-ray free electron lasers.</description>

      <title>Sub-GeV Dark Matter Direct Detection with Neutrino Observatories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09685v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new technique for sub-GeV dark matter (DM) searches and a new use of neutrino observatories. DM-electron scattering in an observatory can excite or ionize target molecules, which then produce light that can be detected by the photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). While individual DM scatterings are indistinguishable, the aggregate rate from many independent scatterings can be isolated from the total PMT dark rate using the expected DM annual modulation. We showcase this technique with the example of JUNO, a 20,000-ton scintillator detector, showing that its potential sensitivity in some mass ranges exceeds other techniques and reaches key particle-theory benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Mechanical Sensors for Ultraheavy Dark Matter Searches via Long-range Forces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11645v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark matter candidates with masses around the Planck-scale are theoretically well-motivated, and it has been suggested that it might be possible to search for dark matter solely via gravitational interactions in this mass range. In this work, we explore the pathway towards searching for dark matter candidates with masses around the Planck-scale using mechanical sensors while considering realistic experimental constraints, and develop analysis techniques needed to conduct such searches. These dark matter particles are expected to leave tracks as their signature in mechanical sensor arrays, and we show that we can effectively search for such tracks using statistical approaches to track-finding. We analyze a range of possible experimental setups and compute sensitivity projections for searches for ultraheavy dark matter coupling to the Standard Model via long-range forces. We find that while a search for Planck-scale dark matter purely via gravitational couplings would be exceedingly difficult, requiring $\sim 80\,\mathrm{dB}$ of quantum noise reduction with a $100^3$ array of devices, there is a wide range of currently unexplored dark matter candidates which can be searched for with already existing or near-term experimental platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18829v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show for the first time that warm inflation is feasible with Standard Model (SM) gauge interactions alone. Our model consists of a minimal extension of the SM by a single scalar inflaton field with an axion-like coupling to gluons and a monomial potential. The effects of light fermions, which were previously argued to render warm inflation with the SM impossible, are alleviated by Hubble dilution of their chiral chemical potentials. Our model only features one adjustable combination of parameters and accommodates all inflationary observables. We briefly discuss implications for axion experiments, dark matter, and the strong CP-problem.</description>

      <title>Dipionic transitions of $Y(4500)$ to $J/\psi$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We, using an effective Lagrangian approach, investigated the dipionic transition of the $Y(4500)$ newly well established in the process $e^+e^-\to K^+K^- J/\psi$. In this study, the $Y(4500)$ was considered as a mixture of the $\psi(5S)$ and $\psi(4\,{^3D_1})$, and its dipionic decay to the $J/\psi$ was assumed to occur via charmed meson loops including box and two kinds of triangle loops. The calculated invariant mass spectra due to the different loop mechanisms exhibit distinct differences. These spectrum patterns are found to be nearly independent of the cutoff parameter, especially for the box and $\mathcal{R}$ loops. By means of comparing our calculated results with the future experimental measurements of the $\pi^+\pi^-$ and $\pi^\pm J/\psi$ invariant mass distributions, we could judge which loop mechanism is of more importance in this dipionic transition. The interference among the different kinds of loops is also exhibited. Despite the unknown phase angles between different kinds of loop diagrams, the partial decay width for the process $Y(4500)\to\pi^+\pi^- J/\psi$ is estimated to be 250--700 keV, aligning with the estimation obtained by combining BESIII Collaboration measurements and theoretical predictions for $Y(4500)\to K^+K^- J/\psi$. We hope that the present calculations would be tested by the future BESIII or Belle II experiments.</description>

Calculating their mass spectra could provide crucial guidance for determining their spectroscopic positions. Additionally, by analyzing their decay properties, we could predict the important decay channels, which are essential for experimental searches and quantum number assignments.

      <description>arXiv:2505.17995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the projected sensitivity to non-relativistic Effective Field Theory (EFT) operators for Dark Matter (DM) direct detection using the QUEST-DMC experiment. QUEST-DMC employs superfluid Helium-3 as a target medium and measures energy deposition via nanomechanical resonators with SQUID-based readout to probe DM interactions. The experiment aims to explore new parameter space in the sub-GeV mass range, probing light DM and a broad range of interaction models. We analyse the sensitivity to a complete set of fourteen independent non-relativistic EFT operators, each parameterised by a Wilson coefficient that quantifies the strength of DM interactions with Standard Model particles. For each interaction channel, we determine the corresponding sensitivity ceiling due to attenuation of the DM flux incident on the detector, caused by DM scattering in the Earth and atmosphere. As a key component of this analysis, we provide the mapping between the non-relativistic EFT operators and the relativistic bilinear DM-nucleon interactions, and assess the interaction sensitivity to sub-GeV DM in the QUEST-DMC detector. Our findings demonstrate that QUEST-DMC provides a unique probe of DM interactions, particularly in previously unexplored parameter space for momentum- and velocity-dependent interactions, thereby expanding the search for viable DM candidates beyond traditional weakly interacting massive particles.</description>

      <title>Regularization Prescription for the Mixing Between Nonlocal Gluon and Quark Operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00639v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well-known that in the study of mixing between nonlocal gluon and quark bilinear operators there exists an ambiguity when relating coordinate space and momentum space results, which can be conveniently resolved through Mellin moments matching in both spaces. In this work, we show that this ambiguity is due to the lack of a proper regularization prescription of the singularity that arises when the separation between the gluon/quark fields approaches zero. We then demonstrate that dimensional regularization resolves this issue and yields consistent results in both coordinate and momentum space. This prescription is also compatible with lattice extractions of parton distributions from nonlocal operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) soft function for non-relativistic heavy quark pair production at hadron colliders is analytically computed at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in the strong coupling expansion. We present the details of our computational approach and analyze the general two-loop structure of the soft function. The final result, which takes a particularly simple form, provides the last missing ingredient for a complete NNLO calculation of color-octet $S$-wave quarkonium hadroproduction--including charmonium, bottomonium, and toponium--using the $q_T$-slicing formalism. It also enables next-to-next-to-next-to-leading-logarithmic (N$^3$LL) resummation at small transverse momentum for the same process.</description>

Abstract: A fast-rolling axion can transfer its kinetic energy to a gauge field via the Chern-Simons coupling, leading to copious production of gauge quanta, which can act as a source of gravitational waves (GWs) with potentially observable amplitudes. In this work, we investigate GW production in a spectator axion model when strong backreaction is taken into account. We find that decreasing the decay constant of the axion enhances GW production. Since the initial value of the axion is larger than its quantum fluctuations, such a condition imposes a lower bound on the axion dacay constant, which sets an upper bound on the amplitude of the energy spectrum of GWs. As a result, the amplitude of the predicted GW energy spectrum is lower than $10^{-10}$ in the nHz to mHz frequency range.</description>

Abstract: A supercooled phase transition in a nearly conformal dark sector can provide a natural setting for darkogenesis via its out-of-equilibrium dynamics, where a particle-antiparticle number asymmetry in the dark sector can be reprocessed into the visible sector, yielding the observed baryon asymmetry and an asymmetric dark matter. We consider a scenario where the number asymmetry is generated from the decay of a mother particle produced via parametric resonance during the phase transition induced due to its coupling to the dilaton associated with spontaneous breaking of scale invariance. It is shown that the correct baryon asymmetry and dark matter abundance can be realized for a dark phase transition at $\mathcal{O}(1) \, \rm GeV$, which can also explain the nano-Hz gravitational wave signal reported by pulsar timing array experiments. The scenario will be tested further in neutron-antineutron oscillation experiments.</description>

      <title>Recasting Experimental Constraints on Relativistic Magnetic Monopoles</title>

Abstract: Magnetic monopoles with masses up to $10^{14}$ GeV can be accelerated to relativistic velocities in Galactic and intergalactic magnetic fields. The cosmic flux of relativistic monopoles is constrained by various experiments, with the limits given as functions of the monopole velocity (Lorentz factor) at the detectors. The velocity, however, is usually treated as a free parameter due to the ambiguity in the computation of the acceleration before the monopoles arrive at Earth. We explicitly evaluate the velocity by exploiting recent studies on cosmic magnetic fields and the monopole acceleration therein, to recast experimental limits in terms of the mass of monopoles. By applying our method to various terrestrial experiments, including the Pierre Auger Observatory, IceCube, MACRO, and the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory, as well as to astrophysical constraints, we report limits on the flux of monopoles for a wide range of monopole masses. We also highlight the role of monopoles as messengers of cosmic magnetic fields, and discuss the possibility of using monopole experiments to probe intergalactic magnetic fields.</description>

Abstract: The photon production process $f\to f+\gamma$ in the presence of a time-dependent chiral chemical potential $\mu_5$ is studied. The validity of the adiabatic approximation is demonstrated in the ultra-relativistic limit. Analytical expressions for the photon spectrum are derived for two models of the chiral magnetic conductivity $b_0\propto \mu_5$: (i) $b_0(t)= A_1+B_1\tanh(t/\tau)$ and (ii) $b_0(t)= A_2(t/\tau)/(1+t^2/\tau^2)$. It is known that for constant $b_0$, photon emission may exhibit a resonance for one photon polarization depending on the sign of $b_0$. It is shown that in model (i), up to two resonances may occur, depending on the sign of the asymptotic values $b_0(\infty)$ and $b_0(-\infty)$. No resonances are observed in model (ii). Numerical calculations are performed using parameters relevant to quark-gluon plasma, and the universality of the results is discussed.</description>

      <title>Constraints on axionlike particles from 16.5 years of Fermi-LAT data and prospects for VLAST</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Axionlike particles (ALPs), hypothetical particles beyond the Standard Model, are considered as promising dark matter candidates. ALPs can convert into photons and vice versa in a magnetic field via the Primakoff effect, potentially generating detectable oscillation in $\gamma$-ray spectra. This study analyzes 16.5 years of data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) on NGC 1275, the brightest galaxy in the Perseus cluster, to constrain the ALP parameter space. Our results improve the previous 95\% exclusion limits of the photon-ALP coupling $g_{a\gamma}$ by a factor of 2 in the ALP mass range of $4\times 10^{-10}\,\mathrm{eV}\lesssim m_{a}\lesssim 5\times 10^{-9}\,\mathrm{eV}$. Moreover, we investigate the projected sensitivity of the future Very Large Area $\gamma$-ray Space Telescope (VLAST) on searching for ALPs. We find that (i) the expected sensitivity on the ALP-photon coupling can be stronger than that from the upcoming International Axion Observatory (IAXO) in the ALP mass range of $2\times 10^{-11}\,\mathrm{eV}\lesssim m_{a}\lesssim 1\times 10^{-7}\,\mathrm{eV}$, with the best sensitivity of $g_{a\gamma}\sim 7\times 10^{-13}\,\mathrm{GeV^{-1}}$ at $m_{a}\sim 2\times 10^{-10}\,\mathrm{eV}$; (ii) VLAST can extend the sensitivity of the ALP masses below $5\times 10^{-12}\,\mathrm{eV}$, where the ALP-photon coupling $g_{a\gamma}\gtrsim 1.5\times 10^{-11}\,\mathrm{GeV^{-1}}$ will be excluded; (iii) the entire parameter space of ALP accounting for TeV transparency can be fully tested. These results demonstrate that VLAST will offer an excellent opportunity for ALPs searches.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal Structure Function at the Limit $x=Q^2/s$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The longitudinal structure function for nucleons and nuclei is considered at fixed $\sqrt{s}$ and $Q^2$ to the minimum value of $x$ given by $Q^2/s$. This is done using the expansion method and color dipole model in the next-to-leading order approximation. The extracted longitudinal structure functions were consistent with HERA hepdata [ https://www.hepdata.net/record/ins1377206] and the determination of $F_{L}$ at $x=Q^2/s$ [Frank E.Taylor, Phys. Rev. D {\bf111}, 052001 (2025)] at moderate and large $Q^2$ values. The results, consistent with the dipole picture at low $Q^2$ values, show that the longitudinal structure function is small as expected due to the transverse polarization of the exchanged photon and the strong suppression of the dominant gluon component. Nonlinear corrections to the nuclear longitudinal structure function at low values of $x$ and $Q^2$ are also considered. These results may enhance the deep inelastic scattering neutral current data in future colliders at low $x$ and low $Q^2$. The longitudinal structure functions for deuterium at low four-momentum transfer squared, $Q^2&lt;1~\mathrm{GeV}^2$ at the LO and NLO approximations are determined and compared with the JLab E00-002 data.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Muon Anomaly from $e^+ e^-\to$ Hadrons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18239v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this talk, I revisit and present a more comprehensive estimate of the lowest order Hadronic Vacuum Polarization (HVP) contribution $a_\mu\vert_{hvp}^{lo}$ to the muon anomalous magnetic moment (muon anomaly) from $e^+e^-\to$ Hadrons obtained recently in Ref.[1]. New CMD-3 data on $e^+e^-\to 2\pi$ [2] and precise BABAR [3] and recent BELLE2 [4] $e^+e^-\to 3\pi$ data are usedto update the estimate of the $I=0$ isoscalar channel below the $\phi$-meson mass. Adding the data compiled by PDG22 [5] above 1 GeV and the QCD improved continuum used in Ref. [1], one deduces: $a_\mu\vert^{hvp}_{lo}=(7043\pm 37)\times 10^{-11} $.A comparison with previous data driven ($e^+e^-$ and $\tau$-decays) estimates is done.Including the Higher Order $a_\mu\vert_{hvp}^{ho}$ corrections, the phenomenological estimate of the Hadronic Light by Light scattering up to NLO and the QED and Electroweak (EW) contributions, one obtains: $\Delta a_\mu^{pheno}\equiv a_\mu^{exp}-a_{\mu}^{pheno}= (81\pm 41)\times 10^{-11}$ where the recent experimental value $a_\mu^{exp}$ [6] has been used. This result consolidates the previous one in Ref.[1], after adding the $\pi^0\gamma,\eta\gamma$ contributions, and can be compared with the one from the most precise Lattice result $\Delta a_\mu^{lattice}= (90\pm 56)\times 10^{-11}$. Then, we deduce the (tentative) SM prediction average : $\Delta a_\mu^{SM} = (87\pm 33)\times 10^{-11}$. We complete the paper by revising our predictions on the LO HVP contributions in adding the $\pi^0\gamma,\eta\gamma$ contributions to the ones in Ref.[1]. Then, we obtain: $a_\tau\vert^{hvp}_{lo}=(3516\pm 25)\times 10^{-11} $ and $\Delta \alpha^{(5)}_{had}(M_Z^2)=(2770.7\pm 4.5)\times 10^{-5}$ for 5 flavours.</description>

Abstract: Dark photons can be resonantly produced in the early universe via their coupling to an oscillating axion field. However, this mechanism typically requires large axion--dark photon couplings or some degree of fine-tuning. In this work, we present a new scenario in which efficient dark photon production arises from axion potentials that are shallower than quadratic at large field values. For moderately large initial misalignment angles, the oscillation of the axion field can trigger either efficient dark photon production or strong axion self-resonance via parametric resonance. When self-resonance dominates and disrupts the field's homogeneity, we show that oscillons -- localized, oscillating axion field configurations -- naturally form and can sustain continued dark photon production, provided the coupling is $\gtrsim \mathcal O(1)$. For dark photon mass up to three orders of magnitude below the axion mass, the produced dark photons can account for a significant fraction of the present-day dark matter. We support this scenario with numerical lattice simulations of a benchmark model. Our results further motivate experimental searches for ultralight dark photon dark matter. The simulation code is publicly available at https://github.com/hongyi18/AxionDarkPhotonSimulator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the helicity amplitudes of the $N(1520)$ and $N(1535)$ resonances in the electromagnetic transition process $\gamma^*p\to N^*$, where the $N(1520)$ and $N(1535)$ are assumed to include both the $L=1$ three-quark and $L=0$ spatial symmetric $q^4\bar q$ pentaquark components. The helicity transition amplitudes $A_{1/2}$, $A_{3/2}$ (for spin 3/2 states) and $S_{1/2}$ are computed within the constituent quark model. The inclusion of the $q^4 \bar q$ pentaquark components via the $\gamma^*\to q\bar q$ diagram significantly improves the theoretical description of the helicity amplitudes for both $N(1520)$ and $N(1535)$, yielding a closer agreement with experimental data compared to the pure three-quark picture. The work reveals that the $N(1520)$ and $N(1535)$ resonances may contain a considerable pentaquark components.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01652v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate energy correlators in semi-inclusive electron-positron annihilation as precision probes of parton hadronization dynamics. Using soft-collinear effective theory (SCET), we analyze the correlation patterns between the examined hadron and the rest of QCD radiations in both large-angle and small-angle limits, which establishes a direct correspondence with Transverse-Momentum-Dependent Fragmentation Functions (TMD FFs) and Fragmentation Energy Correlators (FECs). The two complementary regimes encode the transition from perturbative parton branching to nonperturbative confinement, enabling a unified description of hadron formation across all kinematic regimes. Using renormalization group evolution, we obtain joint N3LL/NNLL quantitative predictions for energy correlations both in the sudakov and jet fragmentation region (JFR). Our results demonstrate that semi-inclusive ECs provide direct, theoretically controlled access to QCD dynamics underlying hadronization, opening new avenues for precision studies at future lepton colliders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new approach for deriving neutrino masses from the known masses of quarks, charged leptons, and the parameters of the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) matrix is proposed. This framework is based on the simultaneous diagonalization of the kinetic and mass terms in an extension of the Standard Model (SM) with massive Dirac neutrinos. Numerical results for the neutrino masses are obtained, which are consistent with experimental data through a new scaling parameter, $\anu$, introduced to adjust the mass splittings $\Delta m^2_{21}$ and $\Delta m^2_{31}$ in order to reach their precise experimental values, thereby reducing the number of flavor parameters in this SM extension. The proposed framework connects neutrino mass generation to the known masses of quarks and charged leptons, offering a unified perspective on the matter sector of the SM.</description>

      <title>Two-flavor chirally imbalanced quark matter beyond large $N_c$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a chirally imbalanced medium in the context of the two-flavor Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model using both the large-$N_c$ (LN) and beyond large-$N_c$ (BLN) approximations. To incorporate BLN effects, we consider the optimized perturbation theory (OPT) to the first nontrivial order, which includes two-loop (exchange) contributions. This procedure allows us to explicitly explore how finite $N_c$ corrections affect the thermodynamics as well as the phase diagram of chirally imbalanced quark matter. We then compare the results obtained with a sharp three-dimensional cutoff -- generically referred to as the traditional regularization scheme -- and with an alternative procedure called the medium separation scheme (MSS). In the first case, we observe that the pseudocritical temperature decreases as the chiral chemical potential increases, an effect dubbed inverse chiral catalysis. On the other hand, when considering the MSS regularization, which properly isolates the medium contributions from the vacuum, we find the opposite result. We show that the results obtained with MSS are consistent with well-established LQCD data in both the LN and BLN approximations. Finally, we suggest that to cope with the high-density limit, the standard OPT interpolation prescription must be modified with the inclusion of an extra variational parameter.</description>

Abstract: In the framework of the multi-source thermal model employing the Tsallis distribution, the transverse momentum distributions of kaon, pion, and (anti -)proton production in U+U collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 193 GeV with varying centrality are investigated. The transverse momentum spectra are appropriately characterized. The dependencies of parameters (average transverse momenta, effective temperature, and entropy index) on event centrality are determined. It is observed that the q parameters increase as the average number of particles participating in the collisions rises, which implies that the nuclear stopping degree elevates with the increase of collision centrality. The T value remains fundamentally consistent for the same particle under different collision parameters, suggesting that the kinetic freezing temperature of particle ejection in this collision system is independent of the collision parameters.</description>

      <title>CP-conserving SO(3) parameterization of the neutrino mixing matrix</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The pattern of neutrino mixing, usually parameterized by the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata $U_{\rm PMNS}$ matrix, still remains a striking puzzle in particle physics. $U_{\rm PMNS}$ is one of six possible products of multiplying three Euler matrices. Here we discuss the neutrino mixing matrix parameterization for three known flavours of neutrinos based on the SO(3) group represented by one three-dimensional rotation matrix $U_{\rm SO3}$. The mixing matrix $U_{\rm SO3}$ with cyclic order of the Lie group generators implies $\delta_{\rm{CP}}=180^\circ$ for clockwise rotation in three dimensions, a viable scenario for normal mass ordering. We determine a range of rotation angles for $U_{\rm SO3}$ which deviate substantially from the almost maximal mixings in the standard $U_{\rm PMNS}$ scenario, yielding `democratic' values for the mixing angles. With the fixed $\delta_{\rm CP}$ value, the $U_{\rm SO3}$ parameterization can be validated or falsified by the next generation of neutrinoless double beta decay experiments and puts a stringent constraint on the absolute neutrino mass. The proposed $U_{\rm SO3}$ neutrino mixing parameterization is suited for independent CP-conserving neutrino oscillation experimental analysis.</description>

      <title>Boltzmann Suppressed Ultraviolet Freeze-in</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If the dark matter mass $m$ exceeds the maximum temperature of the Universe ($T_{\rm max} &lt; m$), then its production rate will be Boltzmann suppressed. The important implications of this Boltzmann suppression have been explored for dark matter freeze-in via renormalizable operators. Here we extend these considerations to the case of ultraviolet (UV) freeze-in for which freeze-in proceeds via non-renormalizable operators. The UV freeze-in variant has a number of appealing features, not least that a given effective field theory can describe a multitude of UV completions, and thus such analyses are model agnostic for a given high dimension freeze-in operator. We undertake model independent analyses of UV freeze-in for portal operators of general mass dimensions. Subsequently, we explore a number of specific examples, namely, Higgs portals, bino dark matter, and gravitino dark matter. Finally, we discuss how significant differences arise if one departs from the standard assumptions regarding inflationary reheating (i.e. transitions from an early matter dominated era to radiation domination). As a motivated example we examine the implications of early kination domination. Boltzmann suppressed UV freeze-in is well motivated and permits a number of compelling scenarios. In particular, we highlight that for $T_{\rm max} \sim$ 1 TeV it is feasible that the freeze-in mechanism is entirely realized within a couple of orders of magnitude of the TeV scale, making it experimentally accessible in contrast to traditional freeze-in scenarios.</description>

      <title>Strange Pentaquark Molecules in QCD Sum Rules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13548v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we systematically construct hidden- and open-strange pentaquarks in the hadronic molecular picture to search for possible partners of hadronic molecular state multiplets in the strange quark sector using QCD sum rules. Within this picture, 21 distinct currents are constructed with $J^P = 1/2^-$ and $3/2^-$. There is no bound state found from $J^P = 1/2^-$ currents, while three of them from $J^P = 3/2^-$ currents are bound-state solutions consistent with the $\Lambda(2050)3/2^-$, $\Xi(2250)$, and $N(2120)3/2^-$ states, which can be identified as $\Lambda\phi$, $\Xi\phi$, and $\Sigma K^\ast$ hadronic molecular states, respectively. Other constructions are interpreted as hadronic molecular states composed of excited states with the same quantum numbers, and some of these exhibit mass values that align with known resonances listed in the RPP(PDG). Our numerical results indicate that $\Lambda(2050)3/2^-$ and $\Xi(2250)$ should be the multiplet partner of each other. Additionally, although $\Sigma K^\ast$ bound state was identified under this framework, no corresponding partner states were found within the context of the currents we constructed. Alternative constructions may offer new possibilities for identifying such states.</description>

      <title>Nucleon Electric Dipole Moments in Paramagnetic Molecules through Effective Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electric dipole moment (EDM) measurements using paramagnetic molecules have significantly advanced over the last decade. Traditionally, these experiments have been analyzed in terms of the electron EDM. However, paramagnetic molecules are also sensitive to hadronic sources of charge-parity (CP) violation, highlighting the need for a new framework to interpret the experimental results. In this Letter, we introduce an effective field theory framework to relate molecular EDMs to the EDMs of neutrons and protons. We identify the dominant contributions through power counting and pinpoint the necessary nuclear matrix elements. As a practical application, we employ the nuclear shell model to calculate these nuclear matrix elements for the polar molecule BaF. Finally, we estimate the limits on the nucleon EDMs set by current molecular EDM experiments.</description>

      <title>Understanding gravitationally induced decoherence parameters in neutrino oscillations using a microscopic quantum mechanical model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03106v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, a microscopic quantum mechanical model for gravitationally induced decoherence introduced by Blencowe and Xu is investigated in the context of neutrino oscillations. The focus is on the comparison with existing phenomenological models and the physical interpretation of the decoherence parameters in such models. The results show that for neutrino oscillations in vacuum gravitationally induced decoherence can be matched with phenomenological models with decoherence parameters of the form $\Gamma_{ij}\sim \Delta m^4_{ij}E^{-2}$. When matter effects are included, the decoherence parameters exhibit a dependence on the varying matter density across the Earth layers. This behavior can be explained by the nature of the coupling between neutrinos and the gravitational wave environment, as suggested by linearised gravity. On a theoretical level, these different models can be characterised by a different choice of Lindblad operators, with the model with decoherence parameters that do not include matter effects being less suitable from the point of view of linearised gravity. Consequently, in the case of neutrino oscillations in matter, the microscopic model does not agree with many existing phenomenological models that assume constant decoherence parameters in matter. Nonetheless, we identify the KamLAND experimental setup as particularly well-suited to establish the first experimental constraints on the model parameters, namely the neutrino coupling to the gravitational wave environment and its temperature, based on a prior analysis using the phenomenological model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves offer an unprecedented opportunity to look into the violent high-energy processes happening during the reheating phase of our Universe. We consider a Hubble-induced phase transition scenario as a source of a post-inflationary stochastic background of gravitational waves and analyse the main characteristics of its spectrum for the first time via numerical methods. The output of a large number of fully-fledged classical lattice simulations is condensed in a set of parametric formulas that describe key features of the gravitational wave spectrum, such as its peak amplitude and characteristic frequency, and avoid the need for further time-consuming simulations. The signal from such stochastic background is compared to the prospective sensitivity of future gravitational-wave detectors.</description>

Abstract: Analysis of data from particle physics experiments traditionally sacrifices some sensitivity to new particles for the sake of practical computability, effectively ignoring some potentially striking signatures. However, recent advances in ML-based tracking allow for new inroads into previously inaccessible territory, such as reconstruction of tracks which do not follow helical trajectories. This paper presents a demonstration of the capacity of ML-based tracking to reconstruct the oscillating trajectories of quirks. The technique used is not specific to quirks, and opens the door to a program of searching for many kinds of non-standard tracks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a relativistic version of the global symmetries responsible for the restricted mobility of fracton quasiparticles. The theories have a symmetry current that is proportional to a vector field that spontaneously breaks Lorentz boost symmetry. We argue that the existence of a pressureless dust in the early universe could be a consequence of this symmetry. We provide an example of a fractonic scalar field with a quartic self-interaction evolving on a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker background and show that the interaction gives rise to a separately conserved fluid with equation of state $w=1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16598v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We combine the ghost-free bimetric theory of gravity with the concept of local Weyl invariance, realized in the framework of Einstein-Cartan gravity. The gravitational sector, characterized by two independent metrics and two independent connections, is coupled to a scalar field that can in principle develop a non-vanishing expectation value through radiative corrections. The spectrum of the model, apart from the massless standard graviton and a pair of axion-like pseudoscalars, associated with the presence of the Holst invariants in the action, includes an additional spin-$2$ state of a non-vanishing Fierz-Pauli mass proportional to the scalar field vacuum expectation value. We analyze the phenomenology of the model and specify the conditions under which the massive spin-$2$ state could be a primary dark matter candidate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study graviton-photon conversion in the magnetic fields of a blazar jet and explore the possibility of detecting high-frequency gravitational waves through blazar observations. We calculate the conversion rate using the magnetic field configurations of leptonic, lepto-hadronic, and hadronic one-zone synchrotron self-Compton models for the blazar jet of Mrk 501. By requiring that the photon flux produced within the blazar jet does not exceed the observed flux of Mrk 501, we derive conservative constraints on the abundance of stochastic gravitational waves. We find that, for all three models considered, the resulting limits can be more stringent than previous constraints in the frequency range from $10^8$ Hz to $10^{15}$ Hz.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize a recent prescription for the relaxation time approximation for the relativistic Boltzmann equation for systems with multiple particle species at finite temperature. This is performed by adding counter-terms to the traditional Anderson-Witting ansatz for each particle species. Our approach allows for the use of momentum-dependent relaxation times and the obedience of local conservation laws regardless of the definition of the local equilibrium state. As an application, we derive the first order Chapman-Enskog corrections to the equilibrium distribution and display results for the hadron-resonance gas. We also demonstrate that our collision term ansatz obeys the second law of thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of a Gigahertz Fabry-P\'erot Resonator for Axion Dark Matter Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03091v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Axions are hypothetical pseudo-Nambu Goldstone bosons that could explain the observed cold dark matter density and solve the strong CP problem of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Haloscope experiments commonly employ resonant cavities to search for a conversion of axion dark matter into photons in external magnetic fields. As the expected signal power degrades with increasing frequency, this approach becomes challenging at frequencies beyond tens of Gigahertz. Here, we propose a novel haloscope design based on an open Fabry-P\'erot resonator. Operating a small-scale resonator at cryogenic temperatures and at modest magnetic fields should already lead to an unparalleled sensitivity for photon-axion couplings $g_{a\gamma} \gtrsim 3\times10^{-12}\,\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ at 35GHz. We demonstrate how this sensitivity could be further improved using graded-phase mirrors and sketch possibilities to probe benchmark models of the QCD axion.</description>

      <title>Memory effects in a dynamical decoupling process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a simple quantitative relationship between the environmental memory effects and the characteristics in a dynamical decoupling process. In contrast to previous works, our measures of non-Markovianity are tailored and extended to evaluate the strength of memory effects in dynamical decoupling. We find that if each kick commutes with the dynamical map of the uncontrolled system, then the change of the final dynamical map or the final state brought by the control (called the "effect of control") is upper (lower) bounded by the summation (difference) of the strengths of memory effects with and without control. We propose sufficient conditions for the commutation relation for parity kicks and illustrate our finding with a dissipative quantum Rabi model by numerical simulations where one or many cycles of parity kicks are implemented on the qubit. Besides, the results show that under certain conditions, the effect of control or the increase of performance by the control may be simply proportional to the strength of memory effects with or without control.</description>

Abstract: The Regge-Gribov model of the pomeron and odderon in the non-trivial transverse space is studied by the renormalization group technique in the single loop approximation. The pomeron and odderon are taken to have different bare intercepts and slopes. The behaviour when the intercepts move from below to their critical values compatible with the Froissart limitation is studied. The singuarities in the form of non-trivial branch points indicating a phase transition are found in the vicinity of five fixed points found in the previous publication. Since new phases violate the projectile-target symmetry the model is found non-physical for the bare intercepts above their critical value.</description>

      <title>The 300 TeV photon from GRB 221009A: a Hint at Non-linear Lorentz Invariance Violation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The air shower array Carpet-3 detected a 300 TeV photon from the direction of GRB 221009A at 4536 s after the Fermi-GBM trigger for this event. If the association with this gamma-ray burst is real, it poses two puzzles. First, why was this photon not absorbed by the extragalactic background light? ``New physics'' beyond the Standard Model is required to explain how it managed to reach Earth from a cosmological distance. Second, why was this photon detected when the VHE afterglow observed by LHAASO already faded? A novel astrophysical mechanism is required to explain this delay. In this work we show that Lorentz invariance violation (LIV), which arises as a low-energy limit of certain quantum gravity theories, can solve both puzzles. It shifts thresholds of particle interaction and changes the opacity of the extragalactic background, and cause energy-dependent variations of the photon velocity, which changes the photon time of flight. We investigate the LIV parameter space assuming that the 300 TeV photon is a part of the VHE afterglow detected by LHAASO in the TeV range. We identify viable solutions and place stringent two-sided constraints on the LIV energy scale required to resolve the observational puzzles. First-order LIV appears to be incompatible with the constraints set by analyzing the TeV afterglow of this GRB. Viable solutions emerge for higher orders. In particular, the commonly studied second-order subluminal LIV with $E_{\rm LIV2} = 1.30_{-0.35}^{+0.56} \times 10^{-7} E_{\rm Pl}$ (95.4% credibility level; $E_{\rm Pl}$ is the Planck energy) is consistent with all the observed data.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the distribution of an interacting axion-like massive field within a magnetized Neutron Star. For this we consider the effect of an intense density-dependent axially symmetric stellar magnetic field ${\bf B}(r,\theta)$ adding another much weaker, but non-vanishing, electric field. We particularize the latter for the case when a finite chiral charge density is present. The axion field is thus coupled to a generic function $Q(F_0,G_0)$ depending on Lorentz invariants $F_0, G_0$ which can be constructed from these electromagnetic fields. From this, the static axion field equations are solved as function of stellar radial coordinate and angular direction, $a(r,\theta)$, using a prescribed linear form for $Q$. In addition, we use a semi-analytical approach to calculate the stellar structure in this hybrid system where pressure components are treated under a perturbative scheme, provided induced deformations with respect to spherical symmetry are tiny. Our results show that the axion couplings to magnetic and electric fields along with its mass, critically determine the axion spatial distribution. Furthermore, we focus on the possibility that the axion field might accumulate in specific outer regions of the star, particularly within the crust, where it could form a condensate. We explore the possible presence of magnetic flux tubes from superconductor phases in this outer layers and qualitatively show they may enhance local conversion into photons. We explore prospects of detectability through indirect methods.</description>

      <title>Radiation of "breathing" vortex electron packets in magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21195v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When a vortex electron with an orbital angular momentum (OAM) enters a magnetic field, its quantum state is described with a nonstationary Laguerre-Gaussian (NSLG) state rather than with a stationary Landau state. A key feature of these NSLG states is oscillations of the electron wave packet's root-mean-square (r.m.s.) radius, similar to betatron oscillations. Classically, such an oscillating charge distribution is expected to emit photons. This raises a critical question: does this radiation carry away OAM, leading to a loss of the electron's vorticity? To investigate this, we solve Maxwell's equations using the charge and current densities derived from an electron in the NSLG state. We calculate the total radiated power and the angular momentum of the emitted field, quantifying the rate at which a vortex electron loses its energy and OAM while propagating in a longitudinal magnetic field. We find both the radiated power and the angular momentum losses to be negligible indicating that linear accelerators (linacs) appear to be a prominent tool for maintaining vorticity of relativistic vortex electrons and other charged particles, at least in the quasi-classical approximation.</description>

      <title>Diffraction by Circular and Triangular Apertures as a Diagnostic Tool of Twisted Matter Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study diffraction of twisted matter waves (electrons and light ions carrying orbital angular momentum $\ell/\hbar=0,\pm1,\pm2,\ldots$ by circular and triangular apertures. Within the scalar Kirchhoff-Fresnel framework, circular apertures preserve cylindrical symmetry and produce ringlike far-field profiles whose radii and widths depend on $|\ell|$ but are insensitive to its sign. In contrast, equilateral triangles break axial symmetry and yield structured patterns that encode both the magnitude and the sign of $\ell$. A transparent Fraunhofer mapping links detector coordinates to the Fourier plane, explaining the $(|\ell|+1)$-lobe rule and the sign-dependent rotation of the pattern. We validate these results for both ideal Bessel beams and localized Laguerre-Gaussian packets, and we cross-check them by split-step Fourier propagation of the time-dependent Schr"odinger equation. From these analyses we extract practical design rules (Fraunhofer distance, lattice pitch, detector sampling) relevant to OAM diagnostics with moderately relativistic electrons with $E_{\rm kin}\sim0.1$ to $5$ MeV and light ions with $E_{\rm kin}\sim0.1$ to $1$ MeV/u. Our results establish triangular diffraction as a simple, passive, and robust method for reading out the OAM content of structured quantum beams.</description>
