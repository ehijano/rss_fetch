      <title>Derivation of the AMP equations from belief propagation for the $\ell_2$ minimisation problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the $\ell_p$-minimisation, which consists of finding the vector $x\in\mathbb{R}^N$ which minimises $\|x\|_p$ subject to the linear constraint $y=Ax$, where $y\in\mathbb{R}^m$ is given and $A$ is a $m\times N$ random matrix with i.i.d. sub-Gaussian centred entries ($m&lt;N$). This can be viewed as the zero temperature version of a statistical mechanics problem, in which one introduces a suitable Gibbs measure on $\mathbb{R}^N$. To such a Gibbs measure there are associated belief propagation equations. We prove in the easiest case $p=2$ that the means of the distributions obtained by the belief propagation iteration satisfy asymptotically the approximate message passing equations.</description>

      <title>Conservativeness of time changed processes and Liouville property for Schr\"odinger operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a criterion for the Liouville property for Schr\"odinger operators via the conservativeness of time changed processes. Using this criterion, we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for the Liouville property for some Schr\"odinger operators in terms of the decay rates of the potentials at infinity/boundary.</description>

      <title>A Phase Transition For Repeated K-Averages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $x_1,\dots,x_{n}$ be a fixed sequence of real numbers. At each stage, pick $k$ integers $\{I_{i}\}_{1\leq i \leq k}$ uniformly at random without replacement and then for each $i \in \{1,2,\dots,k\}$ replace $x_{I_i}$ by $(x_{I_1}+x_{I_2}+\dots+x_{I_k})/k$. It is easy to observe that all the co-ordinates converge to $(x_1+\dots+x_n)/n$. In this article, we extend the result of \cite{chatterjee2019note} by establishing order of decay of the expected $L^{2}$ distance. Furthermore, we establish the mixing time to be in between $\frac{n}{k \log k}\log n$ and $\frac{n}{k-1}\log n$.</description>

      <title>On the depth of depth-weighted trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The depth-weighted tree DWT($f$) with weight function $f:\{0,1,2,\ldots\}\to (0,\infty)$ is a dynamic random tree grown from a root $r$ where vertices arrive consecutively and every new vertex attaches to a parent $u$ with probability proportional to $f$(distance between $u$ and $r$). This work is dedicated to a systematic analysis of the depth of DWT($f$). Namely, we provide precise analytic expressions of the typical depth of DWT($f$) for convergent, periodic, slowly growing, and (super-)exponentially growing weight functions. Furthermore, for bounded or exponentially growing $f$, we determine the typical depth up to a multiplicative constant, thus confirming and strengthening a conjecture of Leckey, Mitsche and Wormald.</description>

      <title>Inviscid limit and an effective energy-enstrophy diffusion process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we consider a stationary $N$-dimensional Galerkin-Navier-Stokes type evolution with Brownian forcing and random stirring (of arbitrarily small strength). We show that the stationary diffusion in an open two-dimensional cone constructed in a companion article, stands as the inviscid limit of the laws of the ``enstrophy-energy'' process of the $N$-dimensional diffusion process considered here, this regardless of the strength of the stirring. With the help of the quantitative condensation bounds of the companion article, we infer quantitative inviscid condensation bounds, which for suitable forcings show an attrition of all but the lowest modes in the inviscid limit.</description>

      <title>Effective energy-enstrophy diffusion process and condensation bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we use Gaussian measure on $\mathbb{R}^N$ to define the coefficients of an elliptic diffusion on an open cone of $\mathbb{R}^2$. We prove the existence and uniqueness of a stationary distribution for this diffusion. In a companion article, we show that the diffusion constructed in this work is the inviscid limit of the laws of the ``enstrophy-energy'' process of a stationary $N$-dimensional Galerkin-Navier-Stokes type evolution with Brownian forcing and random stirring (the strength of which can be made to go to zero in the inviscid limit). In the present work, owing to the special properties of the coefficients constructed with the Gaussian measure, we bound the distance to $1$ of the ratio of the expected energy to the expected enstrophy (this ratio is at most $1$ with our normalization). Together with our companion article, this shows that for suitable Brownian forcings an inviscid condensation inducing an attrition of all but the lowest modes takes place.</description>

      <title>Finite Free Information Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop finite free information theory for real-rooted polynomials, establishing finite free analogues of entropy and Fisher information monotonicity, as well as the Stam and entropy power inequalities. These results resolve conjectures by Shlyakhtenko and Gribinski and recover inequalities in free probability in the large-degree limit. Equivalently, our results may be interpreted as potential-theoretic inequalities for the zeros of real-rooted polynomials under differential operators which preserve real-rootedness. Our proofs leverage a new connection between score vectors and Jacobians of root maps, combined with convexity results for hyperbolic polynomials.</description>

      <title>On propagation of chaos for the Fisher-Rao gradient flow in entropic mean-field optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of optimization problems on the space of probability measures motivated by the mean-field approach to studying neural networks. Such problems can be solved by constructing continuous-time gradient flows that converge to the minimizer of the energy function under consideration, and then implementing discrete-time algorithms that approximate the flow. In this work, we focus on the Fisher-Rao gradient flow and we construct an interacting particle system that approximates the flow as its mean-field limit. We discuss the connection between the energy function, the gradient flow and the particle system and explain different approaches to smoothing out the energy function with an appropriate kernel in a way that allows for the particle system to be well-defined. We provide a rigorous proof of the existence and uniqueness of thus obtained kernelized flows, as well as a propagation of chaos result that provides a theoretical justification for using the corresponding kernelized particle systems as approximation algorithms in entropic mean-field optimization.</description>

      <title>Optimal investment under capital gains taxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize classical results on the existence of optimal portfolios in discrete time frictionless market models to models with capital gains taxes. We consider the realistic but mathematically challenging rule that losses do not trigger negative taxes but can only be offset against potential gains in the future. Central to the analysis is a well-known phenomenon from arbitrage-free markets with proportional transaction costs that does not exist in arbitrage-free frictionless markets: an investment in specific quantities of stocks that is completely riskless but may provide an advantage over holding money in the bank account. As a result of this phenomenon, on an infinite probability space, no-arbitrage does not imply that the set of attainable terminal wealth is closed in probability. We show closedness under the slightly stronger {\em no unbounded non-substitutable investment with bounded risk} condition.
  As a by-product, we provide a proof that in discrete time frictionless models with short-selling constraints, no-arbitrage implies that the set of attainable terminal wealth is closed in probability -- even if there are redundant stocks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of detecting a planted star in the Erd{\H{o}}s--R{\'e}nyi random graph $G(n,m)$, formulated as a hypothesis test. We determine the scaling window for critical detection in $m$ in terms of the star size, and characterize the asymptotic total variation distance between the null and alternative hypotheses in this window. In the course of the proofs we show a condensation phase transition in the likelihood ratio that closely resembles that of the random energy model from spin glass theory.</description>

      <title>Maximum of the Characteristic Polynomial of I.I.D. Matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05045v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the leading order asymptotic of the maximum of the characteristic polynomial for i.i.d. matrices with real or complex entries. In particular, this result is new even for real Ginibre matrices, which was left as an open problem in [arXiv:2303.09912]; the complex Ginibre case was covered in [arXiv:1902.01983]. These are the first universality results for the non--Hermitian analog of the first order term of the Fyodorov--Hiary--Keating conjecture. Our methods are based on constructing a coupling to the branching random walk via Dyson Brownian motion. In particular, we find a new connection between real i.i.d. matrices and inhomogeneous branching random walk.</description>

      <title>On the principal eigenvectors of random Markov matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the invariant distributions of continuous-time and discrete-time random walks on randomly weighted complete digraphs. These distributions correspond to the principal left eigenvectors of the associated random Markov generators and kernels, viewed as random matrices. While much is known about the spectra of these matrices, relatively little is known about the principal left eigenvectors, which are delicate random objects for which no explicit form is known. We consider a broad class of such matrices obtained by associating random weights to the vertices and edges of the complete digraph. Our main result concerns the total variation distance between the invariant distribution of the continuous-time random walk and the distribution that is inversely proportional to the vertex weights. It states that, if the edge weights are i.i.d. with a finite $p$-th moment for some $p&gt;4$, then this distance a.s. converges to zero as the number of vertices grows large, even when the vertex weights are heavy-tailed. We further answer a question of Bordenave, Caputo, and Chafa\"i by showing that, despite the dependence of the entries in the corresponding Markov kernel, its invariant distribution is asymptotically uniform a.s., so long as the edge weights have a finite second moment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02611v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the work of Mirzakhani and Petri on random hyperbolic surfaces of large genus, length statistics of closed geodesics have been studied extensively. We focus on the case of random hyperbolic surfaces with cusps, the number of which grows with the genus. We prove that if the number of cusps grows fast enough and we restrict attention to special geodesics that are tight, we recover upon proper normalization the same Poisson point process in the large genus limit for the length statistics. The proof relies on a recursion formula for tight Weil-Petersson volumes obtained recently by Budd and Zonneveld and on a generalization of Mirzakhani's integration formula to the tight setting.</description>

      <title>Distributional Limits for Eigenvalues of Graphon Kernel Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04584v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the fluctuation behavior of individual eigenvalues of kernel matrices arising from dense graphon-based random graphs. Under minimal integrability and boundedness assumptions on the graphon, we establish distributional limits for simple, well-separated eigenvalues of the associated integral operator. A sharp probabilistic dichotomy emerges: in the non-degenerate regime, the properly normalized empirical eigenvalue satisfies a central limit theorem with an explicit variance, whereas in the degenerate regime the leading stochastic term vanishes and the centered eigenvalue converges to a weighted chi-square law determined by the operator spectrum.
  The analysis requires no smoothness or Lipschitz conditions on the kernel. Prior work under comparable assumptions established only operator convergence and eigenspace consistency; the present results characterize the full distributional behavior of individual eigenvalues, extending fluctuation theory beyond the reach of classical operator-level arguments. The proofs combine second-order perturbation expansions, concentration bounds for kernel matrices, and Hoeffding decompositions for symmetric statistics, revealing that at the $\sqrt{n}$ scale the dominant randomness arises from latent-position sampling rather than Bernoulli edge noise.</description>

      <title>An Operator Ito Formula for Volterra Gaussian Processes: The Intrinsic Bracket via Causal Derivation-Divergence Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10359v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive an Ito-type change-of-variables formula for Volterra Gaussian processes (including fractional Brownian motion with any Hurst parameter), based on the operator factorization framework. The Ito correction is expressed as a Stieltjes integral against the energy function Gamma^X(t) := ||Pi DX_t||_H^2, which equals E[X_t^2] for centered Gaussian processes. The correction emerges from the non-commutativity of the predictable projection Pi with nonlinear functions and is computed via the Gaussian conditional expectation structure following Decreusefond-Ustunel. We prove three results beyond the formula itself: (1) the energy measure d Gamma^X is the unique second-order correction compatible with the operator factorization; (2) under a fixed driving martingale, the intrinsic bracket is invariant under changes of Volterra kernel representation; (3) the bracket is stable under L^2 kernel approximation. The proof uses a marginal density argument via the Gaussian heat equation, bypassing pathwise increments entirely. We restrict to first-order formulas; higher-order rough dynamics are not addressed. The proof relies on Gaussianity; for non-Gaussian processes the formula extends as a conjecture.</description>

      <title>Correlation-Weighted Communicability Curvature as a Structural Driver of Dengue Spread: A Bayesian Spatial Analysis of Recife (2015-2024)</title>

Abstract: We investigate whether the structural connectivity of urban road networks helps explain dengue incidence in Recife, Brazil (2015--2024). For each neighborhood, we compute the average \emph{communicability curvature}, a graph-theoretic measure capturing the ability of a locality to influence others through multiple network paths. We integrate this metric into Negative Binomial models, fixed-effects regressions, SAR/SAC spatial models, and a hierarchical INLA/BYM2 specification. Across all frameworks, curvature is the strongest and most stable predictor of dengue risk. In the BYM2 model, the structured spatial component collapses ($\phi \approx 0$), indicating that functional network connectivity explains nearly all spatial dependence typically attributed to adjacency-based CAR terms. The results show that dengue spread in Recife is driven less by geographic contiguity and more by network-mediated structural flows.</description>

      <title>Quantum Talagrand-type Inequalities via Variance Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish dimension-free quantum Talagrand-type inequalities with explicit constants on the quantum Boolean cube, via a unified variance-decay perspective. For individual observables, short-time variance decay along the depolarizing semigroup, with rates estimated through hypercontractivity, naturally yields Talagrand-type bounds. Within this framework, we derive Talagrand-type energy--variance and high-order influence--variance inequalities. From the former, we obtain quantum analogues of Talagrand's isoperimetric inequality, the Eldan--Gross inequality, and the Cordero-Erausquin--Eskenazis inequality; from the latter, we derive high-order quantum Talagrand--KKL-type and partial isoperimetric bounds. Altogether, our work provides a variance-decay framework of broad applicability, unifying first-order and high-order Talagrand-type phenomena.</description>

      <title>Large expander subgraphs in high genus triangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14984v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that random triangulations of high genus contain very large expander subgraphs, answering a question of Benjamini. Our approach relies on new general criteria for arbitrary graphs to contain large expander subgraphs.</description>
