      <title>Singular support for G-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a reductive group $G$, we introduce a notion of singular support for cocomplete dualizable DG-categories equipped with a strong $G$-action. This is done by considering the singular support of the sheaves of matrix coefficients arising from the action. We focus particularly on dualizable $G$-categories whose singular support lies in the nilpotent cone of $\mathfrak{g}^*$ and refer to these as nilpotent $G$-categories. For such categories, we give a characterization of the singular support in terms of the vanishing of its generalized Whittaker models.
  We study parabolic induction and restriction functors of nilpotent $G$-categories and show that they interact with singular support in a desired way.
  We prove that if an orbit is maximal in the singular support of a nilpotent $G$-category $\mathcal{C}$, the Hochschild homology of the generalized Whittaker model of $\mathcal{C}$ coincides with the microstalk of the character sheaf of $\mathcal{C}$ at that orbit. This should be considered a categorified analogue of a result of Moeglin-Waldspurger that the dimension of the generalized Whittaker model of a smooth admissible representation of a reductive group over a non-Archimedean local field of characteristic zero coincides with the Fourier coefficient in the wave-front set of that orbit.
  As a consequence, we give another proof of a theorem of Bezrukavnikov-Losev, classifying finite-dimensional modules for $W$-algebras with fixed regular central character. More precisely, we realize the (rationalized) Grothendieck group of this category as a certain subrepresentation of the Springer representation. Along the way, we show that the Springer action of the Weyl group on the twisted Grothendieck--Springer sheaves is the categorical trace of the wall crossing functors, extending an observation of Zhu for integral central characters.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper initiates the study of invariants of links associated to infinite-dimensional representations of $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ using graphical representation for quantum $6j$-symbols, the shadow world. We obtain formulae for $q3j$-symbols and $q6j$-symbols for Verma modules and study their properties. This hints at the structure of the possible target category for Reshetikhin-Turaev functor for such an invariant.</description>

      <title>A quantum cluster algebra structure on the semi-derived Hall algebra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using Hernandez-Leclerc's isomorphism between the derived Hall algebra of a representation-finite quiver $Q$ and the quantum Grothendieck ring of the quantum loop algebra of the Dynkin type of $Q$, we lift the (quantum) cluster algebra structure of the quantum Grothendieck ring to the semi-derived Hall algebra, introduced by Gorsky, of the category of bounded complexes of projective modules over the path algebra of $Q$. We also construct a braid group action on the semi-derived Hall algebra, lifting Kashiwara-Kim-Oh-Park's braid group action on the quantum Grothendieck ring.</description>

      <title>Convex elements and Steinberg's cross-sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study convex elements in a (twisted) Weyl group introduced by Ivanov and the first named author. We show that each conjugacy class of the twisted Weyl group contains a convex element, and moreover, the Steinberg cross-sections exist for all convex elements. This result strictly enlarges the cases of Steinberg cross-sections from a new perspective, and will play an essential role in the study of higher Deligne-Lusztig representations.</description>

      <title>Equivalence Relations on Vertex Operator Algebras, II: Witt Equivalence and Orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When can two strongly rational vertex operator algebras or 1+1d rational conformal field theories (RCFTs) be related by topological manipulations? For vertex operator algebras, the term "topological manipulations" refers to operations like passing to a conformal extension or restricting to a conformal subalgebra; for RCFTs, topological manipulations include operations like gauging (or orbifolding) a finite subpart of a generalized global symmetry or interpolating to a new theory via a topological line interface of finite quantum dimension.
  Inspired by results in the theory of even lattices, and also the theory of tensor categories, we say that two strongly rational vertex operator algebras are Witt equivalent if their central charges agree and if their representation categories are Witt equivalent as modular tensor categories. Two RCFTs are said to be Witt equivalent if their central charges agree and if their associated 2+1d topological field theories can be separated by a topological surface. We argue that Witt equivalence is necessary for two theories to be related by topological manipulations. We conjecture that it is also sufficient, and give proofs in various special cases.
  We relate this circle of ideas to the problem of classifying RCFTs, and to lore concerning deformation classes of quantum field theories. We use the notion of Witt equivalence to argue, assuming the conjectural classification of unitary, $c=1$ RCFTs, that all of the finite global symmetries of the $\mathrm{SU}(2)_1$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model are invertible. Finally, we sketch a "quantum Galois theory" for chiral CFTs, which generalizes prior mathematical literature by incorporating non-invertible symmetries; we illustrate this non-invertible Galois theory in the context of the monster CFT, for which we produce a Fibonacci symmetry.</description>

      <title>Planar decomposition of bipartite HOMFLY polynomials in symmetric representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the recently discovered planar decomposition (Kauffman bracket) for the HOMFLY polynomials of bipartite knot/link diagrams to (anti)symmetrically colored HOMFLY polynomials. Cabling destroys planarity, but it is restored after projection to (anti)symmetric representations. This allows to go beyond arborescent calculus, which so far produced the majority of results for colored polynomials. Technicalities include combinations of projectors, and these can be handled rigorously, without any guess-work -- what can be also useful for other considerations, where reliable quantization was so far unavailable. We explicitly provide simple examples of calculation of the HOMFLY polynomials in symmetric representations with the use of our planar technique. These examples reveal what we call the bipartite evolution and the bipartite decomposition of squares of $\mathcal{R}$-matrices eigenvalues in the antiparallel channel.</description>

      <title>Braid groups of J-reflection groups and associated classical and dual Garside structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The family of $J$-reflection groups can be seen as a combinatorial generalisation of irreducible rank two complex reflection groups and was introduced by the author in a previous article. In this article, we define the braid groups associated to $J$-reflection groups, which coincide with the complex braid group when the $J$-reflection group is finite. We show that the isomorphism type of the braid groups only depend on the reflection isomorphism types of the corresponding $J$-reflection groups. Moreover, we show that these braid groups are always abstractly isomorphic to circular groups. At the same time, we show that the center of the braid groups is cyclic and sent onto the center of the corresponding $J$-reflection groups under the natural quotient. Finally, we exhibit two Garside structures for each braid group of $J$-reflection group. These structures generalise the classical and dual Garside structures (when defined) of rank two irreducible complex reflection groups. In particular, the dual Garside structure of $J$-reflection groups provides candidates for dual monoids associated to the irreducible complex reflection groups of rank two which do not already have one.</description>

      <title>Affine Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials on the subregular cell in non simply-laced Lie algebras: with an application to character formulae (with an appendix by Roman Bezrukavnikov, Vasily Krylov, and Kenta Suzuki)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the techniques in arXiv:2209.08865(1) to the non-simply-laced situation, and calculate explicit special values of parabolic affine inverse Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials for subregular nilpotent orbits. We thus obtain explicit character formulas for certain irreducible representations of affine Lie algebras. As particular cases, we compute characters of simple vertex algebras $V_{k}(\mathfrak{g})$ for $k=-1,\ldots,-b$, where $b$ is the largest label of the highest short coroot $\theta^\vee$. Conjecturally, all ordinary modules over $V_{-b}(\mathfrak{g})$ are covered by our computations. As an application, we obtain the explicit formulas for flavoured Schur indices of rank one Argyres-Douglas 4d SCFTs with flavour symmetry $G_2$ and $B_3$. Our results are proved using the geometry of the Springer resolution. We identify the cell quotient of the anti-spherical module over $\widehat{W}$ corresponding to the subregular cell with a certain one-dimensional extension of a module defined by Lusztig. We describe the canonical basis in this module geometrically and present an explicit description of the corresponding objects in the derived category of equivariant coherent sheaves on the Springer resolution. They correspond to irreducible objects in the heart of a certain $t$-structure that we describe using an equivariant version of the derived McKay correspondence.</description>

      <title>Module categories of the generic Virasoro VOA and quantum groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.12969v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the equivalence between two braided tensor categories. On the one hand, we consider the category of modules of the Virasoro vertex operator algebra with a generic central charge (generic Virasoro VOA) generated by those simple modules lying in the first row of the Kac table. On the other hand, we take the category of finite-dimensional type I modules of the quantum group $\mathcal{U}_{q} (\mathfrak{sl}_{2})$ with $q$ determined by the central charge. This is a continuation of our previous work in which we examined intertwining operators for the generic Virasoro VOA in detail. Our strategy to show the categorical equivalence is to take those results as input and directly compare the structures of the tensor categories. Therefore, we are to execute the most elementary proof of categorical equivalence. We also study the category of $C_{1}$-cofinite modules of the generic Virasoro VOA. We show that it is equivalent to the category of finite-dimensional type I modules of $\mathcal{U}_{q} (\mathfrak{sl}_{2})\otimes \mathcal{U}_{\tilde{q}} (\mathfrak{sl}_{2})$ as a tensor category, where $q$ and $\tilde{q}$ are again related to the central charge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05560v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a connection between two variants of van der Corput's Difference Theorem (vdCDT) for countably infinite amenable groups $G$ and the ergodic hierarchy of mixing properties of a unitary representation $U$ of $G$. In particular, we show that one variant of vdCDT corresponds to subrepresentations of the left regular representation, and another variant of vdCDT corresponds to the absence of finite dimensional subrepresentations. We then obtain applications for measure preserving actions of countably infinite abelian groups.</description>

      <title>Length of triangulated categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07583v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of composition series of triangulated categories. Their lengths yield invariants for these categories. We then focus on composition series of derived categories of certain projective varieties and finite dimensional algebras. We construct composition series of different lengths, for some smooth projective rational surfaces and for certain smooth threefolds. On the other hand, we prove that for derived categories of finite dimensional representations of Dynkin and extended Dynkin quivers, for derived categories of some singular varieties, all composition series have the same length. If this property would also hold for the blow-up of $\mathbb{P}^2$ in $10$ general points, then Krah's phantom subcategory would have infinite length. In particular, it would have infinite chain of thick subcategories.</description>

      <title>Root Number Equidistribution for Self-Dual Automorphic Representations on $GL_N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a totally real field. We study the root numbers $\epsilon(1/2, \pi)$ of self-dual cuspidal automorphic representations $\pi$ of $\mathrm{GL}_{2N}/F$ with conductor $\mathfrak n$ and regular integral infinitesimal character $\lambda$. If $\pi$ is orthogonal, then $\epsilon(1/2, \pi)$ is known to be identically one. We show that for symplectic representations, the root numbers $\epsilon(1/2, \pi)$ equidistribute between~$\pm 1$ as $\lambda \to \infty$, provided that there exists a prime dividing $\mathfrak n$ with power $&gt;N$.We also study conjugate self-dual representations with respect to a CM extension $E/F$, where we obtain a similar result under the assumption that $\mathfrak n$ is divisible by a large enough power of a ramified prime and provide evidence that equidistribution does not hold otherwise. In cases where there are known to be associated Galois representations, we deduce root number equidistribution results for the corresponding families of $N$-dimensional Galois representations.
  The proof generalizes a classical argument for the case of $\mathrm{GL}_2/\mathbb Q$ by using Arthur's trace formula and the endoscopic classification for quasisplit classical groups similarly to a previous work (arxiv:2212.12138). The main new technical difficulty is evaluating endoscopic transfers of the required test functions at central elements.</description>
