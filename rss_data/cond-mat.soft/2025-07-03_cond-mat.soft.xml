      <title>An alternative approach to the phonon theory of liquids: Evolution of the energy of diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With regard to the three basic states of matter (solid, liquid, gas), the calculation of the heat capacity of liquids in a general form has been considered one of the deepest and most interesting challenges in condensed matter physics, due to the strong, system-specific interactions involved. Notwithstanding the theoretical difficulties, there have recently been significant advances in our understanding of liquids, and the phonon theory of liquids has been proposed. However, this theory uses the virial theorem to calculate the liquid energy. Here, we propose an alternative version of the phonon theory of liquids by taking into account the numbers of oscillating atoms and diffusing atoms, rather than using the virial theorem. A new formula is derived for the liquid energy in both the quantum and the classical anharmonic cases. To verify the proposed approach, theoretical predictions are compared with the experimental specific heat of liquid mercury. Finally, we obtain a new expression for the energy of a supercritical system.</description>

      <title>A statistical theory for polymer elasticity: from molecular kinematics to continuum behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the macroscopic mechanical behavior of polymeric materials from the micro-structural features has remained a challenge for decades. Existing theoretical models often fail to accurately capture the experimental data, due to non-physical assumptions that link the molecule kinematics with the macroscopic deformation. In this work, we construct a novel Hamiltonian for chain segments enabling a unified statistical description of both individual macromolecular chains and continuum polymer networks. The chain kinematics, including the stretch and orientation properties, are retrieved by the thermodynamic observables without phenomenological assumptions. The theory shows that the chain stretch is specified by a simple relation via its current spatial direction and the continuum Eulerian logarithmic strain, while the probability of a chain in this spatial direction is governed by the new Hamiltonian of a single segment. The model shows a significantly improved prediction on the hyperelastic response of elastomers, relying on minimal, physically-grounded parameters.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Avalanches: Rate-Controlled Switching and Race Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Avalanches are rapid cascades of rearrangements driven by cooperative flipping of hysteretic local elements. Here we show that flipping dynamics and race conditions -- where multiple elements become unstable simultaneously -- give rise to dynamic avalanches that cannot be captured by static models of interacting elements. We realize dynamic avalanches in metamaterials with controlled flipping times, and demonstrate how this allows to modify, promote, and direct avalanche behavior. Our work elucidates the crucial role of internal dynamics in complex materials and introduces dynamic design principles for materializing targeted pathways and sequential functionalities.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal hierarchy of thermal avalanches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In amorphous solids, frustrated elastic interactions conspire with thermal noise to trigger anomalously slow sequences of plastic rearrangements, termed "thermal avalanches", which play an important role during creep and glassy relaxations. Here we uncover the complex spatiotemporal structure of thermal avalanches in simulations of a model amorphous solid. We systematically disentangle mechanical and thermal triggering during logarithmic creep, revealing a hierarchy of fast localized cascades linked by slow, long-range, noise-mediated facilitation. These thermal avalanches exhibit heavy-tailed temporal correlations, reminiscent of seismic activity. Our work sheds light on the rich relaxation dynamics of amorphous solids, while providing a framework for identifying noise-mediated correlations. We validate this approach by revealing a similar hierarchy in experiments with crumpled thin sheets.</description>

      <title>A unifying approach to self-organizing systems interacting via conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified framework for embedding and analyzing dynamical systems using generalized projection operators rooted in local conservation laws. By representing physical, biological, and engineered systems as graphs with incidence and cycle matrices, we derive dual projection operators that decompose network fluxes and potentials. This formalism aligns with principles of non-equilibrium thermodynamics and captures a broad class of systems governed by flux-forcing relationships and local constraints. We extend this approach to collective dynamics through the PRojective Embedding of Dynamical Systems (PrEDS), which lifts low-dimensional dynamics into a high-dimensional space, enabling both replication and recovery of the original dynamics. When systems fall within the PrEDS class, their collective behavior can be effectively approximated through projection onto a mean-field space. We demonstrate the versatility of PrEDS across diverse domains, including resistive and memristive circuits, adaptive flow networks (e.g., slime molds), elastic string networks, and particle swarms. Notably, we establish a direct correspondence between PrEDS and swarm dynamics, revealing new insights into optimization and self-organization. Our results offer a general theoretical foundation for analyzing complex networked systems and for designing systems that self-organize through local interactions.</description>

      <title>Radical scaling: beyond our feet and fingers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling laws arise and are eulogized across disciplines from natural to social sciences for providing pithy, quantitative, `scale-free', and `universal' power law relationships between two variables. On a log-log plot, the power laws display as straight lines, with a slope set by the exponent of the scaling law. In practice, a scaling relationship works only for a limited range, bookended by crossovers to other scaling laws. Leading with Taylor's oft-cited scaling law for the blast radius of an explosion against time, and by collating an unprecedented amount of datasets for laser-induced, chemical and nuclear explosions, we show distinct kinematics arise at the early and late stages. We illustrate that picking objective scales for the two axes using the transitions between regimes leads to the collapse of the data for the two regimes and their crossover, but the third regime is typically not mapped to the master curve. The objective scales permit us to abandon the arbitrarily chosen anthropocentric units of measurement, like feet for length and heart-beat for time, but the decimal system with ten digits (fingers) is still part of the picture. We show a remarkable collapse of all three regimes onto a common master curve occurs if we replace the base 10 by a dimensionless radix that combines the scales from the two crossovers. We also illustrate this approach of radical scaling for capillarity-driven pinching, coalescence and spreading of drops and bubbles, expecting such generalizations will be made for datasets across many disciplines.</description>

      <title>A finite element implementation of a large deformation gradient-damage theory for fracture with Abaqus user material subroutines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in computations have enabled the application of various modeling approaches to predict fracture and failure, such as the gradient-damage (phasefield) method. Several existing studies have leveraged the heat equation solver in Abaqus to model gradient-damage, due to its mathematical resemblance to the heat equation. Particular care is required when extending the approach to large deformation scenarios due to differences in the referential and spatial configurations, especially since the heat equation in Abaqus is solved in the spatial configuration, whereas most gradient-damage frameworks are formulated in the referential configuration. This work provides a pedagogic view of an appropriate Abaqus implementation of a gradient-damage theory for fracture in materials undergoing large deformation using Abaqus UMAT and UMATHT user subroutines. Key benchmark problems from the literature are used to demonstrate the robustness of our implementation across various materials exhibiting different constitutive behaviors, such as non-linear elasticity, linear elasticity, and large deformation rate-dependent plasticity, ensuring its applicability regardless of the specific material constitutive choice. The details of the implementation, along with the codes, which are a direct outcome of this work, are also provided.</description>

      <title>A semi-analytical solution for the lubrication force between two spheres approaching in viscoelastic fluids described by the Oldroyd-B model under small Deborah numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Viscoelastic fluids play a critical role in various engineering and biological applications, where their lubrication properties are strongly influenced by relaxation times ranging from microseconds to minutes. Although the lubrication mechanism for Newtonian fluids is well-established, its extension to viscoelastic materials - particularly under squeezing flow conditions - remains less explored. This study presents a semi-analytical solution for the lubrication force between two spheres approaching in a Boger fluid under small Deborah numbers. Unlike previous works that assumed a Newtonian velocity field, we derive the velocity profile directly from the mass-momentum conservation and Oldroyd-B constitutive equations using lubrication theory and order-of-magnitude analysis techniques. Under steady-state conditions, viscoelasticity induces a marginal increase in the surface-to-surface normal force as a result of the increased pressure required to overcome the original resistance from the first normal-stress difference. Transient analyses reveal that the normal lubrication force is bounded by two Newtonian plateaus and is nonsymmetric as the spheres approach or separate. Our findings highlight the role of viscoelasticity in improving load capacity and provide new insight for modelling dense particle suspensions in Boger fluids, where short-range interactions dominate.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic Origin of Friction Between Suspended Rough Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tangential interactions between particles play a central role in suspension rheology. We show theoretically that these interactions, often attributed to contact friction, are a direct consequence of fluid flows between rough particles in relative motion. We find that small surface asperities generically lead to localized hydrodynamic sliding forces and torques that can exceed their smooth counterparts by orders of magnitude. A fully analytic thin-film theory shows that these forces grow inversely with the surface separation, significantly more singular than the logarithmic scaling for smooth particles. The impending singularity tightly constrains the particles' rotation with their translation, recovering a crucial ingredient in dense suspension rheology. Despite their purely hydrodynamic origin, these features resemble several aspects of dry rolling and sliding friction.</description>
