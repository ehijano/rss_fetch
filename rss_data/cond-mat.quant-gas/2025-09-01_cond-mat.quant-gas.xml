      <title>Floquet-engineered moire quasicrystal patterns of ultracold atoms in twisted bilayer optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain moire quasicrystal patterns via Floquet-engineering intralayer-atomic interactions in twisted bilayer hexagonal optical lattices of ultracold atoms. By tracking the density wave amplitude, we partition the dynamical evolution into four distinct stages and verify the pattern changes of each stage in both real and momentum space. The spatial symmetry of the patterns is intimately tied to the modulation amplitudes and frequencies. Consequently, appropriately reducing the modulation frequency and increasing the amplitude will facilitate lattice symmetry breaking and the subsequent emergence of rotational symmetry. Most notably, at specific parameters, a twelve-fold (D12) moire quasicrystal pattern emerges which closely resembles that observed in twisted bilayer graphene. The momentum-space patterns likewise exhibit pronounced rotational symmetry, with those in real space showing good agreement at specific instants. The patterns obtained exhibit remarkable sensitivity to the modulation frequency, suggesting that this frequency-dependent pattern formation could be exploited for quantum precision measurement. Our findings introduce a new paradigm for investigating the quasicrystals and their associated symmetries in ultracold atomic system.</description>

      <title>Measuring mutual friction in superfluids: the role of initial vortex configuration fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physical origin of mutual friction in quantum fluids is deeply connected to the fundamental nature of superfluidity. It stems from the interaction between the superfluid and normal components, mediated by the dynamics of quantized vortices that induce the exchange of momentum and energy. Despite the complexity of these interactions, their essential features can be effectively described by the dissipative point vortex model, an extension of classical vortex dynamics that incorporates finite-temperature dissipation. Mutual friction is parametrized by the longitudinal (dissipative) coefficient $\alpha$ and the transverse (reactive) coefficient $\alpha'$. Accurate measurement of these parameters provides critical insights into the microscopic mechanisms governing vortex motion and dissipation in quantum fluids, serving as a key benchmark for theoretical models. In this work, we employ the dissipative point vortex model to study how fluctuations in the initial conditions influence the inference of $\alpha$ and $\alpha'$ from the time evolution of the vortex trajectories. Using experimentally realistic parameters, we show that fluctuations can introduce significant biases in the extracted values of the mutual friction coefficients. We compare our findings with recent experimental measurements in strongly interacting atomic superfluids. Applying this analysis to our recent experimental results allowed us to account for fluctuations in the correct determination of $\alpha$ and $\alpha'$.</description>

      <title>Observation of universal non-Gaussian statistics of the order parameter across a continuous phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Second-order phase transitions are characterised by critical scaling and universality. The singular behaviour of thermodynamic quantities at the transition, in particular, is determined by critical exponents of the universality class of the transition. However, critical properties are also characterised by the probability distribution of order parameter across the transition, where non-Gaussian statistics are expected, but remain largely unexplored. Here, making use of single-atom-resolved detection in momentum space, we measure the full probability distribution of the amplitude of the order parameter across a continuous phase transition in an interacting lattice Bose gas. We find that fluctuations are captured by an effective potential -- reconstructed from the measured probability distribution by analogy with Landau theory -- displaying a non-trivial minimum in the superfluid (ordered) phase, which vanishes at the transition point. Additionally, we observe non-Gaussian statistics of the order parameter near the transition, distinguished by non-zero and oscillating high-order cumulants. We provide direct experimental evidence that these oscillations are universal, and show numerically that they exhibit critical scaling. Our experiments are conducted in inhomogeneous systems, challenging the conventional understanding of criticality, which is primarily based on homogeneous models. Our results underscore the crucial role of order parameter statistics in probing critical phenomena and universality.</description>

      <title>Magnetic soliton molecules in binary condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-component Bose-Einstein condensates in the miscible phase can support polarization solitary waves, known as magnetic solitons. By calculating the interaction potential between two magnetic solitons, we elucidate the mechanisms and conditions for the formation of bound states -- or molecules -- and support these predictions with dynamical simulations. We analytically determine the dissociation energy of bound states consisting of two oppositely polarized solitons and find good agreement with full numerical simulations. Collisions between bound states -- either with other bound states or with individual solitons -- produce intriguing dynamics. Notably, collisions between a pair of bound states exhibit a dipole-like behavior. We anticipate that such bound states, along with their rich collision dynamics, are within reach of current experimental capabilities.</description>

      <title>1D quasi-solutions of the 2D Chern-Simons-Schr{\"o}dinger system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a mean-field model for a system of 2D abelian anyons, given by the dynamics of a Schr{\"o}dinger matter field coupled to a Chern-Simons gauge field. We derive an effective 1D equation by adding a strongly anisotropic trapping potential (wave-guide) acting on the Schr{\"o}dinger field, and tracing out the tight confinement direction. The effective dynamics in the loose direction of the wave-guide turns out to be governed by the classical 1D quintic NLS equation.</description>

      <title>Anomalous dispersion of shear waves in dipolar supersolids</title>

Abstract: Dipolar supersolids--quantum states that are simultaneously superfluid and solid--have had their superfluid nature rigorously tested, while their solid nature remain uncharted. Arguably, the defining characteristic of a solid is the existence of elastic shear waves. In this work we investigate transverse wave packet propagation in dipolar supersolids with triangular and honeycomb structure. Remarkably, the honeycomb supersolid displays anomalous dispersion, supporting waves traveling faster than the transverse speed of sound. While the distinction between anomalous and normal dispersion appears subtle, it has a profound influence on both the transport and scattering properties. For both supersolid phases, we calculate the shear modulus, a key parameter that quantifies the material's rigidity. Our findings are pertinent to current experimental efforts scrutinizing the fundamental properties of supersolids.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulating continuum field theories with large-spin lattice models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating the real-time dynamics of quantum field theories (QFTs) is one of the most promising applications of quantum simulators. Regularizing a bosonic QFT for quantum simulation purposes typically involves a truncation in Hilbert space in addition to a discretization of space. Here, we discuss how to perform such a regularization of scalar QFTs by explicitly constructing suitable many-body lattice Hamiltonians using multi-level or qudit systems, and show that this enables quantitative predictions in the continuum limit by extrapolating results obtained for large-spin models. With extensive matrix-product state simulations, we numerically demonstrate the sequence of extrapolations that leads to quantitative agreement of observables for the integrable sine-Gordon (sG) QFT. We further show how to prepare static and moving soliton excitations, and analyze their scattering dynamics in the continuum limit, in agreement with a semi-classical model and with quantitative analytical predictions. Finally, we illustrate how a non-integrable perturbation of the sG model gives rise to dynamics reminiscent of string breaking and plasma oscillations in gauge theories. Our methods are directly applicable in state-of-the-art analog quantum simulators, opening the door to quantitatively investigating a wide variety of scalar field theories and tackling long-standing questions in non-equilibrium QFT like the fate of the false vacuum.</description>

      <title>Phonon thermal Hall as a lattice Aharonov-Bohm effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18236v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a growing list of insulators, experiments find that magnetic field induces a misalignment between the heat flux and the thermal gradient vectors. This phenomenon, known as the phonon thermal Hall effect, implies energy flow without entropy production along the orientation perpendicular to the temperature gradient. The experimentally-measured thermal Hall angle in various insulators does not exceed a bound and becomes maximal at the temperature of peak longitudinal thermal conductivity. The present paper aims to propose a scenario providing and explanation for these two experimental facts. It begins by noticing that at this temperature, $T_{max}$, Normal phonon-phonon collisions become most frequent in comparison with Umklapp and boundary scattering events. Furthermore, the Born-Oppenheimer approximated molecular wave functions are known to acquire a phase in the presence of a magnetic field. In an anharmonic crystal, in which tensile and compressive strain do not cancel out, this field-induced atomic phase gives rise to a phonon Berry phase and generates phonon-phonon interference. The rough amplitude of the thermal Hall angle expected in this picture is set by the phonon wavelength, $\lambda_{ph}$, and the crest atomic displacement, $\delta u_m$ at $T_{max}$. The derived expression is surprisingly close to what has been experimentally found in black phosphorus, germanium and silicon.</description>
