      <title>Generalizing matrix representations to fully heterochronous ranked tree shapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phylogenetic tree shapes capture fundamental signatures of evolution. We consider ``ranked'' tree shapes, which are equipped with a total order on the internal nodes compatible the tree graph. Recent work has established an elegant bijection of ranked tree shapes and a class of integer matrices, called \textbf{F}-matrices, defined by simple inequalities. This formulation is for isochronous ranked tree shapes, where all leaves share the same sampling time, such as in the study of ancient human demography from present-day individuals. Another important style of phylogenetics concerns trees where the ``timing'' of events is by branch length rather than calendar time. This style of tree, called a rooted phylogram, is output by popular maximum-likelihood methods. These trees are broadly relevant, such as to study the affinity maturation of B cells in the immune system. Discretizing time in a rooted phylogram gives a fully heterochronous ranked tree shape, where leaves are part of the total order.
  Here we extend the \textbf{F}-matrix framework to such fully heterochronous ranked tree shapes. We establish an explicit bijection between a class of \textbf{F}-matrices and the space of such tree shapes. The matrix representation has the key feature that values at any entry are highly constrained via four previous entries, enabling straightforward enumeration of all valid tree shapes. We also use this framework to develop probabilistic models on ranked tree shapes. Our work extends understanding of combinatorial objects that have a rich history in the literature: isochronous ranked tree shapes are related to alternating permutations that Andr\'e studied over 130 years ago, and Poupard found (nearly 40 years ago) that fully heterochronous ranked tree shapes are counted by the reduced tangent numbers.</description>

      <title>Streptococcosis in aquaculture: Advances, challenges, and future directions in disease control and prevention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aquaculture is pivotal for global food security but faces significant challenges from infectious diseases, particularly those caused by Streptococcus species such as Streptococcus iniae and Streptococcus agalactiae. These pathogens induce severe systemic infections in various fish species, resulting in high morbidity and mortality rates. This review consolidates current knowledge on the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations of these infections in fish and provides a comprehensive analysis of multifaceted control and prebention strategies. Advancements in genetic engineering and selective breeding are highlighted, demonstrating significant potential in developing disease-resistant fish strains through technologies like CRISPR-Cas9 and genomic selection. We examine the impact of farming practices on disease prevalence, emphasizing the roles of stocking density, feeding regimes, and biosecurity measures. The integration of big data analytics and IoT technologies is shown to revolutionize disease monitoring and management, enabling real-time surveillance and predictive modeling for timely interventions. Progress in vaccine development, including subunit, DNA, and recombinant protein vaccines, highlights the importance of tailored immunoprophylactic strategies. Furthermore, this review emphasizes the One-Health approach and the essential collaboration among industry, academia, and government to address the interconnected health of humans, animals, and the environment. This holistic strategy, supported by advanced technologies and collaborative efforts, promises to enhance the sustainability and productivity of aquaculture systems. Future research directions advocate for continued innovation and interdisciplinary partnerships to overcome the persistent challenges of streptococcal infections in aquaculture.</description>

      <title>Generalized Maximum Entropy: When and Why you need it</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical Maximum-Entropy Principle (MEP) based on Shannon entropy is widely used to construct least-biased probability distributions from partial information. However, the Shore-Johnson axioms that single out the Shannon functional hinge on strong system independence, an assumption often violated in real-world, strongly correlated systems. We provide a self-contained guide to when and why practitioners should abandon the Shannon form in favour of the one-parameter Uffink-Jizba-Korbel (UJK) family of generalized entropies. After reviewing the Shore and Johnson axioms from an applied perspective, we recall the most commonly used entropy functionals and locate them within the UJK family. The need for generalized entropies is made clear with two applications, one rooted in economics and the other in ecology. A simple mathematical model worked out in detail shows the power of generalized maximum entropy approaches in dealing with cases where strong system independence does not hold. We conclude with practical guidelines for choosing an entropy measure and reporting results so that analyses remain transparent and reproducible.</description>

      <title>Reaction-diffusion models of invasive tree pest spread: quantifying the expansion of oak processionary moth in the UK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: UK woodlands, forests, and urban treescapes are under threat from invasive species, exacerbated by climate change, trade, and transport. Invasive tree pests debilitate their host and disrupt forest ecosystems, thus it is imperative to quantitatively model and predict their spread. Addressing this, we model the spread of an invasive pest using a spatiotemporal reaction-diffusion equation, representing the spatial distribution as a population density field. We solve this intractable equation numerically and, from the solution, we determine first arrival times of the pest at locations in the field. The adopted model permits us to obtain the expansion rate of pest spread directly from the model parameters, which we infer in the Bayesian paradigm, using a Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme. We apply our framework to the ongoing spread of oak processionary moth in the UK, an outbreak which continues to grow despite management efforts. We demonstrate that our approach effectively captures the spread of the pest and that this has occurred at a non-constant expansion rate. The proposed framework is a powerful tool for quantitatively modelling the spread of an invasive tree pest and could underpin future prediction and management approaches.</description>
