      <title>Revisiting the strain-induced softening behaviour in hydrogels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Usually, the strain-induced softening behaviour observed in the differential modulus $K(T,\gamma)$ of hydrogels has been attributed to the breakage of internal structures of the network, such as the cross-links that bind together the polymer chains. Here we consider a stress-strain relationship that we have recently derived from a coarse-grained model to demonstrate that no rupture of the network is needed for rubber-like gels to present such behaviour. In particular, we show that, in some cases, the decreasing of $K(T,\gamma)$ as a function of the strain $\gamma$ is closely related to the energy-related contribution to the elastic modulus that has been experimentally observed, e.g., for tetra-PEG hydrogels. Thus, our results suggest that, instead of the breakage of structures, the softening behaviour can be also related to the effective interaction between the chains in the network and their neighbouring solvent molecules. Comparison to experimental data determined for several hydrogels is included to illustrate that behaviour and to validate our approach.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous flows in active smectics with dislocations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a hydrodynamic theory of active smectics A in two-dimensional space, including the creation/annihilation and motility of dislocations with Burgers' number $\pm1$. We derive analytical criteria on the set of parameters that lead to flows. We show that the motility of dislocations can lead to flow transitions with distinct features from the previously reported active Helfrich--Hurault shear instability with, notably, a first-order transition in the velocity from quiescence to turbulence.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic insights into Z-ring formation and stability: A Langevin dynamics approach to FtsZ self-assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tubulin-like protein FtsZ is crucial for cytokinesis in bacteria and many archaea, forming a ring-shaped structure called the Z-ring at the site of cell division. Despite extensive research, the formation of Z-rings is not entirely understood. We propose a theoretical model based on FtsZ's known filament structures, treating them as semiflexible polymers with specific mechanical properties and lateral inter-segment attraction that can stabilize ring formations. Our Langevin dynamics simulations reveal various morphological phases, including open helices, chains, rings, and globules, capturing experimental observations in the fission yeast model using FtsZ from different bacterial species or mutants of Escherichia coli. Using the theoretical model, we explore how treadmilling activity affects Z-ring stability and identify a spooling mechanism of ring formation. The active ring produces contractile, shear, and rotational stresses, which intensify before the Z-ring transitions to an open helix at high activity.</description>

      <title>The significance of fuzzy boundaries of the barrier regions in single-molecule measurements of failed barrier crossing attempts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent experimental study reports on measuring the temporal duration and the spatial extent of failed attempts to cross an activation barrier (i.e., "loops") for a folding transition in a single molecule and for a Brownian particle trapped within a bistable potential. Within the model of diffusive dynamics, however, both of these quantities are, on the average, exactly zero because of the recrossings of the barrier region boundary. That is, an observer endowed with infinite spatial and temporal resolution would find that finite loops do not exist (or, more precisely, form a set of measure zero). Here we develop a description of the experiment that takes finite experimental resolution into account and show how the experimental uncertainty of localizing the point, in time and space, where the barrier is crossed leads to observable distributions of loop times and sizes. Although these distributions generally depend on the experimental resolution, this dependence, in certain cases, may amount to a simple resolution-dependent factor and thus the experiments do probe inherent properties of barrier crossing dynamics.</description>

      <title>Memory-induced absolute negative mobility</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Markovian systems form a broad area of physics that remains greatly unexplored despite years of intensive investigations. The spotlight is on memory as a source of effects that are absent in their Markovian counterparts. In this work we dive into this problem and analyze a driven Brownian particle moving in a spatially periodic potential and exposed to correlated thermal noise. We show that the absolute negative mobility effect, in which the net movement of the particle is in direction opposite to the average force acting on it, may be induced by the memory of the setup. To explain the origin of this phenomenon we resort to the recently developed effective mass approach to dynamics of non-Markovian systems.</description>

      <title>Unraveling friction forces of droplets on non-wetting surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the friction forces encountered by droplets on non-wetting surfaces, specifically focusing on superhydrophobic and superheated substrates. Employing a combination of experimental techniques, including inclined plane tests and cantilever force sensor measurements, we quantify friction forces across a broad range of velocities and surface types. Our results demonstrate that friction forces vary significantly with changes in droplet velocity and surface characteristics, transitioning from contact line pinning to viscous dissipation in the bulk of the droplet. We propose a universal scaling law that accounts for contact angle hysteresis, viscous dissipation, and aerodynamic drag, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding droplet dynamics on non-wetting surfaces. These findings offer valuable insights for optimizing surface designs in fluid transport and microfluidic applications, paving the way for enhanced efficiency and innovation in these technologies.</description>

      <title>Short-time Fokker-Planck propagator beyond the Gaussian approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a perturbation approach to calculate the short-time propagator, or transition density, of the one-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation, to in principle arbitrary order in the time increment. Our approach preserves probability exactly and allows us to evaluate expectation values of analytical observables to in principle arbitrary accuracy; to showcase this, we derive perturbation expansions for the moments of the spatial increment, the finite-time Kramers-Moyal coefficients, and the mean medium entropy production rate. For an explicit multiplicative-noise system with available analytical solution, we validate all our perturbative results. Throughout, we compare our perturbative results to those obtained from the widely used Gaussian approximation of the short-time propagator; we demonstrate that this Gaussian propagator leads to errors that can be many orders of magnitude larger than those resulting from our perturbation approach. Potential applications of our results include parametrizing diffusive stochastic dynamics from observed time series, and sampling path spaces of stochastic trajectories numerically.</description>

      <title>Bifurcations of inflating balloons and interacting hysterons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10721v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While many materials exhibit a complex, hysteretic response to external driving, there has been a surge of interest in how the complex dynamics of internal materials states can be understood and designed to process and store information. We consider a system of connected rubber balloons that can be described by a Preisach model of non-interacting hysterons under pressure control, but for which the hysterons become coupled under volume control. We study this system by exploring the possible transition graphs, as well as by introducing a configuration space approach which tracks the volumes of each balloon. Changes in the transition graphs turn out to be related to changes in the topology of the configuration space of the balloons, providing a particularly geometric view of how transition graphs can be designed, as well as additional information on the existence of hidden metastable states. This class of systems is more general than just balloons.</description>

      <title>On a conjecture concerning the Fisher--Widom line and the line of vanishing excess isothermal compressibility in simple fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the statistical mechanics approach to liquid-state theory, understanding the role of the intermolecular potential in determining thermodynamic and structural properties is crucial. The Fisher--Widom (FW) line, which separates regions in the temperature vs density plane where the decay of the total correlation function is monotonic or oscillatory, provides insights into the dominance of the attractive or repulsive part of the interactions. Stopper et al. have recently conjectured [J. Chem. Phys. \textbf{151}, 014501 (2019)] that the line of vanishing excess isothermal compressibility approximates the FW line in simple fluids. Here, we investigate this conjecture using the Jagla potential and also explore the line of vanishing excess pressure. We employ theoretical approximations and Monte Carlo simulations to study one-dimensional and three-dimensional systems. While exact results for the one-dimensional case do not support the conjecture, our Monte Carlo simulations for the three-dimensional fluid validate it. Our findings not only contribute to the understanding of the relationship between the three transition lines but also provide valuable insights into the thermodynamic and structural behaviour of simple fluids.</description>
