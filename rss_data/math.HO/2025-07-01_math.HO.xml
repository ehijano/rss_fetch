      <title>The VIBE Framework: A Student-Centered Approach to Teaching Knot Theory in Secondary Mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knot theory, a visual and intuitive branch of topology, offers a unique opportunity to introduce advanced mathematical thinking in secondary education. Despite its accessibility and cross-disciplinary relevance, it remains largely absent from standard curricula. This paper proposes the {\it VIBE framework}, a student-centered approach, structured around four pedagogical pillars: Visual, Inquiry-based, Braided (collaborative), and Embedded (contextualized) learning. Rooted in constructivist theory, VIBE supports cognitive development, spatial reasoning, and mathematical engagement across diverse learners. We present a sequence of low-threshold, high-ceiling activities designed to develop core topological concepts while fostering creativity and exploration. Through qualitative heatmaps, clustering visualizations, and classroom snapshots, we demonstrate how knot theory can be transformed into a powerful medium for inquiry and interdisciplinary connection. We believe that the VIBE framework provides a structured yet adaptable approach that supports the integration of deep, meaningful mathematical experiences into secondary education.</description>

      <title>Modular versus Hierarchical: A Structural Signature of Topic Popularity in Mathematical Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mathematical researchers, especially those in early-career positions, face critical decisions about topic specialization with limited information about the collaborative environments of different research areas. The aim of this paper is to study how the popularity of a research topic is associated with the structure of that topic's collaboration network, as observed by a suite of measures capturing organizational structure at several scales. We apply these measures to 1,938 algorithmically discovered topics across 121,391 papers sourced from arXiv metadata during the period 2020--2025. Our analysis, which controls for the confounding effects of network size, reveals a structural dichotomy--we find that popular topics organize into modular "schools of thought," while niche topics maintain hierarchical core-periphery structures centered around established experts. This divide is not an artifact of scale, but represents a size-independent structural pattern correlated with popularity. We also document a "constraint reversal": after controlling for size, researchers in popular fields face greater structural constraints on collaboration opportunities, contrary to conventional expectations. Our findings suggest that topic selection is an implicit choice between two fundamentally different collaborative environments, each with distinct implications for a researcher's career. To make these structural patterns transparent to the research community, we developed the Math Research Compass (https://mathresearchcompass.com), an interactive platform providing data on topic popularity and collaboration patterns across mathematical topics.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models Don't Make Sense of Word Problems. A Scoping Review from a Mathematics Education Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT raises the question of how they can be integrated into education. One hope is that they can support mathematics learning, including word-problem solving. Since LLMs can handle textual input with ease, they appear well-suited for solving mathematical word problems. Yet their real competence, whether they can make sense of the real-world context, and the implications for classrooms remain unclear. We conducted a scoping review from a mathematics-education perspective, including three parts: a technical overview, a systematic review of word problems used in research, and a state-of-the-art empirical evaluation of LLMs on mathematical word problems. First, in the technical overview, we contrast the conceptualization of word problems and their solution processes between LLMs and students. In computer-science research this is typically labeled mathematical reasoning, a term that does not align with usage in mathematics education. Second, our literature review of 213 studies shows that the most popular word-problem corpora are dominated by s-problems, which do not require a consideration of realities of their real-world context. Finally, our evaluation of GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4.1, and o3 on 287 word problems shows that most recent LLMs solve these s-problems with near-perfect accuracy, including a perfect score on 20 problems from PISA. LLMs still showed weaknesses in tackling problems where the real-world context is problematic or non-sensical. In sum, we argue based on all three aspects that LLMs have mastered a superficial solution process but do not make sense of word problems, which potentially limits their value as instructional tools in mathematics classrooms.</description>
