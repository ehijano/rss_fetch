      <title>Logical Dependence of Physical Determinism on Set-theoretic Metatheory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Baroque questions of set-theoretic foundations are widely assumed to be irrelevant to physics. In this article, I challenge this assumption. I argue that even the fundamental physical question of whether a theory is deterministic - whether it fixes a unique future given the present - can depend on choice of set-theoretic axiom candidates over which there is deep disagreement. Suppose, as is customary, that a deterministic theory is one whose mathematical formulation yields a unique solution to its governing equations. Then the question of whether a theory is deterministic is the question of whether there exists a unique solution to its mathematical model. I argue that competing axiom candidates extending standard mathematics can diverge on all dimensions of determinism. First, they may disagree about whether a given physical system is well-posed, and so whether a solution exists. Second, even when they agree that a solution exists, they can differ on whether that solution is unique. Finally, even when they agree that a system has a solution, and agree that this solution is unique, they may still dispute what that solution is. Whether a theory is deterministic - and even which outcome it predicts - can depend on choice of set-theoretic metatheory. I indicate how the conclusions extend to discrete systems and suggest directions for future research. One upshot of the discussion is that either physical theories must be relativized to set-theoretic metatheories, in which case physics itself becomes relative, or, as Quine controversially argued, the search for new axioms to settle undecidables may admit of empirical input.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Continuum of States and Intuitionistic Flows in a Cognitive Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a rigorous mathematical framework for an abstract continuous evolution of an internal state, inspired by the intuitive notion of a flowing thought sequence. Using tools from topology, functional analysis, measure theory, and logic, we formalize an indefinitely proceeding sequence of states as a non-linear continuum with rich structure. In our development, a trajectory of states is modeled as a continuous mapping on a topological state space (a potentially infinite-dimensional Banach space) and is further conceptualized intuitionistically as a choice sequence not fixed in advance. We establish fundamental properties of these state flows, including existence and uniqueness of evolutions under certain continuity conditions (via a Banach fixed-point argument), non-measurability results (demonstrating the impossibility of assigning a classical measure to all subsets of the continuum of states), and logical semantic frameworks (defining a Tarskian truth definition for propositions about states). Throughout, we draw on ideas of Brouwer, Banach, Tarski, Poincar\'e, Hadamard, and others--blending intuitionistic perspective with classical analysis--to rigorously capture a continuous, ever-evolving process of an abstract cognitive state without resorting to category-theoretic notions.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Effective Reductions with Ordinal Turing Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In arXiv:1811.11630, we introduced a notion of effective reducibility between set-theoretical $\Pi_{2}$-statements; in arXiv:2411.19386, this was extended to statements of arbitrary (potentially even infinite) quantifier complexity. We also considered a corresponding notion of Weihrauch reducibility, which allows only one call to the effectivizer of $\psi$ in a reduction of $\phi$ to $\psi$. In this paper, we refine this notion considerably by asking how many calls to an effectivizer for $\psi$ are required for effectivizing $\phi$. This allows us make formally precise questions such as ``how many ordinals does one need to check for being cardinals in order to compute the cardinality of a given ordinal?'' and (partially) answer many of them. Many of these anwers turn out to be independent of ZFC.</description>

      <title>Derivations and gt-henselian field topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose that $K$ is a characteristic zero field with infinite transcendence degree over its prime subfield. We show that if there is a gt-henselian topology on $K$ then there are $2^{2^{|K|}}$ pairwise incomparable gt-henselian topologies on $K$. It follows by applying a recent theorem of Will Johnson that if $K$ is large and countable then there are $2^{2^{\aleph_0}}$ pairwise incomparable gt-henselian topologies on $K$. We also formulate several conjectures concerning gt-henselian field topologies and their relationship with the \'etale-open topology.</description>

      <title>Flows with minimal subdynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a countably infinite discrete group. A $\Gamma$-flow $X$ (i.e., a nonempty compact Hausdorff space equipped with a continuous action of $\Gamma$) is called $S$-minimal for a subset $S \subseteq \Gamma$ if the partial orbit $S \cdot x$ is dense for every point $x \in X$. We show that for any countable family $(S_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ of infinite subsets of $\Gamma$, there exists a free $\Gamma$-flow $X$ that is $S_n$-minimal for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$; additionally, $X$ can be taken to be a subflow of $2^\Gamma$. This vastly generalizes a result of Frisch, Seward, and Zucker, in which each $S_n$ is required to be a normal subgroup of $\Gamma$. As a corollary, we show that for a given Polish $\Gamma$-flow $X$, there exists a free $\Gamma$-flow $Y$ disjoint from $X$ in the sense of Furstenberg if and only if $X$ has no wandering points. This completes a line of inquiry started by Glasner, Tsankov, Weiss, and Zucker. As another application, we strengthen some of the results of Gao, Jackson, Krohne, and Seward on the structure of Borel complete sections. For example, we show that if $B$ is a Borel complete section in the free part of $2^\Gamma$, then every union of sufficiently many shifts of $B$ contains an orbit (previously, this was only known for open sets $B$). Although our main results are purely dynamical, their proofs rely on recently developed machinery from descriptive set-theoretic combinatorics, namely the asymptotic separation index introduced by Conley, Jackson, Marks, Seward, and Tucker-Drob and its links to the Lov\'{a}sz Local Lemma.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the modular Zilber--Pink conjecture (in Pink's formulation in terms of unlikely intersections) holds for all subvarieties $V$ of $ \mathrm{Y}(1)^n$ for which no projection to any $\dim V + 2$ coordinates is defined over the algebraic numbers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a DK-equivalence between the relative category of $\pi$-tribes and the relative category of locally cartesian closed quasicategories. From this follows one of the internal languages conjecture: Martin-L\"of type theory with dependent sums, intensional identity types, and dependent products satisfying functional extensionality is the internal language of locally cartesian closed $(\infty,1)$-categories.</description>

      <title>On the local consequence of modal Product logic: standard completeness and decidability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study modal extensions of product fuzzy logic in two settings: (i) Kripke models where the accessibility relation itself takes fuzzy values, and (ii) Kripke models with a classical (crisp) accessibility relation. In both cases, the models can be evaluated either over all product algebras or over a single product algebra. In this paper, we focus on the local consequence relation for these four types of modal product logics. We show that reasoning in these modal logics can be reduced to reasoning in propositional product logic. This reduction leads to two main results. First, these logics are standard complete: the corresponding logic defined using all product algebras coincides with the one defined using only the standard product algebra on the interval [0, 1]. Second, we show that these logics are decidable.</description>

      <title>Large cardinals, structural reflection, and the HOD Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11568v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce exacting cardinals and a strengthening of these, ultraexacting cardinals. These are natural large cardinals defined equivalently as weak forms of rank-Berkeley cardinals, strong forms of J\'onsson cardinals, or in terms of principles of structural reflection. However, they challenge commonly held intuition on strong axioms of infinity. We prove that ultraexacting cardinals are consistent with Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory with the Axiom of Choice (ZFC) relative to the existence of an I0 embedding. However, the existence of an ultraexacting cardinal below a measurable cardinal implies the consistency of ZFC with a proper class of I0 embeddings, thus challenging the linear-incremental picture of the large cardinal hierarchy. We show that the existence of an exacting cardinal implies that V is not equal to HOD (G\"odel's universe of Hereditarily Ordinal Definable sets), showing that these cardinals surpass the current hierarchy of large cardinals consistent with ZFC. We prove that the consistency of ZFC with an exacting cardinal above an extendible cardinal refutes Woodin's HOD Conjecture and Ultimate-L Conjecture. Finally, we show that the consistency of ZF with certain large cardinals beyond choice implies the consistency of ZFC with the existence of an exacting cardinal above an extendible cardinal.</description>

      <title>On the Isomorphism Relation for Omnigenous Locally Finite Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of an omnigenous locally finite group was introduced in [2] as a generalization of Hall's universal countable locally finite group. In this paper we show that the class of all countable omnigenous locally finite groups is Borel complete, hence it has the maximum Borel cardinality of isomorphism types among all countable structures.

      <title>Interpreting type theory in a quasicategory: a Yoneda approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.01967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We make use of a higher version of the Yoneda embedding to construct, from a given quasicategory, a tribe, as a subcategory of a well-behaved simplicial model category, that presents the same $(\infty,1)$-category as the former quasicategory. We then show that, when the quasicategory is locally cartesian closed, it is possible to further endow such a tribe with enough structure for it to provide a model of Martin-L\"of type theory with $\Pi$-types. This mapping procedure restricts so that elementary higher topoi yield models of homotopy type theory.</description>
