      <title>Parametric modeling of shear wave velocity profiles for the conterminous U.S</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Earthquake ground motions and the related damage can be significantly impacted by near-surface soils. Accurate predictions of seismic hazard require depth-continuous models of soil stiffness, commonly described in terms of shear-wave velocity (VS). For regional-scale studies, efforts to predict VS remotely, such as the U.S. Geological Survey's National Crustal Model, tend to emphasize deeper lithologic velocity structures, thus simplifying important near-surface soil velocity variations, and tend to be produced at relatively coarse geospatial resolution for one geographic area. In this study, we define a functional form to describe VS-with-depth across the conterminous U.S. We calibrate the parameters of the function using a national compilation of more than 9,000 in-situ geotechnical measurements. By coupling the parametric framework with geospatial machine learning, the model can be leveraged to provide consistent, high resolution VS-depth predictions of the near-surface geotechnical layer across the U.S., complementing the National Crustal Model and supporting applications such as physics-based ground motion simulations and coseismic hazard assessments.</description>

      <title>2025 EERI LFE Travel Study -- Mexico: Lessons in soft soils, subsidence, and site effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 1985 M8.1 Mexico City earthquake marked a turning point in Mexican earthquake engineering, underscoring the influence of soft soils, subsidence, and site effects on seismic performance in the Valley of Mexico. In the four decades since, both research and engineering practice have evolved significantly, shaped by subsequent events such as the 2017 M7.1 Puebla-Morelos earthquake. Integrating observations made during the Learning from Earthquakes Travel Study program and desk study findings, this paper summarizes the progression of geotechnical knowledge and practice in Mexico City, through the lessons of 1985 and 2017, through the lens of site effects, soil zonation, subsidence and emerging directions and future trends.</description>

      <title>Absorption and reflection of inertial waves by a geostrophic vortex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study interaction of inertial waves with geostrophic flow in a rapidly rotating fluid system. In accordance with experimental conditions in [1, 2], we consider inertial waves, which were excited by a source being near side boundary of the flow and enter the region where geostrophic vortex flow is present. The wave equation is derived and analyzed in the paper that describes the propagation of convergent and divergent cylindrical waves on the background of mean vortex flow, which is considered as an axisymmetric differential rotation. We show that a monochromatic wave does not exert any torque on the vortex flow in the inviscid limit until it is absorbed inside the critical layer. Among convergent waves those only are absorbed which carries angular momentum of the same sign as one's of the rotation in the vortex. Convergent waves with the opposite sign of angular momentum are just reflected from the vortex. The absorption of a wave is possible only if the vortex flow is characterized by fast enough angular velocity there. The behavior of the wave near the critical layer can be described by the well-known model where the mean flow is rectilinear shear flow. We show that the conventional wave train approximation for the short-wave limit is not applicable in the vicinity of the layer and revise it, deriving the proper equation and reformulating the conservation law of wave action. For the vicinity of critical layer, a model which accounts for the viscous dissipation is derived; viscous effects are studied for absorption both of monochromatic wave and wave train.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Extreme Learning Machine (PIELM) for Tunnelling-Induced Soil-Pile Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning has been a promising data-driven and physics-informed approach in geotechnical engineering. This study proposes a physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM) framework for analyzing tunneling-induced soil-pile interactions. The pile foundation is modeled as an Euler-Bernoulli beam, and the surrounding soil is modeled as a Pasternak foundation. The soil-pile interaction is formulated into a fourth-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) that constitutes the physics-informed component, while measured data are incorporated into PIELM as the data-driven component. Combining physics and data yields a loss vector of the extreme learning machine (ELM) network, which is trained within 1 second by the least squares method. After validating the PIELM approach by the boundary element method (BEM) and finite difference method (FDM), parametric studies are carried out to examine the effects of ELM network architecture, data monitoring locations and numbers on the performance of PIELM. The results indicate that monitored data should be placed at positions where the gradients of pile deflections are significant, such as at the pile tip/top and near tunneling zones. Two application examples highlight the critical role of physics-informed and data-driven approach for tunnelling-induced soil-pile interactions. The proposed approach shows great potential for real-time monitoring and safety assessment of pile foundations, and benefits for intelligent early-warning systems in geotechnical engineering.</description>
