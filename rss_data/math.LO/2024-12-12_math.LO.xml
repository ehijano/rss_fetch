      <title>A variety of partially conservative sentences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the existence of a $\Theta$ sentence which is simultaneously $\Gamma$-conservative over consistent RE extensions $T$ and $U$ of Peano Arithmetic for various reasonable pairs $(\Gamma, \Theta)$. As a result of this study, we prove the existence of a sentence which is essentially $\Theta$ and exactly hereditarily $\Gamma$-conservative over any single theory $T$ for various reasonable pairs $(\Gamma, \Theta)$. This is an affirmative answer to Guaspari's question.</description>

      <title>A generalization of Markov's approach to the continuity problem for Type 1 computable functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We axiomatize and generalize Markov's approach to the continuity problem for Type 1 computable functions, i.e. the problem of finding sufficient conditions on a computable topological space to obtain a theorem of the form "computable functions are (effectively) continuous". We introduce different notions of effective closure. These notions of effective closure lead to different notions of effective discontinuity at a point. We give conditions that prevent computable functions from having effective discontinuities. We finally show that results that forbid effective discontinuities can be turned into (abstract) continuity results on spaces where the closure and effective closure of semi-decidable sets naturally coincide. This happens for instance on spaces which admit a dense and computable sequence.</description>

      <title>Interpretation of Inaccessible Sets in Martin-L\"{o}f Type Theory with One Mahlo Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Martin-L\"{o}f type theory $\mathbf{MLTT}$ was extended by Setzer with the so-called Mahlo universe types. The extension of $\mathbf{MLTT}$ with one Mahlo universe is called $\mathbf{MLM}$ and was introduced to develop a variant of $\mathbf{MLTT}$ equipped with an analogue of a large cardinal. Another instance of constructive systems extended with an analogue of a large set was formulated in the context of Aczel's constructive set theory: $\mathbf{CZF}$. Rathjen, Griffor and Palmgren extended $\mathbf{CZF}$ with inaccessible sets of all transfinite orders. While Rathjen proved that this extended system of $\mathbf{CZF}$ is interpretable in an extension of $\mathbf{MLM}$ with one usual universe type above the Mahlo universe, it is unknown whether it can be interpreted by the Mahlo universe without a universe type above it. We extend $\mathbf{MLM}$ not by a universe type but by the accessibility predicate, and show that $\mathbf{CZF}$ with inaccessible sets can be interpreted in $\mathbf{MLM}$ with the accessibility predicate. Our interpretation of this extension of $\mathbf{CZF}$ is the same as that of Rathjen, Griffor and Palmgren formulated by $\mathbf{MLTT}$ with second-order universe operators, except that we construct the inaccessible sets by using the Mahlo universe and the accessibility predicate. We formalised the main part of our interpretation in the proof assistant Agda.</description>

      <title>A duality for the class of compact $T_1$-spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a contravariant adjunction between compact $T_1$-spaces and a class of distributive lattices which recomprises key portions of Stone's duality and of Isbell's duality among its instantiations. This brings us to focus on $T_1$-spaces, rather than sober spaces, and to identify points in them with minimal prime filters on some base for a $T_1$-topology (which is what Stone's duality does on the base of clopen sets of compact $0$-dimensional spaces), in spite of completely prime filters on the topology (which is what Isbell's duality does on a sober space).
  More precisely our contravariant adjunction produces a contravariant, faithful and full embedding of the category of compact $T_1$-spaces with arrows given by closed continuous map as a reflective subcategory of a category $\mathsf{SbfL} $ whose objects are the bounded distributive lattices isomorphic to some base of a $T_1$-topological space (e.g. subfits, when the lattices are frames) and whose arrows are given by (what we call) set-like-morphisms (a natural class of morphisms characterized by a first order expressible constraint).
  Furthermore this contravariant adjunction becomes a duality when one restricts on the topological side to the category of compact $T_2$-spaces with arbitrary continuous maps, and on the lattice-theoretic side to the category of compact, complete, and normal lattices.
  A nice by-product of the above results is a lattice-theoretic reformulation of the Stone-\v{C}ech compactification theorem which we have not been able to trace elsewhere in the literature.</description>
