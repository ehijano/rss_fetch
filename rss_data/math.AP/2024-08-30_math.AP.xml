      <title>Deformations of acid-mediated invasive tumors in a model with Allee effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a Gatenby--Gawlinski-type model of invasive tumors in the presence of an Allee effect. We describe the construction of bistable one-dimensional traveling fronts using singular perturbation techniques in different parameter regimes corresponding to tumor interfaces with, or without, acellular gap. By extending the front as a planar interface, we perform a stability analysis to long wavelength perturbations transverse to the direction of front propagation and derive a simple stability criterion for the front in two spatial dimensions. In particular we find that in general the presence of the acellular gap indicates transversal instability of the associated planar front, which can lead to complex interfacial dynamics such as the development of finger-like protrusions and/or different invasion speeds.</description>

      <title>Global boundedness and blow-up in a repulsive chemotaxis-consumption system in higher dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the repulsive chemotaxis-consumption model \begin{align*} \partial_t u &amp;= \nabla \cdot (D(u) \nabla u) + \nabla \cdot (u \nabla v), \\ 0 &amp;= \Delta v - uv \end{align*} in an $n$-dimensional ball, $n \ge 3$, where the diffusion coefficient $D$ is an appropriate extension of the function $0\le\xi\mapsto(1+\xi)^{m-1}$ for some $m&gt;0$. Under the boundary conditions \begin{equation*} \nu \cdot (D(u) \nabla u + u \nabla v) = 0 \quad\text{ and }\quad v = M&gt;0,\end{equation*} we first demonstrate that for $m &gt; 1$, or $m = 1$ with $0 &lt; M &lt; 2/(n-2)$, the system admits globally defined classical solutions that are uniformly bounded in time for any choice of sufficiently smooth radial initial data. This result is further extended to the case $0&lt;m&lt;1$ when $M$ is chosen to be sufficiently small, depending on the initial conditions. In contrast, it is shown that for $0 &lt; m &lt; \frac{2}{n}$, the system exhibits blow-up behavior for sufficiently large $M$.</description>

      <title>On the intertwining map between Coulomb and hyperbolic scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a unitary operator between Hilbert spaces of generalized eigenfunctions of Coulomb operators and the Laplace-Beltrami operator of hyperbolic space that intertwines their respective Poisson operators on $L^2(\mathbb{S}^{d-1})$. The constructed operator generalizes Fock's unitary transformation, originally defined between the discrete spectra of the attractive Coulomb operator and the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the sphere, to the setting of continuous spectra. Among other connections, this map explains why the scattering matrices are the same in these two different settings, and it also provides an explicit formula for the Poisson operator of the Coulomb Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Conformal metrics on the four-dimensional half sphere with symmetric $Q$ and $T$ curvatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of prescribing non-constant $Q$ and boundary $T$ curvatures on the upper hemisphere $\mathbb{S}^4_+\subset \mathbb{R}^5$, via a conformal change of the background metric. This is equivalent to solve a fourth-order non-linear elliptic boundary value problem with a third-order non-linear equation and homogeneous Neumann conditions at the boundary. The problem admits a Mean-field type variational formulation, similar to the one obtained by Cruz-Bl\'azquez and Ruiz for a related problem in two dimensions, with the associated energy functional being bounded from below but, in general, not coercive. By imposing symmetry conditions, we are able to prove the existence of minimizers, especially when $Q,T\geq 0$. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first existence results obtained for this setting.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic relaxation of the chemical potential in the viscous Cahn-Hilliard equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a hyperbolic relaxation of the viscous Cahn--Hilliard system with zero Neumann boundary conditions. In fact, we consider a relaxation term involving the second time derivative of the chemical potential in the first equation of the system. We develop a well-posedness, continuous dependence and regularity theory for the initial-boundary value problem. Moreover, we investigate the asymptotic behavior of the system as the relaxation parameter tends to 0 and prove the convergence to the viscous Cahn--Hilliard system.</description>

      <title>Steady Compressible 3D Euler Flows in Toroidal Volumes without Continuous Euclidean Isometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of smooth three-dimensional vector fields where the cross product between the vector field and its curl is balanced by the gradient of a smooth function, with toroidal level sets that are not invariant under continuous Euclidean isometries. This finding indicates the existence of steady compressible Euler flows, either influenced by an external potential energy or maintained by a density source in the continuity equation, that are foliated by asymmetric nested toroidal surfaces. Our analysis suggests that the primary obstacle in resolving Grad's conjecture regarding the existence of nontrivial magnetohydrodynamic equilibria arises from the incompressibility constraint imposed on the magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Improved well-posedness for quasilinear and sharp local well-posedness for semilinear KP-I equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show new well-posedness results in anisotropic Sobolev spaces for dispersion-generalized KP-I equations with increased dispersion compared to the KP-I equation. We obtain the sharp dispersion rate, below which generalized KP-I equations on $\mathbb{R}^2$ and on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{T}$ exhibit quasilinear behavior. In the quasilinear regime, we show improved well-posedness results relying on short-time Fourier restriction. In the semilinear regime, we show sharp well-posedness with analytic data-to-solution mapping. On $\mathbb{R}^2$ we cover the full subcritical range, whereas on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{T}$ the sharp well-posedness is strictly subcritical. Nonlinear Loomis-Whitney inequalities are one ingredient. These are presently proved for Borel measures with growth condition reflecting the different geometries of the plane $\mathbb{R}^2$, the cylinder $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{T}$, and the torus $\mathbb{T}^2$. Finally, we point out that on tori $\mathbb{T}^2_\gamma$, KP-I equations are never semilinear.</description>

      <title>Large time asymptotic behavior for the dissipative Timoshenko system and its application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study large time behavior for the dissipative Timoshenko system in the whole space $\mathbb{R}$, particularly, on the transversal displacement $w$ and the rotation angle $\psi$ of the filament for the beam. Different from decay properties of the energy term derived by Ide-Haramoto-Kawashima (2008), we discover new optimal growth $L^2$ estimates for the solutions themselves. Under the non-trivial mean condition on the initial data $w_1$, the unknowns $w$ and $\psi$ grow polynomially with the optimal rates $t^{3/4}$ and $t^{1/4}$, respectively, as large time. Furthermore, asymptotic profiles of them are introduced by the diffusion plate function, which explains a hidden cancellation mechanism in the shear stress $\partial_x w-\psi$. As an application of our results, we study the semilinear dissipative Timoshenko system with a power nonlinearity. Precisely, if the power is greater than the Fujita exponent, then the global in time existence of Sobolev solution is proved for the case of equal wave speeds, which partly gives a positive answer to the open problem in Racke-Said-Houari (2013).</description>

      <title>Nontrivial solutions for a generalized poly-Laplacian system on finite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the existence and multiplicity of solutions for a class of generalized coupled system involving poly-Laplacian and a parameter $\lambda$ on finite graphs. By using mountain pass lemma together with cut-off technique, we obtain that system has at least a nontrivial weak solution $(u_{\lambda},v_{\lambda})$ for every large parameter $\lambda$ when the nonlinear term $F(x,u,v)$ satisfies superlinear growth conditions only in a neighborhood of origin point $(0,0)$. We also obtain a concrete form for the lower bound of parameter $\lambda$ and the trend of $(u_{\lambda},v_{\lambda})$ with the change of parameter $\lambda$. Moreover, by using a revised Clark's theorem together with cut-off technique, we obtain that system has a sequence of solutions tending to 0 for every $\lambda&gt;0$ when the nonlinear term $F(x,u,v)$ satisfies sublinear growth conditions only in a neighborhood of origin point $(0,0)$.</description>

      <title>Quantum-classical correspondence and obstruction to dispersion on the Engel group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop the semiclassical analysis of the lowest dimensional simply connected nilpotent Lie group of step 3, called the Engel group and denoted by ${\mathbb E}$, in the continuity of the works for groups of step 2 realized and exhibiting new features specific to groups of higher step. We are interested in the propagation of the semiclassical measures associated to solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation for the canonical subLaplacian $\Delta_{\mathbb E}$ and at different time-scales $\tau$. In particular, for $\tau=1$ we recover a quantum-classical correspondence where we observe the fundamental role of abnormal extremal lifts of the Engel group and are able to discuss the speed of the propagation of the singularities. Furthermore, in order to understand the dispersive nature of the subLaplcian, we are led to develop a second-microlocal analysis on particular cones in our phase space. This is done by relating the quasi-contact structure of the group ${\mathbb E}$ to its semiclassical analysis via harmonic analysis. As a consequence, we are able to prove obstruction to local smoothness-type estimates and Strichartz estimates for the Engel subLaplacian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the Riemannian version of a classical Euclidean result: every level set of the capacitary potential of a starshaped ring is starshaped. In the Riemannian setting, we restrict ourselves to starshaped rings in a warped product of an open interval and the unit sphere. We also extend the result by replacing the Laplacian with the $q$-Laplacian.</description>

      <title>Nonrelativistic limit of Chandrasekhar Variational Model for Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the nonrelativistic limit of Chandrasekhar variational model for neutron stars. We show that the minimizer $\rho_{c}$ of Chandrasekhar energy $E_c(N)$ converges strongly to the minimizer $\rho_{\infty}$ of limit energy $E_{\infty}(N)$ in $L^1\cap L^{\frac{5}{3}}(\mathbb{R}^3)$ as the speed of light $c\rightarrow\infty$, this is a limit between two free boundary problems. We develop a novel approach to obtain the convergence rates. For the radius $R_c$ of the compact support of $\rho_c(x)$ and the radius $R_\infty$ of the compact support of $\rho_\infty(x)$, we prove that $|R_c-R_\infty|\leq O(\frac{1}{c^2})$ as $c\rightarrow\infty$. Moreover, we show that the $L^\infty$-convergence rate of $|\rho_c-\rho_\infty|$ is not bigger than $O(\frac{1}{c^3})$ in the corner layer $B(R_\infty +\frac{K_1}{c^2})\setminus B(R_\infty -\frac{K_1}{c^2})\, (K_1&gt;0)$, while $L^\infty$-convergence rate of $|\rho_c-\rho_\infty|$ is not bigger than $O(\frac{1}{c^2})$ inside the corner layer $B(R_\infty -\frac{K_1}{c^2})$ for $N$ large enough.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness and long-time behavior for self-consistent Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equations with general potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the well-posedness, steady states and long time behavior of solutions to Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation with external confinement potential and nonlinear self-consistent interactions. Our analysis introduces newly characterized conditions on the interaction kernel that ensure the local asymptotic stability of the unique steady state. Compared to previous works on this topic, our results allow for large, singular and non-symmetric interactions. As a corollary of our main results, we show exponential decay of solutions to the Vlasov-Poisson-Fokker-Planck equation in dimension $3$, for low regularity initial data. In the repulsive case, the result holds in strongly nonlinear regimes (\emph{i.e.} for arbitrarily small Debye length). Our techniques rely on the design of new Lyapunov functionals based on hypocoercivity and hypoellipticity theories. We use norms which include part of the interaction kernel, and carefully mix ``macroscopic quantities based''--hypocoercivity with ``commutators based''--hypocoercivity.</description>

      <title>Fabes-Stroock approach to higher integrability of Green's functions with $L_d$ drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the higher integrability of Green's functions associated with the second-order elliptic equation $a^{ij}D_{ij}u + b^i D_iu = f$ in a bounded domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$, and establish a version of Aleksandrov's maximum principle. In particular, we consider the drift term $b=(b^1, \ldots, b^d)$ in $L_d$ and the source term $f \in L_p$ for some $p &lt; d$. This provides an alternative and analytic proof of a result by N. V. Krylov (2021) concerning $L_d$ drifts. The key step involves deriving a Gehring type inequality for Green's functions by using the Fabes-Stroock approach (1984).</description>

      <title>Regularity of vector fields with piecewise regular curl and divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove piecewise Sobolev regularity of vector fields that have piecewise regular curl and divergence, but may fail to be globally continuous. The main idea behind our approach is to employ recently developed parametrices for the curl-operator and the regularity theory of Poisson transmission problems. We conclude our work by applying our findings to the heterogeneous time-harmonic Maxwell equations with either a) impedance, b) natural or c) essential boundary conditions and providing wavenumber-explicit piecewise regularity estimates for these equations.</description>

      <title>Desingularization of time-periodic vortex motion in bounded domains via KAM tools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the Euler equations within a simply-connected bounded domain. The dynamics of a single point vortex are governed by a Hamiltonian system, with most of its energy levels corresponding to time-periodic motion. We show that for the single point vortex, under certain non-degeneracy conditions, it is possible to desingularize most of these trajectories into time-periodic concentrated vortex patches. We provide concrete examples of these non-degeneracy conditions, which are satisfied by a broad class of domains, including convex ones. The proof uses Nash-Moser scheme and KAM techniques, in the spirit of the recent work of Hassainia-Hmidi-Masmoudi on the leapfrogging motion, combined with complex geometry tools. Additionally, we employ a vortex duplication mechanism to generate synchronized time-periodic motion of multiple vortices. This approach can be, for instance, applied to desingularize the motion of two symmetric dipoles (with four vortices) in a disc or a rectangle. To our knowledge, this is the first result showing the existence of non-rigid time-periodic motion for Euler equations in generic simply-connected bounded domain. This answers an open problem that has been pointed in the literature, for example by Bartsch-Sacchet.</description>

      <title>Existence and stability for the travelling waves of the Benjamin equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the seminal work of Benjamin,\cite{Ben} in the late 70's, he has derived the ubiquitous Benjamin model, which is a reduced model in the theory of water waves. Notably, it contains two parameters in its dispersion part and under some special circumstances, it turns into the celebrated KdV or the Benjamin-Ono equation, During the90's, there was renewed interest in it. Benjamin, \cite{Ben1}, \cite{Ben2} studied the problem for existence of solitary waves, followed by works of Bona-Chen, \cite{BC}, Albert-Bona-Restrepo, \cite{ABR}, Pava, \cite{Pava1}, who have showed the existence of travelling waves, mostly by variational, but also bifurcation methods. Some results about the stability became available, but unfortunately, those were restricted to either small waves or Benjamin model, close to a distinguished (i.e. KdV or BO) limit. Quite recently, in \cite{ADM}, Abdallah, Darwich and Molinet, proved existence, orbital stability and uniqueness results for these waves, but only for large values of $\f{c}{\ga^2}&gt;&gt;1$.
  In this article, we present an alternative constrained maximization procedure for the construction of these waves, for the full range of the parameters, which allows us to ascertain their spectral stability. Moreover, we extend this construction to all $L^2$ subcritical cases (i.e. power nonlinearities $(|u|^{p-2}u)_x$, $2&lt;p\leq 6$). Finally, we propose a different procedure, based on a specific form of the Sobolev embedding inequality, which works for all powers $2&lt;p&lt;\infty$, but produces some unstable waves, for large $p$. Some open questions and a conjecture regarding this last result are proposed for further investigation.</description>

      <title>Porous medium type reaction-diffusion equation: large time behaviors and regularity of free boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Cauchy problem of the porous medium type reaction-diffusion equation \begin{equation*} \partial_t\rho=\Delta\rho^m+\rho g(\rho),\quad (x,t)\in \mathbb{R}^n\times \mathbb{R}_+,\quad n\geq2,\quad m&gt;1, \end{equation*} where $g$ is the given monotonic decreasing function with the density critical threshold $\rho_M&gt;0$ satisfying $g(\rho_M)=0$. We prove that the pressure $P:=\frac{m}{m-1}\rho^{m-1}$ in $L_{loc}^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ tends to the pressure critical threshold $P_M:=\frac{m}{m-1}(\rho_M)^{m-1}$ at the time decay rate $(1+t)^{-1}$. If the initial density $\rho(x,0)$ is compactly supported, we justify that the support $\{x: \rho(x,t)&gt;0\}$ of the density $\rho$ expands exponentially in time. Furthermore, we show that there exists a time $T_0&gt;0$ such that the pressure $P$ is Lipschitz continuous for $t&gt;T_0$, which is the optimal (sharp) regularity of the pressure, and the free surface $\partial \{(x,t): \rho(x,t)&gt;0\}\cap \{t&gt;T_0\}$ is locally Lipschitz continuous. In addition, under the same initial assumptions of compact support, we verify that the free boundary $\partial \{(x,t): \rho(x,t)&gt;0\}\cap \{t&gt;T_0\}$ is a local $C^{1,\alpha}$ surface.</description>

      <title>Beltrami fields, dispersive electromagnetic waves and gravitational spheromaks from chiral anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note we focus on the backreaction effects due to the chiral anomaly. The chiral anomaly gives rise to certain modifications in the conserved currents. In the case of the Maxwell gauge fields there appears a new contribution to the electric current proportional to the background magnetic field. This phenomenon is known as the chiral magnetic effect and it is widely discussed in the current literature. In the case of the gravitational field, the anomaly, as we show here, induces a new contribution to the stress-energy tensor. We analyze the possible manifestations of these modifications in the gravitational field and in hydrodynamics in the chiral media. We also make some comments regarding the backreaction effects in the electrodynamics in the chiral media. In each of these directions we observe the systematical appearance of the Beltrami type fields. In electrodynamics or in hydrodynamics the Beltrami field (e.g., magnetic field or fluid velocity) is a vector that is parallel to its own curl. We suggest a generalization of the Beltrami fields for the tensorial gravitational perturbations. The respective solutions to the gravitational equations we call gravitational spheromaks by analogy with a similar phenomenon in electrodynamics. In the modified hydrodynamics in the chiral media the vorticity is asymptotically a Beltrami vector field in a generalized Gromeka-Beltrami flow.</description>

      <title>The Riesz $\alpha$-energy of log-concave functions and related Minkowski problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the first order variation of the Riesz $\alpha$-energy of a log-concave function $f$ with respect to the Asplund sum. Such a variational formula induces the Riesz $\alpha$-energy measure of log-concave function $f$, which will be denoted by $\mathfrak{R}_{\alpha}(f, \cdot)$. We pose the related Riesz $\alpha$-energy Minkowski problem aiming to find necessary and/or sufficient conditions on a pregiven Borel measure $\mu$ defined on $\Rn$ so that $\mu=\mathfrak{R}_{\alpha}(f,\cdot)$ for some log-concave function $f$. Assuming enough smoothness, the Riesz $\alpha$-energy Minkowski problem reduces to a new Monge-Amp\`{e}re type equation involving the Riesz $\alpha$-potential. Moreover, this new Minkowski problem can be viewed as a functional counterpart of the recent Minkowski problem for the chord measures in integral geometry posed by Lutwak, Xi, Yang and Zhang (Comm.\ Pure\ Appl.\ Math.,\ 2024). The Riesz $\alpha$-energy Minkowski problem will be solved under certain mild conditions on $\mu$.</description>

      <title>A collision-oriented interacting particle system for Landau-type equations and the molecular chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a collision-oriented particle system to approximate a class of Landau-type equations. This particle system is formally derived from a particle system with random collisions in the grazing regime, and happens to be a special random batch system with random interaction in the diffusion coefficient. The difference from usual random batch systems with random interaction in the drift is that the batch size has to be $p=2$. We then analyze the convergence rate of the proposed particle system to the Landau-type equations using the tool of relative entropy, assuming that the interaction kernels are regular enough. A key aspect of our approach is the gradient estimates of logarithmic densities, applied to both the Landau-type equations and the particle systems. Compared to existing particle systems for the approximation of Landau-type equations, our proposed system not only offers a more intrinsic reflection of the underlying physics but also reduces the computational cost to $O(N)$ per time step when implemented numerically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.09582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of stability for non-autonomous Hamiltonian flows on two-dimensional annular surfaces. This notion of stability is designed to capture the sustained twisting of particle trajectories. The main Theorem is applied to establish a number of results that reveal a form of irreversibility in the Euler equations governing the motion of an incompressible and inviscid fluid. In particular, we show that nearby general stable steady states (i) all fluid flows exhibit indefinite twisting (ii) vorticity generically exhibits gradient growth and wandering. We also give examples of infinite time gradient growth for smooth solutions to the SQG equation and of smooth vortex patches that entangle and develop unbounded perimeter in infinite time.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study pointwise estimates for linear and multilinear pseudo-differential operators with exotic symbols in terms of the Fefferman-Stein sharp maximal function and Hardy-Littlewood type maximal function. Especially in the multilinear case, we use a multi-sublinear variant of the classical Hardy-Littlewood maximal function introduced by Lerner, Ombrosi, P\'erez, Torres, and Trujillo-Gonz\'alez, which provides more elaborate and natural weighted estimates in the multilinear setting.</description>

      <title>Singularities of the hyperbolic elastic flow: Convergence, quantization and blow-ups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the elastic flow of closed curves and of open curves with clamped boundary conditions in the hyperbolic plane. While global existence and convergence toward critical points for initial data with sufficiently small energy is already known, this study pioneers an investigation into the flow's singular behavior. We prove a convergence theorem without assuming smallness of the initial energy, coupled with a quantification of potential singularities: Each singularity carries an energy cost of at least 8. Moreover, the blow-ups of the singularities are explicitly classified. A further contribution is an explicit understanding of the singular limit of the elastic flow of $\lambda$-figure-eights, a class of curves that previously served in showing sharpness of the energy threshold 16 for the smooth convergence of the elastic flow of closed curves.</description>

      <title>Rigid Lid limit in shallow water over a flat bottom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09605v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform the so-called rigid lid limit on different shallow water models such as the abcd Bousssinesq systems or the Green-Naghdi equations. To do so we consider an appropriate nondimensionalization of these models where two small parameters are involved: the shallowness parameter $\mu$ and a parameter $\epsilon$ which can be interpreted as a Froude number. When parameter $\epsilon$ tends to zero, the surface deformation formally goes to the rest state, hence the name rigid lid limit. We carefully study this limit for different topologies. We also provide rates of convergence with respect to $\epsilon$ and a careful attention is given to the dependence on theshallowness parameter $\mu$.</description>

      <title>Local convergence rates for Wasserstein gradient flows and McKean-Vlasov equations with multiple stationary solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15725v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-linear versions of log-Sobolev inequalities, that link a free energy to its dissipation along the corresponding Wasserstein gradient flow (i.e. corresponds to Polyak-Lojasiewicz inequalities in this context), are known to provide global exponential long-time convergence to the free energy minimizers, and have been shown to hold in various contexts. However they cannot hold when the free energy admits critical points which are not global minimizers, which is for instance the case of the granular media equation in a double-well potential with quadratic attractive interaction at low temperature. This work addresses such cases, extending the general arguments when a log-Sobolev inequality only holds locally and, as an example, establishing such local inequalities for the granular media equation with quadratic interaction either in the one-dimensional symmetric double-well case or in higher dimension in the low temperature regime. The method provides quantitative convergence rates for initial conditions in a Wasserstein ball around the stationary solutions. The same analysis is carried out for the kinetic counterpart of the gradient flow, i.e. the corresponding Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation. The local exponential convergence to stationary solutions for the mean-field equations, both elliptic and kinetic, is shown to induce for the corresponding particle systems a fast (i.e. uniform in the number or particles) decay of the particle system free energy toward the level of the non-linear limit.</description>

Abstract: We prove optimal Lipschitz regularity of solutions to Poisson's equation with measure data supported on a $C^{1,\operatorname{Dini}}$ interface and with $C^{0,\operatorname{Dini}}$ density. We achieve this by deriving pointwise gradient estimates on the interface, further showing the piecewise differentiability of solutions up to this surface. Our approach relies on perturbation arguments and estimates for the Green's function of the Laplacian. Additionally, we provide sharp counterexamples highlighting the minimality of our assumptions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20191v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The forward acoustic scattering problem is to find $u=u^f(x,t)$ satisfying \begin{align*} &amp;u_{tt}-\Delta u+qu=0, &amp;&amp; (x,t) \in {\mathbb R}^3 \times (-\infty,\infty); \\ &amp;u \mid_{|x|&lt;-t} =0 , &amp;&amp; t&lt;0;\\ &amp;\lim_{s \to -\infty} s\,u((-s+\tau)\,\omega,s)=f(\tau,\omega), &amp;&amp; (\tau,\omega) \in \Sigma:=[0,\infty)\times S^2; \end{align*} for a real valued compactly supported potential $q=q(x)$ and a control $f \in L_2(\Sigma)$. The map $R: L_2(\Sigma)\to L_2(\Sigma)$, \begin{align*} &amp; (Rf)(\tau ,\omega )\,:= \lim_{s \to +\infty} s\, u^f((s+\tau )\,\omega ,s), \quad (\tau ,\omega ) \in \Sigma \end{align*} is a response operator.
  The inverse problem is to determine $q$ from $R$. It is solved by a relevant version of the boundary control method. The procedure that recovers the potential is local: for any fixed $\xi&gt;0$, given $R\upharpoonright\{f\in L_2(\Sigma)\,|\,\,f\mid_{0\leqslant \tau&lt;\xi}=0\}$ it determines $q\big|_{|x|\geqslant\xi}$.</description>

Abstract: The spatial dimensions 1 and 4 play an exceptional role for radial solutions of the pressureless repulsive Euler-Poisson equations. Namely, for any spatial dimension except 1 and 4, any nontrivial solution of the Cauchy problem blows up in a finite time (except in special cases), whereas for dimensions 1 and 4 there exists a neighborhood of trivial initial data in the $C^1$ - norm such that the respective solution preserves the initial smoothness globally. For dimension 1, the criterion of the singularity formation in terms of initial data was known, i.e. this neighborhood can be found exactly.
  For the case of dimension 4, there was no similar result. In this paper, we close this gap and obtain such a criterion for the case of a more technically complicated case of dimension 4.</description>

      <title>An Integral Approach to Prescribing Scalar Curvature Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an integral approach to obtain interior a priori $C^{1,1}$ estimates for convex solutions of prescribing scalar curvature equations $\sigma_2(\kappa) = f(x)$ as well as the Hessian equations $\sigma_2(D^2u) = f(x)$. This new approach can deal with the case when $f$ is of weaker regularity. As a result, we prove that the $C^{1,1}$ modules of the solutions depend only on the Lipschitz modules of $f(x)$, instead of the $\|f\|_{C^k}$ for some $k\geq 2$ in all the papers we have known up to now.</description>

      <title>On a Fujita critical time-fractional semilinear heat equation in the uniformly local weak Zygmund type space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive sufficient conditions on initial data for the local-in-time solvability of a time-fractional semilinear heat equation with the Fujita exponent in a uniformly local weak Zygmund type space. It is known that the time-fractional problem with the Fujita exponent in the scale critical space $L^1(\mathbb{R}^N)$ exhibits the local-in-time solvability in contrast to the unsolvability of the Fujita critical classical semilinear heat equation. Our new sufficient conditions take into account the fine structure of singularities of the initial data, in order to show a natural correspondance between the time-fractional and the classical case for the local-in-time solvability. We also apply our arguments to life span estimates for some typical initial data.</description>

      <title>Exponential stability of a free boundary problem with spherical symmetry for a gas bubble immersed in a bounded incompressible liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is mainly concerned with the free boundary problem for an approximate model (for example, arising from the study of sonoluminescence) of a gas bubble of finite mass enclosed within a bounded incompressible viscous liquid, accounting for surface tensions at both the gas-liquid interface and the external free surface of the entire gas-liquid region. It is found that any regular spherically symmetric steady-state solution is characterized by a positive root of a ninth-degree polynomial for which the existence and uniqueness are proved and a one-to-one correspondence between equilibria and pairs of gas mass and liquid volume is established. We prove that these equilibria exhibit nonlinear and exponential asymptotic stability under small perturbations that conserve gas mass and liquid volume, and an equilibrium solution acts as a local minimizer of the energy functional, even under relatively large perturbations, with the proportionality constant determined by the adiabatic constant. Moreover, we construct a global center manifold to apply the center manifold theory. Our results apply to gases and liquids of all sizes. Furthermore, we derive the optimal exponential decay rate for small liquid volumes by analyzing the spectrum bounds of the associated linear operator and show that decreasing the gas mass or increasing the temperature can accelerate the convergence rate, a behavior not seen in unbounded liquid scenarios.</description>

      <title>A priori bounds for geodesic diameter. Part III. A Sobolev-Poincar\'e inequality and applications to a variety of geometric variational problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.05504</link>
      <description>arXiv:1709.05504v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on a novel type of Sobolev-Poincar\'e inequality (for generalised weakly differentiable functions on varifolds), we establish a finite upper bound of the geodesic diameter of generalised compact connected surfaces-with-boundary of arbitrary dimension in Euclidean space in terms of the mean curvatures of the surface and its boundary. Our varifold setting includes smooth immersions, surfaces with finite Willmore energy, two-convex hypersurfaces in level-set mean curvature flow, integral currents with prescribed mean curvature vector, area minimising integral chains with coefficients in a complete normed commutative group, varifold solutions to Plateau's problem furnished by min-max methods or by Brakke flow, and compact sets solving Plateau problems based on \v{C}ech homology. Due to the generally inevitable presence of singularities, path-connectedness was previously known neither for the class of varifolds (even in the absence of boundary) nor for the solutions to the Plateau problems considered.</description>

      <title>Effective Dynamics of Translationally Invariant Magnetic Schr\"odinger Equations in the High Field Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.07894v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the large field limit in Schr\"odinger equations with magnetic vector potentials describing translationally invariant $B$-fields with respect to the $z$-axis. In a first step, using regular perturbation theory, we derive an approximate description of the solution, provided the initial data is compactly supported in the Fourier-variable dual to $z\in \mathbb R$. The effective dynamics is thereby seen to produce high-frequency oscillations and large magnetic drifts. In a second step we show, by using the theory of almost invariant subspaces, that this asymptotic description is stable under polynomially bounded perturbations that vanish in the vicinity of the origin.</description>
