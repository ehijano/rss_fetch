      <title>Atomic clock frequency ratios with fractional uncertainty $\leq 3.2 \times 10^{-18}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report high-precision frequency ratio measurements between optical atomic clocks based on $^{27}$Al$^+$, $^{171}$Yb, and $^{87}$Sr. With total fractional uncertainties at or below $3.2 \times 10^{-18}$, these measurements meet an important milestone criterion for redefinition of the second in the International System of Units. Discrepancies in $^{87}$Sr ratios at approximately $1\times10^{-16}$ and the Al$^+$/Yb ratio at $1.6\times10^{-17}$ in fractional units compared to our previous measurements underscore the importance of repeated, high-precision comparisons by different laboratories. A key innovation in this work is the use of a common ultrastable reference delivered to all clocks via a 3.6 km phase-stabilized fiber link between two institutions. Derived from a cryogenic single-crystal silicon cavity, this reference improves comparison stability by a factor of 2 to 3 over previous systems, with an optical lattice clock ratio achieving a fractional instability of $1.3 \times 10^{-16}$ at 1 second. By enabling faster comparisons, this stability will improve sensitivity to non-white noise processes and other underlying limits of state-of-the-art optical frequency standards.</description>

      <title>Low-SWaP Magneto-optical Trap using both Planar Optical and Magnetic Components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compact, lightweight, and energy-efficient cold atom systems are crucial for advancing quantum technologies, yet their realization remains constrained by the bulky optical and magnetic components required in current atom trapping architectures. Here, we demonstrate a low-SWaP magneto-optical trap that seamlessly integrates planar optical and magnetic components into a unified platform. A monolithic dual-functional metasurface simultaneously polarized and shapes the cooling beam, replacing traditional lens-waveplate assemblies and converting a linearly polarized Gaussian beam into a circularly polarized flat-top beam. In parallel, a planar coil chip substitutes bulky anti-Helmholtz cols and generated the required quadrupole magnetic field with drastically reduced power consumption. Under D2 line cooling of 87Rb atoms, the fully planar system delivers nearly an order-of-magnitude improvement in trapping performance while operating at a fraction of the size, weight, and power of traditional systems. This compact, bulky-component-free approach offers a scalable, energy-efficient pathway toward chip-scale cold atom platforms.</description>

      <title>Towards an understanding of dipole-dipole interactions in nonlocal media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We commence our study with review of dispersion interactions in electrolytes. We then reflect on how background media change atom-atom excited-state systems. To highlight the impact of nonlocal media, such as salt solutions, we predict that a new contribution to the resonance interaction energy emerges in a form $\propto e^{-\kappa_{\rm D} \rho}/\rho$. Here $\kappa_{\rm D}$ is the Debye length and $\rho$ is the distance between the atoms. This contribution vanishes at zero temperature, where a new term proportional to $1/\rho^4$ (similar to free space) occurs. This new term is dampened by the electrolyte at large distances, causing it to decrease much faster, proportional to $1/\rho^7$. The long-range electrolyte-induced resonance interaction at finite temperature may, in addition to the dominating van der Waals attraction (which goes as $1/\rho^6$), take part in the molecular formation of biological fluids.</description>

      <title>A general approximator for strong-field ionization rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03996v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the long-standing problem of determining accurate, time-resolved ionization rates for atoms in strong laser fields, a quantity that is fundamental to attosecond science. We show that it is possible to retrieve sub-optical-cycle dynamics of strong-field ionization from ionization probabilities obtained for a set of few-cycle laser pulses that covers a sufficiently broad parameter space. To this end, we introduce the General Approximator for Strong-Field Ionization Rates (GASFIR), a retrieval tool that uses a few adjustable parameters to accurately reconstruct ab initio data. By imposing only essential physical constraints, our model provides a versatile framework for time-domain investigations of strong-field ionization and the role of ionization dynamics in attosecond metrology and lightwave electronics.</description>

      <title>Theoretical evaluation of decay mode of $ {}^{229m} \mathrm{Th} $ in solid samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The excitation energy of $ {}^{229m} \mathrm{Th} $ is extremely low at $ 8.4 \, \mathrm{eV} $; thus, this isotope exhibits changes in its decay modes depending on the chemical state, specifically the outermost electronic states. However, the reported half-lives of the $ \gamma $-ray transition are not consistent among the previous experiments. In this study, we investigate the chemical states of $ {}^{229m} \mathrm{Th} $ by density functional theory calculations. Based on these results, we evaluate the relationship between the experimental half-life of each sample and the electronic state of $ \mathrm{Th} $. The calculation results indicate that ion trap method, $ \mathrm{Ca} \mathrm{F}_2 $ model and $ \mathrm{Mg} \mathrm{F}_2 $ one decay only via the $ \gamma $-ray transition, whereas $ \mathrm{Li} \mathrm{Sr} \mathrm{Al} \mathrm{F}_6 $ one decays via the $ \gamma $-ray transition and has a possibility of decay via internal conversion and electron bridge.</description>

      <title>Bound and Resonant States of Muonic Few-Body Coulomb Systems: Extended Stochastic Variational Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the bound and resonant states of hydrogen-like muonic ions ($\mu\mu p$, $\mu\mu d$, $\mu\mu t$) and three-body muonic molecular ions ($pp\mu$, $pd\mu$, $pt\mu$, $dd\mu$, $dt\mu$, $tt\mu$), and the four-body double-muonic hydrogen molecule ($\mu\mu pp$) using an extended stochastic variational method combined with complex scaling. The approach provides a unified treatment of bound and quasibound states and achieves an energy accuracy better than $0.1~\mathrm{eV}$ across all systems studied. Complete spectra below the corresponding $n=2$ atomic thresholds are obtained, including several previously unresolved shallow resonances in both three- and four-body sectors.</description>

      <title>Structure of the mean-field yrast spectrum of a two-component Bose gas in a ring: role of interaction asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mean-field yrast spectrum of an SU(2)-symmetric two-component Bose gas confined to a ring geometry is known to exhibit an intricate nonanalytic structure that is absent in single-component systems. In particular, due to the interplay between the species concentration and the atomic interactions, a sequence of plane-wave states can emerge as yrast states at fractional values of the angular momentum per particle. This behavior stands in sharp contrast to the single-component case, where plane-wave states occur only at integer angular momenta. In this paper, we investigate how the structure of the yrast spectrum in a two-component Bose gas is modified by interaction asymmetry. By numerically solving the coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations for propagating soliton states, we compute the mean-field yrast spectrum and, in particular, determine the critical curves associated with the emergence of various plane-wave yrast states. We find that both the behavior of these critical curves and the mechanisms by which plane-wave yrast states arise depend sensitively on the relative strengths of the inter- and intra-component interactions. When the inter-component interaction is weaker, the plane-wave yrast states replace soliton states through a continuous evolution, as in the SU(2)-symmetric case, although the conditions for their existence become more restrictive. In contrast, when the inter-component interaction is stronger, plane-wave yrast states emerge by overtaking soliton states via branch crossings, and their stability is significantly enhanced. Our results have important implications for the existence and stability of persistent currents in asymmetric, two-component Bose gases.</description>
