      <title>Characterizing Discourse Group Roles in Inquiry-based University Science Labs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15746</link>

Abstract: Group work is commonly adopted in university science laboratories. However, student small-group discourse in university science labs is rarely investigated. We aim to bridge the gap in the literature by characterizing student discourse group roles in inquiry-based science labs. The instructional context for the study was a summer program hosted at a private research university in the eastern United States. The program was designed as a bridge program for matriculating students who were first generation and/or deaf or hard-of-hearing (DHH). Accommodations such as interpreters and technology were provided for DHH students. We analyzed 19 students' discourse moves in five lab activities from the video recordings, resulting in a total of 48 student-lab units. We developed codes to describe student discourse moves: asking a question, proposing an idea, participating in discussion, chatting off-task, and talking with instructor. Through a cluster analysis using the 48 student-lab units on quantified discourse moves, we identified four discourse styles, High on-task high social, High on-task low social, Low on-task low social, and Low on-task high social. The results show that individual students tend to demonstrate varying discourse styles in different lab activities; students' discourse styles within the same groups tend to be aligned with their group members. By examining group members' discourse styles in mixed-gender groups, we did not observe a difference in engagement level between female and male students. DHH students in mixed hearing ability groups, however, were observed to have a lower level of engagement compared to their non-DHH group members. We discuss possible factors that may have contributed to the observations for genders and students with different hearing abilities. We also provide suggestions for promoting equitable small-group discourse in university science labs.</description>

      <title>Using skateboarding to develop a culturally relevant tutorial on static equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17625v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Culturally relevant pedagogy (CRP), initially developed by Ladson-Billings, is an instructional framework for supporting diverse learners by drawing on their cultural backgrounds and experiences. In line with the CRP framework, we developed a tutorial on static equilibrium using skateboarding, a popular activity on university campuses, as a culturally relevant context. To help students refine their conceptions about static equilibrium documented in the physics education research (PER) literature, we used the elicit-confront-resolve (ECR) strategy to develop the tutorial. In this paper, we provide a detailed account of how we operationalized the ECR strategy in designing the sequences of questions in the tutorial. Additionally, we present anecdotal evidence to show that this research-based culturally relevant tutorial appears to effectively engage students and motivate their interest in learning physics.</description>
