      <title>Polynomial Order Selection for Savitzky-Golay Smoothers via N-fold Cross-Validation (extended version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Savitzky-Golay (SG) smoothers are noise suppressing filters operating on the principle of projecting noisy input onto the subspace of polynomials. A poorly selected polynomial order results in over- or under-smoothing which shows as either bias or excessive noise at the output. In this study, we apply the N-fold cross-validation technique (also known as leave-one-out cross-validation) for model order selection and show that the inherent analytical structure of the SG filtering problem, mainly its minimum norm formulation, enables an efficient and effective order selection solution. More specifically, a novel connection between the total prediction error and SG-projection spaces is developed to reduce the implementation complexity of cross-validation method. The suggested solution compares favorably with the state-of-the-art Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) rule in non-asymptotic signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and sample size regimes. MATLAB codes reproducing the numerical results are provided.</description>

      <title>RIS-Aided Localization and Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-precision localization and environmental sensing are essential for a new wave of applications, ranging from industrial automation and autonomous systems to augmented reality and remote healthcare. Conventional wireless methods, however, often face limitations in accuracy, reliability, and coverage, especially in complex non-line-of-sight (NLoS) environments. Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) have emerged as a key enabling technology, offering dynamic control over the radio propagation environment to overcome these challenges. This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of RIS-aided localization and sensing, bridging fundamental theory with practical implementation. The core principles of the RIS technology are first described detailing how programmable metasurfaces can intelligently combat blockages, enhance signal diversity, and create virtual line-of-sight (LoS) links. The chapter then reviews a range of application scenarios where RISs can offer significant improvements. A significant portion of the chapter is dedicated to algorithmic methodologies, covering beam sweeping protocols, codebook-based techniques, and advanced optimization and machine learning strategies for both localization and sensing. To validate the theoretical concepts in real-world conditions, recent experimental results using an RIS prototype are detailed, showcasing the technology's efficacy and illustrating key performance trade-offs.</description>

      <title>FAS-RSMA: Can Fluid Antennas Elevate RSMA Performance?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As 6G networks demand massive connectivity and stronger interference control, rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) is attractive because it superposes a common stream and user-private streams and remains effective under imperfect CSIT and heterogeneous traffic. In practical multiuser deployments, two considerations arise: the common stream decoding constraint imposed by the weakest user, and residual inter-user interference can remain non-negligible, particularly in single-input single-output (SISO) broadcast settings and under an imperfect CSIT scenario. Motivated by prior advances of RSMA research, we investigate a complementary mechanism-fluid antenna systems (FAS), with dynamic port reconfiguration supplies adaptive spatial selectivity without altering the RSMA signaling structure. Can FAS help alleviate these considerations and enhance RSMA performance? We develop a tractable correlation-aware analytical framework based on block-correlation models, including constant block correlation (CBC) and variable block correlation (VBC), to capture realistic spatial dependence among ports. Closed-form expressions are derived for outage probability (OP) and average capacity (AC), revealing how port reconfiguration strengthens the weakest effective channel and improves SINR through higher channel gains and lower relative noise impact. Monte Carlo simulations verify the analysis and show that VBC matches simulations more tightly than CBC across all port configurations. Finally, FAS-RSMA provides clear gains over conventional antenna systems and NOMA, achieving lower OP and higher AC by combining RSMA interference management with FAS spatial diversity.</description>

      <title>Distributed Integrated Sensing and Edge AI Exploiting Prior Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a distributed ISEA system under a Bayesian framework, focusing on incorporating task-relevant priors to maximize inference performance. At the sensing level, an RWB estimator with a GM prior is designed. By weighting class-conditional posterior means with responsibilities, RWB effectively denoises features and outperforms ML at low SNR. At the communication level, two theoretical proxies are introduced: the computation-optimal and decision-optimal proxies. Optimal transceiver designs in terms of closed-form power allocation are derived for both TDM and FDM settings, revealing threshold-based and dual-decomposition structures. Results show that the discriminant-aware allocation yields additional inference gains.</description>

      <title>Vision Transformer for Classification of UAV and Helicopters Using Micro-Doppler Spectrograms in Surveillance Radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning researchers strive to develop better and better algorithms to solve computer vision problems, such as image classification. In recent years, the classification of micro-Doppler spectrograms has also benefited from these findings. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) became the gold standard for these tasks. Unfortunately, CNNs can work on fixed-resolution images, or they need to resize mismatched images to fit input dimensions. It can become a problem when micro-Doppler spectrograms are generated with e.g. different integration times. The goal of this work was to classify the UAV and helicopters micro-Doppler spectrograms with different duration times, using the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture. Before that, spectrograms signal-to-noise-ratio and micro-Doppler features visibility were improved by denoising algorithm based on modified Dual Tree Complex Wavelet Transform. The experiments were conducted on real data collected using surveillance, short range, military radar. As a result, it has been shown that the ViT model achieved 97.76\% accuracy for this task. To further interpret the network performance, the raw self-attention maps were analyzed.</description>

      <title>Rotatable Antenna-array-enhanced Direction-sensing for Low-altitude Communication Network: Method and Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a practical multi-antenna receiver, each element of the receive antenna array has a directive antenna pattern, which is still not fully explored and investigated in academia and industry until now. When the emitter is deviated greatly from the normal direction of antenna element or is close to the null-point direction, the sensing energy by array will be seriously attenuated such that the direction-sensing performance is degraded significantly. To address such an issue, a rotatable array system is established with the directive antenna pattern of each element taken into account, where each element has the same antenna pattern. Then, the corresponding the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is derived. Finally, a recursive rotation Root-MUSIC (RR-Root-MUSIC) direction-sensing method is proposed and its mean-square-error (MSE) performance is evaluated by the derived CRLB. Simulation results show that the proposed rotation method converges rapidly with about ten iterations, and make a significant enhancement on the direction-sensing accuracy in terms of MSE when the target direction departs seriously far away from the normal vector of array. Compared with conventional Root-MUSIC, the sensing performance of the proposed RR-Root-MUSIC method is much closer to the CRLB.</description>

      <title>A 40 GHz Low-Power Variable-Gain Low Noise Amplifier in 28-nm CMOS Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Low-Power Variable Gain (VG) mm-Wave Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) is designed and simulated in a 28-nm CMOS process. The LNA utilizes a simple, yet novel, technique presented in this paper to vary the small-signal output resistance to provide gain control. The amplifier also utilizes forward body biasing to reduce the supply voltage to 0.7 V and enhance power efficiency. A simultaneous noise and input matching (SNIM) technique is used to provide robust input matching and noise performance during gain adjustment. The proposed VG-LNA achieves a peak gain of 21 dB at 40.5 GHz with a noise figure of 2.8 dB and consumes only 4.5 mW. At the highest gain configuration, an input-referred 1-dB compression of -21 dBm and IP3 of -7.8 dBm are achieved, which increase to -14.8 dBm and 1.2 dBm, respectively, at the lowest gain configuration. Regardless of the gain control voltage, the LNA attains a very good FoM as compared to the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Diffuse scattering measurements and mechanism analysis at 8, 12, and 28 GHz for typical building surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the fundamental diffuse scattering mechanisms from three typical building wall surfaces, conducting measurements and model parameterization at 28 GHz and two key FR3 frequencies (8 GHz and 12 GHz). A novel three-dimensional (3D) measurement procedure is proposed to capture comprehensive spatial characteristics, and its effectiveness in improving parameterization accuracy was verified using 28 GHz data. For parameterization, we developed a new method utilizing two dimensions of the high-bandwidth power delay profile-received power and delay spread-thereby fully leveraging the rich information provided by such measurements. Furthermore, we introduce the ER-BK hybrid model, which integrates the Beckmann-Kirchhoff (BK) model's high accuracy and cross-frequency adaptability with the Effective Roughness (ER) model's simplicity, applying it to the building surfaces. Our results show that diffuse scattering at 8 GHz and 12 GHz is highly similar, distinct from that at 28 GHz. A comparison revealed that the BK model provides a better fit for our FR3 measurement data. Crucially, we validated the angular generalization of the parameterized BK model using data from a different incident angle than the one used for fitting. The feasibility of the ER-BK hybrid model was also verified through simulation of the parameterized marble surface.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Multi-Emitter Localization Using Spatially Distributed Power Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With more devices competing for limited spectrum, dynamic spectrum sharing is increasingly vulnerable to interference from unauthorized emitters. This motivates fast detection and localization of these emitters using low-cost, distributed sensors that do not require precise time synchronization. This paper presents two convolutional neural network (CNN) approaches for multi-emitter detection and localization from sparsely sampled power maps. The first method performs single-stage prediction of existence probabilities and positions. The alternative two-stage method first estimates an occupancy map as an interpretable intermediate representation and then localizes emitters. A unified training objective combines binary cross entropy with coordinate regression loss and can handle an unknown emitter count. Small footprint networks, on the order of 70\,k parameters, are trained and evaluated on simulated free-space and urban scenes. Experiments demonstrate that both approaches localize multiple emitters from sparse measurements across diverse environments, with the logits based two-stage variant remaining competitive, and in some cases superior, under extreme sensor sparsity. The findings indicate that small CNNs with a unified objective can be deployed for spectrum monitoring and localization.</description>

      <title>GCMCG: A Clustering-Aware Graph Attention and Expert Fusion Network for Multi-Paradigm, Multi-task, and Cross-Subject EEG Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) based on Motor Execution (ME) and Motor Imagery (MI) electroencephalogram (EEG) signals offer a direct pathway for human-machine interaction. However, developing robust decoding models remains challenging due to the complex spatio-temporal dynamics of EEG, its low signal-to-noise ratio, and the limited generalizability of many existing approaches across subjects and paradigms. To address these issues, this paper proposes Graph-guided Clustering Mixture-of-Experts CNN-GRU (GCMCG), a novel unified framework for MI-ME EEG decoding. Our approach integrates a robust preprocessing stage using Independent Component Analysis and Wavelet Transform (ICA-WT) for effective denoising. We further introduce a pre-trainable graph tokenization module that dynamically models electrode relationships via a Graph Attention Network (GAT), followed by unsupervised spectral clustering to decompose signals into interpretable functional brain regions. Each region is processed by a dedicated CNN-GRU expert network, and a gated fusion mechanism with L1 regularization adaptively combines these local features with a global expert. This Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design enables deep spatio-temporal fusion and enhances representational capacity. A three-stage training strategy incorporating focal loss and progressive sampling is employed to improve cross-subject generalization and handle class imbalance. Evaluated on three public datasets of varying complexity (EEGmmidb-BCI2000, BCI-IV 2a, and M3CV), GCMCG achieves overall accuracies of 86.60%, 98.57%, and 99.61%, respectively, which demonstrates its superior effectiveness and strong generalization capability for practical BCI applications.</description>

      <title>Deep Broadcast Feedback Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning for wireless communications have renewed interest in channel output feedback codes. In the additive white Gaussian broadcast channel with feedback (AWGN-BC-F), feedback can expand the channel capacity region beyond that of the no-feedback case, but linear analytical codes perform poorly with even small amounts of feedback noise. Deep learning enables the design of nonlinear feedback codes that are more resilient to feedback noise. We extend single-user learned feedback codes for the AWGN channel to the broadcast setting, and compare their performance with existing analytical codes, as well as a newly proposed analytical scheme inspired by the learned schemes. Our results show that, for a fixed code rate, learned codes outperform analytical codes at the same blocklength by using power-efficient nonlinear structures and are more robust to feedback noise. Analytical codes scale more easily to larger blocklengths with perfect feedback and surpass learned codes at higher SNRs.</description>

      <title>Outage Analysis of TAS-NOMA Systems With Multi-Antenna Users Over {\alpha}-{\mu} Fading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the outage performance of downlink NOMA systems with transmit antenna selection (TAS) and multi-antenna users over {\alpha}-{\mu} fading. Maximal-ratio combining (MRC) and equal-gain combining (EGC) are considered, with imperfect successive interference cancellation (ipSIC) explicitly modeled. Exact closed-form outage probability (OP) expressions and asymptotic results are derived, offering insights into diversity and coding gains. Simulations validate the analysis, showing that TAS improves the far user's performance and that MRC outperforms EGC. The results also quantify the loss from ipSIC, and highlight the impact of power allocation on joint OP. The proposed framework serves as a unified tool for evaluating TAS-NOMA systems under generalized fading, providing design insights for B5G/6G networks.</description>

      <title>Box Decoding with Low-Complexity Sort-free Candidate Pruning for MIMO Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Box Decoding is a sort-free tree-search MIMO detector whose complexity does not scale with the QAM order, achieved by searching a fixed candidate "box" around a zero-forcing (ZF) estimate. Prior work primarily reports small dimensions (e.g. 2x2), since the search visits an exponentially growing number of nodes as the MIMO order increases when no pruning is applied. This letter introduces three deterministic pruning rules that exploit QAM-grid symmetry and relative displacement between the ZF estimate and the nearby QAM points to eliminate unlikely branches, avoiding metric sorting and reducing full metric distance calculations. Simulations show large complexity savings with only a small impact on error performance. The resulting detector preserves QAM-order independence, scales to larger MIMO sizes, and maps naturally to parallel hardware implementation.</description>

      <title>Sensing-Aided Near-Field Beam Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between large antenna apertures and high carrier frequencies in future wireless systems gives rise to near-field communications, where the curvature of spherical wavefronts renders traditional far-field beamforming models inadequate. This chapter addresses the following fundamental questions on near-field operation: (i) What is the maximum distance where far-field approximations remain effective for path gain prediction and beam design? (ii) What level of position resolution is needed for accurate near-field beam focusing? (iii) How frequently must channel state information be updated to maintain highly directive bweamforming in dynamic scenarios? We develop an analytical framework for assessing near-field beamforming gain degradation due to mismatches between the focusing point and the coordinates of a user. Closed-form expressions for beam correlation, beam sensitivity to user movement, and the direction of fastest beamforming gain degradation are derived. A dynamic polar coordinate grid is also proposed for low complexity and adaptive near-field beam search. Furthermore, we introduce the novel concept of beam coherence time, quantifying the temporal robustness of focused beams and enabling proactive sensing-aided beam tracking strategies. The effect of microstrip losses on the preceding derivations is also analyzed. Finally, extensive simulation results validate the presented theoretical analysis and beam tracking method over randomly generated user trajectories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled network slicing problem to provide content delivery, sensing data gathering, and mobile edge computing (MEC) services. Three tenants provide services to their clients by sharing a common infrastructure of a set of UAVs. The content delivery tenant needs to guarantee that each of its clients (users) receives the required content, the sensing tenant aims to gather an adequate amount of uncorrelated data, and the MEC tenant provides computing service to its clients. An energy consumption minimization framework is considered to meet the tenants' requirements by optimizing the number of deployed UAVs, the deployment location of each UAV, the transmit power of each deployed UAV, the user-UAV association, and the transmission power as well as the computing resources of each UAV. Taking into account the spatial correlation among the sensing users, a subset of these users is activated to gather the required sensing information. A solution approach technique inherited from graph theory is presented, in which the Lagrange approach derives the transmission power and computing resource allocation expressions. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed framework significantly reduces the total energy consumption.</description>

      <title>Bridging FR1 to FR3: Frequency-Continuous Urban Macro/Microcellular Channel Parameterization Anchored at 4.85 GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition from 5G to 6G requires radio channel models that are frequency-continuous across the entire FR1--FR3 span, particularly in the under-explored 4--8 GHz region targeted by WRC-27. Existing 3GPP-style models are often specified at discrete frequencies, introducing discontinuities in large-scale parameters (LSPs) at the 7.125 GHz boundary. To address this, we develop a unified framework anchored by rigorous double-directional measurements at 4.85 GHz in three representative UMa/UMi layouts. We derive route-specific statistics for path loss, delay and angular spreads, K-factor, and spatial consistency using robust distance-binning and bootstrap processing. Subsequently, we construct a log-log frequency-continuous LSP model spanning 4.85 to 28 GHz by anchoring these local statistics to complementary high-frequency datasets. The resulting models ensure smoothness across 7.125 GHz and systematically deviate from 3GPP trends, capturing weaker dispersion in urban macrocells (UMa) and stronger frequency-dependent compaction in urban microcells (UMi). The proposed parameter set fills the measurement gap around 4.85 GHz and provides a practical, implementation-ready basis for wideband 5G/6G simulations, mobility evaluation, and spectrum-planning activities across the FR1--FR3 interface.</description>

      <title>Planar Diffractive Neural Networks Empowered Communications: A Spatial Modulation Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffractive neural networks, where signal processing is embedded into wave propagation, promise light-speed and energy-efficient computation. However, existing three-dimensional structures, such as stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs), face critical challenges in implementation and integration. In contrast, this work pioneers planar diffractive neural networks (PDNNs) empowered communications, a novel architecture that performs signal processing as signals propagate through artificially designed planar circuits. To demonstrate the capability of PDNN, we propose a PDNN-based space-shift-keying (PDNN-SSK) communication system with a single radio-frequency (RF) chain and a maximum power detector. In this system, PDNNs are deployed at both the transmitter and receiver to jointly execute modulation, beamforming, and detection. We conduct theoretical analyses to provide the maximization condition of correct detection probability and derive the closed-form expression of the symbol error rate (SER) for the proposed system. To approach these theoretical benchmarks, the phase shift parameters of PDNNs are optimized using a surrogate model-based training approach, which effectively navigates the high-dimensional, non-convex optimization landscape. Extensive simulations verify the theoretical analysis framework and uncover fundamental design principles for the PDNN architecture, highlighting its potential to revolutionize RF front-ends by replacing conventional digital baseband modules with this integrable RF computing platform.</description>

      <title>Covariance-Guided DFT Beam Selection for Beamspace ESPRIT in Hybrid mmWave MIMO Receivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider direction-of-arrival estimation in hybrid analog/digital mmWave MIMO receivers that employ DFT beamspace processing with a limited number of RF chains. Building on beamspace ESPRIT, we develop a covariance-guided beam selection framework that reconstructs a virtual fully digital subarray, fits a structured signal-plus-noise covariance model, and uses the resulting denoised covariance to select, for each coarse sector, a small contiguous block of DFT beams under a beam-budget constraint. The selected beams feed a sparse beamspace Unitary ESPRIT stage, so that the overall complexity is dominated by a single low-dimensional ESPRIT call while retaining a large effective aperture. Monte Carlo simulations for a 32-element uniform linear array with three paths show that, relative to a standard sectorization-based beam selector built on the same DFT codebook and ESPRIT estimator, the proposed method attains near Cram\'er--Rao bound accuracy at moderate array signal-to-noise ratios, substantially reduces the gap to the bound and the failure rate, and offers favorable accuracy--runtime trade-offs under dynamic RF budgets and sector-edge stress tests.</description>

      <title>An Acoustic Communication Model in Plants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular communication (MC) studies biological signals that are found in nature. Most MC literature focuses on particle properties, even though many natural phenomena exhibit wave-like behavior. One such signal is sound waves. Understanding how sound waves are used in nature can help us better utilize this signal in our interactions with our environment. To take a step in this direction, in this paper, we examine how plants process incoming sound waves and take informed actions. Indeed, plants respond to sound, yet no quantitative communication-theoretic model currently explains this behavior. This study develops the first end-to-end acoustic communication framework for plants. The model is formed following the biological steps of the incoming signal, and a mathematical description is constructed at each step following basic biological models. The resulting end-to-end communication-theoretic model is analyzed using MATLAB. Simulations show that a $200$ $Hz$, $20$ $mu Pa$ stimulus elevates cytosolic $Ca^{2+}$ from $150$ $nM$ to $230 \pm 10$ $nM$ within $50$ seconds which can cause root bending in plants in the long run. This work establishes quantitative phytoacoustics, enabling bio-inspired acoustic connections for precision agriculture and plant signaling research.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Optimization for Non-Cooperative Game-Based Radio Resource Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio resource management in modern cellular networks often calls for the optimization of complex utility functions that are potentially conflicting between different base stations (BSs). Coordinating the resource allocation strategies efficiently across BSs to ensure stable network service poses significant challenges, especially when each utility is accessible only via costly, black-box evaluations. This paper considers formulating the resource allocation among spectrum sharing BSs as a non-cooperative game, with the goal of aligning their allocation incentives toward a stable outcome. To address this challenge, we propose PPR-UCB, a novel Bayesian optimization (BO) strategy that learns from sequential decision-evaluation pairs to approximate pure Nash equilibrium (PNE) solutions. PPR-UCB applies martingale techniques to Gaussian process (GP) surrogates and constructs high probability confidence bounds for utilities uncertainty quantification. Experiments on downlink transmission power allocation in a multi-cell multi-antenna system demonstrate the efficiency of PPR-UCB in identifying effective equilibrium solutions within a few data samples.</description>

      <title>Retroreflective Optical ISAC for 6G: Technologies, Applications and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has emerged as a key technological paradigm for sixth generation (6G) mobile networks, aiming to unify sensing and communication in a spectrally efficient and hardware lightweight manner. Radio frequency ISAC (RF-ISAC) is constrained by spectrum crowding, limited sensing resolution, and susceptibility to electromagnetic interference. In contrast, optical ISAC (O-ISAC) leverages the large bandwidth and short wavelength of optical carriers and is regarded as an important complement to RF-ISAC. However, conventional O-ISAC relies on natural optical reflections from target surfaces, which generate weak echoes that are highly dependent on surface materials, thereby limiting the achievable sensing range and sensing accuracy. This article introduces retroreflective optical ISAC (RO-ISAC), which alleviates these limitations by equipping targets with compact retroreflective modules. These modules return incident light approximately back to the source over a useful range of incidence angles, forming a well controlled double pass optical path with strong and stable echoes, and thereby further unlocking the application potential of O-ISAC. The conceptual architecture of RO-ISAC is presented together with the underlying retroreflection mechanism. Key enabling technologies for RO-ISAC systems are discussed, including channel modeling, waveform design, bidirectional transmission, and multi-target sensing and communication, with representative details and experimental validation. The suitability of RO-ISAC is analyzed in indoor, aerial, underwater, and satellite scenarios, and challenges and research directions related to mobility, cooperative networking, intelligent operation, and sustainable deployment are outlined, pointing toward robust and scalable RO-ISAC deployment in future 6G networks.</description>

      <title>Experimental Methods, Health Indicators, and Diagnostic Strategies for Retired Lithium-ion Batteries: A Comprehensive Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable health assessment of retired lithium-ion batteries is essential for safe and economically viable second-life deployment, yet remains difficult due to sparse measurements, incomplete historical records, heterogeneous chemistries, and limited or noisy battery health labels. Conventional laboratory diagnostics, such as full charge-discharge cycling, pulse tests, Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) measurements, and thermal characterization, provide accurate degradation information but are too time-consuming, equipment-intensive, or condition-sensitive to be applied at scale during retirement-stage sorting, leaving real-world datasets fragmented and inconsistent. This review synthesizes recent advances that address these constraints through physical health indicators, experiment testing methods, data-generation and augmentation techniques, and a spectrum of learning-based modeling routes spanning supervised, semi-supervised, weakly supervised, and unsupervised paradigms. We highlight how minimal-test features, synthetic data, domain-invariant representations, and uncertainty-aware prediction enable robust inference under limited or approximate labels and across mixed chemistries and operating histories. A comparative evaluation further reveals trade-offs in accuracy, interpretability, scalability, and computational burden. Looking forward, progress toward physically constrained generative models, cross-chemistry generalization, calibrated uncertainty estimation, and standardized benchmarks will be crucial for building reliable, scalable, and deployment-ready health prediction tools tailored to the realities of retired-battery applications.</description>

      <title>Joint CFO-Channel Estimation over CFO-Coherent SS Burst Sets for Low-Altitude Radio Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extending terrestrial networks into low-altitude airspace is a practical way to support aerial services, and accurate low-altitude radio maps are essential for characterizing terrestrial base station (BS) coverage and guiding system design. This work targets per-cell per-beam radio mapping from 5G new radio (NR) synchronization signal (SS) burst sets. Conventional processing treats interference as noise and focuses on the strongest link, which is insufficient to comprehensive awareness of the radio environment and ineffective in dense multi-cell low-altitude scenarios. We propose a successive waveform reconstruction and cancellation framework that iteratively estimates, reconstructs, and subtracts the SSs of stronger BSs, thereby enabling reliable detection and estimation of ultra-weak signals. To support this, we introduce the notion of a carrier frequency offset (CFO)-coherent block within which a common-CFO/per-synchronization signal block (SSB)-channel model holds and design a joint CFO-channel estimator that coherently aggregates multiple SSBs within each CFO-coherent block. We further derive closed-form scaling laws that relate estimation accuracy to unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) speed, motion geometry, burst periodicity, and the length of the CFO-coherent block. Simulations show that the proposed framework can detect and estimate SSs at signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) levels down to -30 dB. Field tests at 150 m altitude demonstrate per-beam coverage maps for more than ten overlapping BSs and reveal that, despite strong received power, the measured SINR rarely exceeds 10 dB, underscoring the need for careful interference management in low-altitude airspace.</description>

      <title>Masked Symbol Modeling for Demodulation of Oversampled Baseband Communication Signals in Impulsive Noise-Dominated Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in natural language processing show that attention mechanism in Transformer networks, trained via masked-token prediction, enables models to capture the semantic context of the tokens and internalize the grammar of language. While the application of Transformers to communication systems is a burgeoning field, the notion of context within physical waveforms remains under-explored. This paper addresses that gap by re-examining inter-symbol contribution (ISC) caused by pulse-shaping overlap. Rather than treating ISC as a nuisance, we view it as a deterministic source of contextual information embedded in oversampled complex baseband signals. We propose Masked Symbol Modeling (MSM), a framework for the physical (PHY) layer inspired by Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers methodology. In MSM, a subset of symbol aligned samples is randomly masked, and a Transformer predicts the missing symbol identifiers using the surrounding "in-between" samples. Through this objective, the model learns the latent syntax of complex baseband waveforms. We illustrate MSM's potential by applying it to the task of demodulating signals corrupted by impulsive noise, where the model infers corrupted segments by leveraging the learned context. Our results suggest a path toward receivers that interpret, rather than merely detect communication signals, opening new avenues for context-aware PHY layer design.</description>

      <title>RadioPiT: Radio Map Generation with Pixel Transformer Driven by Ultra-Sparse Real-World Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As wireless communication networks rapidly evolve, spectrum resources are increasingly scarce, making effective spectrum management critically important. Radio map is a spatial representation of signal characteristics across different locations in a given area, which serves as a key tool for enabling precise spectrum management. To generate accurate radio maps, extensive research efforts have been made. However, most existing studies are conducted on simulation data, which differs significantly from real-world data and cannot accurately reflect the spectrum characteristics of practical environments. To tackle this problem, we construct a dataset of real-world radio map with a self-developed measurement system. Due to the limited volume of real-world data and the distributional discrepancies between simulation and real-world data, we propose a Pixel Transformer (PiT)- based model enhanced with the test-time adaptation (TTA) strategy, named RadioPiT, for real-world radio map generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed RadioPiT significantly outperforms baseline methods in real-world scenarios, yielding a 21.9% decrement in the root mean square error (RMSE) compared to RadioUNet.</description>

      <title>Spectral-Energy Efficiency Tradeoff of Nearly-Passive RIS in MIMO URLLC Downlink: Diagonal vs. Beyond Diagonal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the spectral and energy efficiency (EE) tradeoff of nearly-passive (NP), both locally and globally NP (GNP), reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), considering diagonal and beyond-diagonal (BD) implementations in multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) broadcast channels designed for ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC). We demonstrate that while all RIS architectures enhance the spectral efficiency, GNP BD-RIS achieves the highest gains. However, its EE is highly sensitive to the static circuit power consumption since BD-RIS has many more circuit elements than diagonal architectures. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the benefits of BD-RIS over diagonal RIS diminish as the number of data streams per user increases due to enhanced channel diversity in MIMO systems.</description>

      <title>In-Context Learning for Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding Over MIMO Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated the ability to perform \textit{in-context learning} (ICL), whereby the model performs predictions by directly mapping the query and a few examples from the given task to the output variable. In this paper, we study ICL for deep joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC) in image transmission over multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, where an ICL denoiser is employed for MIMO symbol estimation. We first study the transceiver without any hardware impairments and explore the integration of transformer-based ICL with DeepJSCC in both open-loop and closed-loop MIMO systems, depending on the availability of channel state information (CSI) at the transceiver. For both open-loop and closed-loop scenarios, we propose two MIMO transceiver architectures that leverage context information, i.e., pilot sequences and their outputs, as additional inputs, enabling the DeepJSCC encoder, DeepJSCC decoder, and the ICL denoiser to jointly learn encoding, decoding, and estimation strategies tailored to each channel realization. Next, we extend our study to a more challenging scenario where the transceiver suffers from in-phase and quadrature (IQ) imbalance, resulting in nonlinear MIMO estimation. In this case, the context information is also exploited, facilitating joint learning across the DeepJSCC encoder, decoder, and the ICL denoiser under hardware impairments and varying channel conditions. Numerical results demonstrate that the ICL denoiser for MIMO estimation significantly outperforms the conventional least-squares method, with even greater advantages under IQ imbalance. Moreover, the proposed transformer-based ICL framework, integrated with contextual information, achieves significant improvements in end-to-end image reconstruction quality under transceiver IQ imbalance.</description>

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and sustained hypertension is an often silent risk factor, making cuffless continuous blood pressure (BP) monitoring with wearable devices important for early screening and long-term management. Most existing cuffless BP estimation methods use only photoplethysmography (PPG) and electrocardiography (ECG) signals, alone or in combination. These models are typically developed under resting or quasi-static conditions and struggle to maintain robust accuracy in multi-motion-state scenarios. In this study, we propose a six-modal BP estimation framework that jointly leverages ECG, multi-channel PPG, attachment pressure, sensor temperature, and triaxial acceleration and angular velocity. Each modality is processed by a lightweight branch encoder, contrastive learning enforces cross-modal semantic alignment, and a mixture-of-experts (MoE) regression head adaptively maps the fused features to BP across motion states. Comprehensive experiments on the public Pulse Transit Time PPG Dataset, which includes running, walking, and sitting data from 22 subjects, show that the proposed method achieves mean absolute errors (MAE) of 3.60 mmHg for systolic BP (SBP) and 3.01 mmHg for diastolic BP (DBP). From a clinical perspective, it attains Grade A for SBP, DBP, and mean arterial pressure (MAP) according to the British Hypertension Society (BHS) protocol and meets the numerical criteria of the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) standard for mean error (ME) and standard deviation of error (SDE).</description>

      <title>Multimodal Mixture-of-Experts for ISAC in Low-Altitude Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a key enabler for low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs), providing simultaneous environmental perception and data transmission in complex aerial scenarios. By combining heterogeneous sensing modalities such as visual, radar, lidar, and positional information, multimodal ISAC can improve both situational awareness and robustness of LAWNs. However, most existing multimodal fusion approaches use static fusion strategies that treat all modalities equally and cannot adapt to channel heterogeneity or time-varying modality reliability in dynamic low-altitude environments. To address this fundamental limitation, we propose a mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework for multimodal ISAC in LAWNs. Each modality is processed by a dedicated expert network, and a lightweight gating module adaptively assigns fusion weights according to the instantaneous informativeness and reliability of each modality. To improve scalability under the stringent energy constraints of aerial platforms, we further develop a sparse MoE variant that selectively activates only a subset of experts, thereby reducing computation overhead while preserving the benefits of adaptive fusion. Comprehensive simulations on three typical ISAC tasks in LAWNs demonstrate that the proposed frameworks consistently outperform conventional multimodal fusion baselines in terms of learning performance and training sample efficiency.</description>

      <title>Secure Over-the-Air Computation Against Multiple Eavesdroppers using Correlated Artificial Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of the Internet of Things and massive connectivity, many engineering applications, such as sensor fusion and federated edge learning, rely on efficient data aggregation from geographically distributed users over wireless networks. Over-the-air computation shows promising potential for enhancing resource efficiency and scalability in such scenarios by leveraging the superposition property of wireless channels. However, due to the use of uncoded transmission with linear mapping, it also suffers from security vulnerabilities that must be dealt with to allow widespread adoption. In this work, we consider a scenario where multiple cooperating eavesdroppers attempt to infer information about the aggregation result. We derive the optimal joint estimator for the eavesdroppers and provide bounds on the achievable estimation accuracy for both the eavesdroppers and the intended receiver. We show that significant inherent security exists against individual eavesdroppers due to channel misalignment. However, the security level is greatly compromised when the eavesdroppers can cooperate, motivating the need for deliberate security measures. A common measure is to add carefully calibrated perturbation signals (artificial noise) prior to data transmission to improve the security level. To this end, we propose a zero-forced artificial noise design that achieves a high level of security against cooperative eavesdroppers without compromising the aggregation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Insights on the Uplink Operation of a 1-bit Radio-Over-Fiber Architecture in Multi-User D-MIMO Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a distributed multiple-input multiple-output (D-MIMO) testbed in which, to enable coherent-phase transmission without over-the-air synchronization, the remote radio heads (RRHs) are connected to a central unit via a 1-bit radio-over-fiber fronthaul. Specifically, 1-bit samples of the radio-frequency signal are exchanged over the fronthaul. We investigate via both measurements and simulations based on an accurate model of the testbed hardware, the capability of the proposed architecture to provide uniform quality of services over the coverage area--one of the promises of D-MIMO. Our results are encouraging: for the case in which two user equipments (UEs) communicate over the same 75MHz signal bandwidth, the measured error-vector magnitude meets the 3GPP New Radio specification of 12.5\% for 16QAM across all tested DMIMO scenarios. We also determine that uplink transmission is a potential bottleneck, due to the limited dynamic range of the automatic gain controller, which prevents the 1-bit quantizer to benefit from dithering. We show that this issue can be mitigated via UE power control.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin Aided Millimeter Wave MIMO: Site-Specific Beam Codebook Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning site-specific beams that adapt to the deployment environment, interference sources, and hardware imperfections can lead to noticeable performance gains in coverage, data rate, and power saving, among other interesting advantages. This learning process, however, typically requires a large number of active interactions/iterations, which limits its practical feasibility and leads to excessive overhead. To address these challenges, we propose a digital twin aided codebook learning framework, where a site-specific digital twin is leveraged to generate synthetic channel data for codebook learning. We also propose to learn separate codebooks for line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight users, leveraging the geometric information provided by the digital twin. Simulation results demonstrate that the codebook learned from the digital twin can adapt to the environment geometry and user distribution, leading to high received signal-to-noise ratio performance. Moreover, we identify the ray-tracing accuracy as the most critical factor in digital twin fidelity that impacts the learned codebook performance.</description>

      <title>The Equivalence of Fast Algorithms for Convolution, Parallel FIR Filters, Polynomial Modular Multiplication, and Pointwise Multiplication in DFT/NTT Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast time-domain algorithms have been developed in signal processing applications to reduce the multiplication complexity. For example, fast convolution structures using Cook-Toom and Winograd algorithms are well understood. Short length fast convolutions can be iterated to obtain fast convolution structures for long lengths. In this paper, we show that well known fast convolution structures form the basis for design of fast algorithms in four other problem domains: fast parallel filters, fast polynomial modular multiplication, and fast pointwise multiplication in the DFT and NTT domains. Fast polynomial modular multiplication and fast pointwise multiplication problems are important for cryptosystem applications such as post-quantum cryptography and homomorphic encryption. By establishing the equivalence of these problems, we show that a fast structure from one domain can be used to design a fast structure for another domain. This understanding is important as there are many well known solutions for fast convolution that can be used in other signal processing and cryptosystem applications.</description>

      <title>From RISC-V Cores to Neuromorphic Arrays: A Tutorial on Building Scalable Digital Neuromorphic Processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital neuromorphic processors are emerging as a promising computing substrate for low-power, always-on EdgeAI applications. In this tutorial paper, we outline the main architectural design principles behind fully digital neuromorphic processors and illustrate them using the SENECA platform as a running example. Starting from a flexible array of tiny RISC-V processing cores connected by a simple Network-on-Chip (NoC), we show how to progressively evolve the architecture: from a baseline event-driven implementation of fully connected networks, to versions with dedicated Neural Processing Elements (NPEs) and a loop controller that offloads fine-grained control from the general-purpose cores. Along the way, we discuss software and mapping techniques such as spike grouping, event-driven depth-first convolution for convolutional networks, and hard-attention style processing for high-resolution event-based vision. The focus is on architectural trade-offs, performance and energy bottlenecks, and on leveraging flexibility to incrementally add domain-specific acceleration. This paper assumes familiarity with basic neuromorphic concepts (spikes, event-driven computation, sparse activation) and deep neural network workloads. It does not present new experimental results; instead, it synthesizes and contextualizes findings previously reported in our SENECA publications to provide a coherent, step-by-step architectural perspective for students and practitioners who wish to design their own digital neuromorphic processors.</description>

      <title>Variable Point: A Number Format for Area- and Energy-Efficient Multiplication of High-Dynamic-Range Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fixed-point number representation is commonly employed in digital VLSI designs that have stringent hardware efficiency constraints. However, fixed-point numbers cover a relatively small dynamic range for a given bitwidth. In contrast, floating-point numbers offer a larger dynamic range at the cost of increased hardware complexity. In this paper, we propose a novel number format called variable-point (VP). VP numbers cover a larger dynamic range than fixed-point numbers with similar bitwidth, without notably increasing hardware complexity -- this allows for a more efficient representation of signals with high dynamic range. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed VP number format, we consider a matrix-vector multiplication engine for spatial equalization in multi-antenna wireless communication systems involving high-dynamic-range signals. Through post-layout VLSI implementation results, we demonstrate that the proposed VP-based design achieves 20% and 10% area and power savings, respectively, compared to a fully optimized fixed-point design, without incurring any noticeable performance degradation.</description>

      <title>Movable Antenna Empowered Near-Field Sensing via Antenna Position Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) technology exhibits great promise for enhancing the sensing capabilities of future sixth-generation (6G) networks due to its capability to alter antenna array geometry. With the growing prevalence of near-field propagation at ultra-high frequencies, this paper focuses on the application of one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) MA arrays for near-field sensing to jointly estimate the angle and distance information about a target. First, for the 1D MA array scenario, to gain insights into MA-enhanced near-field sensing, we investigate two simplified cases with only angle-of-arrival (AoA) or distance estimation, respectively, assuming that the other information is already known. The worst-case Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs) on the mean square errors (MSEs) of the AoA estimation and the distance estimation are derived in these two cases. Then, we jointly optimize the positions of the MAs within the 1D array to minimize these CRBs and derive their closed-form solutions, which yield an identical array geometry to MA-enhanced far-field sensing. For the more challenging joint AoA and distance estimation, since the associated worst-case CRB is a highly complex and non-convex function with respect to the MA positions, a discrete sampling-based approach is proposed to sequentially update the MA positions and obtain an efficient suboptimal solution. Furthermore, we investigate the worst-case CRB minimization problems for a 2D MA array under various conditions and extend our proposed algorithms to solve them efficiently. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed MA-enhanced near-field sensing scheme dramatically outperforms conventional fixed-position antennas (FPAs). Moreover, the joint angle and distance estimation results in a different array geometry from that in the individual estimation of angle/distance or far-field sensing.</description>

      <title>Approximating Analytically-Intractable Likelihood Densities with Deterministic Arithmetic for Optimal Particle Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle filtering algorithms have enabled practical solutions to problems in autonomous robotics (self-driving cars, UAVs, warehouse robots), target tracking, and econometrics, with further applications in speech processing and medicine (patient monitoring). Yet, their inherent weakness at representing the likelihood of the observation (which often leads to particle degeneracy) remains unaddressed for high-frequency and resource-constrained systems. Improvements such as the optimal proposal and auxiliary particle filter mitigate this issue under specific circumstances and with increased computational cost. This work presents a new particle filtering method and its implementation, which enables tunably-approximative representation of arbitrary likelihood densities as program transformations of parametric distributions. Our method leverages a recent computing platform that can perform deterministic computation on probability distribution representations (UxHw) without relying on stochastic methods. For non-Gaussian non-linear systems and with an optimal-auxiliary particle filter, we benchmark the likelihood evaluation error and speed for a total of 294840 evaluation points. For such models, the results show that the UxHw method leads to as much as 37.7x speedup compared to the Monte Carlo alternative. For narrow uniform observation noise, the particle filter falsely assigns zero likelihood as much as 81.89% of the time whereas UxHw achieves 1.52% false-zero rate. The UxHw approach achieves filter RMSE improvement of as much as 18.9% (average 3.3%) over the Monte Carlo alternative.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling heterogeneous correlated time series requires the ability to learn hidden dynamic relationships between component time series with possibly varying periodicities and generative processes. To address this challenge, we formulate and evaluate a windowed variance-correlation metric (WVC) designed to quantify time-varying correlations between signals. This method directly recovers hidden relationships in an specified time interval as a weighted adjacency matrix, consequently inferring hidden dynamic graph structure. On simulated data, our method captures correlations that other methods miss. The proposed method expands the ability to learn dynamic graph structure between significantly different signals within a single cohesive dynamical graph model.</description>

      <title>Q2D2: A Geometry-Aware Audio Codec Leveraging Two-Dimensional Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent neural audio codecs have achieved impressive reconstruction quality, typically relying on quantization methods such as Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ), Vector Quantization (VQ) and Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ). However, these quantization techniques limit the geometric structure of the latent space, make it harder to capture correlations between features leading to inefficiency in representation learning, codebook utilization and token rate. In this paper we introduce Two Dimensional Quantization (Q2D2), a quantization scheme in which feature pairs are projected onto structured 2D grids such as hexagonal, rhombic, or rectangular tiling and quantized to the nearest grid values, yielding an implicit codebook defined by the product of grid levels, with codebook sizes comparable to conventional methods. Despite its simple geometric formulation, Q2D2 improves audio compression efficiency, with low token rates and high codebook utilization while maintaining state of the art reconstruction quality. Specifically, Q2D2 achieves competitive to superior performance in various objective and subjective reconstruction metrics, across extensive experiments in speech domain compared to state of the art models. Comprehensive ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of our design choices.</description>

      <title>AgriLiRa4D: A Multi-Sensor UAV Dataset for Robust SLAM in Challenging Agricultural Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-sensor Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is essential for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) performing agricultural tasks such as spraying, surveying, and inspection. However, real-world, multi-modal agricultural UAV datasets that enable research on robust operation remain scarce. To address this gap, we present AgriLiRa4D, a multi-modal UAV dataset designed for challenging outdoor agricultural environments. AgriLiRa4D spans three representative farmland types-flat, hilly, and terraced-and includes both boundary and coverage operation modes, resulting in six flight sequence groups. The dataset provides high-accuracy ground-truth trajectories from a Fiber Optic Inertial Navigation System with Real-Time Kinematic capability (FINS_RTK), along with synchronized measurements from a 3D LiDAR, a 4D Radar, and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), accompanied by complete intrinsic and extrinsic calibrations. Leveraging its comprehensive sensor suite and diverse real-world scenarios, AgriLiRa4D supports diverse SLAM and localization studies and enables rigorous robustness evaluation against low-texture crops, repetitive patterns, dynamic vegetation, and other challenges of real agricultural environments. To further demonstrate its utility, we benchmark four state-of-the-art multi-sensor SLAM algorithms across different sensor combinations, highlighting the difficulty of the proposed sequences and the necessity of multi-modal approaches for reliable UAV localization. By filling a critical gap in agricultural SLAM datasets, AgriLiRa4D provides a valuable benchmark for the research community and contributes to advancing autonomous navigation technologies for agricultural UAVs.

      <title>Delay Tolerant Networking to Extend Connectivity in Rural Areas Using Public Transport Systems: Design And Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In today's digital age, access to the Internet is essential, yet a significant digital divide exists, particularly in rural areas of developing nations. This paper presents a Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) framework that utilizes informal public transportation systems, such as minibus taxis, as mobile data mules to enhance connectivity in these underserved regions. We develop a probabilistic model to capture the randomness in vehicle mobility, including travel times and contact durations at bus stops. Key performance metrics are analyzed, including average data transmission rate and Peak Age of Information (PAoI), to assess the effectiveness of the proposed system. An analytical approximation for the Mean PAoI (MPAoI) is derived and validated through simulations. Case studies from real-world datasets in Nouakchott, Accra, and Addis Ababa demonstrate the practical applicability and scalability of our framework. The findings indicate that leveraging existing transportation networks can significantly bridge the digital divide by providing reliable internet-like connectivity to remote areas.</description>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) on resource-constrained edge devices faces a critical challenge: The computational energy required for training Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) often dominates communication costs. However, most existing Energy-Harvesting FL (EHFL) strategies fail to account for this reality, resulting in wasted energy due to redundant local computations. For efficient and proactive resource management, algorithms that predict local update contributions must be devised. We propose a lightweight client scheduling framework using the Version Age of Information (VAoI), a semantics-aware metric that quantifies update timeliness and significance. Crucially, we overcome VAoI's typical prohibitive computational cost, which requires statistical distance over the entire parameter space, by introducing a feature-based proxy. This proxy estimates model redundancy using intermediate-layer extraction from a single forward pass, dramatically reducing computational complexity. Experiments conducted under extreme non-IID data distributions and scarce energy availability demonstrate superior learning performance while achieving energy reduction compared to existing baseline selection policies. Our framework establishes semantics-aware scheduling as a practical and vital solution for EHFL in realistic scenarios where training costs dominate transmission costs.</description>

      <title>Retrieving Filter Spectra in CNN for Explainable Sleep Stage Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06478v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite significant advances in deep learning-based sleep stage classification, the clinical adoption of automatic classification models remains slow. One key challenge is the lack of explainability, as many models function as black boxes with millions of parameters. In response, recent work has increasingly focussed on enhancing model explainability. This study contributes to these efforts by introducing an explainability tool for spectral processing of individual EEG channels. Specifically, this tools retrieves the filter spectrum of low-level convolutional feature extraction and compares it with the classification-relevant spectral information in the data. We apply our tool on the EEGNet and MSA-CNN models using the ISRUC-S3 and Sleep-EDF-20 datasets. The tool reveals that spectral processing plays a significant role in the lower frequency bands. In addition, comparing the correlation between filter spectrum and data-derived spectral information with univariate performance indicates that the model naturally prioritises the most informative channels in a multimodal setting. We specify how these insights can be leveraged to enhance model performance. The code for the filter spectrum retrieval and its analysis is available at https://github.com/sgoerttler/MSA-CNN.</description>

      <title>PhySense: Sensor Placement Optimization for Accurate Physics Sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18190v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics sensing plays a central role in many scientific and engineering domains, which inherently involves two coupled tasks: reconstructing dense physical fields from sparse observations and optimizing scattered sensor placements to observe maximum information. While deep learning has made rapid advances in sparse-data reconstruction, existing methods generally omit optimization of sensor placements, leaving the mutual enhancement between reconstruction and placement on the shelf. To change this suboptimal practice, we propose PhySense, a synergistic two-stage framework that learns to jointly reconstruct physical fields and to optimize sensor placements, both aiming for accurate physics sensing. The first stage involves a flow-based generative model enhanced by cross-attention to adaptively fuse sparse observations. Leveraging the reconstruction feedback, the second stage performs sensor placement via projected gradient descent to satisfy spatial constraints. We further prove that the learning objectives of the two stages are consistent with classical variance-minimization principles, providing theoretical guarantees. Extensive experiments across three challenging benchmarks, especially a 3D geometry dataset, indicate PhySense achieves state-of-the-art physics sensing accuracy and discovers informative sensor placements previously unconsidered. Code is available at this repository: https://github.com/thuml/PhySense.</description>

      <title>Attention-Aided MMSE for OFDM Channel Estimation: Learning Linear Filters with Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00452v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), accurate channel estimation is crucial. Classical signal processing based approaches, such as minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) estimation, often require second-order statistics that are difficult to obtain in practice. Recent deep neural networks based methods have been introduced to address this; yet they often suffer from high inference complexity. This paper proposes an Attention-aided MMSE (A-MMSE), a novel model-based DNN framework that learns the optimal MMSE filter via the Attention Transformer. Once trained, the A-MMSE estimates the channel through a single linear operation for channel estimation, eliminating nonlinear activations during inference and thus reducing computational complexity. To enhance the learning efficiency of the A-MMSE, we develop a two-stage Attention encoder, designed to effectively capture the channel correlation structure. Additionally, a rank-adaptive extension of the proposed A-MMSE allows flexible trade-offs between complexity and channel estimation accuracy. Extensive simulations with 3GPP TDL channel models demonstrate that the proposed A-MMSE consistently outperforms other baseline methods in terms of normalized MSE across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. In particular, the A-MMSE and its rank-adaptive extension establish a new frontier in the performance-complexity trade-off, providing a powerful yet highly efficient solution for practical channel estimation</description>

      <title>Real-Time High-Accuracy Digital Wireless Time, Frequency, and Phase Calibration For Coherent Distributed Antenna Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07267v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a fully-digital high-accuracy real-time calibration procedure for frequency and time alignment of open-loop wirelessly coordinated coherent distributed antenna array (CDA) modems, enabling radio frequency (RF) phase coherence of spatially separated commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software-defined radios (SDRs) without cables or external references such as global navigation satellite system (GNSS). Building on previous work using high-accuracy spectrally-sparse time of arrival (ToA) waveforms and a multi-step ToA refinement process, a high-accuracy two-way time transfer (TWTT)-based timefrequency coordination approach is demonstrated. Due to the two-way nature of the high-accuracy TWTT approach, the time and frequency estimates are Doppler and multi-path tolerant, so long as the channel is reciprocal over the synchronization epoch. This technique is experimentally verified using COTS SDRs in a lab environment in static and dynamic scenarios and with significant multipath scatterers. Time, frequency, and phase stability were evaluated by beamforming over coaxial cables to an oscilloscope which achieved time and phase precisions of ~60 ps-70 ps, with median coherent gains above 99 % using optimized coordination parameters, and a beamforming frequency root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 3.73 ppb in a dynamic scenario. Finally, experiments were conducted to compare the performance of this technique with previous works using an analog continuous-wave two-tone (CWTT) frequency reference technique in both static and dynamic settings.</description>

      <title>How to Bridge the Sim-to-Real Gap in Digital Twin-Aided Telecommunication Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Training effective artificial intelligence models for telecommunications is challenging due to the scarcity of deployment-specific data. Real data collection is expensive, and available datasets often fail to capture the unique operational conditions and contextual variability of the network environment. Digital twinning provides a potential solution to this problem, as simulators tailored to the current network deployment can generate site-specific data to augment the available training datasets. However, there is a need to develop solutions to bridge the inherent simulation-to-reality (sim-to-real) gap between synthetic and real-world data. This paper reviews recent advances on two complementary strategies: 1) the calibration of digital twins (DTs) through real-world measurements, and 2) the use of sim-to-real gap-aware training strategies to robustly handle residual discrepancies between digital twin-generated and real data. For the latter, we evaluate two conceptually distinct methods that model the sim-to-real gap either at the level of the environment via Bayesian learning or at the level of the training loss via prediction-powered inference.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution Sensing in Communication-Centric ISAC: Deep Learning and Parametric Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces two novel algorithms designed to address the challenge of super-resolution sensing parameter estimation in bistatic configurations within communication-centric integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. Our approach leverages the estimated channel state information derived from reference symbols originally intended for communication to achieve super-resolution sensing parameter estimation. The first algorithm, IFFT-C2VNN, employs complex-valued convolutional neural networks to estimate the parameters of different targets, achieving significant reductions in computational complexity compared to traditional methods. The second algorithm, PARAMING, utilizes a parametric method that capitalizes on the knowledge of the system model, including the transmit and receive array geometries, to extract the sensing parameters accurately. Through a comprehensive performance analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of both algorithms across a range of signal-to-noise ratios, underscoring their applicability in realistic ISAC scenarios.</description>

      <title>Fluid-Antenna-aided AAV Secure Communications in Eavesdropper Uncertain Location</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For autonomous aerial vehicle (AAV) secure communications, traditional designs based on fixed position antenna (FPA) lack sufficient spatial degrees of freedom (DoF), which leaves the line-of-sight-dominated AAV links vulnerable to eavesdropping. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes a framework that effectively incorporates the fluid antenna (FA) and the artificial noise (AN) techniques. Specifically, the minimum secrecy rate (MSR) among multiple eavesdroppers is maximized by jointly optimizing AAV deployment, signal and AN precoders, and FA positions. In particular, the worst-case MSR is considered by taking the channel uncertainties due to the uncertainty about eavesdropping locations into account. To tackle the highly coupled optimization variables and the channel uncertainties in the formulated problem, an efficient and robust algorithm is proposed. Particularly, the uncertain regions of eavesdroppers, whose shapes can be arbitrary, are disposed by constructing convex hull. In addition, two movement modes of FAs are considered, namely, free movement mode and zonal movement mode, for which different optimization techniques are applied, respectively. Numerical results show that, the proposed FA schemes boost security by exploiting additional spatial DoF rather than transmit power, while AN provides remarkable gains under high transmit power. Furthermore, the synergy between FA and AN results in a secure advantage that exceeds the sum of their individual contributions, achieving a balance between security and reliability under limited resources.</description>

      <title>NEFT: A Unified Transformer Framework for Efficient Near-Field CSI Feedback in XL-MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12748v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems, operating in the near-field region due to their massive antenna arrays, are key enablers of next-generation wireless communications but face significant challenges in channel state information (CSI) feedback. Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool by learning compact channel features for feedback. However, existing methods struggle to capture the intricate structure of near-field CSI and incur prohibitive computational overhead on practical mobile devices. To overcome these limitations, we propose the near-field efficient feedback Transformer (NEFT) family for accurate near-field CSI feedback with reduced overhead under diverse hardware constraints. NEFT builds on a hierarchical vision Transformer backbone with progressive token reduction and multi-scale feature extraction, enabling compact and effective modeling of near-field channel characteristics. Furthermore, NEFT is extended with lightweight variants: NEFT-Compact applies multi-level knowledge distillation (KD) to reduce model complexity while preserving accuracy; NEFT-Hybrid adopts an attention-free CNN encoder to reduce encoder-side computation; and NEFT-Edge combines NEFT-Hybrid with KD to enable deployment on highly resource-constrained edge devices. Extensive simulations show that NEFT achieves a 15--21dB improvement in normalized mean-squared error over state-of-the-art methods, NEFT-Compact and NEFT-Edge reduce total FLOPs by 25-36% with negligible accuracy loss, while NEFT-Hybrid reduces encoder-side complexity by up to 64%, enabling deployment in highly asymmetric device scenarios. These results establish NEFT as a practical and scalable solution for near-field CSI feedback in XL-MIMO systems.</description>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a collaborative machine learning (ML) framework that combines on-device training and server-based aggregation to train a common ML model among distributed agents. In this work, we propose an asynchronous FL design with periodic aggregation to tackle the straggler issue in FL systems. Considering limited wireless communication resources, we investigate the effect of different scheduling policies and aggregation designs on the convergence performance. Driven by the importance of reducing the bias and variance of the aggregated model updates, we propose a scheduling policy that jointly considers the channel quality and training data representation of user devices. The effectiveness of our channel-aware data-importance-based scheduling policy, compared with state-of-the-art methods proposed for synchronous FL, is validated through simulations. Moreover, we show that an ``age-aware'' aggregation weighting design can significantly improve the learning performance in an asynchronous FL setting.</description>

      <title>MVGT: A Multi-view Graph Transformer Based on Spatial Relations for EEG Emotion Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03131v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG), a technique that records electrical activity from the scalp using electrodes, plays a vital role in affective computing. However, fully utilizing the multi-domain characteristics of EEG signals remains a significant challenge. Traditional single-perspective analyses often fail to capture the complex interplay of temporal, frequency, and spatial dimensions in EEG data. To address this, we introduce a multi-view graph transformer (MVGT) based on spatial relations that integrates information across three domains: temporal dynamics from continuous series, frequency features extracted from frequency bands, and inter-channel relationships captured through several spatial encodings. This comprehensive approach allows model to capture the nuanced properties inherent in EEG signals, enhancing its flexibility and representational power. Evaluation on publicly available datasets demonstrates that MVGT surpasses state-of-the-art methods in performance. The results highlight its ability to extract multi-domain information and effectively model inter-channel relationships, showcasing its potential for EEG-based emotion recognition tasks.</description>

      <title>RIFT: Entropy-Optimised Fractional Wavelet Constellations for Ideal Time-Frequency Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new method for estimating the Ideal Time-Frequency Representation (ITFR) of complex nonstationary signals. The Reconstructive Ideal Fractional Transform (RIFT) computes a constellation of Continuous Fractional Wavelet Transforms (CFWTs) aligned to different local time-frequency curvatures. This constellation is combined into a single optimised time-frequency energy representation via a localised entropy-based sparsity measure, designed to resolve auto-terms and attenuate cross-terms. Finally, a positivity-constrained Lucy-Richardson deconvolution with total-variation regularisation is applied to estimate the ITFR, achieving auto-term resolution comparable to that of the Wigner-Ville Distribution (WVD), yielding the high-resolution RIFT representation. The required Cohen's class convolutional kernels are fully derived in the paper for the chosen CFWT constellations. Additionally, the optimisation yields an Instantaneous Phase Direction (IPD) field, which allows the localised curvature in speech or music extracts to be visualised and utilised within a Kalman tracking scheme, enabling the extraction of signal component trajectories and the construction of the Spline-RIFT variant. Evaluation on synthetic and real-world signals demonstrates the algorithm's ability to effectively suppress cross-terms and achieve superior time-frequency precision relative to competing methods. This advance holds significant potential for a wide range of applications requiring high-resolution cross-term-free time-frequency analysis.</description>

      <title>Beamforming Design for Beyond Diagonal RIS-Aided Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07189v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) is a promising technology for further improving spectral efficiency (SE) with low cost and power consumption. However, conventional RIS has inevitable limitations due to its diagonal scattering matrix. In contrast, beyond-diagonal RIS (BD-RIS) has gained great attention. This correspondence focuses on integrating a hybrid transmitting and reflecting BD-RIS into CF mMIMO systems to enhance coverage and spatial multiplexing. This requires completing the beamforming design under the transmit power constraints and unitary constraints of the BD-RIS, by optimizing active and passive beamformer simultaneously. To tackle this issue, we introduce an alternating optimization algorithm that decomposes it using fractional programming and solves the subproblems alternatively. Moreover, to address the challenge introduced by the unitary constraint on the beamforming matrix of the BD-RIS, we propose a Riemannian limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (R-L-BFGS) algorithm to solve the problem optimally. Simulation results show that our algorithm achieves faster convergence and finds higher-quality solutions compared with baselines, while also demonstrating a favorable performance-complexity trade-off.</description>

      <title>Homeostatic Ubiquity of Hebbian Dynamics in Regularized Learning Rules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hebbian and anti-Hebbian plasticity are widely observed in the biological brain, yet their theoretical understanding remains limited. In this work, we find that when a learning method is regularized with L2 weight decay, its learning signal will gradually align with the direction of the Hebbian learning signal as it approaches stationarity. This Hebbian-like behavior is not unique to SGD: almost any learning rule, including random ones, can exhibit the same signature long before learning has ceased. We also provide a theoretical explanation for anti-Hebbian plasticity in regression tasks, demonstrating how it can arise naturally from gradient or input noise, and offering a potential reason for the observed anti-Hebbian effects in the brain. Certainly, our proposed mechanisms do not rule out any conventionally established forms of Hebbian plasticity and could coexist with them extensively in the brain. A key insight for neurophysiology is the need to develop ways to experimentally distinguish these two types of Hebbian observations.</description>

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is crucial for many clinical and research applications. However, achieving it remains costly and constrained by technical trade-offs and experimental limitations. Super-resolution (SR) presents a promising computational approach to overcome these challenges by generating HR images from more affordable low-resolution (LR) scans, potentially improving diagnostic accuracy and efficiency without requiring additional hardware. This survey reviews recent advances in MRI SR techniques, with a focus on deep learning (DL) approaches. It examines DL-based MRI SR methods from the perspectives of computer vision, computational imaging, inverse problems, and MR physics, covering theoretical foundations, architectural designs, learning strategies, benchmark datasets, and performance metrics. We propose a systematic taxonomy to categorize these methods and present an in-depth study of both established and emerging SR techniques applicable to MRI, considering unique challenges in clinical and research contexts. We also highlight open challenges and directions that the community needs to address. Additionally, we provide a collection of essential open-access resources, tools, and tutorials, available on our GitHub: https://github.com/mkhateri/Awesome-MRI-Super-Resolution.
