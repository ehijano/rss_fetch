      <title>Algorithmic Detection of Jacobi Stability for Systems of Second Order Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an algorithmic approach to the analysis of Jacobi stability of systems of second order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) via the Kosambi--Cartan--Chern (KCC) theory. We develop an efficient symbolic program using Maple for computing the second KCC invariant for systems of second order ODEs in arbitrary dimension. The program allows us to systematically analyze Jacobi stability of a system of second order ODEs by means of real solving and solution classification using symbolic computation. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated by a model of wound strings, a two-dimensional airfoil model with cubic nonlinearity in supersonic flow and a 3-DOF tractor seat-operator model. The computational results on Jacobi stability of these models are further verified by numerical simulations. Moreover, our algorithmic approach allows us to detect hand-guided computation errors in published papers.</description>

      <title>Deciding summability via residues in theory and in practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In difference algebra, summability arises as a basic problem upon which rests the effective solution of other more elaborate problems, such as creative telescoping problems and the computation of Galois groups of difference equations. In 2012 Chen and Singer introduced discrete residues as a theoretical obstruction to summability for rational functions with respect to the shift and $q$-dilation difference operators. Since then analogous notions of discrete residues have been defined in other difference settings relevant for applications, such as for Mahler and elliptic shift difference operators. Very recently there have been some advances in making these theoretical obstructions computable in practice.</description>

      <title>SONC Optimization and Exact Nonnegativity Certificates via Second-Order Cone Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.07903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.07903v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The second-order cone (SOC) is a class of simple convex cones and optimizing over them can be done more efficiently than with semidefinite programming. It is interesting both in theory and in practice to investigate which convex cones admit a representation using SOCs, given that they have a strong expressive ability. In this paper, we prove constructively that the cone of sums of nonnegative circuits (SONC) admits a SOC representation. Based on this, we give a new algorithm for unconstrained polynomial optimization via SOC programming. We also provide a hybrid numeric-symbolic scheme which combines the numerical procedure with a rounding-projection algorithm to obtain exact nonnegativity certificates. Numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm for polynomials with fairly large degree and number of variables.</description>
