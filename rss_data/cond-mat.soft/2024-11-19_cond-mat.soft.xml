      <title>Drag reduction during the side-by-side motion of a pair of intruders in a granular medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When several intruders move in a granular medium, coupling effects are observed, the motion of one intruder affecting that of others. In this paper, we investigate experimentally how the drag forces acting on a pair of spherical intruders moving amid grains at constant velocity vary with the transverse separation between them and their depth. When intruders are sufficiently far apart, they do not influence each other, and the average drag felt by each of them matches that of a single intruder. However, for small distances between intruders and at a given depth, the average drag per intruder decreases, highlighting a collaborative effect that facilitates motion. This collaboration effect is amplified when the depth of the intruders increases. We propose a model for the drag reduction of a pair of intruders based on the breakup of contact chains, caused by the perturbation generated by the neighbor intruder. Our findings provide new insights into the interaction effects on the motion of solids in sand, such as those observed in animal locomotion, root growth, and soil survey.</description>

      <title>Depletion interaction between cylindrical inclusions in polymer brushes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cylindrical inclusions in mobile brushes experience apparent attraction, which arises from a tendency to minimize the depletion zone around the inclusions, thereby maximizing the overall entropy. We find that correlation blobs act as the basic units of the attraction. In tall brushes, however, the depletion zone formed above the inclusions can generate repulsion, partially offsetting the depletion attraction. Our study offers physical insights into the brush-induced depletion interaction and suggests it as a mechanism for protein cluster formation on cell surfaces.</description>

      <title>An elastoplastic model approach for the relaxation dynamics of active glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How activity affects the glassy dynamics is crucial for several biological processes. Furthermore, active glasses offer fascinating phenomenologies, extend the scope of equilibrium glasses, and can provide novel insights into the original problem. We introduce a family of novel approaches to investigating the relaxation dynamics of active glasses via an active elastoplastic model (EPM). These approaches describe the relaxation dynamics via local plastic yielding and can provide improved insights as we can study various aspects of the system separately. Activity enters the model via three crucial features: activity-mediated plastic yielding, activated barrier crossing, and persistent rotational dynamics of the yielding direction. We first consider a minimal active EPM that adds the effect of active yielding to a thermal EPM. We show that this active EPM captures the known results of active glasses within a reasonable parameter space. The results also agree well with the analytical results for active glasses when activity is small. The minimal model breaks down at very low temperatures where other effects become important. Looking at the broader model class, we demonstrate that whereas active yielding primarily dominates the relaxation dynamics, the persistence of yielding direction governs the dynamic heterogeneity in active glasses.</description>

      <title>Persistent Homology Reveals the Role of Stiffness in Forming Topological Glasses in Dense Solutions of Ring Polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ring polymers are characterized by topology-specific entanglements called threadings. In the limit of large rings, it is conjectured that a "topological glass" should emerge due to the proliferation of threadings. In this study, we used persistent homology to quantify threading structures of ring polymers with different chain stiffness and elucidate mechanisms behind topological glasses. Using coordination data from coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, we analyzed the topology of the union of virtual spheres centered on each monomer or center of mass. As the radius of each sphere increases, the corresponding points connect, giving rise to topological entities such as edges, loops, and facets. We then analyzed how the number of loops per ring chain and penetrated loops varies with sphere radius, focusing on the effects of chain stiffness and density. The results reveal that loops are larger in stiff ring chains, whereas flexible ring chains do not generate sufficiently large loops to establish a threading structure. The stiffness of ring polymer plays a significant role in the formation of topological glasses in ring polymers.</description>

      <title>Stacking correlation length in single-stranded DNA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Base stacking is crucial in nucleic acid stabilization, from DNA duplex hybridization to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) protein binding. While stacking energies are tiny in ssDNA, they are inextricably mixed with hydrogen bonding in DNA base pairing, making their measurement challenging. We conduct unzipping experiments with optical tweezers of short poly-purine (dA and alternating dG and dA) sequences of 20-40 bases. We introduce a helix-coil model of the stacking-unstacking transition that includes finite length effects and reproduces the force-extension curves. Fitting the model to the experimental data, we derive the stacking energy per base, finding the salt-independent value $\Delta G_0$ = 0.14(3) kcal/mol for poly-dA and $\Delta G_0$ = 0.07(3) kcal/mol for poly-dGdA. Stacking in these polymeric sequences is predominantly cooperative with a correlation length of $\sim4$ bases at zero force. The correlation length reaches a maximum of $\sim10$ and 5 bases at the stacking-unstacking transition force of $\sim10$ and 20 pN for poly-dA and poly-dGdA, respectively. The salt dependencies of the cooperativity parameter in ssDNA and the energy of DNA hybridization are in agreement, suggesting that double-helix stability is primarily due to stacking. Analysis of poly-rA and poly-rC RNA sequences shows a larger stacking stability but a lower stacking correlation length of $\sim2$ bases.</description>

      <title>Facilitating a 3D granular flow with an obstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring a smooth rate of efflux of particles from an outlet without unpredictable clogging events is crucial in processing powders and grains. We show by experiments and simulations that an obstacle placed near the outlet can greatly suppress clog formation in a 3-dimensional granular flow; this counterintuitive phenomenon had previously been demonstrated in 2-dimensional systems. Remarkably, clog suppression is very effective even when the obstacle cross-section is comparable to that of a single grain, and is only a small fraction of the outlet area. Data from two dissimilar obstacle shapes indicate that the underlying mechanism for clog suppression is geometric: while the magnitude of the effect can be affected by dynamical factors, the optimal location of the obstacle is determined entirely by a simple geometric rule. An optimally-placed obstacle arranges for the most-probable clogging arch to be at a perilous and unstable spot, where the local flow geometry is at a point of expansion and a slight perturbation leaves the arch without downstream support. This geometric principle does not rely on previously conjectured dynamical mechanisms and admits generalization to other agent-based and particulate systems.</description>

      <title>Computational study of active polar polymer melts: from active reptation to activity induced local alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the effects of tangent polar activity on the conformational and dynamic properties of entangled polymer melts through Langevin molecular dynamics simulations. We examine systems composed of all self-propelled, monodisperse linear chains, so that constraint release is considered. The range of activities explored here includes values where the active reptation theory is applicable, as well as higher activities that challenge the validity of the theory. Chain conformations exhibit a moderate increase in coil size increase, which becomes more pronounced at higher activity levels. Under these conditions, a local bond alignment along the chain contour appears together with a non-homogeneous segmental stretching, and orientation and stretching of the tube. Dynamically, polar activity induces a molecular-weight-independent diffusion coefficient, a transient superdiffusive behavior, and an end-to-end relaxation time inversely proportional to the molecular weight. Finally, our results are summarized in a diagram that classifies the various regimes of behavior observed in the simulations. Overall, these findings provide valuable insights into the complex interplay between activity and entanglements, advancing our understanding of active polymer systems and their potential applications across various fields.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic properties of bridging transitions in sinusoidally-shaped slits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study bridging transitions that emerge between two sinusoidally-shaped walls of amplitude $A$, wavenumber $k$, and mean separation $L$. The focus is on weakly corrugated walls to examine the properties of bridging transitions in the limit when the walls become flat. The reduction of walls roughness can be achieved in two ways which we show differ qualitatively: a) By decreasing $k$, (i.e., by increasing the system wavelength), which induces a continuous phenomenon associated with the growth of bridging films concentrated near the system necks, the thickness of with the thickness of these films diverging as $\sim k^{-2/3}$ in the limit of $k\to0$. Simultaneously, the location of the transition approaches that of capillary condensation in an infinite planar slit of an appropriate width as $\sim k^{2/3}$; b) in contrast, the limit of vanishing walls roughness by reducing $A$ cannot be considered in this context, as there exists a minimal value $A_{\rm min}(k,L)$ of the amplitude below which bridging transition does not occur. On the other hand, for amplitudes $A&gt;A_{\rm min}(k,L)$, the bridging transition always precedes global condensation in the system. These predictions, including the scaling property $A_{\rm min}\propto kL^2$, are verified numerically using density functional theory.</description>

      <title>The motion of catalytically active colloids approaching a surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Catalytic microswimmers typically swim close to walls due to hydrodynamic and/or phoretic effects. The walls in turn are known to affect their propulsion, making it difficult to single out the contributions that stem from particle-based catalytic propulsion only, thereby preventing an understanding of the propulsion mechanism. Here, we use acoustic tweezers to lift catalytically active Janus spheres away from the wall to study their motion in bulk and when approaching a wall. Mean-squared displacement analysis shows that diffusion constants at different heights match with Fax\'en's prediction for the near-wall hydrodynamic mobility. Both particles close to a substrate and in bulk show a decrease in velocity with increasing salt concentration, suggesting that the dominant factor for the decrease in speed is a reduction of the swimmer-based propulsion. The velocity-height profile follows a hydrodynamic scaling relation as well, implying a coupling between the wall and the swimming speed. The observed speed reduction upon addition of salt matches expectations from a electrokinetic theory, except for experiments in 0.1 wt% hydrogen peroxide in bulk, which could indicate contributions from a different propulsion mechanism. Our results help with the understanding of ionic effects on microswimmers in 3D and point to a coupling between the wall and the particle that affects its self-propulsion speed.</description>

      <title>Active droplets controlled by enzymatic reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of condensates is now considered as a major organization principle of eukaryotic cells. Several studies have recently shown that the properties of these condensates are affected by enzymatic reactions. We propose here a simple generic model to study the interplay between two enzyme populations and a two-state protein. In one state, the protein forms condensed droplets through attractive interactions, while in the other state, the proteins remain dispersed. Each enzyme catalyzes the production of one of these two protein states only when reactants are in its vicinity. A key feature of our model is the explicit representation of enzyme trajectories, capturing the fluctuations in their local concentrations. The spatially dependent growth rate of droplets naturally arises from the stochastic motion of these explicitly modeled enzymes.
  Using two complementary numerical methods, (1) Brownian Dynamics simulations, and (2) a hybrid method combining Cahn-Hilliard-Cook diffusion equations with Brownian Dynamics for the enzymes, we investigate how enzyme concentration and dynamics influence the evolution with time, and the steady-state number and size of droplets. Our results show that the concentration and diffusion coefficient of enzymes govern the formation and size-selection of biocondensates.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Nonequilibrium Dimerization of Model Polymer Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dimerization and subsequent aggregation of polymers and biopolymers often occur under nonequilibrium conditions. When the initial state of the polymer is not collapsed or the final folded native state, the dynamics of dimerization can follow a course sensitive to both the initial conditions and the conformational dynamics. Here we study the dimerization process by using computer simulations and analytical theory where both the two monomeric polymer chains are in the elongated state and are initially placed at a separation distance, d0. Subsequent dynamics lead to the concurrent processes of collapse, dimerization and/or escape. We employ Langevin dynamics simulations with a coarse-grained model of the polymer to capture certain aspects of the dimerization process. At separations d0 much shorter than the length of the monomeric polymer, the dimerization could happen fast and irreversibly, from the partly extended polymer state itself. At an initial separation larger than a critical distance, dc, the polymer collapse precedes dimerization and a significant number of single polymers do not dimerize within the time scale of simulations. To quantify these competition, we introduce several time-dependent order parameters, namely, (i) the time-dependent radius of gyration of individual polymers describing the conformational state of the polymer, (ii) a centre-to-centre of mass distance parameter RMM, and (iii) a time dependent overlap function Q(t) between the two monomeric polymers, mimicking contact order parameter popular in protein folding. In order to better quantify the findings, we perform a theoretical analysis to capture the stochastic processes of collapse and dimerization by using dynamical disorder model.</description>

      <title>Constrained composite Bayesian optimization for rational synthesis of polymeric particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polymeric nano- and micro-scale particles have critical roles in tackling critical healthcare and energy challenges with their miniature characteristics. However, tailoring their synthesis process to meet specific design targets has traditionally depended on domain expertise and costly trial-and-errors. Recently, modeling strategies, particularly Bayesian optimization (BO), have been proposed to aid materials discovery for maximized/minimized properties. Coming from practical demands, this study for the first time integrates constrained and composite Bayesian optimization (CCBO) to perform efficient target value optimization under black-box feasibility constraints and limited data for laboratory experimentation. Using a synthetic problem that simulates electrospraying, a model nanomanufacturing process, CCBO strategically avoided infeasible conditions and efficiently optimized particle production towards predefined size targets, surpassing standard BO pipelines and providing decisions comparable to human experts. Further laboratory experiments validated CCBO capability to guide the rational synthesis of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) particles with diameters of 300 nm and 3.0 $\mu$m via electrospraying. With minimal initial data and unknown experiment constraints, CCBO reached the design targets within 4 iterations. Overall, the CCBO approach presents a versatile and holistic optimization paradigm for next-generation target-driven particle synthesis empowered by artificial intelligence (AI).</description>

      <title>Self-Assembly of Active Bivalent Patchy Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present work, with the intent of exploring the out-of-equilibrium polymerization of active patchy particles in linear chains, we study a suspension of active bivalent Brownian particles (ABBPs). At all studied temperatures and densities, ABBPs self-assemble in aggregating chains, as opposed to the uniformly space-distributed chains observed in the corresponding passive systems. The main effect of activity, other than inducing chain aggregation, is to reduce the chain length and favor alignment of the propulsion vectors in the bonding process. At low activities, attraction dominates over activity in the bonding process, leading self-assembly to occur randomly regardless of the particle orientations.Interestingly, we find that at the lowest temperature, as density increases, chains aggregate forming a novel state: MISP, i.e., Motility-Induced Spirals, where spirals are characterised by a finite angular velocity. On the contrary, at the highest temperature, density and activity, chains aggregate forming a different novel state (a spinning crystalline cluster) characterized by a compact and hexagonal ordered structure, both translating and rotating. The rotation arises from an effective torque generated by the presence of competing domains where particles self-propel in the same direction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07833v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dip-coating geometry, where a solid plate is withdrawn from or plunged into a liquid pool, offers a prototypical example of wetting flows involving contact-line motion. Such flows are commonly studied using the lubrication approximation approach which is intrinsically limited to small interface slopes and thus small contact angles. Flows for arbitrary contact angles, however, can be studied using a generalized lubrication theory that builds upon viscous corner flow solutions. Here we derive this generalized lubrication theory for viscoelastic liquids that exhibit normal stress effects and are modelled using the second-order fluid model. We apply our theory to advancing and receding contact lines in the dip-coating geometry, highlighting the influence of viscoelastic normal stresses for contact line motion at arbitrary contact angle.</description>

      <title>CO2-induced Drastic Decharging of Dielectric Surfaces in Aqueous Suspensions</title>

Abstract: We study the influence of airborne CO2 on the charge state of carboxylate stabilized polymer latex particles suspended in aqueous electrolytes. We combine conductometric experiments interpreted in terms of Hessinger's conductivity model with Poisson-Boltzmann cell (PBC) model calculations with charge regulation boundary conditions. Without CO2, a minority of the weakly acidic surface groups are dissociated and only a fraction of the total number of counter-ions actually contribute to conductivity. The remaining counter-ions exchange freely with added other ions like Na+, K+ or Cs+. From the PBC-calculations we infer a corresponding pKa of 4.26 as well as a renormalized charge in reasonably good agreement with the number of freely mobile counter-ions. Equilibration of salt- and CO2-free suspensions against ambient air leads to a drastic de-charging, which exceeds by far the expected effects of to dissolved CO2 and its dissociation products. Further, no counter-ion-exchange is observed. To reproduce the experimental findings, we have to assume an effective pKa of 6.48. This direct influence of CO2 on the state of surface group dissociation explains our recent finding of a CO2-induced decrease of the {\zeta}-potential and supports the suggestion of an additional charge regulation caused by molecular CO2. Given the importance of charged surfaces in contact with aqueous electrolytes, we anticipate that our observations bear substantial theoretical challenges and important implications for applications ranging from desalination to bio-membranes.</description>

      <title>Finite-size Nagle-Kardar model: Casimir force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18324v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive exact results for the critical Casimir force (CCF) within the
  Nagle-Kardar model with periodic boundary conditions (PBC's). The model represents one-dimensional Ising chain with long-range equivalent-neighbor ferromagnetic interactions of strength $J_{l}/N&gt;0$ superimposed on the nearest-neighbor interactions of strength $J_{s}$ which could be either ferromagnetic ($J_{s}&gt;0$) or antiferromagnetic ($J_{s}&lt;0$). In the infinite system limit the model exhibits in the plane $(K_s=\beta J_s,K_l=\beta J_l)$ a critical line $2 K_l=\exp{\left(-2 K_s\right)}, K_s&gt;-\ln3/4$, which ends at a tricritical point $(K_l=-\sqrt{3}/2, K_s=-\ln3/4)$. The critical Casimir amplitudes are: $\Delta_{\rm Cas}^{\rm (cr)}=1/4$ at the critical line, and $\Delta_{\rm Cas}^{\rm (tr)}=1/3$ at the tricritical point. Quite unexpectedly, with the imposed PBC's the CCF exhibits very unusual behavior as a function of temperature and magnetic field. It is \textit{repulsive} near the critical line and tricritical point, decaying rapidly with separation from those two singular regimes fast away from them and becoming \textit{attractive}, displaying in which the maximum amplitude of the attraction exceeds the maximum amplitude of repulsion.
  This represents a violation of the widely-accepted ``boundary condition rule,'' which holds that the CCF is attractive for equivalent BC's and repulsive for conflicting BC's \textit{independently} of the actual bulk universality class of the phase transition under investigation.</description>
