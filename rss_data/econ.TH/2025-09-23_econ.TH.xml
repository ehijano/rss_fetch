      <title>Bundling against Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A monopolist sells multiple goods to an uninformed buyer. The buyer chooses to learn any one-dimensional linear signal of their values for the goods, anticipating the seller's mechanism. The seller designs an optimal mechanism, anticipating the buyer's learning choice. In a generalized Gaussian environment, we show that every equilibrium has vertical learning where the buyer's posterior means are comonotonic, and every equilibrium is outcome-equivalent to nested bundling where the seller offers a menu of nested bundles. In equilibrium, the buyer learns more about a higher-tier good, resulting in a higher posterior variance on the log scale.</description>

      <title>Mean-tail Gini framework for optimal portfolio selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The limitations of the traditional mean-variance (MV) efficient frontier, as introduced by Markowitz (1952), have been extensively documented in the literature. Specifically, the assumptions of normally distributed returns or quadratic investor preferences are often unrealistic in practice. Moreover, variance is not always an appropriate risk measure, particularly for heavy-tailed and highly volatile distributions, such as those observed in insurance claims and cryptocurrency markets, which may exhibit infinite variance. To address these issues, Shalit and Yitzhaki (2005) proposed a mean-Gini (MG) framework for portfolio selection, which requires only finite first moments and accommodates non-normal return distributions.
  However, downside risk measures - such as tail variance - are generally considered more appropriate for capturing risk managers' risk preference than symmetric measures like variance or Gini. In response, we introduce a novel portfolio optimization framework based on a downside risk metric: the tail Gini. In the first part of the paper, we develop the mean-tail Gini (MTG) efficient frontier. Under the assumption of left-tail exchangeability, we derive closed-form solutions for the optimal portfolio weights corresponding to given expected returns. In the second part, we conduct an empirical study of the mean-tail variance (MTV) and MTG frontiers using data from equity and cryptocurrency markets. By fitting the empirical data to a generalized Pareto distribution, the estimated tail indices provide evidence of infinite-variance distributions in the cryptocurrency market. Additionally, the MTG approach demonstrates superior performance over MTV strategy by mitigating the amplification distortions induced by $\mathrm{L}^2$-norm risk measures. The MTG framework helps avoid overly aggressive investment strategies, thereby reducing exposure to unforeseen losses.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Non-T\^atonnement Processes and the Attraction Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I characterize stochastic non-t\^atonnement processes (SNTP) and argue that they are a natural outcome of General Equilibrium Theory. To do so, I revisit the classical demand theory to define a normalized Walrasian demand and a diffeomorphism that flattens indifference curves. These diffeomorphisms are applied on the three canonical manifolds in the consumption domain (i.e., the indifference and the offer hypersurfaces and the trade hyperplane) to analyze their images in the normalized and the flat domains. In addition, relations to the set of Pareto optimal allocations on Arrow-Debreu and overlapping generations economies are discussed. Then, I derive, for arbitrary non-t\^atonnement processes, an Attraction Principle based on the dynamics of marginal substitution rates seen in the "floor" of the flat domain. This motivates the definition of SNTP and, specifically, of Bayesian ones (BSNTP). When all utility functions are attractive and sharp, these BSNTP are particularly well behaved and lead directly to the calculation of stochastic trade outcomes over the contract curve, which are used to model price stickiness and markets' responses to sustained economic disequilibrium, and to prove a stochastic version of the First Welfare Theorem.</description>

      <title>On the Existence and Complexity of Core-Stable Data Exchanges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of data-driven technologies and the emergence of various data-sharing paradigms have underscored the need for efficient and stable data exchange protocols. In any such exchange, agents must carefully balance the benefit of acquiring valuable data against the cost of sharing their own. Ensuring stability in these exchanges is essential to prevent agents -- or groups of agents -- from departing and conducting local (and potentially more favorable) exchanges among themselves. To address this, we study a model where agents participate in a data exchange. Each agent has an associated payoff for the data acquired from other agents and a cost incurred during sharing its own data. The net utility of an agent is payoff minus the cost. We adapt the classical notion of core-stability from cooperative game theory to data exchange. A data exchange is core-stable if no subset of agents has any incentive to deviate to a different exchange. We show that a core-stable data exchange is guaranteed to exist when agents have concave payoff functions and convex cost functions -- a setting typical in domains like PAC learning and random discovery models. We show that relaxing either of the foregoing conditions may result in the nonexistence of core-stable data exchanges. Then, we prove that finding a core-stable exchange is PPAD-hard, even when the potential blocking coalitions are restricted to constant size. To the best of our knowledge, this provides the first known PPAD-hardness result for core-like guarantees in data economics. Finally, we show that data exchange can be modelled as a balanced $n$-person game. This immediately gives a pivoting algorithm via Scarf's theorem \cite{Scarf1967core}. We show that the pivoting algorithm works well in practice through our empirical results.</description>

      <title>A game played by tandem-running ants: Hint of procedural rationality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Navigation through narrow passages during colony relocation by the tandem-running ants, $\textit{Diacamma}$ $\textit{indicum}$, is a tour de force of biological traffic coordination. Even on one-lane paths, the ants tactfully manage a bidirectional flow: Informed individuals (termed leaders) guide nest-mates (termed followers) from a suboptimal nest to a new optimal nest, and then return to recruit additional followers. We propose that encounters between the ants moving in opposite directions can be modelled within the framework of game theory leading to an understanding of the mechanism behind observed behaviours. Our experiments reveal that, upon encountering a tandem pair (a leader and its follower) on a narrow path, the returning leader reverses her direction and proceeds toward the new nest again as if she becomes the leader guiding a follower. This observed behaviour is consistent with game-theoretic predictions, provided the assumption of perfect rationality is relaxed in favour of bounded rationality -- specifically, procedural rationality. In other words, the experimental outcomes are consistent with sampling equilibrium but not with Nash equilibrium. Our work, which strives to induct the essence of behavioural game theory into the world of ants, is first ever report of realizing sampling equilibrium in scenarios not involving human players.</description>

      <title>A Reexamination of Proof Approaches for the Impossibility Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06753v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Revised proofs of Kenneth Arrow's impossibility theorem have been presented in prose form, incorporating novel ideas such as decisive sets and pivotal voters. This study develops another approach to proving the theorem. Using a proof calculus in formal logic, we construct a proof with a full mathematical representation. While previous proofs emphasize intuitive accessibility, this one focuses on meticulous derivation and reveals the global structure of the social welfare function central to the theorem.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Beta: A Causal Take on CAPM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The CAPM regression is typically interpreted as if the market return contemporaneously \emph{causes} individual returns, motivating beta-neutral portfolios and factor attribution. For realized equity returns, however, this interpretation is inconsistent: a same-period arrow $R_{m,t} \to R_{i,t}$ conflicts with the fact that $R_m$ is itself a value-weighted aggregate of its constituents, unless $R_m$ is lagged or leave-one-out -- the ``aggregator contradiction.'' We formalize CAPM as a structural causal model and analyze the admissible three-node graphs linking an external driver $Z$, the market $R_m$, and an asset $R_i$. The empirically plausible baseline is a \emph{fork}, $Z \to \{R_m, R_i\}$, not $R_m \to R_i$. In this setting, OLS beta reflects not a causal transmission, but an attenuated proxy for how well $R_m$ captures the underlying driver $Z$. Consequently, ``beta-neutral'' portfolios can remain exposed to macro or sectoral shocks, and hedging on $R_m$ can import index-specific noise. Using stylized models and large-cap U.S.\ equity data, we show that contemporaneous betas act like proxies rather than mechanisms; any genuine market-to-stock channel, if at all, appears only at a lag and with modest economic significance. The practical message is clear: CAPM should be read as associational. Risk management and attribution should shift from fixed factor menus to explicitly declared causal paths, with ``alpha'' reserved for what remains invariant once those causal paths are explicitly blocked.</description>

      <title>Dominated Actions in Imperfect-Information Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09716v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dominance is a fundamental concept in game theory. In strategic-form games dominated strategies can be identified in polynomial time. As a consequence, iterative removal of dominated strategies can be performed efficiently as a preprocessing step for reducing the size of a game before computing a Nash equilibrium. For imperfect-information games in extensive form, we could convert the game to strategic form and then iteratively remove dominated strategies in the same way; however, this conversion may cause an exponential blowup in game size. In this paper we define and study the concept of dominated actions in imperfect-information games. Our main result is a polynomial-time algorithm for determining whether an action is dominated (strictly or weakly) by any mixed strategy in n-player games, which can be extended to an algorithm for iteratively removing dominated actions. This allows us to efficiently reduce the size of the game tree as a preprocessing step for Nash equilibrium computation. We explore the role of dominated actions empirically in the "All In or Fold" No-Limit Texas Hold'em poker variant.</description>

      <title>On the Identification of Diagnostic Expectations: Econometric Insights from DSGE Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08472v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper provides the first econometric evidence for diagnostic expectations (DE) in DSGE models. Using the identification framework of Qu and Tkachenko (2017), I show that DE generate dynamics unreplicable under rational expectations (RE), with no RE parameterization capable of matching the autocovariance implied by DE. Consequently, DE are not observationally equivalent to RE and constitute an endogenous source of macroeconomic fluctuations, distinct from both structural frictions and exogenous shocks. From an econometric perspective, DE preserve overall model identification but weaken the identification of shock variances. To ensure robust conclusions across estimation methods and equilibrium conditions, I extend Bayesian estimation with Sequential Monte Carlo sampling to the indeterminacy domain. These findings advance the econometric study of expectations and highlight the macroeconomic relevance of diagnostic beliefs.</description>
