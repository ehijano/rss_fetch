      <title>Molecular glues stabilize water-mediated hydrogen bonds in ternary complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By stabilizing weak and transient protein-protein interactions (PPIs), molecular glues address the challenge of targeting proteins previously considered undruggable. Rapamycin and WDB002 are molecular glues that bind to FK506-binding protein (FKBP12) and target the FKBP12-rapamycin-associated protein (FRAP) and the centrosomal protein 250 (CEP250), respectively. Here, we used molecular dynamics simulations to gain insights into the effects of molecular glues on protein conformation and PPIs. The molecular glues modulated protein flexibility, leading to less flexibility in some regions, and changed the pattern and stability of water-mediated hydrogen bonds between the proteins. Our findings highlight the importance of considering water-mediated hydrogen bonds in developing strategies for the rational design of molecular glues.</description>

      <title>How Do Proteins Fold?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How proteins fold remains a central unsolved problem in biology. While the idea of a folding code embedded in the amino acid sequence was introduced more than 6 decades ago, this code remains undefined. While we now have powerful predictive tools to predict the final native structure of proteins, we still lack a predictive framework for how sequences dictate folding pathways. Two main conceptual models dominate as explanations of folding mechanism: the funnel model, in which folding proceeds through many alternative routes on a rugged, hyperdimensional energy landscape; and the foldon model, which proposes a hierarchical sequence of discrete intermediates. Recent advances on two fronts are now enabling folding studies in unprecedented ways. Powerful experimental approaches; in particular, single-molecule force spectroscopy and hydrogen (deuterium exchange assays) allow time-resolved tracking of the folding process at high resolution. At the same time, computational breakthroughs culminating in algorithms such as AlphaFold have revolutionized static structure prediction, opening opportunities to extend machine learning toward dynamics. Together, these developments mark a turning point: for the first time, we are positioned to resolve how proteins fold, why they misfold, and how this knowledge can be harnessed for biology and medicine.</description>

      <title>The transitional kinetics between open and closed Rep structures can be tuned by salt via two intermediate states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DNA helicases undergo conformational changes; however, their structural dynamics are poorly understood. Here, we study single molecules of superfamily 1A DNA helicase Rep, which undergo conformational transitions during bacterial DNA replication, repair and recombination. We use time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC), fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), rapid single-molecule F\"orster resonance energy transfer (smFRET), Anti-Brownian ELectrokinetic (ABEL) trapping and molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) to provide unparalleled temporal and spatial resolution of Rep's domain movements. We detect four states revealing two hitherto hidden intermediates (S2, S3), between the open (S1) and closed (S4) structures, whose stability is salt dependent. Rep's open-to-closed switch involves multiple changes to all four subdomains 1A, 1B, 2A and 2B along the S1 to S2 to S3 to S4 transitional pathway comprising an initial truncated swing of 2B which then rolls across the 1B surface, following by combined rotations of 1B, 2A and 2B. High forward and reverse rates for S1 to S2 suggest that 1B may act to frustrate 2B movement to prevent premature Rep closure in the absence of DNA. These observations support a more general binding model for accessory DNA helicases that utilises conformational plasticity to explore a multiplicity of structures whose landscape can be tuned by salt prior to locking-in upon DNA binding.</description>

      <title>The Demon Hidden Behind Life's Ultra-Energy-Efficient Information Processing -- Demonstrated by Biological Molecular Motors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The remarkable progress of artificial intelligence (AI) has revealed the enormous energy demands of modern digital architectures, raising deep concerns about sustainability. In stark contrast, the human brain operates efficiently on only ~20 watts, and individual cells process gigabit-scale genetic information using energy on the order of trillionths of a watt. Under the same energy budget, a general-purpose digital processor can perform only a few simple operations per second. This striking disparity suggests that biological systems follow algorithms fundamentally distinct from conventional computation. The framework of information thermodynamics-especially Maxwell's demon and the Szilard engine-offers a theoretical clue, setting the lower bound of energy required for information processing. However, digital processors exceed this limit by about six orders of magnitude. Recent single-molecule studies have revealed that biological molecular motors convert Brownian motion into mechanical work, realizing a "demon-like" operational principle. These findings suggest that living systems have already implemented an ultra-efficient information-energy conversion mechanism that transcends digital computation. Here, we experimentally establish a quantitative correspondence between positional information (bits) and mechanical work, demonstrating that molecular machines selectively exploit rare but functional fluctuations arising from Brownian motion to achieve ATP-level energy efficiency. This integration of information, energy, and timescale indicates that life realizes a Maxwell's demon-like mechanism for energy-efficient information processing.</description>
