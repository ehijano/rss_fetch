      <title>A Powerful Chi-Square Specification Test with Support Vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Specification tests, such as Integrated Conditional Moment (ICM) and Kernel Conditional Moment (KCM) tests, are crucial for model validation but often lack power in finite samples. This paper proposes a novel framework to enhance specification test performance using Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for direction learning. We introduce two alternative SVM-based approaches: one maximizes the discrepancy between nonparametric and parametric classes, while the other maximizes the separation between residuals and the origin. Both approaches lead to a $t$-type test statistic that converges to a standard chi-square distribution under the null hypothesis. Our method is computationally efficient and capable of detecting any arbitrary alternative. Simulation studies demonstrate its superior performance compared to existing methods, particularly in large-dimensional settings.</description>

      <title>Causal Inference in Counterbalanced Within-Subjects Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experimental designs are fundamental for estimating causal effects. In some fields, within-subjects designs, which expose participants to both control and treatment at different time periods, are used to address practical and logistical concerns. Counterbalancing, a common technique in within-subjects designs, aims to remove carryover effects by randomizing treatment sequences. Despite its appeal, counterbalancing relies on the assumption that carryover effects are symmetric and cancel out, which is often unverifiable a priori. In this paper, we formalize the challenges of counterbalanced within-subjects designs using the potential outcomes framework. We introduce sequential exchangeability as an additional identification assumption necessary for valid causal inference in these designs. To address identification concerns, we propose diagnostic checks, the use of washout periods, and covariate adjustments, and alternative experimental designs to counterbalanced within-subjects design. Our findings demonstrate the limitations of counterbalancing and provide guidance on when and how within-subjects designs can be appropriately used for causal inference.</description>

      <title>Automatic Debiased Estimation with Machine Learning-Generated Regressors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.10643v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many parameters of interest in economics and other social sciences depend on generated regressors. Examples in economics include structural parameters in models with endogenous variables estimated by control functions and in models with sample selection, treatment effect estimation with propensity score matching, and marginal treatment effects. More recently, Machine Learning (ML) generated regressors are becoming ubiquitous for these and other applications such as imputation with missing regressors, dimension reduction, including autoencoders, learned proxies, confounders and treatments, and for feature engineering with unstructured data, among others. We provide the first general method for valid inference with regressors generated from ML. Inference with generated regressors is complicated by the very complex expression for influence functions and asymptotic variances. Additionally, ML-generated regressors may lead to large biases in downstream inferences. To address these problems, we propose Automatic Locally Robust/debiased GMM estimators in a general three-step setting with ML-generated regressors. We illustrate our results with treatment effects and counterfactual parameters in the partially linear and nonparametric models with ML-generated regressors. We provide sufficient conditions for the asymptotic normality of our debiased GMM estimators and investigate their finite-sample performance through Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Debiased Machine Learning of Aggregated Intersection Bounds and Other Causal Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.00982v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel framework of aggregated intersection of regression functions, where the target parameter is obtained by averaging the minimum (or maximum) of a collection of regression functions over the covariate space. Such quantities include the lower and upper bounds on distributional effects (Frechet-Hoeffding, Makarov) and the optimal welfare in the statistical treatment choice problem. The proposed estimator -- the envelope score estimator -- is shown to have an oracle property, where the oracle knows the identity of the minimizer for each covariate value. I apply this result to the bounds in the Roy model and the Horowitz-Manski-Lee bounds with a discrete outcome. The proposed approach performs well empirically on the data from the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment.</description>

      <title>Cross-sectional Dependence in Idiosyncratic Volatility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces an econometric framework for analyzing cross-sectional dependence in the idiosyncratic volatilities of assets using high frequency data. We first consider the estimation of standard measures of dependence in the idiosyncratic volatilities such as covariances and correlations. Naive estimators of these measures are biased due to the use of the error-laden estimates of idiosyncratic volatilities. We provide bias-corrected estimators and the relevant asymptotic theory. Next, we introduce an idiosyncratic volatility factor model, in which we decompose the variation in idiosyncratic volatilities into two parts: the variation related to the systematic factors such as the market volatility, and the residual variation. Again, naive estimators of the decomposition are biased, and we provide bias-corrected estimators. We also provide the asymptotic theory that allows us to test whether the residual (non-systematic) components of the idiosyncratic volatilities exhibit cross-sectional dependence. We apply our methodology to the S&amp;P 100 index constituents, and document strong cross-sectional dependence in their idiosyncratic volatilities. We consider two different sets of idiosyncratic volatility factors, and find that neither can fully account for the cross-sectional dependence in idiosyncratic volatilities. For each model, we map out the network of dependencies in residual (non-systematic) idiosyncratic volatilities across all stocks.</description>

      <title>Non-linear dependence and Granger causality: A vine copula approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by Jang et al. (2022), we propose a Granger causality-in-the-mean test for bivariate $k-$Markov stationary processes based on a recently introduced class of non-linear models, i.e., vine copula models. By means of a simulation study, we show that the proposed test improves on the statistical properties of the original test in Jang et al. (2022), and also of other previous methods, constituting an excellent tool for testing Granger causality in the presence of non-linear dependence structures. Finally, we apply our test to study the pairwise relationships between energy consumption, GDP and investment in the U.S. and, notably, we find that Granger-causality runs two ways between GDP and energy consumption.</description>

      <title>An Analysis of the Relationship Between the Characteristics of Innovative Consumers and the Degree of Serious Leisure in User Innovation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study examines the relationship between the concept of serious leisure and user innovation. We adopted the characteristics of innovative consumers identified by Luthje (2004)-product use experience, information exchange, and new product adoption speed-to analyze their correlation with serious leisure engagement. The analysis utilized consumer behavior survey data from the "Marketing Analysis Contest 2023" sponsored by Nomura Research Institute, examining the relationship between innovative consumer characteristics and the degree of serious leisure (Serious Leisure Inventory and Measure: SLIM). Since the contest data did not directly measure innovative consumer characteristics or serious leisure engagement, we established alternative variables for quantitative analysis. The results showed that the SLIM alternative variable had positive correlations with diverse product experiences and early adoption of new products. However, no clear relationship was found with information exchange among consumers. These findings suggest that serious leisure practice may serve as a potential antecedent to user innovation. The leisure career perspective of the serious leisure concept may capture the motivations of user innovators that Okada and Nishikawa (2019) identified.</description>

      <title>A New Design-Based Variance Estimator for Finely Stratified Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10851v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of design-based inference for the average treatment effect in finely stratified experiments. Here, by "design-based'' we mean that the only source of uncertainty stems from the randomness in treatment assignment; by "finely stratified'' we mean that units are stratified into groups of a fixed size according to baseline covariates and then, within each group, a fixed number of units are assigned uniformly at random to treatment and the remainder to control. In this setting we present a novel estimator of the variance of the difference-in-means based on pairing "adjacent" strata. Importantly, our estimator is well defined even in the challenging setting where there is exactly one treated or control unit per stratum. We prove that our estimator is upward-biased, and thus can be used for inference under mild restrictions on the finite population. We compare our estimator with some well-known estimators that have been proposed previously in this setting, and demonstrate that, while these estimators are also upward-biased, our estimator has smaller bias and therefore leads to more precise inferences whenever adjacent strata are sufficiently similar. To further understand when our estimator leads to more precise inferences, we introduce a framework motivated by a thought experiment in which the finite population is modeled as having been drawn once in an i.i.d. fashion from a well-behaved probability distribution. In this framework, we argue that our estimator dominates the others in terms of limiting bias and that these improvements are strict except under strong restrictions on the treatment effects. Finally, we illustrate the practical relevance of our theoretical results through a simulation study, which reveals that our estimator can in fact lead to substantially more precise inferences, especially when the quality of stratification is high.</description>

      <title>Welfare Analysis in Dynamic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.09173</link>
      <description>arXiv:1908.09173v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces metrics for welfare analysis in dynamic models. We develop estimation and inference for these parameters even in the presence of a high-dimensional state space. Examples of welfare metrics include average welfare, average marginal welfare effects, and welfare decompositions into direct and indirect effects similar to Oaxaca (1973) and Blinder (1973). We derive dual and doubly robust representations of welfare metrics that facilitate debiased inference. For average welfare, the value function does not have to be estimated. In general, debiasing can be applied to any estimator of the value function, including neural nets, random forests, Lasso, boosting, and other high-dimensional methods. In particular, we derive Lasso and Neural Network estimators of the value function and associated dynamic dual representation and establish associated mean square convergence rates for these functions. Debiasing is automatic in the sense that it only requires knowledge of the welfare metric of interest, not the form of bias correction. The proposed methods are applied to estimate a dynamic behavioral model of teacher absenteeism in \cite{DHR} and associated average teacher welfare.</description>

      <title>Functional Partial Least-Squares: Adaptive Estimation and Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11134v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the functional linear regression model with a scalar response and a Hilbert space-valued predictor, a canonical example of an ill-posed inverse problem. We show that the functional partial least squares (PLS) estimator attains nearly minimax-optimal convergence rates over a class of ellipsoids and propose an adaptive early stopping procedure for selecting the number of PLS components. In addition, we develop new test that can detect local alternatives converging at the parametric rate which can be inverted to construct confidence sets. Simulation results demonstrate that the estimator performs favorably relative to several existing methods and the proposed test exhibits good power properties. We apply our methodology to evaluate the nonlinear effects of temperature on corn and soybean yields.</description>
