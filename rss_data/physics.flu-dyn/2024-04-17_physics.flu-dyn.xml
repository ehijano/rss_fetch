      <title>Is a direct numerical simulation (DNS) of Navier-Stokes equations with small enough grid spacing and time-step definitely reliable/correct?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditionally, results given by the direct numerical simulation (DNS) of Navier-Stokes equations are widely regarded as reliable benchmark solutions of turbulence, as long as grid spacing is fine enough (i.e. less than the minimum Kolmogorov scale) and time-step is small enough, say, satisfying the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition. Is this really true? In this paper a two-dimensional sustained turbulent Kolmogorov flow is investigated numerically by the two numerical methods with detailed comparisons: one is the traditional `direct numerical simulation' (DNS), the other is the `clean numerical simulation' (CNS). The results given by DNS are a kind of mixture of the false numerical noise and the true physical solution, which however are mostly at the same order of magnitude due to the butterfly-effect of chaos. On the contrary, the false numerical noise of the results given by CNS is much smaller than the true physical solution of turbulence in a long enough interval of time so that a CNS result is very close to the true physical solution and thus can be used as a benchmark solution. It is found that numerical noise as a kind of artificial tiny disturbances can lead to huge deviations at large scale on the two-dimensional Kolmogorov turbulence, not only quantitatively (even in statistics) but also qualitatively (such as symmetry of flow). Thus, fine enough spatial grid spacing with small enough time-step alone cannot guarantee the validity of the DNS: it is only a necessary condition but not sufficient. This finding might challenge some assumptions in investigation of turbulence. So, DNS results of a few sustained turbulent flows might have huge deviations on both of small and large scales from the true solution of Navier-Stokes equations even in statistics. Hopefully, CNS as a new tool to investigate turbulent flows more accurately than DNS could bring us some new discoveries.</description>

      <title>Synchronous PIV measurements of a self-powered blood turbine and pump couple for right ventricle support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A blood turbine-pump system (iATVA), resembling a turbocharger was proposed as a mechanical right-heart assist device without external drive power. In this study, the iATVA system is investigated with particular emphasis on the blood turbine flow dynamics. A time-resolved 2D particle image velocimetry (PIV) set-up equipped with a beam splitter and two high speed cameras, allowed simultaneous recordings from both the turbine and pump impellers at 7 different phased-locked instances. The iATVA prototype is 3D printed using an optically clear resin following our earlier PIV protocols. Results showed that magnetically coupled impellers operated synchronously. As the turbine flow rate increased from 1.6 to 2.4 LPM, the rotational speed and relative inlet flow angle increase from 630 to 900 rpm, and 38 to 55% respectively. At the trailing edges, backflow region spanned 3/5 of the total passage outlet flow, and an extra leakage flow was observed at the leading edge. For this initial turbine design, approximately, 75% of the turbine blade passage was not contributing to the impulse operation mode. The maximum non-wall shear rate was ~2288 s-1 near to the inlet exit, which is significantly lower than the commercial blood pumps, encouraging further research and blood experiments of this novel concept. Experimental results will improve the hydrodynamic design of the turbine impeller and volute regions and will be useful in computational fluid dynamics validation studies of similar passive devices.</description>

      <title>Onsager's "Ideal Turbulence" Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lars Onsager in 1945-1949 made an exact analysis of the high Reynolds-number limit for individual turbulent flow realizations modeled by incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, motivated by experimental observations that dissipation of kinetic energy does not vanish. I review here developments spurred by his key idea, that such flows are well-described by distributional or "weak" solutions of ideal Euler equations. 1/3 H\"older singularities of the velocity field were predicted by Onsager and since observed. His theory describes turbulent energy cascade without probabilistic assumptions and yields a local, deterministic version of the Kolmogorov 4/5th law. The approach is closely related to renormalization group methods in physics and envisages "conservation-law anomalies", as discovered later in quantum field theory. There are also deep connections with Large-Eddy Simulation modeling. More recently, dissipative Euler solutions of the type conjectured by Onsager have been constructed and his 1/3 H\"older singularity proved to be the sharp threshold for anomalous dissipation. This progress has been achieved by an unexpected connection with work of John Nash on isometric embeddings of low regularity or "convex integration" techniques. The dissipative Euler solutions yielded by this method are wildly non-unique for fixed initial data, suggesting "spontaneously stochastic" behavior of high-Reynolds number solutions. I focus in particular on applications to wall-bounded turbulence, leading to novel concepts of spatial cascades of momentum, energy and vorticity to or from the wall as deterministic, space-time local phenomena. This theory thus makes testable predictions and offers new perspectives on Large-Eddy Simulation in presence of solid walls.</description>

      <title>Investigations on Projection-Based Reduced Order Model Development for Rotating Detonation Engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current study aims to evaluate and investigate the development of projection-based reduced-order models (ROMs) for efficient and accurate RDE simulations. Specifically, we focus on assessing the projection-based ROM construction utilizing three different approaches: the linear static basis, nonlinear quadratic basis, and an adaptive model order reduction (MOR) formulation. First, an ~\textit{a priori} analysis is performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the linear static and nonlinear quadratic bases in representing the detonation-wave dynamics. The~\textit{a priori} analysis reveals that compared to the linear basis, the nonlinear quadratic basis provides significantly improved representation of detonation-wave dynamics within the training regime. However, it exhibits limited capabilities in representing the dynamics beyond the training regime, either in the future state or under a different operating parameter (i.e., inlet velocity). Second, the investigations proceed to the adaptive MOR formulation, which constructs an \textit{online} adaptive ROM with a small amount of offline training data. It is demonstrated that the adaptive ROM can provide significantly enhanced predictive capabilities in modeling the RDE dynamics in the future state, and subject to parametric variations. More importantly, the adaptive ROM is shown to be capable of capturing the initial transience in establishing the detonation wave.</description>

      <title>1D solutions for compressible two-phase flows in a heated and cooled duct: mechanical equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analytical/quasi-analytical solutions are proposed for a steady, compressible, two-phase flow in mechanical equilibrium in a rectilinear duct subjected to heating followed by cooling. The flow is driven by the pressure ratio between a variable outlet pressure and an upstream tank. A critical pressure ratio distinguishes subsonic and supersonic outlet regimes: the article proposes a methodology to determine the full flow behaviour, as a function of pressure ratio and heat-flux distribution. Going forward, these analytical reference solutions will help validate numerical codes for more complex industrial applications. Specific results are studied for a mixture of liquid water and water vapour.</description>

      <title>Integrating Discrete Sub-grid Filters with Discretization-Corrected Particle Strength Exchange Method for High Reynolds Number Flow Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a discrete filter for subgrid-scale (SGS) model, coupled with the discretization corrected particle strength exchange (DC-PSE) method for the simulation of three-dimensional viscous incompressible flow, at high Reynolds flows. The majority of turbulence modelling techniques, particularly in complex geometries, face significant computational challenges due to the difficulties in implementing 3-D convolution operations for asymmetric boundary conditions or curved domain boundaries. In this contribution Taylor expansion is used to define differential operators corresponding to the convolution filter, so that the transfer function remains very close to the unity of sizeable displacement in wave number, making the filter a good approximation to the convolution one. A discrete Gaussian filter, in both fourth and second-order forms, was evaluated with varying ratios of particle spacing to the cut-off length. The impact of the filter's order and the ratio's value is thoroughly examined and detailed in the study. Additionally, the Brinkman penalisation technique is employed to impose boundary conditions implicitly, allowing for efficient and accurate flow simulations around complex geometries without the need for modifying the numerical method or computational domain. The incompressible flow is governed by the the he Entropically Damped Artificial Compressibility equations allowing explicit simulation of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is validated through several benchmark problems, including isotropic turbulence decay, and flow around four cylinders arranged in a square in-line configuration. These test cases demonstrate the method's accuracy in capturing the intricate flow structures characteristic of high Reynolds number flows, highlighting its applicability to industrial turbulence modeling.</description>

      <title>Friction and heat transfer in forced air convection with variable physical properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a theoretical framework for predicting friction and heat transfer coefficients in variable-properties forced air convection. Drawing from concepts in high-speed wall turbulence, which also involves significant temperature, viscosity, and density variations, we utilize the mean momentum balance and mean thermal balance equations to develop integral transformations that account for the impact of variable fluid properties. These transformations are then applied inversely to predict the friction and heat transfer coefficients, leveraging the universality of passive scalars transport theory. Our proposed approach is validated using a comprehensive dataset from direct numerical simulations, covering both heating and cooling conditions up to a friction Reynolds number of approximately $\Rey_\tau\approx 3200$. The predicted friction and heat transfer coefficients closely match DNS data with an accuracy margin of 1-2\%, representing a significant improvement over the current state of the art.</description>

      <title>Efficient point-based simulation of four-way coupled particles in turbulence at high number density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many natural and industrial applications, turbulent flows encompass some form of dispersed particles. Although this type of multiphase turbulent flow is omnipresent, its numerical modeling has proven to be a remarkably challenging problem. Models that fully resolve the particle phase are computationally very expensive, strongly limiting the number of particles that can be considered in practice. This warrants the need for efficient reduced order modeling of the complex system of particles in turbulence that can handle high number densities of particles. Here, we present an efficient method for point-based simulation of particles in turbulence that are four-way coupled. In contrast with traditional one-way coupled simulations, where only the effect of the fluid phase on the particle phase is modeled, this method additionally captures the back-reaction of the particle phase on the fluid phase, as well as the interactions between particles themselves. We focus on the most challenging case of very light particles or bubbles, which show strong clustering in the high-vorticity regions of the fluid. This strong clustering poses numerical difficulties which are systematically treated in our work. Our method is valid in the limit of small particles with respect to the Kolmogorov scales of the flow and is able to handle very large number densities of particles. This methods paves the way for comprehensive studies of the collective effect of small particles in fluid turbulence for a multitude of applications.</description>

      <title>Numerical validation of the inverse cascade of surface gravity wave action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report numerical simulations of surface gravity waves forced at small scale and the subsequent inverse cascade of wave action. We combine the spectral approach to simulating weakly nonlinear waves with the capabilities of modern Graphics Processing Units to reach unprecedented scale separation between the forcing and domain scales. The resulting broad inertial range allows for an unambiguous confirmation of the theoretical prediction for the spectrum in the inverse cascade regime, both in terms of spectral index and dependence of the spectral level on the action flux.</description>

      <title>Scaling Law Breaking in Unequal-size Droplet Coalescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This Letter examines the coalescence of two unequal-size spherical liquid droplets in the inviscid regime. We find that the liquid bridge evolution exhibits a breaking from the classical 1/2 power-law scaling [Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 164503 (2005)]. Employing an energy balance analysis, we attain a theoretical model to collapse bridge evolution data of different droplet size ratios. This model reveals an exponential dependence of the bridge's radial growth on time, which is intrinsically scaling-free owing to the asymmetric movement of the liquid bridge.</description>

      <title>Influence of temperature-dependent density inhomogeneity on the stability of atmospheric stratified fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stability of atmospheric stratified fluids is revisited to study the influence of the temperature-dependent density inhomogeneity due to thermal expansion in the Earth's lower atmosphere (with heights $0$ to $50$ km) under the action of gravity. Previous theory in the literature [Phys. Lett. A 480 (2023) 128990] is modified and advanced. It is found that the Brunt-V{\"a}is{\"a}l{\"a} frequency associated with internal gravity waves is modified, leading to new instability conditions of vertically stratified fluids. The possibility of the onset of Rayleigh-B{\'e}nard convective instability is also discussed, and the influences of the modified Brunt-V{\"a}is{\"a}l{\"a} frequency and the density and temperature gradients on the instability growth rates are studied.</description>

      <title>Hypersonic limit for steady compressible Euler flows passing straight cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the hypersonic limit for steady, uniform, and compressible polytropic gas passing a symmetric straight cone. By considering Radon measure solutions, we show that as the Mach number of the upstream flow tends to infinity, the measures associated with the weak entropy solution containing an attached shock ahead of the cone converge vaguely to the measures associated with a Radon measure solution to the conical hypersonic-limit flow. This justifies the Newtonian sine-squared pressure law for cones in hypersonic aerodynamics. For Chaplygin gas, assuming that the Mach number of the incoming flow is less than a finite critical value, we demonstrate that the vertex angle of the leading shock is independent of the conical body's vertex angle and is totally determined by the incoming flow's Mach number. If the Mach number exceeds the critical value, we explicitly construct a Radon measure solution with a concentration boundary layer.</description>

      <title>The Structure of Turbulence in Pulsatile Flow over Urban Canopies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transport of energy, mass, and momentum in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) is regulated by coherent structures. Although past studies have primarily focused on stationary ABL flows, the majority of real-world ABL flows are non-stationary, and a thorough examination of coherent structures under such conditions is lacking. To fill this gap, this study examines the topological changes in ABL turbulence induced by non-stationarity and their effects on momentum transport. Results from a large-eddy simulation of pulsatile open channel flow over an array of surface-mounted cuboids are examined with a focus on the inertial sublayer, and contrasted to those from a corresponding constant pressure gradient case. The analysis reveals that flow pulsation primarily affects the ejection-sweep pattern. Inspection of the instantaneous turbulence structures, two-point autocorrelations, and conditionally-averaged flow fields shows that such a pattern is primarily influenced by the phase-dependent shear rate. From a turbulence structure perspective, this influence is attributed to the changes in the geometry of hairpin vortices. An increase (decrease) in the shear rate intensifies (relaxes) the hairpin vortices, leading to an increase (decrease) in the frequency of ejections and an amplification (reduction) of their percentage contribution to the total momentum flux. Moreover, the size of the hairpin vortex packets changes according to the hairpin vortices comprising them, while the packet inclination remains unaltered during the pulsatile cycle. Findings underscore the important impact of non-stationarity on the structure of ABL turbulence and associated mechanisms supporting momentum transport.</description>

      <title>Efficient parallel solver for rarefied gas flow using GSIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the general synthetic iterative scheme (GSIS) has been proposed to find the steady-state solution of the Boltzmann equation in the whole range of gas rarefaction, where its fast-converging and asymptotic-preserving properties lead to the significant reduction of iteration numbers and spatial cells in the near-continuum flow regime. However, the efficiency and accuracy of GSIS has only been demonstrated in two-dimensional problems with small numbers of spatial cells and discrete velocities. Here, a large-scale parallel computing strategy is designed to extend the GSIS to three-dimensional flow problems, including the supersonic flows which are usually difficult to solve by the discrete velocity method. Since the GSIS involves the calculation of the mesoscopic kinetic equation which is defined in six-dimensional phase-space, and the macroscopic high-temperature Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations in three-dimensional physical space, the proper partition of the spatial and velocity spaces, and the allocation of CPU cores to the mesoscopic and macroscopic solvers, are the keys to improving the overall computational efficiency. These factors are systematically tested to achieve optimal performance, up to 100 billion spatial and velocity grids. For hypersonic flows around the Apollo reentry capsule, the X38-like vehicle, and the space station, our parallel solver can obtain the converged solution within one hour.</description>

      <title>Fragmentation of Colliding Liquid Rims</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07300v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present direct numerical simulations of the splashing process between two cylindrical liquid rims. This belongs to a class of impact and collision problems with a wide range of applications in science and engineering, and motivated here by splashing of breaking ocean waves. Interfacial perturbations with a truncated white noise frequency profile are introduced to the rims before their collision, whose subsequent morphological development is simulated by solving the two-phase incompressible Navier-Stokes equation with the adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) technique, within the Basilisk software environment. We first derive analytical solutions predicting the unsteady interfacial and velocity profiles of the expanding sheet forming between the two rims, and develop scaling laws for the evolution of the lamella rim under capillary deceleration. We then analyse the formation and growth of transverse ligaments ejected from the lamella rims, which we find to originate from the initial corrugated geometry of the perturbed rim surface. Novel scaling models are proposed for predicting the decay of the ligament number density due to the ongoing ligament merging phenomenon, and found to agree well with the numerical results presented here. The role of the mechanism in breaking waves is discussed further and necessary next steps in the problem are identified.</description>

Abstract: We show that the appearance of stochastic resonance (SR) depends on position along the channel, $l/h$, the second control parameter, besides $Wi$. Such type of SR is observed experimentally for the first time, and in particular, in such as complex polymer chaotic channel flow. We observe that SR does not appear close to the inlet, where streamwise velocity fluctuations, $u_{rms}$, are much larger. Far away from the inlet, $u_{rms}$ fluctuations become small and about the same until outlet resulting in flat spanwise velocity, $w$, power spectrum in lower subrange of transition regime. Then interaction of chaotic $u$ power spectrum with white noise $w$ energy spectrum in the presence of low intensity elastic wave promotes SR, as predicted by internal dynamics of autonomous nonlinear dynamical model. Appearance of chaotic $w$ power spectrum at higher $u_{rms}$ results in vanishing of SR. Moreover, SR frequency, $f_p$, shows the same scaling exponent as elastic wave frequency, $f_{el}$, in the dependence on $Wi$, with $f_p$ significantly shifted down compared to $f_{el}$ that indicates their close relation.</description>

      <title>Emulsions in microfluidic channels with asymmetric boundary conditions and directional surface roughness: stress and rheology</title>

Abstract: The flow of emulsions in confined microfluidic channels is affected by surface roughness. Directional roughness effects have recently been reported in channels with asymmetric boundary conditions featuring a flat wall, and a wall textured with a directional roughness, the latter promoting a change in the velocity profiles when the flow direction of emulsions is inverted [D. Filippi et al., Adv. Mater. Technol. 8, 2201748 (2023)]. An operative protocol is needed to reconstruct the stress profile inside the channel from velocity data to shed light on the trigger of the directional response. To this aim, we performed lattice Boltzmann numerical simulations of the flow of model emulsions with a minimalist model of directional roughness in two dimensions: a confined microfluidic channel with one flat wall and the other patterned by right-angle triangular-shaped posts. Simulations are essential to develop the protocol based on mechanical arguments to reconstruct stress profiles. Hence, one can analyze data to relate directional effects in velocity profiles to different rheological responses close to the rough walls associated with opposite flow directions. We finally show the universality of this protocol by applying it to other realizations of directional roughness by considering experimental data on emulsions in a microfluidic channel featured with a flat wall and a wall textured by herringbone-shaped roughness.</description>

      <title>Small-scale magnetohydrodynamic dynamos: from deterministic chaos to turbulence</title>

Abstract: It is shown, using results of numerical simulations, and geophysical and solar observations, that the transition from deterministic chaos to hard turbulence in the magnetic field generated by the small-scale MHD dynamos occurs through a randomization process. This randomization process has been described using the notion of distributed chaos and the main parameter of distributed chaos has been used for quantifying the degree of randomization. The dissipative (Loitsianskii and Birkhoff-Saffman integrals) and ideal (magnetic helicity) magnetohydrodynamic invariants control the randomization process and determine the degree of randomization in different MHD flows, directly or through the Kolmogorov-Iroshnikov phenomenology (the magneto-inertial range of scales as a precursor of hard turbulence). Despite the considerable differences in the scales and physical parameters, the results of numerical simulations are in quantitative agreement with the geophysical and solar observations in the frames of this approach. The Hall magnetohydrodynamic dynamo has been also briefly discussed in this context.</description>

      <title>Mori-Zwanzig latent space Koopman closure for nonlinear autoencoder</title>

Abstract: The Koopman operator presents an attractive approach to achieve global linearization of nonlinear systems, making it a valuable method for simplifying the understanding of complex dynamics. While data-driven methodologies have exhibited promise in approximating finite Koopman operators, they grapple with various challenges, such as the judicious selection of observables, dimensionality reduction, and the ability to predict complex system behaviors accurately. This study presents a novel approach termed Mori-Zwanzig autoencoder (MZ-AE) to robustly approximate the Koopman operator in low-dimensional spaces. The proposed method leverages a nonlinear autoencoder to extract key observables for approximating a finite invariant Koopman subspace and integrates a non-Markovian correction mechanism using the Mori-Zwanzig formalism. Consequently, this approach yields a closed representation of dynamics within the latent manifold of the nonlinear autoencoder, thereby enhancing the precision and stability of the Koopman operator approximation. Demonstrations showcase the technique's ability to capture regime transitions in the flow around a cylinder. It also provides a low dimensional approximation for Kuramoto-Sivashinsky with promising short-term predictability and robust long-term statistical performance. By bridging the gap between data-driven techniques and the mathematical foundations of Koopman theory, MZ-AE offers a promising avenue for improved understanding and prediction of complex nonlinear dynamics.</description>

      <title>RiemannONets: Interpretable Neural Operators for Riemann Problems</title>

Abstract: Developing the proper representations for simulating high-speed flows with strong shock waves, rarefactions, and contact discontinuities has been a long-standing question in numerical analysis. Herein, we employ neural operators to solve Riemann problems encountered in compressible flows for extreme pressure jumps (up to $10^{10}$ pressure ratio). In particular, we first consider the DeepONet that we train in a two-stage process, following the recent work of \cite{lee2023training}, wherein the first stage, a basis is extracted from the trunk net, which is orthonormalized and subsequently is used in the second stage in training the branch net. This simple modification of DeepONet has a profound effect on its accuracy, efficiency, and robustness and leads to very accurate solutions to Riemann problems compared to the vanilla version. It also enables us to interpret the results physically as the hierarchical data-driven produced basis reflects all the flow features that would otherwise be introduced using ad hoc feature expansion layers. We also compare the results with another neural operator based on the U-Net for low, intermediate, and very high-pressure ratios that are very accurate for Riemann problems, especially for large pressure ratios, due to their multiscale nature but computationally more expensive. Overall, our study demonstrates that simple neural network architectures, if properly pre-trained, can achieve very accurate solutions of Riemann problems for real-time forecasting.
