      <title>Probing Quantum Curves and Transitions in 5d SQFTs via Defects and Blowup Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate codimension-2 defect partition functions and quantum Seiberg-Witten curves in 5d rank-1 supersymmetric QFTs, including non-Lagrangian and Kaluza-Klein theories. Using generalized blowup equations, we compute defect partition functions in the $\Omega$-background and show that, in the Nekrasov-Shatashvili limit, they satisfy certain difference equations that encode the quantization of classical Seiberg-Witten curves. Furthermore, we explore novel transitions in the defect partition functions and their relation to coordinate transformations of quantum Seiberg-Witten curves, with a focus on SL(2,$\mathbb{Z}$) transformations and Hanany-Witten transitions. These findings provide new insights into the interplay between codimension-2 defects, quantum curves, and the geometric structure of 5d supersymmetric QFTs.</description>

      <title>The Four-Point Correlator of Planar sYM at Twelve Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the 4-point correlation function and amplitude in planar, maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory to 12 loops. We find that the recently-introduced 'double-triangle' rule in fact implies the previously described square and pentagon rules; and when applied to 12 loops, it fully determines the 11-loop correlator and fixes all but 3 of the (22,024,902) 12-loop coefficients; these remaining coefficients can be subsequently fixed using the '(single-)triangle' rule. Not only do we confirm the Catalan conjecture for anti-prism graphs, but we discover evidence for a greatly generalized Catalan conjecture for the coefficients of all polygon-framed fishnet graphs. We provide all contributions through 12 loops as ancillary files to this work.</description>

      <title>Tame Embeddings, Volume Growth, and Complexity of Moduli Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum gravity is expected to impose constraints on the moduli spaces of massless fields that can arise in effective quantum field theories. A recent proposal asserts that the asymptotic volume growth of these spaces is severely restricted, and related to the existence of duality symmetries. In this work we link this proposal to a tameness criterion, by suggesting that any consistent moduli space should admit a tame isometric embedding into Euclidean space. This allows us to promote the volume growth constraint to a local condition, and give the growth coefficient a geometric interpretation in terms of complexity. We study the implications of this proposal for the emergence of dualities, as well as for the curvature and infinite distance limits of moduli spaces.</description>

      <title>Operator Product Expansion in Carrollian CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carrollian conformal field theory offers an alternative description of massless scattering amplitudes, that is holographic in nature. In an effort to build a framework that is both predictive and constraining, we construct operator product expansions (OPE) that are compatible with carrollian symmetries. In this way, we unify and extend preliminary works on the subject, and demonstrate that the carrollian OPEs indeed control the short-distance expansion of carrollian correlators and amplitudes. In the process, we extend the representation theory of carrollian conformal fields such as to account for composite operators like the carrollian stress tensor or those creating multiparticle states. In addition we classify 2- and 3-point carrollian correlators and amplitudes with complex kinematics, and give the general form of the 4-point function allowed by symmetry.</description>

      <title>Color-kinematics and double-copy relations for selfdual solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We clarify the relation between the classical double copy and the double copy for amplitudes in the setting of selfdual gauge and gravity theories. To this end we construct explicit all-order perturbative solutions in these theories and show that they are related by a version of color-kinematics duality. This relation can be expressed in a double-copy form and embodies the most general manifestation of the selfdual classical double copy. Our classical double copy relations directly lead to known amplitude double-copy relations, both for Berends-Giele currents and on-shell amplitudes, through the perturbiner expansion.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Topological Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study anisotropic scaling limits of topological field theories using tropical geometry. The resulting topological field theories are characterized by foliated geometries and are invariant under foliation-preserving gauge transformations. We demonstrate the tropicalization for the 2D BF theory and generalize the prescription to topological Yang-Mills and Chern-Simons theories. We call the tropical limit of the BF theory, the \textit{TBF} theory, which is an anisotropic generalization of the BF theory with an additional adjoint-valued field $T$ that enforces a projectability condition onto the leaves of the foliation. The TBF theory localizes onto the moduli space of tropicalized flat connections $\mathcal{M}(\Sigma_g,G)$ on a foliated Riemann surface $\Sigma_g$ of genus $g$. The tropical connections exhibit anisotropic behavior; their holonomy is sensitive only to the leaves of the foliation. We analyze this moduli space two distinct ways, Firstly, they are classified by leaf-wise holonomy whose dimension can be explicitly calculated for the case of tropical projective space $\mathbb{TP}^1$ by the moduli space isomorphism $\mathcal{M}\left(\mathbb{TP} ^1, G\right) \cong \operatorname{Hom}(\mathbb{Z}, G) / G$. The second way is through Kodaira-Spencer theory which gives a twisted cohomology argument to argue that $\operatorname{dim} \mathcal{M}\left(\mathbb{T} P^1, G\right)=\operatorname{rank}(\mathfrak{g})$ and we demonstrate their equivalence for the case of $SU(N)$. We show that we can glue together several $\mathbb{TP}^1$ to obtain $\operatorname{dim} \mathcal{M}\left(\Sigma_g, G\right)=(g-1)\operatorname{rank}(\mathfrak{g})$ through a foliated refinement of the Atiyah-Segal axioms. We leave several open questions such as potential connections to JT gravity and anisotropic conformal field theory.</description>

      <title>All-loop planar integrands in Yang-Mills theory from recursion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we generalize the recursion methods based on cut equations arXiv:2412.21027, originally developed for scalar theories, to gluons in pure Yang-Mills theory. In gauge theories, planar loop integrands are subtle to defined and obtained due to the existence of scaleless integrals. A critical challenge arises when constructing higher-loop integrands via recursion methods: integrands with or without all scaleless terms both are incompatible with the reconstruction formalism in arXiv:2412.21027. To address this, we introduce a $\textit{refined}$ integrand by systematically removing specific scaleless contributions, and develop an algorithmic implementation of the recursion to all-loop level. We explicitly demonstrate the framework by three steps and obtain the recursion formula in pure Yang-Mills theory. In the ancillary files, we provide the results up to the two-loop five-point integrand and the simplified result in the large-$D$ limit for the three-loop four-point case.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo study on Heisenberg model with local dipolar interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aharony and Fisher showed that non-local dipolar effects in magnetism destabilize the Heisenberg fixed point in real ferromagnets, leading to a new fixed point, called the dipolar fixed point. The non-perturbative nature of the new fixed point, however, has not been uncovered for many decades. Inspired by the recent understanding that the dipolar fixed point is scale-invariant but not conformal invariant, we perform the Monte Carlo simulation of the local Heisenberg-dipolar model on the lattice of $40^3$ by introducing the local cost function parameterized by a parameter $\lambda$ and study its critical exponents, which should become identical to the dipolar fixed point of Aharony and Fisher in the infinite coupling limit $\lambda = \infty$. We find that the critical exponents become noticeably different from those of the Heisenberg fixed point for a finite coupling constant $\lambda=8$ (e.g. $\nu=0.601(2)(^{+0}_{-2})$ in the local Heisenberg-dipolar model while $\nu=0.712(1)(^{+3}_{-0})$ in the Heisenberg model), and the spin correlation function has a feature that it becomes divergence-free, implying the lack of conformal invariance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study maximal supergravity in two dimensions, obtained from reduction of IIA supergravity on an $S^8$ sphere. The theory captures the low-lying fluctuations around the non-conformal D0-brane near-horizon geometry, dual to operators in the BFSS matrix model. Upon exciting some of the supergravity scalars, we construct half-supersymmetric domain wall solutions preserving $SO(p)\times SO(9-p)$ subgroups of the original $SO(9)$ symmetry. We determine their uplift to ten dimensions and the corresponding distributions of D0-branes. Finally, we compute the fluctuations around these domain wall backgrounds, corresponding to holographic two-point correlation functions in the Coulomb branch of the matrix model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We elaborate on the partially massless spin 5/2 supermultiplet, which contains partially massless spin 5/2, massless and partially massless spin 2, as well as massless spin 3/2. We consider the global supertransformations connecting partially massless spin 5/2 to its two possible superpartners, massless and partially massless spin 2, and make them local by switching the interaction with the massless gravitino. We use a frame-like gauge-invariant formalism to describe free fields and the Fradkin-Vasiliev formalism to construct interactions, Due to the presence of the Stueckelberg fields in the gauge-invariant description of massive and partially massless fields, we face ambiguities related to field redefinitions. We use this freedom to simplify calculations. At the same time, we demonstrate how these ambiguities can be resolved using unfolded equations.</description>

      <title>Super-Higher-Form Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the study of higher-form-symmetries to theories with supersymmetry. Using a supergeometry formulation, we find that ordinary higher-form-symmetries nicely combine with supersymmetry to give rise to a much larger spectrum of topological conserved (super)currents. These can be classified as a supersymmetric version of Chern-Weil symmetries, and a brand new set of geometric-Chern-Weil symmetries whose generators are constructed using invariant differential forms in super-manifolds. For N=1 super-Maxwell theory in various dimensions, we build the topological operators generating these super-higher-form symmetries and construct defects carrying non-trivial charges. Notably, the charge is proportional to the super-linking number between the super-hypersurface supporting the symmetry generator and the one supporting the defect.</description>

      <title>Refined BPS numbers on compact Calabi-Yau 3-folds from Wilson loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We relate the counting of refined BPS numbers on compact elliptically fibred Calabi-Yau 3-folds $X$ to Wilson loop expectations values in the gauge theories that emerge in various rigid local limits of the 5d supergravity theory defined by M-theory compactification on $X$. In these local limits $X_*$ the volumes of curves in certain classes go to infinity, the corresponding very massive M2-brane states can be treated as Wilson loop particles and the refined topological string partition function on $X$ becomes a sum of terms proportional to associated refined Wilson loop expectation values. The resulting ansatz for the complete refined topological partition function on $X$ is written in terms of the proportionality coefficients which depend only on the $\epsilon$ deformations and the Wilson loop expectations values which satisfy holomorphic anomaly equations. Since the ansatz is quite restrictive and can be further constrained by the one-form symmetries and E-string type limits for large base curves, we can efficiently evaluate the refined BPS numbers on $X$, which we do explicitly for local gauge groups up to rank three and $h_{11}(X)=5$. These refined BPS numbers pass an impressive number of consistency checks imposed by the direct counting of these numbers using the moduli space of one dimensional stable sheaves on $X$ and give us numerical predictions for the complex structure dependency of the refined BPS numbers.</description>

      <title>On the finite basis of two-loop `t Hooft-Veltman Feynman integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the finite basis topologies of two-loop dimensionally regularized Feynman integrals in the `t Hooft-Veltman scheme in the Standard Model. We present a functionally distinct finite basis of Master Integrals which spans the whole transcendental space of all two-loop Feynman integrals with external momenta in four dimensions. We also indicate that all the two-loop Master Integrals, in an appropriate basis, with more than 8 denominators do not contribute to the finite part of any two-loop scattering amplitude. In addition, we elaborate on the application of the `t Hooft-Veltman decomposition to improve the performance of numerical evaluation of Feynman integrals using AMFlow and DCT packages. Moreover, we analyze the spectrum of special functions and the corresponding geometries appearing in any two-loop scattering amplitude. Our work will allow for a reduction in the computational complexity required for providing high-precision predictions for future high-multiplicity collider observables, both analytically and numerically.</description>

      <title>Finite-coupling spectrum of O(N) model in AdS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the scaling dimensions in the boundary $\mathsf{CFT}_{d}$ corresponding to the $\mathsf{O}(N)$ model in $\mathsf{EAdS}_{d+1}$. The $\mathsf{CFT}$ data accessible to the 4-point boundary correlator of fundamental fields are extracted in $d=2$ and $d=4$, at a finite coupling, and to the leading nontrivial order in the $1/N$ expansion. We focus on the non-singlet sectors, namely the anti-symmetric and symmetric traceless irreducible representations of the $\mathsf{O}(N)$ group, extending the previous results that considered only the singlet sector. Studying the non-singlet sector requires an understanding of the crossed-channel diagram contributions to the $s$-channel conformal block decomposition. Building upon an existing computation, we present general formulas in $d=2$ and $d=4$ for the contribution of a $t$-channel conformal block to the anomalous dimensions of $s$-channel double-twist operators, derived for external scalar operators with equal scaling dimensions. Up to some technical details, this eventually leads to the complete picture of $1/N$ corrections to the $\mathsf{CFT}$ data in the interacting theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the quantum transport generated by the bipartite entanglement in two-dimensional conformal field theory at finite density with the $U(1) \times U(1)$ symmetry associated to the conservation of the electric charge and of the helicity. The bipartition given by an interval is considered, either on the line or on the circle. The continuity equations and the corresponding conserved quantities for the modular flows of the currents and of the energy-momentum tensor are derived. We investigate the mean values of the associated currents and their quantum fluctuations in the finite density representation, which describe the properties of the modular quantum transport. The modular analogues of the Johnson-Nyquist law and of the fluctuation-dissipation relation are found, which encode the thermal nature of the modular evolution.</description>

      <title>On the Holographic Dual of a Symmetry Operator at Finite Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological symmetry operators of holographic large $N$ CFT$_D$'s are dual to dynamical branes in the gravity dual AdS$_{D+1}$. We use this correspondence to establish a dictionary between thermal expectation values of symmetry operators in the Euclidean CFT$_D$ and the evaluation of gravitational saddles in the presence of a dynamical brane. Expectation values of $0$-form symmetry operators in the CFT$_D$ are then related to branes wrapped on volume minimizing cycles in the bulk, i.e., the Euclidean continuation of a black hole horizon. We illustrate with some representative examples, including gravity in AdS$_3$, duality / triality defects in 4D $\mathcal{N} = 4$ Super Yang-Mills theory, and the dual of R-symmetry operators probing 5D BPS black holes.</description>

      <title>Over-Luminous Type Ia Supernovae and Standard Candle Cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) serve as crucial cosmological distance indicators due to their empirical consistency in peak luminosity and characteristic light-curve decline rates. These properties facilitate them to be standardized candles for the determination of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) within late-time universe cosmology. Nevertheless, a statistically significant difference persists between $H_0$ values derived from early and late-time measurements, a phenomenon known as the Hubble tension. Furthermore, recent observations have identified a subset of over-luminous SNe Ia, characterized by peak luminosities exceeding the nominal range and faster decline rates. These discoveries raise questions regarding the reliability of SNe Ia as standard candles in measuring cosmological distances. In this article, we present the Bayesian analysis of eight over-luminous SNe Ia and show that they yield a lower $H_0$ estimates, exhibiting closer concordance with $H_0$ estimates derived from early-universe data. This investigation potentially represent a step toward addressing the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>QNMs of charged black holes in AdS spacetime: a geometrical optics perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quasinormal modes of the Reissner$-$Nordstr\"om anti$-$de Sitter black hole using the Penrose limit, motivated by the geometrical optics approximation. This approach offers a novel framework for approximating quasinormal modes with large real frequencies by associating a plane wave to spacetime regions near null geodesics, providing a geometric interpretation of the geometrical optics approximation. Applying this limit to bound null orbits around black holes allows us to explore the black hole response to perturbations. We analyze the effects of black hole charge and negative cosmological constant on the quasinormal spectrum, finding that increasing charge enhances both the real and imaginary parts of the frequencies, while a decreasing cosmological constant leads to higher real frequencies and longer lived perturbations, with the spectrum stabilizing at larger values of the cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>Current and quantum transport factor of fermionic system in fermionic bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the dynamics of current and the quantum transport factor in a fermionic system with a central oscillator interacting with two fermionic reservoirs at different temperatures. We derive the master equation for the system density matrix, accounting for energy exchange between the system and the reservoirs. The current is analyzed in relation to system parameters and reservoir temperatures, revealing that the quantum transport factor differs from classical systems, approaching Carnot efficiency at high temperatures but being different at low temperatures. We also examine the power spectrum of the current, providing insights into current fluctuations and their temperature dependence. Furthermore, we derive the Fokker-Planck equation and the Glauber-Sudarshan P-representation, where the steady-state probability distribution takes a Gaussian form, confirming the system behaves like a harmonic oscillator. This work advances the understanding of quantum transport in fermionic systems and provides a foundation for future research in quantum thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions and finite-size effects in integrable virial statistical models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze thermodynamic models for fluid systems in equilibrium based on a virial expansion of the internal energy in terms of the volume density. We prove that the models, formulated for finite-size systems with $N$ particles, are exactly solvable to any expansion order, as expectation values of physical observables (e.g., volume density) are determined from solutions to nonlinear C-integrable PDEs of hydrodynamic type. In the limit $N\to\infty$, phase transitions emerge as classical shock waves in the space of thermodynamic variables. Near critical points, we argue that the volume density exhibits a scaling behavior consistent with the Universality Conjecture in viscous transport PDEs. As an application, we employ our framework to nuclear matter and construct a global QCD phase diagram revealing critical points for the nuclear liquid-gas and hadron gas-QGP transitions. We demonstrate how finite-size effects smear critical signatures, indicating the importance of thoughtful considerations in the search for the QCD critical point.</description>

      <title>Copenhagen Survey on Black Holes and Fundamental Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this survey is to take a snapshot of the attitudes of physicists, which may be useful to sociologists and historians of science. A total of 85 completed surveys were returned out of 151 registered participants of the "Black holes Inside and out" conference, held in Copenhagen in 2024. The survey asked questions about the nature of black holes and some of the most contentious issues in fundamental physics. A number of surprising results were found. For example, some of the leading frameworks, such the cosmological constant, cosmic inflation, or string theory, while most popular, gain less than majority of votes from the participants. The only statement that gains majority approval (by 68% of participants) was that the Big Bang means that "the universe evolved from a hot dense state", not "an absolute beginning time". This provides reasons for caution in describing ideas as consensus in the scientific community when a more nuanced view may be justified.</description>

      <title>Canonical torus action on symplectic singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that any symplectic singularity lying on a smoothable projective symplectic variety locally admits a good action of an algebraic torus of dimension $r \geq 1$, which is canonical. In particular, it admits a good $\mathbb{C}^*$-action. This proves Kaledin's conjecture conditionally but in a substantially stronger form.
  Our key idea is to relate Donaldson-Sun theory on local Kahler metrics in complex differential geometry to the theory of Poisson deformations of symplectic varieties. We also prove results on the local behaviour of (singular) hyperKahler metrics. For instance, we show that the singular hyperKahler metric of any smoothable projective symplectic variety around isolated singularity is close to a Riemannian cone in a polynomial order.
  Most of our results also work for symplectic singularities on hyperKahler quotients under some conditions.</description>

      <title>Effects of tau-neutrino detection on non-standard interactions at DUNE with a short discussion on the nature of neutrino mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the effects of $\nu_\tau$ and $\bar{\nu}_\tau$ detection at the DUNE far detector on the experiment's sensitivity to Non-Standard Interactions (NSI) in neutrino propagation. We show that the strongest observable NSI effect in the $\nu_\tau$ and $\bar{\nu}_\tau$ appearance probabilities arises from $\epsilon_{\mu\tau}$. We have studied the hierarchy sensitivity, CP violation sensitivity and octant sensitivity of DUNE from $\nu_\tau$ and $\bar{\nu}_\tau$ appearance channels in presence of NSI. We have also studied the detection sensitivity of NSI phases and the future constaints on NSI parameters from the tau neutrino appearance channels in DUNE. Additionally, we examine the role of $\nu_\tau$ detection in constraining the unitary nature of the PMNS matrix. These studies emphasize the importance of incorporating $\nu_\tau$ detection in long-baseline neutrino experiments such as DUNE.</description>

Abstract: We propose a new formula for the entropy of a dynamical cosmological event horizon, which is valid to leading order for perturbations of a stationary asymptotically de Sitter spacetime. By introducing a nontrivial correction term, we generalize Gibbons and Hawking's first law of event horizons to non-stationary eras. We also develop the non-stationary physical process first law between two arbitrary horizon cross-sections for the cosmological event horizon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present work, we introduce a new interpretation of exciton binding energies in two-dimensional (2D) materials using concepts from brane physics. We adapt the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati-Shifman mechanism to a (2+1)-dimensional brane in a (3+1)-D spacetime, deriving an effective electromagnetic potential on the brane. Using this potential, we develop a hydrogenic model for exciton binding energies in 2D materials, applying it to s-type excitons and comparing theoretical predictions with experimental results on WS$_{2}$ monolayers. This interdisciplinary approach bridges high-energy and condensed matter physics, offering a new didactic representation of excitons in low-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Spherically symmetric horizonless solutions and their frozen states in Bardeen spacetime with Proca field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct a static spherical symmetric Bardeen-Proca star (BPS) model, which consists of the electromagnetic field and Proca field minimally coupled with gravity. The introduction of the Proca field disrupts the formation of event horizons, ensuring that these solutions are globally regular throughout the spacetime. We obtain families of BPS solutions under several magnetic charge conditions. Based on these results, we further investigate the ADM mass, Noether charge, and energy density distribution of them. We find that when the magnetic charge is sufficiently large, solutions with a critical horizon $r_{cH}$ emerge as $\omega \rightarrow 0$, and the time component of the metric approaches zero inside $r_{cH}$. To an observer at infinity, the collapse process of the matter near the critical horizon appears frozen. Consequently, we refer to the solution with $r_{cH}$ as the frozen Bardeen-Proca star (FBPS). Additionally, we also investigate the circular geodesic orbits of BPS. For the light ring, we find that the light rings always appear in pairs, located on both sides of the critical horizon and moving further apart as the frequency $\omega$ decreases. For timelike circular orbits, we investigate their distribution in the spacetime of BPSs and highlight four representative families of BPS solutions.</description>

      <title>Apparent $w&lt;-1$ and a Lower $S_8$ from Dark Axion and Dark Baryons Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a simple coupling between dark energy and dark matter can simultaneously address two distinct hints at new physics coming from cosmological observations. The first is the recent evidence from the DESI project and supernovae observations that the dark energy equation of state~$w$ is evolving over cosmic time from an earlier value that is~$&lt;-1$ to a present-day value~$&gt;-1$. The second observation is the so-called~$S_8$ tension, describing the suppression of the growth of matter overdensities compared to that expected in the~$\Lambda$CDM model. We propose a stable, technically natural particle physics implementation of this idea, in which dark matter consists of dark baryons in a strongly-coupled hidden sector, and the dark energy field is the associated dark axion. The time-variation of the dark matter mass results in an effective dark energy equation of state that exhibits a phantom crossing behavior consistent with recent results. It also results in a slight delay in matter-radiation equality, which suppresses the overall growth of density perturbations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a perturbation theory which we conjecture to be free of the Coulomb-phase infrared divergence. This perturbation theory is developed for one of the simplest yet prototypical scattering amplitudes which would otherwise exhibit this divergence: the semiclassical scattering of a spinless boson on a background Coulomb field. The perturbation theory is based upon replacing plane waves with Coulomb wavefunctions, and the free-field propagator with the Coulomb propagator, in order to appropriately match the asymptotics of the exact in/out states. We compute the leading-order (LO) and next-to-leading-order (NLO) infrared-finite scattering amplitudes in this framework, which include all-order-in-the-coupling effects, and demonstrate that these amplitudes are in agreement with the known exact amplitude at these orders. We comment on the Runge-Lenz symmetry of the LO amplitude which occurs as a principal series representation of the Euclidean conformal group on the 2-sphere.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13737v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the $2 \to 2$ scattering in the regime where the wavelength of the scattered objects is comparable to their distance but is much larger than any Compton wavelength in the quantum field theory. We observe that in this regime - which differs from the eikonal - the Feynman diagram expansion takes the form of a geometric series, akin to the Born series of quantum mechanics. Conversely, we can define the Feynman diagram expansion as the Born series of a relativistic effective-one-body (EOB) Schr\"odinger equation. For a gravitational theory in this regime we observe that the EOB Schr\"odinger equation reduces to the Regge-Wheeler or Teukolsky wave equations. We make use of this understanding to study the tree-level Compton scattering off a Kerr black hole. We compute the scalar and photon Compton amplitude up to $O(a^{30})$ in the black hole spin $a$ and propose an all-order expression. Remarkably, we find that boundary terms, which are typically neglected, give non-zero contact pieces necessary for restoring crossing symmetry and gauge invariance of the Kerr-Compton amplitude.</description>

      <title>Perturbations in $\mathbf{O}(D,D)$ string cosmology from double field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The low-energy limit of string theory contains additional gravitational degrees of freedom, a skew-symmetric tensor $B$-field and a scalar dilaton, that are not present in general relativity. Together with the metric, these three fields are naturally embedded in the $\mathbf{O}(D,D)$-symmetric framework of double field theory. The $\mathbf{O}(D,D)$ symmetry uniquely prescribes the interactions between the extended gravitational sector and other matter, leading to novel features beyond conventional string cosmology. In this work we present the equations of motion for linear perturbations around $\mathbf{O}(D,D)$ string cosmological backgrounds in $D=4$ under a scalar-vector-tensor decomposition. We obtain analytic solutions in the superhorizon limit for scalar perturbations around various homogeneous and isotropic background solutions, including some candidate models for bouncing cosmologies. The generalized energy-momentum tensor includes source terms for the $B$-field and dilaton, and we show how the resulting generalized conservation laws modify the conditions for conservation of curvature perturbations.</description>

Abstract: We apply a stochastic version of the geometric (Ricci) flow, complemented with the stochastic flow of the gauge Yang-Mills sector, in order to seed the chromo-magnetic and chromo-electric vortices that source the area-law for QCD confinement. The area-law is the key signature of quark confinement in Yang-Mills gauge theories with a non-trivial center symmetry. In particular, chromo-magnetic vortices enclosed within the chromo-electric Wilson loops instantiate the area-law asymptotic behaviour of the Wilson loop vacuum expectation values. The stochastic gauge-geometry flow is responsible for the topology changes that induce the appearance of the vortices. When vortices vanish, due to topology changes in the manifolds associated to the hadronic ground states, the evaluation of the Wilson loop yields a dependence on the length of the path, hence reproducing the perimeter law of the hadronic (Higgs) phase of real QCD. Confinement, instead, is naturally achieved within this context as a by-product of the topology change of the manifold over which the dynamics of the Yang-Mills fields is defined. The stochastic gauge-geometry flow naturally accomplishes a treatment of the emergence of the vortices and the generation of turbulence effects. Braiding and knotting, resulting from topology changes, namely stochastic fluctuations of the Einstein-Yang-Mills system, stabilise the chromo-magnetic vortices and dynamically induce, as non-trivial topological features, chiral symmetry-breaking. Finally, we observe that dimensional transmutation for the Yang-Mills fields can be derived from the scaling property of the geometric part of the stochastic flow. Specifically, a relation can be derived that involves the infrared equilibrium limit of the Planck constant and yields the correct order of magnitude for $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We work out the unfolded formulation of the fields in the non-linear realisation of $E_{11}$. Using the connections in this formalism, we propose, at the linearised level, an infinite number of first-order duality relations between the dual fields in $E_{11}$. In this way, we introduce extra fields that do not belong to $E_{11}$ and we investigate their origin. The equations of motion of the fields are obtained by taking derivatives and higher traces of the duality relations.</description>

      <title>Krylov Complexity in the Schr\"odinger Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16302v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the Krylov complexity of Schr\"odinger field theories, focusing on both bosonic and fermionic systems within the grand canonical ensemble that includes a chemical potential. Krylov complexity measures operator growth in quantum systems by analyzing how operators spread within the Krylov space, a subspace of the Hilbert space spanned by successive applications of the superoperator $[H,\cdot]$ on an initial operator. Using the Lanczos algorithm, we construct an orthonormal Krylov basis and derive the Lanczos coefficients, which govern the operator connectivity and thus characterize the complexity. Our study reveals that the Lanczos coefficients $\{b_{n}\}$ are independent of the chemical potential, while $\{a_{n}\}$ exhibits a dependence on it. Both $\{a_{n}\}$ and $\{b_{n}\}$ show linear relationships with respect to $n$. For both bosonic and fermionic systems, the Krylov complexities behave similarly over time, especially at late times, due to the analogous profiles of the squared absolute values of their autocorrelation functions $\abs{\varphi_{0}(t)}^{2}$. The Krylov complexity grows exponentially with time, but its asymptotic scaling factor $\lambda_{K}$ is significantly smaller than the twice of the slope of the $\{b_{n}\}$ coefficients, contrasting to the relativistic field theories where the scaling aligns more closely with the twice of the slope of $\{b_{n}\}$.</description>

      <title>Generalized Clausius inequalities and entanglement production in holographic two-dimensional CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Utilizing quantum information theory, it has been shown that irreversible entropy production is bounded from both below and above in physical processes. Both these bounds are positive and generalize the Clausius inequality. Such bounds are, however, obtained from distance measures in the space of states, which are hard to define and compute in quantum field theories. We show that the quantum null energy condition (QNEC) can be utilized to obtain both lower and upper bounds on irreversible entropy production for quenches leading to transitions between thermal states carrying uniform momentum density in two dimensional holographic conformal field theories. We achieve this by refining earlier methods and developing an algebraic procedure for determining HRT surfaces in arbitrary Ba\~nados-Vaidya geometries which are dual to quenches involving transitions between general quantum equilibrium states (e.g. thermal states) where the QNEC is saturated. We also discuss results for the growth and thermalization of entanglement entropy for arbitrary initial and final temperatures and momentum densities. The rate of quadratic growth of entanglement just after the quench depends only on the change in the energy density and is independent of the entangling length. For sufficiently large entangling lengths, the entanglement tsunami phenomenon can be established. Finally, we study recovery of the initial state from the evolving entanglement entropy and argue that the Renyi entropies should give us a refined understanding of scrambling of quantum information.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, it has been proposed that holography imposes a universal lower bound on the Casimir effect for 3d BCFTs. This paper generalizes the discussions to higher dimensions. We find Einstein gravity, DGP gravity, and Gauss-Bonnet gravity sets a universal lower bound of the strip Casimir effect in general dimensions. We verify the holographic bound by free theories and $O(N)$ models in the $\epsilon$ expansions. We also derive the holographic bound of the Casimir effect for a wedge and confirm free theories obey it. It implies holography sets a lower bound of the Casimir effect for general boundary shapes, not limited to the strip. Finally, we briefly comment on the impact of mass and various generalizations and applications of our results.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic safety, quantum gravity, and the swampland: a conceptual assessment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a conceptual assessment of some aspects of fundamental quantum field theories of gravity in light of foundational aspects of the swampland program. On the one hand, asymptotically safe quantum gravity may provide a simple and predictive framework, thanks to a finite number of relevant parameters. On the other hand, a (sub-)set of intertwined swampland conjectures on the consistency of quantum gravity can be argued to be universal via effective field theory considerations. We answer whether some foundational features of these frameworks are compatible. This involves revisiting and refining several arguments (and loopholes) concerning the relation between field-theoretic descriptions of gravity and general swampland ideas. We identify the thermodynamics of black holes, spacetime topology change, and holography as the core aspects of this relation. We draw lessons on the features that a field theoretic description of gravity must (not) have to be consistent with fundamental principles underlying the swampland program, and on the universality of the latter.</description>

      <title>Holographic QCD model for heavy and exotic mesons at finite density: A self-consistent dynamical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a self-consistent dynamical holographic QCD model to investigate the mass spectra and melting behavior of heavy and exotic mesons at finite temperature and finite density. Our approach is based on the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) framework and incorporates an elsewhere already introduced, albeit by hand, phenomenological non-quadratic dilaton profile. This allows one to capture the non-linear Regge trajectories of heavy-flavor mesons and model certain exotic states. We show how to construct such models by actually solving the coupled Einstein, Maxwell, and dilaton field equations, ensuring mathematical self-consistency to replace any ad-hoc input. At finite temperature, we analyze the confinement-deconfinement transition via a Hawking-Page phase transition. We compute the spectral functions, revealing the sequential melting of quarkonia as the temperature is increased. Extending to finite density, we explore the impact of baryon chemical potential on meson stability, showing significant modifications in spectral peaks and effective potentials that indicate a more rapid melting of mesonic states as the chemical potential increases in the deconfined phase. The dual of the small/large black hole transition now indicates towards a first order phase transition line ending at a second order critical point. Interestingly, the spectral functions smoothly cross this phase transition line.</description>

      <title>Late-Time Saturation of Black Hole Complexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The holographic complexity of a static spherically symmetric black hole, defined as the volume of an extremal surface, grows linearly with time at late times in general relativity. The growth comes from a region at a constant transverse area inside the black hole and continues forever in the classical theory. In this region the volume complexity of any spherically symmetric black hole in $d+1$ spacetime dimensions reduces to a geodesic length in an effective two-dimensional JT-gravity theory. The length in JT-gravity has been argued to saturate at very late times via non-perturbative corrections obtained from a random matrix description of the gravity theory. The same argument, applied to our effective JT-gravity description of the volume complexity, leads to complexity saturation at times of exponential order in the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of a $d+1$-dimensional black hole. Along the way, we explore a simple toy model for complexity growth, based on a discretisation of Nielsen complexity geometry, that can be analytically shown to exhibit the expected late-time complexity saturation.</description>

Abstract: When the boundary dynamics of \(AdS_3\) gravity is governed by the collective field theory Hamiltonian proposed by Jevicki and Sakita, its asymptotic symmetry algebra becomes the centerless \(U(1)\) Kac-Moody algebra. We quantize this system using the quantum bosonization of relativistic free fermions and relate these to the dynamical fields of \(AdS_3\) gravity. This leads to a correspondence where different bulk configurations correspond to distinct states (particle-hole pair excitations) in the fermionic Hilbert space. This mapping allows us to construct BTZ black hole microstates, represented by Young diagrams of irreducible \(U(\infty)\) representations. Notably, the logarithm of the microstate degeneracy exactly reproduces the classical entropy of the BTZ black hole.</description>

Abstract: The recent increase in computational resources and data availability has led to a significant rise in the use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques for data analysis in physics. However, the application of ML methods to solve differential equations capable of describing even complex physical systems is not yet fully widespread in theoretical high-energy physics. Hamiltonian Neural Networks (HNNs) are tools that minimize a loss function defined to solve Hamilton equations of motion. In this work, we implement several HNNs trained to solve, with high accuracy, the Hamilton equations for a massless probe moving inside a smooth and horizonless geometry known as D1-D5 circular fuzzball. We study both planar (equatorial) and non-planar geodesics in different regimes according to the impact parameter, some of which are unstable. Our findings suggest that HNNs could eventually replace standard numerical integrators, as they are equally accurate but more reliable in critical situations.</description>

Abstract: Theoretical understanding of deep learning remains elusive despite its empirical success. In this study, we propose a novel "synaptic field theory" that describes the training dynamics of synaptic weights and biases in the continuum limit. Unlike previous approaches, our framework treats synaptic weights and biases as fields and interprets their indices as spatial coordinates, with the training data acting as external sources. This perspective offers new insights into the fundamental mechanisms of deep learning and suggests a pathway for leveraging well-established field-theoretic techniques to study neural network training.</description>

Abstract: The novel constraint on any solution to QCD has been exactly and uniquely derived in the framework of the the Slavnov-Taylor identities for the gauge particles propagators. It has the two independent solutions. 1). The first one leads to the general QCD, possessing the confinement phase transition. 2).The second one leads to the particular QCD, or, equivalently, the conventional QCD, does not possessing it. The dynamical source of this effect has to be identified with the constant tadpole term, having the dimension of a mass squared, contributing to the full gluon self-energy. Its renormalized version is conventionally called a mass gap. By formulating the proper subtraction scheme, we prove that it cannot be disregarded from the theory and its ground state by any means, but the perturbative renormalizability of QCD will not be affected.The general QCD forbids the free gluons to appear in the physical spectrum at large distances, and, at the time, has an asymptotic freedom behaviour at high energies. Finally, we describe how our advance results are connected to the Jaffe-Witten's theorem.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we analyze vanishing cycles of Feynman loop integrals by means of the Mayer-Vietoris spectral sequence. A complete classification of possible vanishing geometries are obtained. We employ this result for establishing an asymptotic expansion for the loop integrals near their singularity locus, then give explicit formulas for the coefficients of such an expansion. The further development of this framework may potentially lead to exact calculations of one- and two-loop Feynman diagrams, as well as other next-to-leading and higher-order diagrams, in studies of radiative corrections for upcoming lepton-hadron scattering experiments.</description>

      <title>Rescuing the Unruh Effect in Lorentz Violating Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the robustness of Hawking radiation in the presence of UV Lorentz breaking is well-established, the Unruh effect has posed a challenge, with a large literature concluding that even the low-energy restoration of Lorentz invariance may not be sufficient to sustain this phenomenon. Notably, these previous studies have primarily focused on Lorentz-breaking matter on a conventional Rindler wedge. In this work, we demonstrate that considering the complete structure of Lorentz-breaking gravity, specifically the presence of a hypersurface orthogonal aether field, leads to the selection of a new Rindler wedge configuration characterized by a uniformly accelerated aether flow. This uniform acceleration provides a reference scale for comparison with the Lorentz-breaking one, thus ensuring the persistence of the Unruh effect in this context. We establish this by calculating the expected temperature using a Bogolubov approach, and by analyzing the response of a uniformly accelerated detector. We suggest that this resilience of the Unruh effect opens interesting possibilities towards future developments for using it as a tool to constrain Lorentz breaking theories of gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05224v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study relative differential and integral forms on families of supermanifolds and investigate their cohomology. In particular, we establish a relative version of Poincar\'e-Verdier duality, relating the cohomology of differential and integral forms, and provide a concrete interpretation via Berezin fiber integration, which we introduce. To complement Poincar\'e duality, we prove compactly supported Poincar\'e lemmas for both differential and integral forms, filling a gap in the literature. We then apply our results to the mathematical foundations of supergravity. Specifically, we rigorously define picture-changing operators via relative Poincar\'e duality and use them to formulate a general action principle for geometric supergravity in a mathematically rigorous manner. As an example, we explicitly describe three-dimensional supergravity via higher Cartan structures, which are defined by certain classes of connections valued in $L_\infty$-superalgebras. Our construction provides a unified framework interpolating between two equivalent formulations of supergravity in the physics literature: the superspace approach and the group manifold approach.</description>

      <title>Matter really does matter, or Why $f(R,{\rm Matter})$ type theories are significant for gravitational physics and cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent paper (Lacombe, Mukohyama, and Seitz, JCAP {\bf 2024}, 05, 064 (2024)), the authors provided an in-depth analysis of a class of modified gravity theories, generally called $f(R,{\rm Matter})$ theories, which assume the existence of a non-minimal coupling between geometry and matter. It was argued that if the matter sector consists of Standard Model particles, then these theories suffer from the presence of ghosts, or are just scalar/vector-tensor theories. Hence, the relevance of these theories for cosmology was questioned. It is the goal of the present work to carefully analyze, discuss, and assess the line of arguments proposed in Lacombe et al. JCAP {\bf 2024}, 05, 064 (2024). After a qualitative critical discussion of the five general arguments proposed for the validity of a gravitational theory, we present the theoretical foundations of the $f(R,{\rm Matter})$ theories, including their possible relations with quantum gravity, and discuss in detail the role of matter. The matter source discussed in Lacombe et al., consisting predominantly of a massless scalar field, is extremely restrictive, and rather irrelevant for cosmology and the description of the observational data. We also devote a detailed discussion of the problem of the energy scales of the $f(R,{\rm Matter})$ theories. To test the observational relevance of this type of theories we present the comparison of a simple theoretical model with a small set of observational data and with the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. We conclude by pointing out that the analysis of Lacombe et al., JCAP {\bf 2024}, 05, 064 (2024), even very useful for the understanding of some limited aspects of the $f(R,{\rm Matter})$ theories, and of their theoretical foundations, cannot be considered as a valid or definite criticism of these approaches to gravity.</description>

      <title>Entanglement of Disjoint Intervals in Dual-Unitary Circuits: Exact Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16750v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growth of the entanglement between two disjoint intervals and its complement after a quantum quench is regarded as a dynamical chaos indicator. Namely, it is expected to show qualitatively different behaviours depending on whether the underlying microscopic dynamics is chaotic or integrable. So far, however, this could only be verified in the context of conformal field theories. Here we present an exact confirmation of this expectation in a class of interacting microscopic Floquet systems on the lattice, i.e., dual-unitary circuits. These systems can either have zero or a super extensive number of conserved charges: the latter case is achieved via fine-tuning. We show that, for almost all dual unitary circuits on qubits and for a large family of dual-unitary circuits on qudits the asymptotic entanglement dynamics agrees with what is expected for chaotic systems. On the other hand, if we require the systems to have conserved charges, we find that the entanglement displays the qualitatively different behaviour expected for integrable systems. Interestingly, despite having many conserved charges, charge-conserving dual-unitary circuits are in general not Yang-Baxter integrable.</description>

      <title>Self interacting scalar field theory in general curved spacetimes at zero and finite temperature revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB), its restoration, and phase transition for a self interacting quantum scalar field in a general curved background, at zero and finite temperature. To the best of our knowledge, most of the earlier computations in this context have been done in the linear order in curvature, which may not be very suitable for the Ricci flat spacetimes. One of our objectives is to see whether the higher order terms can bring in qualitatively new physical effects, and thereby attempting to fill in this gap in the literature. We use Bunch and Parker's local momentum space representation of the Schwinger-DeWitt expansion of the Feynman propagator. Such expansion, being based upon the local Lorentz symmetry of spacetime, essentially probes the leading curvature correction to short scale, ultraviolet quantum processes. We compute the renormalised, background spacetime curvature (up to quadratic order) and temperature dependent one loop effective potential for $\phi^4$ plus $\phi^3$ self interaction. In particular for the de Sitter spacetime, we have shown for the $\phi^4$-theory that we can have SSB even with a positive rest mass squared and positive non-minimal coupling, at zero temperature. This cannot be achieved by the linear curvature term alone and the result remains valid for a very large range of renormalisation scale. Such SSB will generate a field mass that depends upon the spacetime curvature as well as the non-minimal coupling. For a phase transition, we have computed the leading curvature correction to the critical temperature. At finite temperature, symmetry restoration is demonstrated. We also extend some of the above results to two loop level. The symmetry breaking in de Sitter at two loop remains present. We have further motivated the necessity of treating this problem non-perturbatively in some instances.</description>

      <title>Lattice gradient flows (de-)stabilizing topological sectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14812v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the stability of topological charge under gradient flow taking the admissibility condition into account. For the $SU(2)$ Wilson gauge theory with $\beta=2.45$ and $L^4=12^4$, we numerically show that the gradient flows with the Iwasaki and DBW2 gauge actions stabilize the topological sectors significantly, and they have qualitatively different behaviors compared with the Wilson and tree-level Symanzik flows. By considering the classical continuum limit of the flow actions, we discuss that the coefficient of dimension-$6$ operators has to be positive for stabilizing the one-instanton configuration, and the Iwasaki and DBW2 actions satisfy this criterion while the Wilson and Symanzik actions do not. Moreover, we observe that the DBW2 flow stabilizes the topological sectors at the very early stage of the flow ($\hat{t}\approx 0.5$--$1$), suggesting that a further systematic investigation of the DBW2 flow is warranted to confirm its computational efficiency in determining the gauge topology.</description>

      <title>The Hamilton equations in $f(T)$ teleparallel gravity and in New General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the Hamiltonian function for extended teleparallel theories of gravity in their covariant formulation. In particular, we present the Hamiltonian for $f(T)$ gravity and New General Relativity. From this, we obtain the related Hamilton equations, which are presented both in covariant formulation and Weitzenb\"ock gauge. In this framework, teleparallel equivalent to General Relativity, its $f(T)$ extension and New General Relativity can be compared. We find that $f(T)$ and New General Relativity consistently reduce to the Teleparallel Equivalent to General Relativity, while significant differences appear comparing the Hamilton equations of $f(T)$ with $f(R)$ gravity.</description>

      <title>Neutrino energy and momentum emission from magnetized dense quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using first-principles field-theoretic methods, we investigate neutrino emission from strongly magnetized dense quark matter under conditions relevant to compact stars. We develop a customized approximation that fully accounts for the Landau-level quantization of electron states while neglecting such quantization for quarks. This approach is well-justified in dense quark matter, where the chemical potentials of up and down quarks significantly exceed those of electrons. Our analysis provides a detailed exploration of the influence of strong magnetic fields on neutrino emission, including both the modification of the total emission rate and the emergence of emission asymmetry relative to the magnetic field direction. We further examine the role of temperature in smoothing the oscillatory behavior of neutrino emission as a function of magnetic field strength. Additionally, we study the interplay between the Landau-level quantization of electrons and the Fermi-liquid effects of quarks in modifying the phase space of relevant weak processes. Finally, we briefly discuss the broader implications of magnetic fields on stellar cooling processes and the potential contribution of asymmetric neutrino emission to pulsar kicks.</description>

Abstract: We study the equation of state of three-dimensional compact U(1) gauge theory on the lattice by means of numerical simulations, and discuss the implications of our results for the spectrum of the theory, in connection with previous results from the literature. We also compare our findings to the case of non-Abelian gauge theories and comment on the continuum limit.</description>

      <title>First-order CP phase transition in two-flavor QCD at $\theta = \pi$ under electromagnetic scale anomaly via a Nambu-Jona-Lasinio description</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03879v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the thermal CP phase transition in QCD at $\theta=\pi$ under a weak magnetic field background, where the electromagnetic scale anomaly gets significant. To explicitize, we work on a two-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model at $\theta=\pi$ in the mean field approximation, including the electromagnetic-scale anomaly term. We find that the thermal CP phase transition becomes first order and the strength of the first order gets more prominent as the magnetic field increases. The associated potential barrier is thermally created by the electromagnetic scale anomaly and gives rise to criticality due to the induced potential of a non-perturbative form $\sim \frac{|eB|^3}{f_\pi} \frac{|P|}{P^2 + m_0^2}$, where $eB$ denotes the magnetic field strength; $P$ the CP order parameter, and $m_0$ the isospin-symmetric current-quark mass.</description>

      <title>Number of partitions of modular integers (with an Appendix by P. Deligne)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For integers $n,k,s$, we give a formula for the number $T(n,k,s)$ of order $k$ subsets of the ring $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ whose sum of elements is $s$ modulo $n$. To do so, we describe explicitly a sequence of matrices $M(k)$, for positive integers $k$, such that the size of $M(k)$ is the number of divisors of $k$, and for two coprime integers $k_{1},k_{2}$, the matrix $M(k_{1}k_{2})$ is the Kronecker product of $M(k_{1})$ and $M(k_{2})$. For $s=0, 1, 2$, and for $s=k/2$ when $k$ is even, the sequences $T(n,k,s)$ are related to the number of necklaces with $k$ black beads and $n-k$ white beads, and to Lyndon words. This work begins with empirical determinations of $M(k)$ up to $k=10000$, from which we infer a closed formula that encompasses many entries in the Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences. Its proof comes from work on Ramanujan sums, by Ramanathan, with a generalization to wider problems linked to representation theory and recently described by Deligne.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the fine-tunings of nuclear reactions in the Big Bang and in stars and draw some conclusions on the emergence of the light elements and the life-relevant elements carbon and oxygen. We also stress how to improve these calculations in the future. This requires a concerted effort of different communities, especially in nuclear reaction theory, lattice QCD for few-nucleon systems, stellar evolution calculations, particle physics and philosophy.</description>
