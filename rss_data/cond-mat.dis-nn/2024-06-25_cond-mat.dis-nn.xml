      <title>Non-Hermitian diluted banded random matrices: Scaling of eigenfunction and spectral properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we introduce the non-Hermitian diluted banded random matrix (nHdBRM) ensemble as the set of $N\times N$ real non-symmetric matrices whose entries are independent Gaussian random variables with zero mean and variance one if $|i-j|&lt;b$ and zero otherwise, moreover off-diagonal matrix elements within the bandwidth $b$ are randomly set to zero such that the sparsity $\alpha$ is defined as the fraction of the $N(b-1)/2$ independent non-vanishing off-diagonal matrix elements. By means of a detailed numerical study we demonstrate that the eigenfunction and spectral properties of the nHdBRM ensemble scale with the parameter $x=\gamma[(b\alpha)^2/N]^\delta$, where $\gamma,\delta\sim 1$. Moreover, the normalized localization length $\beta$ of the eigenfunctions follows a simple scaling law: $\beta = x/(1 + x)$. For comparison purposes, we also report eigenfunction and spectral properties of the Hermitian diluted banded random matrix ensemble.</description>

      <title>Revisiting nonequilibrium characterization of glass: History dependence in solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Glass has long been considered a nonequilibrium material. The primary reason is its history-dependent properties: the obtained properties are not uniquely determined by two state variables alone, namely, temperature and volume, but are affected by the process parameters, such as cooling rates. However, closer observations show that this history dependence is common in solid; in crystal growth, the properties of an obtained crystal are affected by the preparation conditions through defect structures and metallurgical structures. The problem with the previous reasoning of history dependence lies in the lack of appropriate specification of state variables. Without knowledge of the latter, describing thermodynamic states is impossible. The guiding principle to find state variables is provided by the first law of thermodynamics. The state variables of solids have been searched by requiring that the internal energy $U$ is a state function. Detailed information about the abovementioned microstructures is needed to describe the state function $U$. This can be accomplished by specifying the time-averaged positions R_{j} of all atoms comprising the solids. Therefore, R_{j} is a state variable for solids. Defect states, being metastable states, represent equilibrium states within a finite time (relaxation time). However, eternal equilibrium is nonexistent: the perfect crystal is thermodynamically unstable. Equilibrium states can only be considered at the local level. Glass is thus in equilibrium as long as its structure does not change. The relaxation time is controlled by the energy barriers by which a structure is sustained, and this time restriction is intimately related to the definition of state variables. The most important property of state variables is their invariance to time averaging. The time-averaged quantity R_{j} meets this invariance property.</description>

      <title>Odd Dipole Screening in Radial Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inflation of an inner radial (or spherical) cavity in an amorphous solids confined in a disk (or a sphere), served as a fruitful case model for studying the effects of plastic deformations on the mechanical response. It was shown that when the field associated with Eshelby quadrupolar charges is non-uniform, the displacement field is riddled with dipole charges that screen elasticity, reminiscent of Debye monopoles screening in electrostatics. In this paper we look deeper into the screening phenomenon, taking into account the consequences of irreversibility that are associated with the breaking of Chiral symmetry. We consider the equations for the displacement field with the presence of ``Odd Dipole Screening", solve them analytically and compare with numerical simulations. Suggestions how to test the theory in experiments are provided.</description>

      <title>How to compute efficiently the analytical solution to Heisenberg spin glass models on sparse random graphs and their de Almeida-Thouless line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Results regarding spin glass models are, to this day, mainly confined to models with Ising spins. Spin glass models with continuous spins exhibit interesting new physical behaviors related to the additional degrees of freedom, but have been primarily studied on fully connected topologies. Only recently some advancements have been made in the study of continuous models on sparse graphs. In this work we partially fill this void by introducing a method to solve numerically the Belief Propagation equations for systems of Heisenberg spins on sparse random graphs via a discretization of the sphere. We introduce techniques to study the finite-temperature, finite-connectivity case as well as novel algorithms to deal with the zero-temperature and large connectivity limits. As an application, we locate the de Almeida-Thouless line for this class of models and the critical field at zero temperature, showing the full consistency of the methods presented. Beyond the specific results reported for Heisenberg models, the approaches presented in this paper have a much broader scope of application and pave the way to the solution of strongly disordered models with continuous variables.</description>

      <title>Learning in Wilson-Cowan model for metapopulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Wilson-Cowan model for metapopulation, a Neural Mass Network Model, treats different subcortical regions of the brain as connected nodes, with connections representing various types of structural, functional, or effective neuronal connectivity between these regions. Each region comprises interacting populations of excitatory and inhibitory cells, consistent with the standard Wilson-Cowan model. By incorporating stable attractors into such a metapopulation model's dynamics, we transform it into a learning algorithm capable of achieving high image and text classification accuracy. We test it on MNIST and Fashion MNIST, in combination with convolutional neural networks, on CIFAR-10 and TF-FLOWERS, and, in combination with a transformer architecture (BERT), on IMDB, always showing high classification accuracy. These numerical evaluations illustrate that minimal modifications to the Wilson-Cowan model for metapopulation can reveal unique and previously unobserved dynamics.</description>

      <title>Coding schemes in neural networks learning classification tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks posses the crucial ability to generate meaningful representations of task-dependent features. Indeed, with appropriate scaling, supervised learning in neural networks can result in strong, task-dependent feature learning. However, the nature of the emergent representations, which we call the `coding scheme', is still unclear. To understand the emergent coding scheme, we investigate fully-connected, wide neural networks learning classification tasks using the Bayesian framework where learning shapes the posterior distribution of the network weights. Consistent with previous findings, our analysis of the feature learning regime (also known as `non-lazy', `rich', or `mean-field' regime) shows that the networks acquire strong, data-dependent features. Surprisingly, the nature of the internal representations depends crucially on the neuronal nonlinearity. In linear networks, an analog coding scheme of the task emerges. Despite the strong representations, the mean predictor is identical to the lazy case. In nonlinear networks, spontaneous symmetry breaking leads to either redundant or sparse coding schemes. Our findings highlight how network properties such as scaling of weights and neuronal nonlinearity can profoundly influence the emergent representations.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Instabilities in Fermi Glasses</title>

Abstract: We study in this paper the effect of weak, short-ranged interaction on disordered metals. Through analysing the interaction matrix elements between different eigenstates of the non-interacting and corresponding Hartree-Fock single-particle Hamiltonian, we argue that as a result of localized single-particle eigenstates around the Fermi surface, the quasi-particle states on the Fermi surface are unstable towards formation of magnetic moments for arbitrary weak (but finite) repulsive interaction in the thermodynamic limit. This is a mechanism very different from the case of strong interaction $U\sim W_B$ ($W_B=$ bandwidth) or the quantum Griffiths effect where local moments are formed at small localized regions where coupling to the surrounding is weak. Numerical simulations are performed to verify our analysis. We further propose within a Landau Fermi-liquid-type framework that our result is applicable for general electronic systems with weak, short-ranged interaction as long as the quasi-particle states exist and are localized. An analogous result is obtained for attractive interaction, suggesting that Fermi glass state is intrinsically unstable in arbitrary dimension.</description>

Abstract: Quantum simulators of lattice gauge theories involve dynamics of typically short-ranged interacting particles and dynamical fields. Elimination of the latter via Gauss law leads to infinite range interactions as exemplified by the Schwinger model in a staggered formalism. This motivates the study of long-range interactions, not necessarily diminishing with the distance. Here we consider localization properties of a spin chain with interaction strength growing linearly along the chain as for the Schwinger model. We generalize the problem to models with different interaction ranges. Using exact diagonalization we find the participation ratio of all eigenstates, which allows us to quantify the localization volume in Hilbert space. Surprisingly, the localization volume changes nonmonotonically with the interaction range. Our study is relevant for quantum simulators of lattice gauge theories implemented in state-of-the-art cold atom/ion devices, and it could help to reveal hidden features in disorder-free confinement phenomena in long-range interacting systems.</description>

      <title>Unscrambling of single-particle wave functions in systems localized through disorder and monitoring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10725v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In systems undergoing localization-delocalization quantum phase transitions due to disorder or monitoring, there is a crucial need for robust methods capable of distinguishing phases and uncovering their intrinsic properties. In this work, we develop a process of finding a Slater determinant representation of free-fermion wave functions that accurately characterizes localized particles, a procedure we dub "unscrambling". The central idea is to minimize the overlap between envelopes of single-particle wave functions or, equivalently, to maximize the inverse participation ratio of each orbital. This numerically efficient methodology can differentiate between distinct types of wave functions: exponentially localized, power-law localized, and conformal critical, also revealing the underlying physics of these states. The method is readily extendable to systems in higher dimensions. Furthermore, we apply this approach to a more challenging problem involving disordered monitored free fermions in one dimension, where the unscrambling process unveils the presence of a conformal critical phase and a localized area-law quantum Zeno phase. Importantly, our method can also be extended to free fermion systems without particle number conservation, which we demonstrate by estimating the phase diagram of $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric disordered monitored free fermions. Our results unlock the potential of utilizing single-particle wave functions to gain valuable insights into the localization transition properties in systems such as monitored free fermions and disordered models.</description>

      <title>Interacting quasiperiodic spin chains in the prethermal regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent progress in the study of many-body localization (MBL) in strongly disordered interacting spin chains has emphasized the importance of distinguishing finite time prethermal behavior from long time and large volume asymptotics. We re-examine a reported non-ergodic extended (NEE) regime in the interacting quasiperiodic Ganeshan-Pixley-Das Sarma model from this perspective, and propose that this regime is a prethermal feature. Indeed, we argue that the NEE regime may be identified through a change in the functional form of spin-spin autocorrelation functions, demonstrating that the NEE regime is distinguishable within intermediate-time dynamics. This is in contrast with existing conjectures relating the NEE regime to the presence of an asymptotic mobility edge in the single-particle spectrum. Thus, we propose a mechanism for the formation of an NEE regime which does not rely on asymptotic properties of the spin chain. Namely, we propose that the NEE regime emerges due to regularly spaced deep wells in the disorder potential. The highly detuned sites suppress spin transport across the system, effectively cutting the chain, and producing a separation of time scales between the spreading of different operators. To support this proposal, we show that the NEE phenomenology also occurs in random models with deep wells but with no mobility edges, and does not occur in quasiperiodic models with mobility edges but with no deep wells. Our results support the broad conclusion that there is not a sharp distinction between the dynamics of quasiperiodically and randomly disordered systems in the prethermal regime. More specifically, we find that generic interacting quasiperiodic models do not have stable intermediate dynamical phases arising from their single-particle mobility edges, and that NEE phenomenology in such models is transient.</description>

      <title>Toward mean-field bound for critical temperature on Nishimori line</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12728v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The critical inverse temperature of the mean-field approximation establishes a lower bound of the true critical inverse temperature in a broad class of ferromagnetic spin models. This is referred to as the mean-field bound for the critical temperature. In this study, we explored the possibility of a corresponding mean-field bound for the critical temperature in Ising spin glass models with Gaussian randomness on the Nishimori line. On this line, the critical inverse temperature of the mean-field approximation is given by $\beta_{MF}^{NL}=\sqrt{1/z}$, where $z$ is the coordination number. Using the Griffiths inequalities on the Nishimori line, we proved that there is zero spontaneous magnetization in the high-temperature region $\beta &lt; \beta_{MF}^{NL}/2$. In other words, the true critical inverse temperature $\beta_c^{NL}$ on the Nishimori line is always bounded by $\beta_c^{NL} \ge \beta_{MF}^{NL}/2$. Unfortunately, we have not succeeded in obtaining the corresponding mean-field bound $\beta_c^{NL} \ge \beta_{MF}^{NL}$ on the Nishimori line.</description>

Abstract: We studied nonsparsely diluted mean-field models that differ from sparsely diluted mean-field models, such as the Viana--Bray model. We prove that the free energy of nonsparsely diluted mean-field models coincides exactly with that of the corresponding mean-field models with different parameters in ferromagnetic and spin-glass models composed of any discrete spin $S$ in the thermodynamic limit. Our results are a broad generalization of the results of a previous study [Bovier and Gayrard, J. Stat. Phys. 72, 643 (1993)], where the densely diluted mean-field ferromagnetic Ising model (diluted Curie--Weiss model) was analyzed rigorously, and it was proven that its free energy was exactly equivalent to that of the corresponding mean-field model (Curie--Weiss model) with different parameters.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric and thermal properties of the weakly disordered non-Fermi liquid phase of Luttinger semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2104.07459v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the thermoelectric and thermal transport in the weakly disordered non-Fermi liquid phase of the Luttinger semimetals at zero doping, where the decay rate associated with the (strong) Coulomb interactions is much larger than the electron-impurity scattering rate. To this end, we implement the Mori-Zwanzig memory matrix method, that does not rely on the existence of long-lived quasiparticles in the system. We find that the thermal conductivity at zero electric field scales as $\bar{\kappa}\sim T^{-n}$ (with $0\lesssim n\lesssim 1)$ at low temperatures, whereas the thermoelectric coefficient has the temperature dependence given by $\alpha\sim T^{p}$ (with $1/2\lesssim p\lesssim 3/2)$. These unconventional properties turn out to be key signatures of this long sought-after non-Fermi liquid state in the Luttinger semimetals, which is expected to emerge in strongly correlated spin-orbit coupled materials like the pyrochlore iridates. Finally, our results indicate that these materials might be good candidates for achieving high figure of merit for thermoelectric applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a computational strategy to quantify the temperature evolution of the timescales and lengthscales over which dynamic facilitation affects the relaxation dynamics of glass-forming liquids at low temperatures, that requires no assumption about the nature of the dynamics. In two glass models, we find that dynamic facilitation depends strongly on temperature, leading to a subdiffusive spreading of relaxation events which we characterize using a temperature-dependent dynamic exponent. We also establish that this temperature evolution represents a major contribution to the increase of the structural relaxation time.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the stationary (late-time) training regime of single- and two-layer underparameterized linear neural networks within the continuum limit of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for synthetic Gaussian data. In the case of a single-layer network in the weakly underparameterized regime, the spectrum of the noise covariance matrix deviates notably from the Hessian, which can be attributed to the broken detailed balance of SGD dynamics. The weight fluctuations are in this case generally anisotropic, but effectively experience an isotropic loss. For an underparameterized two-layer network, we describe the stochastic dynamics of the weights in each layer and analyze the associated stationary covariances. We identify the inter-layer coupling as a distinct source of anisotropy for the weight fluctuations. In contrast to the single-layer case, the weight fluctuations are effectively subject to an anisotropic loss, the flatness of which is inversely related to the fluctuation variance. We thereby provide an analytical derivation of the recently observed inverse variance-flatness relation in a model of a deep linear neural network.</description>

      <title>A Dynamical Model of Neural Scaling Laws</title>

Abstract: On a variety of tasks, the performance of neural networks predictably improves with training time, dataset size and model size across many orders of magnitude. This phenomenon is known as a neural scaling law. Of fundamental importance is the compute-optimal scaling law, which reports the performance as a function of units of compute when choosing model sizes optimally. We analyze a random feature model trained with gradient descent as a solvable model of network training and generalization. This reproduces many observations about neural scaling laws. First, our model makes a prediction about why the scaling of performance with training time and with model size have different power law exponents. Consequently, the theory predicts an asymmetric compute-optimal scaling rule where the number of training steps are increased faster than model parameters, consistent with recent empirical observations. Second, it has been observed that early in training, networks converge to their infinite-width dynamics at a rate $1/\textit{width}$ but at late time exhibit a rate $\textit{width}^{-c}$, where $c$ depends on the structure of the architecture and task. We show that our model exhibits this behavior. Lastly, our theory shows how the gap between training and test loss can gradually build up over time due to repeated reuse of data.</description>

      <title>Jamming is a first-order transition with quenched disorder in amorphous materials sheared by cyclic quasistatic deformations</title>

Abstract: Jamming is an athermal transition between flowing and rigid states in amorphous systems such as granular matter, colloidal suspensions, complex fluids and cells. The jamming transition seems to display mixed aspects of a first-order transition, evidenced by a discontinuity in the coordination number, and a second-order transition, indicated by power-law scalings and diverging lengths. Here we demonstrate that jamming is a first-order transition with quenched disorder in cyclically sheared systems with quasistatic deformations, in two and three dimensions. Based on scaling analyses, we show that fluctuations of the jamming density in finite-sized systems have important consequences on the finite-size effects of various quantities, resulting in a square relationship between disconnected and connected susceptibilities, a key signature of the first-order transition with quenched disorder. This study puts the jamming transition into the category of a broad class of transitions in disordered systems where sample-to-sample fluctuations dominate over thermal fluctuations, suggesting that the nature and behavior of the jamming transition can be understood within the developed theoretical framework of the athermally driven random-field Ising model.</description>

      <title>Scaling and renormalization in high-dimensional regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a succinct derivation of the training and generalization performance of a variety of high-dimensional ridge regression models using the basic tools of random matrix theory and free probability. We provide an introduction and review of recent results on these topics, aimed at readers with backgrounds in physics and deep learning. Analytic formulas for the training and generalization errors are obtained in a few lines of algebra directly from the properties of the $S$-transform of free probability. This allows for a straightforward identification of the sources of power-law scaling in model performance. We compute the generalization error of a broad class of random feature models. We find that in all models, the $S$-transform corresponds to the train-test generalization gap, and yields an analogue of the generalized-cross-validation estimator. Using these techniques, we derive fine-grained bias-variance decompositions for a very general class of random feature models with structured covariates. These novel results allow us to discover a scaling regime for random feature models where the variance due to the features limits performance in the overparameterized setting. We also demonstrate how anisotropic weight structure in random feature models can limit performance and lead to nontrivial exponents for finite-width corrections in the overparameterized setting. Our results extend and provide a unifying perspective on earlier models of neural scaling laws.</description>
