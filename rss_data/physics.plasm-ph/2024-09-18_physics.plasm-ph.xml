      <title>Semantic Information Management in Low-Temperature Plasma Science and Technology with VIVO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital research data management is increasingly integrated across universities and research institutions, addressing the handling of research data throughout its lifecycle according to the FAIR data principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable). Recent emphasis on the semantic and interlinking aspects of research data, e.g., by using ontologies and knowledge graphs further enhances findability and reusability. This work presents a framework for creating and maintaining a knowledge graph specifically for low-temperature plasma (LTP) science and technology. The framework leverages a domain-specific ontology called Plasma-O, along with the VIVO software as a platform for semantic information management in LTP research. While some research fields are already prepared to use ontologies and knowledge graphs for information management, their application in LTP research is nascent. This work aims to bridge this gap by providing a framework that not only improves research data management but also fosters community participation in building the domain-specific ontology and knowledge graph based on the published materials. The results may also support other research fields in the practical use of knowledge graphs for semantic information management.</description>

      <title>An Extended Variational Method for the Resistive Wall Mode in Toroidal Plasma Confinement Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The external-kink stability of a toroidal plasma surrounded by a rigid resistive wall is investigated. The well-known analysis of Haney &amp; Freidberg is rigorously extended to allow for a wall that is sufficiently thick that the thin-shell approximation does not necessarily hold. A generalized Haney-Freidberg formula for the growth-rate of the resistive wall mode is obtained. Thick-wall effects do not change the marginal stability point of the mode, but introduce an interesting asymmetry between growing and decaying modes. Growing modes have growth-rates that exceed those predicted by the original Haney-Freidberg formula. On the other hand, decaying modes have decay-rates that are less than those predicted by the original formula.
  The well-known Hu-Betti formula for the rotational stabilization of the resistive wall mode is also generalized to take thick-wall effects into account. Increasing wall thickness facilitates the rotational stabilization of the mode, because it decreases the critical toroidal electromagnetic torque that the wall must exert on the plasma. On the other hand, the real frequency of the mode at the marginal stability point increases with increasing wall thickness.</description>

      <title>Wave Steepening and Shock Formation in Ultracold Neutral Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present observations of wave steepening and signatures of shock formation during expansion of ultracold neutral plasmas formed with an initial density distribution that is centrally peaked and decays exponentially with distance. The plasma acceleration and velocity decrease at large distance from the plasma center, leading to central ions overtaking ions in the outer regions and the development of a steepening front that is narrow compared to the size of the plasma. The density and velocity change dramatically across the front, and significant heating of the ions is observed in the region of steepest gradients. For a reasonable estimate of electron temperature, the relative velocity of ions on either side of the front modestly exceeds the local sound speed (Mach number $M \gtrsim 1$). This indicates that by sculpting steep density gradients, it is possible to create the conditions for shock formation, or very close to it, opening a new avenue of research for ultracold neutral plasmas.</description>

      <title>Excess entropy of strongly coupled Yukawa fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The entropy of strongly coupled Yukawa fluids is discussed from several perspectives. First, it is demonstrated that a vibrational paradigm of atomic dynamics in dense fluids can be used to obtain a simple and accurate estimate of the entropy without any adjustable parameters. Second, it is explained why a quasiuniversal value of the excess entropy of simple fluids at the freezing point should be expected, and it is demonstrated that a remaining very weak dependence of the freezing point entropy on the screening parameter in the Yukawa fluid can be described by a simple linear function. Third, a scaling of the excess entropy with the freezing temperature is examined, a modified form of the Rosenfeld-Tarazona scaling is put forward, and some consequences are briefly discussed. Fourth, the location of the Frenkel line on the phase diagram of Yukawa systems is discussed in terms of the excess entropy and compared with some predictions made in the literature. Fifth, the excess entropy scaling of the transport coefficients (self-diffusion, viscosity, and thermal conductivity) is reexamined using the contemporary datasets for the transport properties of Yukawa fluids. The results could be of particular interest in the context of complex (dusty) plasmas, colloidal suspensions, electrolytes, and other related systems with soft pairwise interactions.</description>

      <title>Escape of fast radio bursts from magnetars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are bright extragalactic transients likely produced by magnetars. We study the propagation of FRBs in magnetar winds, assuming that the wind is strongly magnetized and composed of electron-positron pairs. We focus on the regime where the strength parameter of the radio wave, $a_0$, is larger than unity, and the wave frequency, $\omega_0$, is larger than the Larmor frequency in the background magnetic field, $\omega_{\rm L}$. We show that strong radio waves with $a_0&gt;1$ are able to propagate when $\omega_0 &gt; a_0\omega_{\rm L}$, as the plasma current is a linear function of the wave electric field. The dispersion relation is independent of the wave strength parameter when $\omega_0 &gt; a_0\omega_{\rm L}$. Instead, radio waves could be damped when $\omega_0 &lt; a_0\omega_{\rm L}$, as a significant fraction of the wave energy is used to compress the plasma and amplify the background magnetic field. Our results suggest that FRBs should be produced at large distances from the magnetar (i.e., $R&gt;10^{12}{\rm\; cm}$, where the condition $\omega_0 &gt; a_0\omega_{\rm L}$ is satisfied). Alternatively, the structure of the magnetar wind should be strongly modified during a flare to allow the escape of FRBs produced at radii $R&lt;10^{12}{\rm\; cm}$.</description>

      <title>Tokamak edge-SOL turbulence in H-mode conditions simulated with a global, electromagnetic, transcollisional drift-fluid model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The design of commercially feasible magnetic confinement fusion reactors strongly relies on the reduced turbulent transport in the plasma edge during operation in the high confinement mode (H-mode). We present first global turbulence simulations of the ASDEX Upgrade tokamak edge and scrape-off layer (SOL) in ITER baseline H-mode conditions. Reasonable agreement with the experiment is obtained for outboard mid-plane measurements of plasma density, electron and ion temperature, as well as the radial electric field. The radial heat transport is underpredicted by roughly 1/3. These results were obtained with the GRILLIX code implementing a transcollisional, electromagnetic, global drift-fluid plasma model, coupled to diffusive neutrals. The transcollisional extensions include neoclassical corrections for the ion viscosity, as well as either a Landau-fluid or free-streaming limited model for the parallel heat conduction. Electromagnetic fluctuations are found to play a critical role in H-mode conditions. We investigate the structure of the significant $E \times B$ flow shear, finding both neoclassical components as well as zonal flows. But unlike in L-mode, geodesic acoustic modes are not observed. The turbulence mode structure is mostly that of drift-Alfv\'en waves. However, in the upper part of the pedestal, it is very weak and overshadowed by neoclassical transport. At the pedestal foot, on the other hand, we find instead the (electromagnetic) kinetic ballooning mode (KBM), most clearly just inside the separatrix. Our results pave the way towards predictive simulations of fusion reactors.</description>

      <title>Data-driven discovery of a model equation describing self-oscillations of direct current discharge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data-driven techniques developed in recent years for the discovery of equations describing complex physical phenomena open unique opportunities for plasma physics. These methods allow getting insights into the processes difficult for analytical description. Since gas discharges can be represented as complex electrical circuits consisting of impedances and capacitances, it looks natural to use the data-driven techniques to study their complex dynamics. In the present paper, the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) method is applied to analyze the self-oscillations of direct current discharge in argon. It is obtained that the third order polynomials describe best the oscillations of the discharge voltage and current. They allow an accurate capturing of the oscillations amplitudes as well as the harmonics of these oscillations. To understand the physical meaning of each term, an analytical model is presented which describes the discharge self-oscillations.</description>

      <title>Preliminary Investigation of a Higgs Factory based on Proton-Driven Plasma Wakefield Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14765v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Higgs Factory is considered the highest priority next collider project by the high-energy physics community. Very advanced designs based on radio-frequency cavities exist, and variations on this approach are still being developed. Recently, an option based on electron-bunch driven plasma wakefield acceleration has also been proposed. In this article, we discuss a further option based on proton-driven plasma wakefield acceleration. This option has significant potential advantages due to the high energy of the plasma wakefield driver, simplifying the plasma acceleration stage. Its success will depend on further developments in producing compact high-energy proton bunches at a high rate, which would also make possible a broad range of synergistic particle-physics research.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Magnetized Asteroseismic Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We solve for waves in a polytropic, stratified plasmas with a spatially varying background magnetic field that points along a horizontal $x$-direction, and with gravity that is directed along the vertical $z$-direction. Force balance determines the magnitude of the background magnetic field, $B_0^2 \sim z^{n+1}$, where $n$ is the polytropic index. Using numerical and asymptotic methods, we deduce an explicit dispersion relation for fast pressure-driven waves: $\Omega^2 \sim K\left(2m+n\right) \left[1 + (1/M_\mathrm{A})^2 (4-2\gamma+\cos^2\theta-3\cos^4\theta)/4 \right]$. Here, $\Omega$ is the frequency, $K$ the wavenumber, $\theta$ the angle the wave-vector makes with the background magnetic field, $M_\mathrm{A}$ the Alfv\'enic Mach number, and $m$ an integer representing the eigenstate. We discuss roles of such an explicit formula in asteroseismology.</description>

      <title>Characteristics and Source Regions of Slow Alfvenic Solar Wind Observed by Parker Solar Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a classification scheme for solar wind type based on the heliocentric distance of the observation, we look at near perihelion observations from Parker Solar Probe Encounters Four to Fourteen to study the sources of the slow Alfv$\'e$nic solar wind (SASW). Through Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS) modeling and ballistic mapping, we connect streams to their solar source and find that a primary population of SASW comes from low magnetic field strength regions (low-$B_0$), likely small coronal holes (CHs) and their over-expanded boundaries, while a second population of high field strength (high-$B_0$) seems to emerge from non-CH structures potentially through interchange reconnection with nearby open field lines. This low-$B_0$ SASW shows larger expansion than the fast solar wind (FSW) but similar mass flux, potentially indicating additional heating below the critical point, and emergence from a cooler structure, which could lead to slower wind emerging from CH-like structures. We show that this low-$B_0$ SASW shows stronger preferential acceleration of alpha particles (similar to the FSW) than the high-$B_0$ SASW, and that this is a velocity dependent phenomenon as found in previous studies. To have additional confidence in our mapping results, we quantify the error on both the PFSS model and ballistic mapping and discuss how additional multi-point observations of plasma parameters and composition would allow us to better constrain our models and connect the solar wind to its source.</description>
