      <title>Differential Reductions and Cosmological Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of cosmological correlators, and more generally Feynman integrals, is greatly aided by considering them as solutions to differential equations. Often, such systems of differential equations are reducible, which, broadly speaking, implies that the differential system is composed of various subsystems. Studying such decompositions and subsystems can greatly aid in solving the full differential system, as well as bring to light a substantial amount of structure. In this PhD thesis, we study reducibility for a particular system of differential equations known as GKZ (Gelfand, Kapranov and Zelevinsky) systems. We show how reducibility manifests itself in the differential equations through the existence of certain special operators, reduction operators, and explain their properties. Furthermore, we apply this framework to cosmological correlators, exemplifying how these reduction operators can be used to obtain and understand the structure within the system. Here the amount of structure seems remarkably large, and we leverage this structure to obtain many algebraic and permutative identities within the space of solutions to the differential equations. Interestingly, these include various cut and contraction relations between diagrams. We show how to obtain all such relations and how they reduce the full solution set to a certain, remarkably small, subset. Finally, we explain how such simplifications can be understood through the lens of o-minimality and Pfaffian complexity, as well as some of the limitations of this perspective.</description>

      <title>Higher-Point Correlators in N=4 SYM: Ten-Dimensional Null Polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider higher-point generalizations of the "octagon" large-charge four-point function in planar N=4 super Yang-Mills theory. These n-point polygon correlators are defined as ten-dimensional null limits of generating functions of n-point correlators of protected scalar operators with arbitrary R-charge, and are conjecturally dual to massive scattering amplitudes of W-bosons on the Coulomb branch of the theory. We present a twistor-based direct computation of the polygon loop integrands, and determine the two-loop integrands for any number of external operators. The result is expressed as a linear combination of conformal integrals, with coefficients that are rational functions of the spacetime distances and operator polarizations. We obtain an exact match with a one-loop integrability computation, and study the near-massless limit of the pentagon function.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent flux backgrounds in type IIB supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analytically construct families of type IIB supergravity backgrounds in ten dimensions in which the four-dimensional metric is time dependent, while the six-dimensional internal space is an arbitrary compact Calabi-Yau manifold (with no restriction on holonomy) up to an overall time-dependent scale factor. Our solutions include cases with all fluxes (three-form and self-dual five-form) switched on, as well as cases with subsets of these fluxes, together with a time-dependent axiodilaton in most cases. These constructions require no local sources. We show that the associated energy-momentum tensors (both 10D and the resulting 4D effective) satisfy the null, weak, strong, and dominant energy conditions. In our explicit constructions, the Ricci scalar of the four-dimensional Einstein frame metric is negative; such backgrounds may find applications to anisotropic or FLRW cosmologies in the early universe. We also revisit the Maldacena--Nu\~nez no-go analysis, incorporating new elements that appear in our constructions, namely an overall noncompact spacetime-dependent scale factor multiplying the internal metric, and field strengths with components partially covering the noncompact directions. We argue that, with these generalizations, a four-dimensional Einstein-frame metric with positive Ricci scalar cannot be ruled out by such an analysis.</description>

      <title>On the Orbifold origin of Higher Form Symmetries in Geometric Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we explore the relation between orbifold singularities and higher form symmetries. Using the geometric engineering dictionary, we argue that the discrete higher symmetries of 5d SCFTs constructed from M-theory on a non-compact Calabi-Yau threefold can be related to a quantum symmetry of the associated BPS quiver. Through un-orbifolding the quantum symmetry we obtain a new theory without higher form symmetry, providing a notion of ''minimality'' for a theory. This procedure is carried out via algebraic manipulations of the BPS/McKay quiver describing the crepant resolution of the singular geometry. This technique can also be reverted and thus, starting from any ''minimal'' theory, one can orbifold it and generate new theories with the desired higher form symmetries. We test our technology on classes of 5d SCFTs that arise from M-theory geometric engineering on Calabi-Yau threefolds that are non-toric non-complete intersections, which have historically been challenging to tackle.</description>

      <title>Schubert line defects in 3d GLSM, part I: Complete flag manifolds and quantum Grothendieck polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct new half-BPS line defects in 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric quiver gauge theories whose Higgs branches are complete flag manifolds $X = {\rm Fl}(n)$. Upon circle compactification, the bulk theory flows to a non-linear sigma model (NLSM) with target space $X$ and the line defects flow to objects supported on Schubert varieties $X_w \subseteq X$. These Schubert line defects form an important basis of the quantum K-theory of $X$. They are realized as $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SQM) quivers coupled to the 3d gauge theory. We show that the insertion of the Schubert line defect restricts the target space of the 3d gauged linear sigma model (GLSM) to the Schubert variety $X_w$, with the 1d degrees of freedom physically realizing a Bott--Samelson resolution of $X_w$. Moreover, we verify in examples that the 1d flavored Witten index of the quiver SQM reproduces the (equivariant) Chern character of the structure sheaf $\mathcal{O}_{X_w}$ as a (double) quantum Grothendieck polynomial, generalizing previous results for $X$ a Grassmannian manifold. Our construction thus provides a more direct realization of the 3d GLSM/quantum K-theory correspondence for complete flag manifolds. Finally, in the small-circle limit, we obtain a 0d-2d coupled system that realizes the Schubert classes $[X_w]$ in the quantum cohomology ring of $X$.</description>

      <title>Mass and coupling magnetic field dependence in a scalar theory with charged bosons from an environmentally friendly renormalization group analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the running of the mass of a neutral boson and of its self-coupling in a simple model describing the self-interaction of three scalars, one of them neutral and the other two electrically charged, subject to the effects of a magnetic field, as functions of the field strength, at one-loop order. We resort to the Environmentally Friendly Renormalization Group approach, where the flow variable is taken as that describing the environmental conditions, in this case the strength of the magnetic field. We find the magnetic field dependent mass and coupling beta functions and use them to set up the differential equations satisfied by the neutral scalar mass and coupling. We solve the resulting system of coupled equations both numerically, and also analytically in the small-mass approximation. We find that the neutral scalar mass increases, while the coupling decreases with increasing field strength. The study is intended to set up the ideas to later use them in more sophisticated theories such as QED and QCD.</description>

      <title>Entanglement cohomology for GHZ and W states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement cohomology assigns a graded cohomology ring to a multipartite pure state, providing homological invariants that are stable under local unitaries and characterize inequivalent patterns of entanglement. In this work we derive exact expressions for the dimensions of these cohomology groups in two canonical entanglement classes, generalized GHZ and W states on an arbitrary number of parties and local Hilbert space dimensions, thus proving conjectures of arXiv:1901.02011. Using the additional structure of the Hodge star and wedge product operations, we propose two new classes of local unitary invariants: the spectrum of the natural Laplacian acting on entanglement $k$-forms, and the intersection numbers obtained from wedge products of representatives for cohomology classes. We present numerical experiments which investigate these invariants in particular states, suggesting that they may provide useful quantities for describing multipartite entanglement.</description>

      <title>Why Indices Count the Total Number of Black Hole Microstates (at large N)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using supersymmetric localization, we show that the partition function of four-dimensional superconformal gauge theories -- computed as a trace over BPS states without the insertion of $(-1)^F$ -- is protected and independent of the gauge coupling $g_{YM}$. We derive a matrix-integral representation of this observable for generic four-dimensional superconformal gauge theories. For $U(N)$ maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, we study such matrix integral and show that it localizes to ensembles of superconformal indices near its essential singularities. The latter asymptotic localization explains why a single microcanonical index reproduces the growth of the total number of BPS states in a large-$N$ expansion at charges of order $N^2$, despite exhibiting large sign-oscillations due to the insertion of $(-1)^F$. To compute quantum corrections to entropy, at finite $N$, the correct observable is the protected partition function which by definition is a positive quantity.
  To study this protected observable, we propose and test an improvement of the Cardy-like method that allows us to identify and compute perturbatively exact expressions for the leading large-$N$ onshell action of eigenvalue-configurations that we call orbifold, dressed orbifold, and eigenvalue-instanton saddles.</description>

      <title>Entanglement of General Subregions in Time-Dependent States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a unified framework for computing R\'enyi and entanglement entropies of arbitrary spacetime intervals in time-dependent states of $(1+1)$-dimensional conformal field theories. By combining the spacetime density matrix formalism with the replica method, we show that entanglement entropy is well defined for both spacelike and timelike separations. Applying this framework to global quenches prepared by boundary states and to local quenches generated by operator insertions, we obtain analytic expressions for the entanglement entropy in general spacetime configurations. The results reveal qualitative differences between spacelike and timelike intervals: the timelike entanglement entropy is time-independent in the global quench model, depends solely on the temporal separation, and universally exhibits a constant imaginary contribution. These features are naturally explained by a generalized quasiparticle picture in which entanglement is produced precisely when one worldline of each quasiparticle pair intersects the interval. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the linear sum rule relating time- and spacelike entanglement persists in both global and local quenches, indicating a broader universality of spacetime entanglement in real-time quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>On holography with ADE singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study aspects of the AdS/CFT correspondence for $\mathcal{N}=4$ $U(N)$ super Yang-Mills theory on $S^3/\Gamma$, where $\Gamma \subset SU(2)$ is a finite subgroup, leading to an ADE singularity in the bulk AdS geometry. We show that a large vacuum degeneracy arises from the choice of gauge holonomy on $S^3/\Gamma$. On the gravity side, we argue that the bulk ADE singularity supports topological degrees of freedom responsible for this degeneracy. We then provide a holographic derivation of a corresponding large vacuum degeneracy for class S theories of type $U(N)$, showing that these topological degrees of freedom admit an effective description in terms of a three-dimensional level-$N$ Chern-Simons theory, whose gauge group $\mathsf{G}$ is determined by $\Gamma$. Finally, we discuss how the one-form symmetries of the $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory are realized on the Chern-Simons theory side.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supertranslations are usually defined as asymptotic symmetries associated with spacetime boundaries, such as null infinity and black hole horizons. In this Letter, we show that supertranslations admit a natural, coordinate-independent extension into the bulk of spacetime, realized as transitions between families of null hypersurfaces. This construction applies to generic spacetimes in arbitrary dimensions and unifies the realizations of supertranslations at null infinity and black hole horizons. The associated symmetry algebra can be realized by light-ray operators defined on the null hypersurface. Within this framework, the gravitational wave memory effect corresponds to a shift of null hypersurfaces in the bulk. As explicit examples, we compute bulk supertranslations in Minkowski spacetime in arbitrary dimensions and in four-dimensional Schwarzschild spacetime, where we uncover a novel curvature-induced memory effect with observable consequences for light propagation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the nature of higher dimensional operators generated by quantum gravity. Calculating the tree-level and one-loop effective operators generated by graviton exchange between fields of the standard model and those of a hidden sector, we show that the leading order operators generated by quantum gravity are non-local dimension 6 operators. Dimension 5 operators are not generated by perturbative (weak field) effects, although they might be generated by strong field effects such as Planck-scale fluctuations in spacetime. We investigate the consequences of our findings for models of ultralight scalar dark matter.</description>

      <title>Holographic multipartite entanglement structures in IR modified geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how IR modifications of the bulk geometry reshape long-range multipartite entanglement on the boundary in holography. We modify the IR geometries in two opposite directions: spherical modifications that enhance long-range entanglement and hyperbolic modifications that suppress them. We utilize various multipartite entanglement measures/signals to analyze the multipartite entanglement structures. These measures/signals are combinations of entanglement entropy, multi-entropy, entanglement wedge cross sections (EWCS) and multi-EWCS. Our results reveal that in the extremal limits of these two geometric modifications, the multipartite entanglement structures exhibit starkly contrasting behaviors: various measures saturate either their theoretical upper or lower bounds in the respective geometries. This demonstrates that IR deformations provide a practical holographic framework for realizing extremal entanglement regimes. Moreover, it serves as an effective tool for studying quantum marginal problems in holography. Finally, by observing how different measures respond to these engineered geometries, we gain clarifying insights into the specific types of multipartite entanglement that each measure/signal is particularly sensitive to.</description>

      <title>Holographic shear correlators at low temperatures, and quantum $\eta/s$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strongly-coupled 3-dimensional theory, holographically dual to black branes at fixed chemical potential $\muext$ and temperature $T \ll \mu$ is considered in AdS$_4$ Einstein-Maxwell theory. The retarded Green's functions at frequency $\omega$ is calculated using holography in the regime $\omega, T \ll \muext$ but otherwise arbitrary. When the transverse space has finite volume, there is a non-zero energy scale $E_\text{gap}$, scaling as $1/\mu$ for large $\mu$, below which quantum-gravitational corrections due to the fluctuations of the nearly-gapless Schwarzian modes become important. Such corrections to the retarded Green's function are calculated at different relative values of $\omega$, $T$, and $E_\text{gap}$. The $\omega \to 0$ limit is used to define the shear viscosity $\eta$. As the temperature is lowered below $\mu$, quantum corrections are found to increase the value of $\eta$ with respect to its semiclassical value. The quantum-corrected result for $\eta$ diverges as $\sqrt{E_\text{gap}/T}$ at $T \ll E_\text{gap}$, in accord with corresponding results for the absorption cross section. The quantum result for the ratio $\eta/s$, where $s$ is the entropy density, dips below the semiclassical limit of $1/4\pi$ when $E_\text{gap} \ll T \ll \mu$, then turns back to increase towards lower temperatures, and finally diverges at temperatures much below $E_\text{gap}$.</description>

      <title>Geometry and Arithmetic of Special Loci in the Moduli Spaces of Type II String Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use Dwork's deformation method to calculate the Hasse-Weil Zeta function of multi-parameter families of Calabi-Yau three and fourfolds. This information is used to identify subslices of codimension one in the complex-structure moduli space, where the Hodge structure splits in particular ways and different type IIB flux vacua emerge. We calculate the corresponding background fluxes and their potential that drives the IIB string compactification to these subslices and analyse the properties of the corresponding physical vacua. We address the question whether the subslices correspond to fixed loci of symmetries acting on the original family and whether they can be identified with consistent complex-structure moduli spaces of Picard-Fuchs systems with standard integral monodromy bases for fewer complex deformation parameters. We distinguish between supersymmetric vacua and singular subslices. In the latter case a standard geometrical basis can be expected if a physical transition leads to a smooth type II vacuum. In many cases the differential equations on the subslice are fulfilled by the restricted periods after adding an inhomogeneous term. This suggests that the resolution of the singularity provides three-chains and we indeed find that the corresponding integrals allow an integral expansion compatible with their interpretation as generating functions of disk instantons.</description>

      <title>Finite parts of inflationary loops II: A streamlined UV in-in algorithm and distinguishable signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a streamlined method for evaluating in-in loop integrals using dimensional regularization for diagrams with an arbitrary number of external legs and vertices, which complements earlier work and facilitates the extraction of the ultraviolet contributions. The method leads us to identify an apparent difficulty to renormalize with Hamiltonian counterterms within the in-in formalism. We also discuss the importance of the finite parts of loop corrections that can be distinguished from their associated counterterm contributions. As an application, we examine the one-loop primordial bispectrum in the context of the effective field theory of inflation, considering a specific set of interactions, and identifying a contribution distinguishable from its tree-level counterpart.</description>

      <title>Large D charged black hole as a Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity weakly coupled to the thermal graviton background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The s-wave approximation to the black hole dynamics has attracted considerable attention recently. However, the near-AdS2 geometry of the near-horizon region and decoupling of the non-s-wave modes usually requires a small-temperature limit. In this work we propose the new limit based on the large number of dimensions in which the temperature remains finite, but the s-wave sector may be described by Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity interacting with other modes with vanishingly small coupling. However, we demonstrate that the thermal bath of the tensor modes with non-zero angular momenta collectively produces a significant impact on the two-dimensional theory.</description>

      <title>Holographic entanglement negativity and thermodynamics in backreacted AdS black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate holographic entanglement negativity (HEN) as a probe of mixed state quantum correlations in a deformed AdS black hole background with backreaction sourced by a string cloud. The bulk geometry is dual to a strongly coupled large-$N_c$ gauge theory at finite temperature, backreacted by a finite density of heavy static fundamental quarks. Alongside holographic entanglement entropy (HEE), we analyze entanglement thermodynamics and establish a first law like relation in the small backreaction regime by identifying the deformed black hole at zero temperature as the natural ground state of the dual field theory. Using analytic expansions in the low and high temperature limits, we compute the HEN for adjacent, disjoint and bipartite subsystem configurations and examine its dependence on the backreaction parameter $\rho$. Our results reveal a clear regime dependence: at low temperature, backreaction suppresses the negativity, signaling a reduction of distillable quantum correlations while at high temperature the negativity is enhanced due to the monotonic $\rho$-dependence of near horizon contributions. We further compare the behavior of HEN with HEE and mutual information, demonstrating that entanglement negativity provides a sharper diagnostic of the competition between thermal and quantum correlations in holographic plasmas with matter backreaction.</description>

      <title>A Manifestly Causal Approach to Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a probability-level, manifestly causal formalism for calculations in QFT. The approach involves an implicit summation over final states, which makes causality manifest since retarded propagators emerge naturally. This inclusive summation over final states may also offer insights into the cancellation of IR divergences in physical observables within gauge theories, in accordance with the BN and KLN theorems. To study this, we first conduct particle scattering calculations using conventional methods, determining the quark-antiquark production cross section at first-order in gluon corrections, with careful tracking and cancellation of both IR and UV divergences. We then apply the causal formalism to analogous processes in scalar field theory, introducing novel diagrams that represent algebraic terms at the probability level, akin to Feynman diagrams at the amplitude level. We present a list of rules that generate all probability-level diagrams for particle scattering processes in which one is fully inclusive over final states that contain no initial-state particles. We also investigate the Unruh effect through the lens of the causal formalism. We calculate the transition rate of an accelerating UdW detector coupled to a massive scalar field, from both the perspective of an inertial observer and an accelerating observer. We confirm that the two perspectives give the same transition rate, despite the Rindler observer describing the Minkowski vacuum state as a thermal bath of particles. Numerical results for the transition rate are presented, highlighting the transient effects caused by forcing the field to initially be in the Minkowski vacuum state. Finally, we review the literature regarding the response of an UdW detector on various trajectories in the spacetime of a (3+1)-D Schwarzschild black hole, with a view to extending the analysis in the future using our causal formalism.</description>

      <title>The Cosmological Constant and Dark Dimensions from Non-Supersymmetric Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a string theory construction in which the particle physics contributions to the one-loop vacuum energy exactly cancel, whilst the gravitational contributions are suppressed in the size of one or two large extra dimensions. This provides an ultraviolet realisation of the Dark Dimension and Supersymmetric Large Extra Dimensions scenarios, with, moreover, an explanation as to why the Standard Model contributions to the vacuum energy cancel without the need of eV mass-splittings. Gravity propagates in micron sized dark dimension(s), whilst the visible and hidden sectors are supported on D-branes. Supersymmetry is broken in the dark dimension(s) \`a la Scherk-Schwarz, whereas supersymmetry is broken at the string scale, \`a la Brane Supersymmetry Breaking, in the D-branes sector, without inducing tadpoles. Vacuum energy from the visible sector is cancelled by the vacuum energy of the hidden sector branes. We also discuss moduli stabilization in this set-up, finding that the interplay between the Scherk-Schwarz one-loop contribution and non-perturbative effects can fix the size of the dark dimension(s) to be exponentially large in the inverse string-coupling, leading to an exponentially small total vacuum energy, with all moduli stabilised in a dS saddle.</description>

Abstract: We find a necessary condition for subsystems to become entangled after a quantum reference frame transformation. By distinguishing between quantum systems suitable to act as reference frames and physical systems described relative to these frames, we define passive quantum reference frames and show that transformations between these cannot produce entanglement between physical systems. Our results also apply to the study of entanglement between subsystems in the perspectival framework even when there is no distinction between physical and reference systems.</description>

      <title>Buchdahl limits in theories with regular black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study generalizations of Buchdahl's compactness limits for perfect-fluid star solutions of $D$-dimensional Einstein gravity coupled to higher-curvature corrections. We focus on Quasi-topological theories involving infinite towers of terms for which the unique vacuum spherically symmetric solutions correspond to regular black holes. We solve analytically the problem of constant-density stars and find that the space of solutions is bounded by: configurations with divergent central-pressure, corresponding to the most compact stars; configurations which possess zero central-pressure; and configurations for which the sizes of the stars coincide with the inner-horizon radii of the would-be regular black holes. In the more general case of perfect-fluid stars for which the mean density decreases with increasing radius, we show that, for each density profile, maximum compactness is reached when the metric becomes singular at the center. Under certain additional conditions, we find a novel Buchdahl limit for the maximum compactness of stars, attained by a specific constant-density profile. We show, in particular, that stars in these theories may be more compact than in Einstein gravity. While the vacuum solutions of these theories are such that all curvature invariants take mass-independent maximum finite values, we argue that there exist ordinary matter stars with finite central pressures for which such bounds can be violated -- namely, arbitrarily high curvatures can be reached -- unless additional constraints, such as the dominant energy condition, are imposed on the fluid.</description>

      <title>Multiple Mellin-Barnes integrals with polygamma functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mellin-Barnes (MB) integrals appear in various branches of physics and mathematics and are, in particular, used as a standard tool for evaluating multi-loop, multi-scale Feynman integrals both analytically and numerically. Recent geometric approaches based on conic hulls and triangulations provide a systematic framework for computing multiple MB integrals in terms of multivariate series. These approaches have so far been limited to MB integrals whose integrands are ratios of products of Euler's gamma functions only. However, in Feynman integral calculus, MB integrals with polygamma functions naturally arise, for instance, after resolving singularities in the dimensional-regularisation parameter $\epsilon$ and expanding the MB integrand in powers of $\epsilon$, as done by the public codes MB.m and MBresolve.m. In this paper, we extend the conic hull and triangulation methods to the computation of MB integrals having polygamma functions in their integrand. We show that the arguments of polygamma functions can be treated in a similar way to the arguments of gamma functions when applying the conic hull and triangulation techniques to identify poles that would contribute to different series solutions. However, since the singularity structure of the polygamma function is different from that of the gamma function, we propose two different ways to compute MB integrals involving polygamma functions, depending on whether the MB integral has straight or non-straight contours. We have implemented these algorithms in an updated version of the Mathematica package MBConicHulls.wl, which can be found at https://github.com/SumitBanikGit/MBConicHulls/, and we illustrate their use with a set of examples from Feynman integral calculus.</description>

      <title>Mass and entropy of asymptotically flat eternal quantum black holes in 2D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semi-classical dilaton gravity in (1+1)-dimensions remains one of the only arenas where quantum black holes can be exactly constructed, fully accounting for backreaction due to quantum matter. Here we provide a comprehensive analysis of the mass and thermodynamic properties of static asymptotically flat quantum black holes both analytically and numerically. First, we analytically investigate eternal quantum black hole solutions to a one-parameter family of analytically solvable models interpolating between Russo-Susskind-Thorlacius and Bose, Parker, and Peleg gravities. Examining these models in a semi-classically allowed parameter space, we find naked singularities may exist for quantum fields in the Boulware state. Using a quasi-local formalism, where we confine the black hole to a finite sized cavity, we derive the conserved energy and analyze the system's thermal behavior. Specifically, we show the semi-classical Wald entropy precisely equals the generalized entropy, accounting for both gravitational and fine grained matter entropies, and we find a range where the quantum black holes are thermally stable. Finally, we numerically construct eternal black hole solutions to semi-classical Callan-Giddings-Harvey-Strominger gravity and find their thermal behavior is qualitatively different from their analytic counterparts. In the process, we develop an analytic expansion of the solutions and find it accurately approximates the full numerical solutions in the semi-classical limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starting from square-integrable wave functions on a Lie group, we build an invertible Fourier transform mapping them on wave functions on the dual of the Lie algebra. This is a group-theoretic version of the map from position space to momentum space, with generally noncommuting momenta owing to the group structure. As a result, the multiplication of momentum-dependent functions involves star products, which makes the construction of noncommutative Fourier series much more involved than that of their commutative cousin. We show that our formalism provides an isometry of Hilbert spaces, and use it to derive a noncommutative Poisson summation formula for any compact Lie group. This is a key preliminary for the computation of Wigner functions and path integrals for quantum systems on group manifolds.</description>

      <title>The relation between classical and quantum Lyapunov exponent and the bound on chaos in classically chaotic quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Out-of-Time-Ordered Commutators (OTOCs), representing a key diagnostic for scrambling as a facet of short-time quantum chaos, have attracted wide-ranging interest, from many-body physics to quantum gravity. By means of a suitable form of the Wigner-Moyal expansion, and invoking ensemble equivalence in statistical physics, we provide a consistent approach to the growth rate of the OTOC for many-body systems with chaotic classical limit where both the classical Lyapunov exponent and the quantum nature of the density of states enter. Applying this construction to quantized high-dimensional hyperbolic motion, i.e., a quantum chaotic system that exhibits gravity-like correlation functions in the late-time regime, we compute the OTOC growth rate $\Lambda$ as a function of the number of degrees of freedom, $f$, and inverse temperature, $\beta$.
  We show that the scaled growth rate, $\Lambda/f$, can be described by a universal function of $f \beta$ and displays a cross-over from classical to quantum behavior as we increase $f$ and/or lower the temperature. In the deep quantum regime of infinite $f$, we find maximally fast scrambling in the sense of the Maldacena-Shenker-Stanford bound on chaos. This elucidates the non-perturbative mechanism underlying the saturation of the bound via quantum contributions to the mean density of states, and it provides further support for this dynamical system as a dual to two-dimensional quantum gravity. In this way, we present first evidence of maximally fast scrambling in a quantum chaotic system with a well-defined classical Hamiltonian limit, without invoking any external mechanism such as (disorder) averaging.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the cosmology of an axion that is fundamentally non-compact. During inflation, fluctuations of the effectively massless field populate many QCD vacua, thereby evading conventional isocurvature constraints while generating domain walls -- without accompanying cosmic strings. A small non-QCD contribution to the axion potential is required to trigger the timely collapse of domain walls; as a consequence, a residual amount of CP violation in the strong sector must exist, potentially within reach of planned experiments. Non-compact axions can account for the entirety of the dark matter abundance, and the collapse of domain walls sources a stochastic gravitational-wave background at nanohertz frequencies. Such axion dynamics can be embedded in top-down constructions -- such as Weyl-invariant Einstein-Cartan gravity -- where the tilting of the axion potential arises automatically.</description>

Abstract: Two prescriptions, the expansion of near horizon of geometry and expansion of metric with zero limit of the expansion parameter $c$ (speed of light in vacuum), of constructing Carroll geometries are known to complement each other. The entropy of an ideal gas, confined in a box and kept very near to the horizon, depends on the transverse area of the container. We show this by using the Carroll geometry constructed through the expansion of the metric and then taking zero limit of the expansion parameter $c$. Therefore the present analysis re-assures the complementing nature of two ways of finding the Carroll geometry from the thermodynamical point of view.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the teleparallel Robertson--Walker (TRW) $F(T)$-gravity solutions for a cosmological electromagnetic source in the current paper. We use and solve the TRW $F(T)$-gravity field equations (FEs) for each value of the $k$-parameter $(-1,\,0,\,+1)$ and the electromagnetic equivalent of the equation of state (EoS), leading to new teleparallel $F(T)$ solutions. For the $k=0$ cosmological case, we find new teleparallel $F(T)$ solutions for any scale factor $n$. For $k=\pm 1$ cosmological cases, we find exact and far-future approximated new teleparallel $F(T)$ solutions for slow, linear, fast and infinitely fast universe expansion summarized by analytical functions. All the new solutions are relevant for future cosmological applications, implying any electromagnetic source processes, such as the cosmological plasma models.</description>

      <title>The Exact Uncertainty Relation and Geometric Speed Limits in Krylov Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that Hall's exact uncertainty relation acquires a simple geometric form in the Krylov basis generated by the Liouvillian. In this canonical operator frame, the uncertainty equality implies that the operator amplitude vector evolves on the unit Krylov sphere with constant speed fixed solely by the first Lanczos coefficient. This yields an exact linear bound on geometric operator evolution, independent of higher Lanczos coefficients and valid for arbitrary Hamiltonians, integrable or chaotic. Our results provide the first unified geometric interpretation of exact quantum speed limits and operator growth, identifying the first Lanczos coefficient as the intrinsic speed scale of quantum dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: QCD at large densities exhibits a moat regime in the scalar-pseudoscalar sector. The resolution of its dynamics is pivotal for the access to the onset of new phases including the potential critical endpoint of QCD. In this work we present the first selfconsistent analysis of this regime with the functional renormalisation group approach to QCD. We map out the moat regime, including a first analysis of potential inhomogeneous instabilities at baryon chemical potential $\mu_B\gtrsim 600$ MeV on the chiral crossover line.</description>

      <title>Squeezed States in Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general framework for the production of squeezed quantum states of the gravitational field in linearized quantum gravity. Time-dependent couplings in the quadratic part of the action generically produce squeezed states from the vacuum. Using the harmonic oscillator as an example, we describe three techniques to obtain the squeezing parameter from such quadratic terms. For gravity, the action to quadratic order in metric perturbations contains couplings both to background curvature as well as to matter sources. Thus, both time-dependent classical spacetimes and time-dependent classical matter typically produce squeezed states of gravity.</description>

      <title>Hidden Conformal Symmetry in AdS$_2\times$S$^2$ Beyond Tree Level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Correlators of a certain one-dimensional superconformal field theory dual to hypermultiplets in AdS$_2\times$S$^2$ exhibit a hidden four-dimensional conformal symmetry which allows one to repackage all tree-level 4-point correlators into a single four-dimensional object corresponding to a contact diagram arising from a massless $\phi^4$ theory in AdS$_2\times$S$^2$. This theory serves as a toy model for IIB string theory in AdS$_5\times$S$^5$ and is interesting in its own right because AdS$_2\times$S$^2$ describes the near-horizon limit of extremal black holes in four dimensions. We argue that after acting with an $SU(1,1)\times SU(2)$ Casimir, all one-loop correlators can similarly be encoded by a four-dimensional function which arises from a one-loop scalar bubble diagram in AdS$_2\times$S$^2$, explaining how the hidden conformal symmetry extends beyond tree level. Finally, we conjecture a scalar effective field theory with a derivative interaction in AdS$_2\times$S$^2$ whose Witten diagrams should directly reproduce 4-point correlators to all loops without acting with Casimirs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14019v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of the Hamiltonian formulation of string theory, a widely acknowledged issue is the inability of the first-class constraints to accurately reproduce the Lagrangian symmetry transformations. We take a critical look at the Hamiltonian formulation of the Polyakov string and demonstrate, using Castellani's procedure, that diffeomorphism and Weyl symmetries naturally emerge without using any field-dependent reparametrization, thus preserving the theoretical consistency between Hamiltonian and Lagrangian descriptions. Additionally, we will review the standard Hamiltonian analysis of the symmetries in terms of lapse and shift functions and show that the reason behind this failure is not due to the non-canonicity of the variables but rather because this parametrization fails to preserve general covariance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12529v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore and extend the application of homological algebra to describe quantum entanglement, initiated in arXiv:1901.02011, focusing on the Hodge-theoretic structure of entanglement cohomology in finite-dimensional quantum systems. We construct analogues of the Hodge star operator, inner product, codifferential, and Laplacian for entanglement $k$-forms. We also prove that such $k$-forms obey versions of the Hodge isomorphism theorem and Hodge decomposition, and that they exhibit Hodge duality. As a corollary, we conclude that the dimensions of the $k$-th and $(n-k)$-th cohomologies coincide for entanglement in $n$-partite pure states, which explains a symmetry property ("Poincare duality") of the associated Poincare polynomials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The crossed product has recently emerged as an important ingredient in describing algebras of observables for quantum field theory and gravity. We combine this with perturbation theory, and study perturbative crossed product algebras obtained from a unitary deformation of the original system. Motivated by the problem of black hole evaporation, we propose an abstract framework in which black hole information can be transferred to Hawking radiation by passing to a perturbative crossed product exhibiting a degree of non-locality in its modular structure. As both a concrete example and a toy model for evaporation, we analyze the algebra of observables of the traversable wormhole in anti-de-Sitter space. We obtain new contributions to the generalized entropy beyond subleading order relative to the original work by Gao, Jafferis, and Wall. We close with some comments on the potential applicability of the algebraic approach to quantum gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00638v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the fully supersymmetric solutions in a class of N=3 and N=4 higher derivative Poincar\'e supergravity theories. These class of theories are obtained within the framework of conformal supergravity using the standard Weyl multiplet and contains a set of terms related to the Weyl square term by supersymmetry. We work in the superconformal formalism and show that flat spacetime is the only fully supersymmetric solution in these theories. However, in N=2 Poincar\'e supergravity theories that falls into the same class, two fully supersymmetric stationary solutions exist: Bertotti-Robinson geometry ($AdS_2\times S^2$) and flat spacetime, which are known in the literature. We discuss the reason behind the richer vacua in N=2 supergravity compared to its N=3 and N=4 cousins.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19914v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss a cosmological scenario where an effective violation of the strong energy condition (SEC) is realized through a coupling between SEC-fulfilling dark matter (DM) and dark energy (DE). Although the SEC-violating solutions might in principle last for an arbitrarily long time, we highlight several challenges that string realizations must face: most notably, these are the identification of suitable heavy states and their relationship with the theory cutoff. Furthermore, we discuss a black-hole argument that still allows for long-lived epochs of cosmic acceleration, but that prevents them from lasting forever. We also discuss negative potentials in the presence of a tower of light states, showing that the DM/DE coupling can push the theory towards regions of parametric control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a set of higher-form conserved currents on spacetimes admitting conformal Killing-Yano tensors. We find relations between these currents that allow the charge given by integrating one of these currents over a region to be re-expressed as an integral of a covariant quantity over the boundary. In many cases, only a non-covariant form of the boundary integral was previously known. For a special class of these currents the conservation does not rely on field equations, so they give conserved topological charges in any gravitational theory. We discuss the relation of our currents to the Komar current and derive several new properties of conformal Killing-Yano tensors. We study a number of applications of our construction to charges of black hole solutions of Einstein-Maxwell theory, and D-brane solutions of type II supergravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a normalizable measure on the space of two-dimensional conformal field theories, which we interpret as a maximum ignorance ensemble. We test whether pure quantum gravity in AdS$_3$ is dual to the average over this ensemble. We find a negative answer, which implies that CFTs with a primary gap of order the central charge are highly atypical in our ensemble. We provide evidence that more generally, holographic CFTs are atypical in the space of all CFTs by finding similar results for permutation orbifolds: subgroups of $S_N$ with a good large $N$ limit are very sparse in the space of all subgroups. Along the way, we derive several new results on the space of CFTs. Notably we derive an upper bound on the spacing in central charge between CFTs, which is doubly exponentially small in the large central charge limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16104v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The BTZ black hole provides a tractable (2+1)-dimensional example for investigating string dynamics in curved spacetime. However, a systematic and robust analysis of the solution space of strings in the near-horizon region of BTZ black holes remains elusive in the literature. This work aims to fill this gap by employing the string-Carroll expansion. This formalism provides a natural setting for working with the near-horizon region, because near-horizon expansions for non-extremal black holes match string-Carroll expansions. Using this formalism, and expanding the string action and pullback fields in powers of an effective speed of light, we study the dynamics of closed bosonic strings in the near-horizon, non-extremal BTZ spacetime. Our approach classifies the general characteristics and further reveals some novel features of the families of string solutions.</description>

Abstract: We use standard techniques of hydrodynamics to construct a relativistic effective field theory for the low energy dynamics of nearly critical superfluids. In an appropriate non-relativistic limit, our theory predicts an additional coefficient when compared and contrasted to earlier work of Khalatnikov and Lebedev. In addition, we provide an alternative derivation of the same effective theory, using the Keldysh-Schwinger framework for non-equilibrium systems. Finally, we comment on the comparison with the results of an appropriate holographic computation presented in a companion paper. This provides further evidence in support of the theory we propose and confirms the existence of the extra coefficient we identified.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Invariance of on-shell scattering amplitudes under field redefinitions is a well known property in field theory that corresponds to covariance of on-shell amputated connected functions. In recent years there have been great efforts to define a formalism in which the covariance is manifest at all stages of calculation, mainly resorting to geometrical interpretations. In this work covariance is analysed using combinatorial methods relying only on the properties of the tree level effective action, without referring to specific formulations of the Lagrangian. We provide an explicit proof of covariance of on-shell connected functions and of the existence of covariant Feynman rules and we derive an explicitly covariant closed formula for tree level on-shell connected functions with any number of external legs.</description>

      <title>Generalizing quantum dimensions: Symmetry-based classification of local pseudo-Hermitian systems and the corresponding domain walls</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study conformal field theories (CFTs) and their classifications from a modern perspective based on the abstract algebraic formalism of symmetries or conserved charges, known as symmetry topological field theories (SymTFTs). By studying the algebraic structure of the SymTFTs in detail, we found a natural generalization of the quantum dimensions associated with (pseudo-)Hermitian systems and (non)-unitary CFTs. These generalized data of SymTFTs provide classifications of massless and massive renormalization group flows, which will describe the quantum phase transitions of the corresponding pseudo-Hermitian systems. Moreover, our discussions straightforwardly enable one to relate a general class of coset constructions or level-rank dualities to domain wall problems between topological quantum field theories (or a series of corresponding quantum phase transitions related to the Higgs mechanism). Our work provides a systematic reduction and classification of algebraic data, symmetries, for pseudo-Hermitian systems based on ideas from established mathematical fields, linear algebra and ring theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills at finite temperature with chemical potentials that couple either to the $R$-charges or the spins of the operators. We find expressions for the Hagedorn temperatures at both zero coupling by explicitly counting states, and at strong coupling using the string theory dual. We then apply the quantum spectral curve (QSC) to this problem, which adds additional twists to the $Q$-functions. For a single chemical potential $\mu$ coupled to one of the $R$-charges, we find the analytic weak-coupling Hagedorn temperature to one-loop order for any value of $\mu$, and to two-loop order for $\mu=1/2$. We then solve the QSC numerically, showing that at strong coupling there is good agreement with the string theory prediction to order $1/\lambda^{1/4}$. This provides further evidence for a recent conjecture of Harmark for the form of the world-sheet zero-point shift. We also use the QSC to find the analytic one-loop correction to the Hagedorn temperature with non-zero chemical potentials coupled to the spins.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of a time-crystalline phase in a single-band holographic superconductor, extending the AdS/CFT framework. By incorporating a nonlinear gauge-scalar coupling and external driving, we derive coupled equations of motion for the plasma and Higgs modes, analogous to those in high-Tc superconductors. Multi-scale analysis reveals a sum resonance with subharmonic growth indicating broken time-translation symmetry. We perform numerical computation of quasinormal mode and demonstrate the transition to the time-crystalline phase. The holographic model may serve as a robust tool for studying strongly coupled time crystals.</description>

      <title>Continuum canonical purifications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct and characterize canonical purifications for general algebraic states, extending prior constructions by Woronowicz and by Dutta/Faulkner to general quantum theories. Given a state on a $*$-algebra, the canonical purification is a state on a "doubled" algebra that admits an interpretation in terms of CRT reflection. This interpretation holds for all quantum theories, even in the absence of gravity. We then identify conditions under which canonical purifications are "pure" in the technical sense, compute their modular conjugations, and relate them to GNS and natural-cone purifications in certain settings. In an appendix, we develop a general theory of von Neumann algebras generated by unbounded $*$-algebras. In a forthcoming paper with Caminiti and Capeccia, we provide an application of this general theory to the problem of excitability in quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Sine-Liouville gravity as a Vertex Model on Planar Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the universal behaviour of a one-parameter generalisation of the six-vertex model on planar graphs, which we refer to as the 7-vertex model (7vM). The 7vM is characterised by a temperature coupling and its continuum limit is characterised by a massive, dilute and dense phases similarly to the $O(n)$ loop model. We compute the sphere and disk partition functions of the 7vM from the spectral curve of the dual matrix model, abbreviated here as 7vMM. The disk partition function for fixed length is expressed in terms of an uncharted deformation of the K-Bessel functions. We argue that 7vMM and Matrix Quantum Mechanics (MQM) provide two complementary non-perturbative realisations of sine-Liouville gravity. Specifically, we find that the continuum limit of 7vMM and the MQM share the same classical spectral curve but describe two different types of branes in sine-Liouville gravity. The 7vMM precisely covers the range of parameters where the Minkowskian MQM lacks a simple interpretation in terms of multiple tachyon scattering. We investigate the flow relating the dilute and the dense phases and argue that this flow is the gravitational analogue of the massless flow in the sine-Gordon model with imaginary mass coupling. The two extremities of the flow are described by a free boson coupled to Liouville gravity and compactified at circles with two different radii.</description>

      <title>Timelike transitions in an atom by a mirror in light cone and Kruskal-Szekeres regions: a status of quantum equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12378v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the timelike transitions in a two-level atom in the presence of an infinite reflecting mirror in the future-past light cone regions of a Minkowski spacetime, as well as in the region interior of a $(1+1)$ dimensional Schwarzschild black hole. In particular, when considering the light cone regions, two specific scenarios are dealt with -- $(i)$ a mirror is static in Minkowski spacetime while the atom is attached to a frame confined inside the future light cone region, $(ii)$ an atom is static in Minkowski spacetime, and the mirror is confined inside the future light cone region. For both situations, the atom is interacting with field modes defined in the mirror's frame. Analogous configurations are considered in the black hole spacetime: in one case, the mirror carries field modes represented by the Kruskal time, while the atom follows the Schwarzschild time defined inside the black hole; in the other case, the situations are reversed. The analyses, depending on the frame of the atom, are respectively done within the light cone, Minkowski, Schwarzschild, and Kruskal time-interaction pictures. In all of these scenarios, we observe that the excitation probabilities contain a thermal factor and depend periodically on the separation between the atom and the mirror. At the level of transition probabilities, the aforesaid two scenarios in $(1+1)$ dimensional Minkowski-light cone regions appear to be the same for the equal field and atomic frequencies. However, the same is not true when we consider the $(3+1)$ dimensional Minkowski-light cone or the Schwarzschild interior regions. We also estimate the de-excitation probabilities and encounter similar situations. However, we observe that the excitation to de-excitation ratios (EDRs) corresponding to analogous scenarios are equal for equal atomic and field frequencies.</description>

      <title>A note on gravity and fluid dynamic correspondence on a null hypersurface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the extensive literature on fluid-gravity correspondence formulated on null hypersurfaces, the Carrollian and membrane paradigm approaches have predominantly employed a timelike foliation. By contrast, within the null foliation formalism, only the momentum conservation law, expressed through the Damour-Navier-Stokes (DNS) equation, has been established. In this work, we revisit the null foliation formalism for a generic null hypersurface and extend it to include the energy conservation law, continuity equation, and related relations, all derived from the covariant conservation of an appropriately defined energy-momentum tensor. This development complements the existing literature on the fluid description of gravitational dynamics in the null foliation framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model is a paradigm for extreme quantum chaos, non-Fermi-liquid behavior, and holographic matter. Yet, the dense random all-to-all interactions that characterize it are an extreme challenge for realistic laboratory realizations. Here, we propose a general scheme for densifying the coupling distribution of random disorder Hamiltonians, using a Trotterized cycling through sparse time-dependent disorder realizations. To diagnose the convergence of sparse to dense models, we introduce an information-theory inspired diagnostic. We illustrate how the scheme can come to bear in the realization of the complex SYK$_4$ model in cQED platforms with available experimental resources, using a single cavity mode together with a fast cycling through independent speckle patterns. The simulation scheme applies to the SYK class of models as well as spin glasses, spin liquids, and related disorder models, bringing them into reach of quantum simulation using single-mode cavity-QED setups and other platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19893v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Light scalars that couple to leptons are common figures in beyond the Standard Model endeavors. Considering a scalar that has universal and couplings to leptons only, we compute this leptophilic scalar contribution to the $e^{-}e^{+} \rightarrow \tau^{+}\tau^{-} S $ production cross section with $S \rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}(\mu^{+}\mu^{-})$. We later compare the expected signal with recent data from the BELLE collaboration collected near the resonance $\Upsilon(4S)$ with $\mathcal{L}=626 fb^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity to place limits on the couplings-mass plane for the $4$~MeV-$6.5$~GeV mass range. We then extended this analysis to a more general one $e^{-}e^{+} \rightarrow {\ell}^{+}{\ell}^{-} S$ production cross section where $\ell=e,\mu,\tau$ with $S \rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}(\mu^{+}\mu^{-})$, showing that BELLE constitutes an excellent laboratory for light scalars, where can be derived constraints stronger than those derived stemming from the g-2 of the electron or muon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17574v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the relationship between a one-parameter family of (anti-)de Sitter Yang-Mills models and a model of Einstein-Palatini gravity with matter, realized through In\"o\"nu-Wigner contraction of the (A)dS algebra. By setting the group parameter $\alpha$ to zero, the gauge transformation of the potential becomes consistent with the transformation properties of the tetrad form and spin connection. We show that a sector of the Yang-Mills dynamics exists in which the equations decouple. Moreover, a subset of the gauge transformations can be related to diffeomorphisms, leading to the identification of the tetrad field. Finally, the resulting dynamics is consistent with a gravitational dynamics in the first-order formalism.</description>

      <title>Effective field theory reproducing the MOND phenomenology based on a non-Abelian Yang-Mills graviphoton</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the phenomenology of MOND, we propose a theory based on a fundamental non Abelian Yang-Mills gauge field with gravitational coupling constant (a "graviphoton") emerging in a regime of weak acceleration, i.e. below the MOND acceleration scale. Using the formalism of the effective field theory and invoking a mechanism of gravitational polarization of the dark matter medium, we show that generic solutions of this theory reproduce the deep MOND limit without having to introduce in an ad hoc way an arbitrary function in the action. In this framework, MOND is due to the existence of a new sector of the standard model of particle physics. Furthermore, the model involves a violation of the local Lorentz invariance in the low acceleration regime. We show how to restore the general covariance of the model by adding one gravitational degree of freedom in the form of the scalar Khronon field.</description>

      <title>Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves from self-resonant preheating in $\alpha$-attractor models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: After the inflationary phase, the universe enters the preheating phase, during which the inflaton field rolls down its potential and oscillates. When the potential significantly deviates from a parabolic shape at its minimum, these oscillations trigger an instability in the scalar perturbations, leading to their amplification. This phenomenon, known as self-resonance, has important implications in cosmology. Notably, since scalar perturbations couple to tensor perturbations at second order in the equations of motion, this amplification results in the production of Gravitational Waves (GWs), referred to as Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves (SIGWs). In this study, we investigate the production of SIGWs during the preheating phase for a class of inflationary models known as $\alpha$-attractors, characterized by a single parameter $\alpha$. We focus on small values of this parameter, specifically $\alpha \sim O(10^{-1} - 10^{-4})$, where the self-resonance effect is particularly pronounced. We obtain lower bounds on this parameter, $\log_{10}(\alpha)&gt;-3.54$ for the T-model and $\log_{10}(\alpha)&gt;-3.17$ for the E-model, based on the energy density of SIGWs constrained by Big Bang nucleosynthesis, which ultimately translates into lower bounds on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r&gt;9.61\times10^{-7}$ for the T-model and $r&gt;2.25\times10^{-6}$ for the E-model. Note that these bounds on $\alpha$ and $r$ are derived within the linear framework of tensor fluctuations at the level of equations of motion, which nevertheless include scalar-scalar-tensor interactions with metric and matter fields. However, fully non-linear approaches, with all higher-order metric fluctuations, would be needed in the future to further validate these conclusions.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the recently published analytic results for unpolarized and polarized semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS) at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in QCD. These expressions for the hard scattering coefficients contain case distinctions in the kinematic $(x,z)$ plane splitting the analytic result in four regions. By re-expressing the coefficient functions in terms of single-valued polylogarithms we remove these case distinctions and can present a unified result valid in the entire kinematic range of SIDIS. This reduces the length of the overall expressions by 30% to 60%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10563v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Kerr-Schild perturbations of a ghost-free, generic non-local gravity theory constructed from an infinite series of higher derivative terms in $D$ dimensions. The infinite series of higher derivative terms are encoded by form factors, the forms of which can be restricted by requiring that the action remains perturbatively free of ghosts and tachyons around maximally symmetric backgrounds for transverse traceless fluctuations. To demonstrate this, we obtain field equations for AdS plane wave metric in Kerr-Schild form, which yield linearized field equations for transverse-traceless spin-$2$ field. Using unitarity and consistency requirements, we obtain, as an example, the explicit derivation of non-local form factors in $D$ dimensions.</description>

      <title>Decay and lifetime of oscillons coupled to an external scalar field: Insights from instability band analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Oscillons are long-lived, spherically symmetric solitons that can arise in real scalar field theories with potentials shallower than quadratic ones. They are considered to form via parametric resonance during the preheating stage after inflation and have extended lifetimes. However, the estimation of their lifespan becomes complicated when taking into account the interactions between the inflaton field and other fields, as naturally expected in realistic reheating scenarios. In this study, we investigate how the lifetime of a single oscillon is affected by the coupling to the external real scalar field. By numerically computing the instability bands of the external field with the inhomogeneous oscillon profile as background, we show that the resonance behavior depends intricately on the coupling strength and shape of the oscillon. We analyze distinct instability mechanisms that dominate across different regimes of the coupling strength and oscillon shapes. Especially, we show that the parametric resonance fails to occur when the oscillon size is too limited to drive enhancement of the external field. Furthermore, our simulations show that as the oscillon loses energy, the exponential growth of the external field can terminate before the oscillon reaches its critical energy for collapse, which indicates that the external field does not necessarily lead to rapid destruction of oscillons even in the presence of strong coupling or with large amplitudes. These results suggest that oscillons can remain long-lived across a wide range of coupling strengths, with potential implications for their role in cosmological evolution.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we analyze the energy density and the stress distribution inside the pion derived from gravitational form factors in top-down holographic QCD. In particular, we show that the dominance of the scale anomaly in the confining pressure, previously observed in the instant form for the nucleon, also holds for the pion in the light-front form. Furthermore, we find that in large-$N_c$ QCD described by this approach, the scalar glueball plays a mediating role in transmitting the confining pressure. These findings support the universal role of the scale anomaly in the stability of hadrons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23786v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effect of the QCD scale anomaly on the internal pressure distribution of hadrons is studied based on the trace-traceless decomposition of the energy-momentum tensor. Using recent model-independent results of gravitational form factors as input, the pressure distributions of both pions and nucleons are analyzed in the instant form and the light-front form. It is found that, in all cases, the scale anomaly dominantly generates the negative binding pressure. This result suggests that the phenomenon is a universal feature, independent of models, types of hadrons, and the choice of form.</description>

      <title>Transport-model investigation of scaling of the number of constituent quarks and the hadronic-partonic transition in Au + Au collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21577v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the elliptic flow ($v_2$) in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\text{NN}}} = 3.0$ and 4.5 GeV using both hadronic and partonic transport models, including JAM, SMASH, AMPT-Hadronic Cascade, and AMPT-String Melting. At 3.0 GeV, the JAM model reproduces the number-of-constituent-quark (NCQ) scaling violation observed by STAR, as well as the particle ordering ($K^0_S &gt; p &gt; \pi^+$). Model calculations of the centrality dependence indicate that the scaling violation mainly originates from hadronic interactions rather than spectator effects, while the rapidity dependence further constrains the mechanism of the scaling breaking and the underlying longitudinal dynamics. At 4.5 GeV, partonic interactions in the AMPT-String Melting mode significantly enhance NCQ scaling, and turning off final-state hadronic rescattering further clarifies the scaling pattern, highlighting the increasing role of partonic degrees of freedom. The energy dependence of the $p_T$-integrated $v_2$ is also examined within these models.</description>

      <title>Strong CP problem, theta term and QCD topological properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this chapter we introduce the $\theta$-dependence and the topological properties of QCD, features of the strongly interacting sector which give rise to the strong CP problem in the more general context of the Standard Model of particle physics. We discuss the analytical approaches that can be used to obtain qualitative, or in some cases quantitative, information on the $\theta$-dependence of QCD and QCD-like models, discussing their range of validity and comparing their predictions with the numerical results obtained by means of lattice simulations.</description>

      <title>Novel thermodynamic inequality for rotating AdS black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new thermodynamic inequality for stationary and asymptotically Anti-de Sitter charged and rotating black holes, $ 4\pi J^2/(3MV)&lt;1 $. This inequality is derived through an analysis of the roots of the identity which holds among the thermodynamic variables to avoid a naked singularity. We have analyzed the Kerr-AdS black hole and the asymptotically AdS uncharged and rotating black strings and find strong supporting evidence for different horizon topologies. Using this inequality we verify the validity of reverse isoperimetric inequality in its conventional form ($ {\cal R}\geq 1 $) in the presence of rotation. By examining a wide range of black hole solutions, we confirm the validity of the proposed inequality. Assuming that reverse isoperimetric inequality continues to hold in higher dimensions, and employing the intermediate refined reverse isoperimetric inequalities introduced in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 241401] as guiding principles, we extend the inequality to higher-dimensional spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Two-point correlators in de Sitter-prepared states with bra-ket wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the finiteness of de Sitter (dS) horizon entropy, we study how "bra-ket wormholes" modify correlation functions in gravitationally prepared states. Euclidean wormhole saddles in gravitational path integrals can generate non-factorizing contributions to correlation functions, as in replica-wormhole explanation of the Page curve and bra-ket-wormhole restoration of strong subadditivity. By defining 'time' variables and computing observables in a flat region attached to the dS boundary, we evaluate bra-ket wormhole contributions to scalar two-point functions and find late-time transitions in the dominant saddle, accompanied by the ramp-and-plateau behavior of correlations and the characteristic timescale comparable to the fast scrambling. Each observable is consistent with `complementarity', in the sense that wormhole effects are distinguishable only at late respective times. Consistencies are based upon the interplay of (i) inflationary horizon exit and re-entry, (ii) enhancement of correlations at small comoving momentum by wormhole contributions, (iii) a competition between mode counting and topological suppression that drives a transition to wormhole dominance, which naturally yields the fast scrambling timescale, and (iv) irreducible errors by cosmic variance in early CMB-like observations. To clearly interpret in terms of entropy and chaotic nature of dS, one needs a more complete mechanism of wormhole stabilization.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Lorentz-Dirac Dynamics and Post-Newtonian Interaction of Radiating Point Charges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine classical radiation reaction by combining the covariant Lorentz--Dirac formulation, its Landau--Lifshitz (LL) order reduction, and a post-Newtonian (PN) Hamiltonian treatment of interacting and radiating charges. After reviewing the LL reduction and its removal of runaway and preacceleration behavior, we verify energy balance in several relativistic single-particle scenarios by demonstrating agreement between the LL Larmor power and the loss of mechanical energy. We then construct an N-body framework based on the conservative Darwin Hamiltonian supplemented with the leading 1.5PN radiation--reaction term. Numerical simulations of charge-neutral binary systems of both symmetric and asymmetric mass configurations show orbital decay, circularization, and monotonic Hamiltonian decrease consistent with dipole radiative losses. The resulting framework provides a simple analogue of gravitational PN radiation reaction and a tractable system for studying dissipative and potentially chaotic electromagnetic dynamics.</description>
