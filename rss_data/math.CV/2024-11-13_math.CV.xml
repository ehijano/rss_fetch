      <title>Analytical Error Estimation of Conformal Mappings Using Complex Bessel Functions under Perturbed Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the theoretical construction and analytic error estimation of complex Bessel function-based conformal mappings in regions with randomly perturbed boundaries. First, we construct a conformal mapping applicable to such boundary conditions and prove the existence and uniqueness of the mapping. On this basis, an analytical error estimation method is proposed to quantify the effect of the magnitude of the boundary perturbation on the accuracy of the mapping. By deriving the error formula, we show the stability of the complex Bessel function under perturbed boundary conditions and prove the asymptotic convergence of the mapping error under small perturbation conditions. This study provides new theoretical support for conformal mapping under complex boundary conditions and reveals the potential of complex Bessel functions in dealing with stochastic boundary problems.</description>

      <title>An introduction to univalent function theory and the Bieberbach conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to make an introduction to univalent function theory for readers of any level, assuming only foundational knowledge in real and complex analysis. In particular, we state and proof (with details) important theorems utilised in proving Bieberbach's conjecture, especially those that were missed or merely sketched by other texts on univalent functions. We will finally prove the conjecture following the proof given by Lenard Weinstein in a comprehensive and self-contained manners, exposing its full technical details in each step. Readers are encouraged to make used of this paper to accompany the preliminary chapters of Duren's Univalent Functions and Lenard Weinstein's the Bieberbach Conjecture.</description>

      <title>The Hilbert matrix done right</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give very simple proofs of the classical results of Magnus and Hill on the spectral properties of the Hilbert matrix $$ H = \left ( {1 \over i+j+ 1 } \right )_{i,j\geq 0} $$ which defines a bounded linear operator on the sequence space $\ell^2$. In particular, we use the Mehler-Fock transform to find the spectrum and the latent eigenfunctions of the Hilbert matrix, that is, we show that the spectrum of $H$ is $[0,\pi]$ with no eigenvalues (Magnus' result) and describe all complex sequences $x$ such that $Hx=\mu x$ for some complex number $\mu$ (Hill's result).</description>

      <title>The Schwartz index and the residue of singularities of logarithmic foliations along a hypersurface with isolated singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a complex compact manifold $X$, we prove a Baum-Bott type formula for one-dimensional foliations on $X$, logarithmic along a hypersurface with isolated singularities. In this case, we show that the residues of the singularities of foliations can be given in terms of the Schwartz index. Furthermore, in this context, we proved that the Schwartz index is positive when $dim(X)$ is even, and that the GSV index is positive when $dim(X)$ is odd. We also obtained some applications in the context of the Poincar\'e's problem.</description>

      <title>Weight sensitivity in K-stability of Fano varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that, for a spherical Fano threefold not in the Mori-Mukai family 2-29, and a weight function associated with the action of the connected center of a Levi subgroup of its automorphism group, weighted K-polystability is equivalent to vanishing of the weighted Futaki invariant. This is surprising since unlike the case of toric Fano manifold, there exist non-product, special, equivariant test configurations. For the K\"ahler-Einstein Fano threefold 2-29, and for well-chosen torus action on the three dimensional quadric, we show that this property is false and exhibit explicit examples of weighted optimal degenerations. We then generalize this to higher-dimensional quadrics and blowups of quadrics along a codimension 2 subquadric.</description>

      <title>Wirtinger operators for functions of several quaternionic variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.10868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Wirtinger operators for functions of several quaternionic variables. These operators are real linear partial differential operators which behave well on quaternionic polynomials, with properties analogous to the ones satisfied by the Wirtinger derivatives of several complex variables. Due to the non-commutativity of the variables, Wirtinger operators turn out to be of higher order, except the first ones that are of the first order. In spite of that, these operators commute each other and satisfy a Leibniz rule for products. Moreover, they characterize the class of slice-regular polynomials, and more generally of slice-regular quaternionic functions. As a step towards the definition of the Wirtinger operators, we provide Almansi-type decompositions for slice functions and for slice-regular functions of several variables. We also introduce some aspects of local slice analysis, based on the definition of locally slice-regular function in any open subset of the $n$-dimensional quaternionic space.</description>

      <title>Sendov conjecture, Borcea variance conjectures and Schoenberg inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $F(z)=\prod\limits_{k=1}^n(z-z_k)$ be a monic complex polynomial of degree $n$. In 1998, Pawlowski [Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 350 (1998)] studied the radius $\gamma_n$ of the smallest concentric disk with center at $\tfrac{\sum\limits_{k=1}^nz_k}{n}$ contained at least one critical point of $F(z)$. He showed that $\gamma_n\le \tfrac{2n^\frac{1}{n-1}}{n^\frac{2}{n-1}+1}$. In this paper, we refine Pawlowski's result in the spirit of Borcea variance conjectures and classic Schoenberg inequality, specifically, we show that $\gamma_n\le\sqrt{\tfrac{n-2}{n-1}}$ in a very concise manner. Moreover, we obtain various generalizations of Schoenberg inequalities based on classic Schoenberg inequality including refining Lin-Xie-Zhang's result [J. Math. Anal. Appl. 502 (2021)], which is inspired by the author's recent work on Clarkson-McCarthy inequalities [arXiv:2410.21961] . Finally, we make $D$-companion matrix introduced by Cheung-Ng [Linear Algebra Appl. 432 (2010)] and operator inequalities involved Schatten $p$-norm react so that we provide an additional relationship between the zeros of $F(z)$ and its critical points in the case where all $z_k\ge 0$, which can be regarded as complements of Schmeisser's result [Comput. Methods Funct. Theory 3 (2003)]. By an operator 2-norm identity, we also prove Sendov conjecture with a condition that depends only on $\left( \tfrac{1}{n-1}\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n-1}\left|z_k-z_n\right|^2\right)^\frac{1}{2}$.</description>

      <title>Positivity of the Cotangent Bundle of Complex Hyperbolic Manifolds with Cusps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.10816v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\overline{X}$ be the toroidal compactification of a cusped complex hyperbolic manifold $X=\mathbb{B}^n/\Gamma$ with the boundary divisor $D=\overline{X}\setminus X$. The main goal of this paper is to find the positivity properties of $\Omega^{1}_{\overline{X}}$ and $\Omega^{1}_{\overline{X}}\big(\log(D)\big)$ depending intrinsically on $X$. We prove that $\Omega^{1}_{\overline{X}}\big(\log(D)\big) \langle -r D \rangle$ is ample for all sufficiently small rational numbers $r &gt;0$, and $\Omega^{1}_{\overline{X}}\big(\log(D)\big)$ is ample modulo $D.$ Further, we conclude that if the cusps of $X$ have uniform depth greater than $4\pi$, then $\Omega^{1}_{\overline{X}}$ is semi-ample and is ample modulo $D$, all subvarieties of $X$ are of general type, and every smooth subvariety $V\subset \overline{X}$ intersecting $\overline{X}$ has ample $K_{V}$. Finally, we show that the minimum volume of subvarieties of $\overline{X}$ intersecting both $X$ and $D$ tends to infinity in towers of normal covering of $X.$</description>

      <title>Spiders' webs in the Eremenko-Lyubich class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider the entire function $f(z)=\cosh(z)$. We show that the escaping set of this function - that is, the set of points whose orbits tend to infinity under iteration - has a structure known as a "spider's web". This disproves a conjecture of Sixsmith from 2020. In fact, we show that the "fast escaping set", i.e. the set of points whose orbits tend to infinity at an iterated exponential rate, is a spider's web. This answers a question of Rippon and Stallard from 2012. We also discuss a wider class of functions to which our results apply, and state some open questions.</description>
