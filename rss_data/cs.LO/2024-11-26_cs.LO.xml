      <title>Advances in Algorithmic Meta Theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tractability results for the model checking problem of logics yield powerful algorithmic meta theorems of the form: Every computational problem expressible in a logic $L$ can be solved efficiently on every class $\mathscr{C}$ of structures satisfying certain conditions. The most prominent logics studied in the field are (counting) monadic second-order logic (C)MSO, and first-order logic FO and its extensions. The complexity of CMSO model checking in general and of FO model checking on monotone graph classes is very well understood. In recent years there has been a rapid and exciting development of new algorithmic meta theorems. On the one hand there has been major progress for FO model checking on hereditary graph classes. This progress was driven by the development of a combinatorial structure theory for the logically defined monadically stable and monadically dependent graph classes, as well as by the advent of the new width measure twinwidth. On the other hand, new algorithmic meta theorems for new logics with expressive power between FO and CMSO offer a new unifying view on methods like the irrelevant vertex technique and recursive understanding. In this paper we overview the recent advances in algorithmic meta theorems and provide rough sketches for the methods to prove them.</description>

      <title>Words-to-Letters Valuations for Language Kleene Algebras with Variable and Constant Complements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the equational theory for Kleene algebra terms with variable complements and constant complements -- (language) complement where it applies only to variables or constants -- w.r.t. languages. While the equational theory w.r.t. languages coincides with the language equivalence (under the standard language valuation) for Kleene algebra terms, this coincidence is broken if we extend the terms with complements. In this paper, we prove the decidability of some fragments of the equational theory: the universality problem is coNP-complete, and the inequational theory $t \le s$ is coNP-complete when $t$ does not contain Kleene-star. To this end, we introduce words-to-letters valuations; they are sufficient valuations for the equational theory and ease us in investigating the equational theory w.r.t. languages. Additionally, we show a completeness theorem of the equational theory for words with variable complements and the non-empty constant.</description>

      <title>J-P: MDP. FP. PP.: Characterizing Total Expected Rewards in Markov Decision Processes as Least Fixed Points with an Application to Operational Semantics of Probabilistic Programs (Technical Report)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Markov decision processes (MDPs) with rewards are a widespread and well-studied model for systems that make both probabilistic and nondeterministic choices. A fundamental result about MDPs is that their minimal and maximal expected rewards satisfy Bellmann's optimality equations. For various classes of MDPs - notably finite-state MDPs, positive bounded models, and negative models - expected rewards are known to be the least solution of those equations. However, these classes of MDPs are too restrictive for probabilistic program verification. In particular, they assume that all rewards are finite. This is already not the case for the expected runtime of a simple probabilisitic program modeling a 1-dimensional random walk.
  In this paper, we develop a generalized least fixed point characterization of expected rewards in MDPs without those restrictions. Furthermore, we demonstrate how said characterization can be leveraged to prove weakest-preexpectation-style calculi sound with respect to an operational MDP model.</description>

      <title>Guiding Word Equation Solving using Graph Neural Networks (Extended Technical Report)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a Graph Neural Network-guided algorithm for solving word equations, based on the well-known Nielsen transformation for splitting equations. The algorithm iteratively rewrites the first terms of each side of an equation, giving rise to a tree-like search space. The choice of path at each split point of the tree significantly impacts solving time, motivating the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for efficient split decision-making. Split decisions are encoded as multi-classification tasks, and five graph representations of word equations are introduced to encode their structural information for GNNs. The algorithm is implemented as a solver named DragonLi. Experiments are conducted on artificial and real-world benchmarks. The algorithm performs particularly well on satisfiable problems. For single word \mbox{equations}, DragonLi can solve significantly more problems than well-established string solvers. For the conjunction of multiple word equations, DragonLi is competitive with state-of-the-art string solvers.</description>

      <title>Metamathematics of Resolution Lower Bounds: A TFNP Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the *refuter* problems, a family of decision-tree $\mathsf{TFNP}$ problems capturing the metamathematical difficulty of proving proof complexity lower bounds. Suppose $\varphi$ is a hard tautology that does not admit any length-$s$ proof in some proof system $P$. In the corresponding refuter problem, we are given (query access to) a purported length-$s$ proof $\pi$ in $P$ that claims to have proved $\varphi$, and our goal is to find an invalid derivation inside $\pi$. As suggested by witnessing theorems in bounded arithmetic, the *computational complexity* of these refuter problems is closely tied to the *metamathematics* of the underlying proof complexity lower bounds.
  We focus on refuter problems corresponding to lower bounds for *resolution*, which is arguably the single most studied system in proof complexity. We introduce a new class $\mathrm{rwPHP}(\mathsf{PLS})$ in decision-tree $\mathsf{TFNP}$, which can be seen as a randomized version of $\mathsf{PLS}$, and argue that this class effectively captures the metamathematics of proving resolution lower bounds.
  We view these results as a contribution to the *bounded reverse mathematics* of complexity lower bounds: when interpreted in relativized bounded arithmetic, our results show that the theory $\mathsf{T}^1_2(\alpha) + \mathrm{dwPHP}(\mathsf{PV}(\alpha))$ characterizes the "reasoning power" required to prove (the "easiest") resolution lower bounds. An intriguing corollary of our results is that the combinatorial principle, "the pigeonhole principle requires exponential-size resolution proofs", captures the class of $\mathsf{TFNP}$ problems whose totality is provable in $\mathsf{T}^1_2 + \mathrm{dwPHP}(\mathsf{PV})$.</description>

      <title>Portus: Linking Alloy with SMT-based Finite Model Finding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alloy is a well-known, formal, declarative language for modelling systems early in the software development process. Currently, it uses the Kodkod library as a back-end for finite model finding. Kodkod translates the model to a SAT problem; however, this method can often handle only problems of fairly low-size sets and is inherently finite. We present Portus, a method for translating Alloy into an equivalent many-sorted first-order logic problem (MSFOL). Once in MSFOL, the problem can be evaluated by an SMT-based finite model finding method implemented in the Fortress library, creating an alternative back-end for the Alloy Analyzer. Fortress converts the MSFOL finite model finding problem into the logic of uninterpreted functions with equality (EUF), a decidable fragment of first-order logic that is well-supported in many SMT solvers. We compare the performance of Portus with Kodkod on a corpus of 49 expert Alloy models. Our method is fully integrated into the Alloy Analyzer.</description>

      <title>Extracting Linear Relations from Gr\"obner Bases for Formal Verification of And-Inverter Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Formal verification techniques based on computer algebra have proven highly effective for circuit verification. The circuit, given as an and-inverter graph, is encoded as a set of polynomials that automatically generates a Gr\"obner basis with respect to a lexicographic term ordering. Correctness of the circuit can be derived by computing the polynomial remainder of the specification. However, the main obstacle is the monomial blow-up during the rewriting of the specification, which leads to the development of dedicated heuristics to overcome this issue. In this paper, we investigate an orthogonal approach and focus the computational effort on rewriting the Gr\"obner basis itself. Our goal is to ensure the basis contains linear polynomials that can be effectively used to rewrite the linearized specification. We first prove the soundness and completeness of this technique and then demonstrate its practical application. Our implementation of this method shows promising results on benchmarks related to multiplier verification.</description>

      <title>An order out of nowhere: a new algorithm for infinite-domain CSPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.12977v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of satisfiability of sets of constraints in a given set of finite uniform hypergraphs. While the problem under consideration is similar in nature to the problem of satisfiability of constraints in graphs, the classical complexity reduction to finite-domain CSPs that was used in the proof of the complexity dichotomy for such problems cannot be used as a black box in our case. We therefore introduce an algorithmic technique inspired by classical notions from the theory of finite-domain CSPs, and prove its correctness based on symmetries that depend on a linear order that is external to the structures under consideration. Our second main result is a P/NP-complete complexity dichotomy for such problems over many sets of uniform hypergraphs. The proof is based on the translation of the problem into the framework of constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) over infinite uniform hypergraphs. Our result confirms in particular the Bodirsky-Pinsker conjecture for CSPs of first-order reducts of some homogeneous hypergraphs. This forms a vast generalization of previous work by Bodirsky-Pinsker (STOC'11) and Bodirsky-Martin-Pinsker-Pongr\'acz (ICALP'16) on graph satisfiability.</description>

      <title>A Mixed Linear and Graded Logic: Proofs, Terms, and Models (with appendices)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graded modal logics generalise standard modal logics via families of modalities indexed by an algebraic structure whose operations mediate between the different modalities. The graded "of-course" modality $!_r$ captures how many times a proposition is used and has an analogous interpretation to the of-course modality from linear logic; the of-course modality from linear logic can be modelled by a linear exponential comonad and graded of-course can be modelled by a graded linear exponential comonad. Benton showed in his seminal paper on Linear/Non-Linear logic that the of-course modality can be split into two modalities connecting intuitionistic logic with linear logic, forming a symmetric monoidal adjunction. Later, Fujii et al. demonstrated that every graded comonad can be decomposed into an adjunction and a `strict action'. We give a similar result to Benton, leveraging Fujii et al.'s decomposition, showing that graded modalities can be split into two modalities connecting a graded logic with a graded linear logic. We propose a sequent calculus, its proof theory and categorical model, and a natural deduction system which we show is isomorphic to the sequent calculus system. Interestingly, our system can also be understood as Linear/Non-Linear logic composed with an action that adds the grading, further illuminating the shared principles between linear logic and a class of graded modal logics.</description>

      <title>Interaction Equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18709v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contextual equivalence is the de facto standard notion of program equivalence. A key theorem is that contextual equivalence is an equational theory. Making contextual equivalence more intensional, for example taking into account the time cost of the computation, seems a natural refinement. Such a change, however, does not induce an equational theory, for an apparently essential reason: cost is not invariant under reduction.
  In the paradigmatic case of the untyped $\lambda$-calculus, we introduce interaction equivalence. Inspired by game semantics, we observe the number of interaction steps between terms and contexts but -- crucially -- ignore their own internal steps. We prove that interaction equivalence is an equational theory and we characterize it as $B$, the well-known theory induced by B\"ohm tree equality. Ours is the first observational characterization of $B$ obtained without enriching the discriminating power of contexts with extra features such as non-determinism. To prove our results, we develop interaction-based refinements of the B\"ohm-out technique and of intersection types.</description>

Abstract: The categorical modeling of Petri nets has received much attention recently. The Dialectica construction has also had its fair share of attention. We revisit the use of the Dialectica construction as a categorical model for Petri nets generalising the original application to suggest that Petri nets with different kinds of transitions can be modelled in the same categorical framework. Transitions representing truth-values, probabilities, rates or multiplicities, evaluated in different algebraic structures called lineales are useful and are modelled here in the same category. We investigate (categorical instances of) this generalised model and its connections to more recent models of categorical nets.</description>

      <title>On guarded extensions of MMSNP</title>

Abstract: Feder and Vardi showed that the class Monotone Monadic SNP without inequality (MMSNP) has a P vs NP-complete dichotomy if and only if such a dichotomy holds for finite-domain Constraint Satisfaction Problems. Moreover, they showed that none of the three classes obtained by removing one of the defining properties of MMSNP (monotonicity, monadicity, no inequality) has a dichotomy. The overall objective of this paper is to study the gaps between MMSNP and each of these three superclasses, where the existence of a dichotomy remains unknown. For the gap between MMSNP and Monotone SNP without inequality, we study the class Guarded Monotone SNP without inequality (GMSNP) introduced by Bienvenu, ten Cate, Lutz, and Wolter, and prove that GMSNP has a dichotomy if and only if a dichotomy holds for GMSNP problems over signatures consisting of a unique relation symbol. For the gap between MMSNP and MMSNP with inequality, we have two contributions. We introduce a new class MMSNP with guarded inequality, that lies between MMSNP and MMSNP with inequality and that is strictly more expressive than the former and still has a dichotomy. Apart from that, we give a detailed proof that every problem in NP is polynomial-time equivalent to a problem in MMSNP with inequality, which implies the absence of a dichotomy for the latter. For the gap between MMSNP and Monadic SNP without inequality, we introduce a logic that extends the class of Matrix Partitions in a similar way how MMSNP extends CSP, and pose an open question about the existence of a dichotomy for this class.</description>

      <title>The Algebras for Automatic Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15496v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce "synchronous algebras", an algebraic structure tailored to recognize automatic relations (aka. synchronous relations, or regular relations). They are the equivalent of monoids for regular languages, however they conceptually differ in two points: first, they are typed and second, they are equipped with a dependency relation expressing constraints between elements of different types.
  The interest of the proposed definition is that it allows to lift, in an effective way, pseudovarieties of regular languages to that of synchronous relations, and we show how algebraic characterizations of pseudovarieties of regular languages can be lifted to the pseudovarieties of synchronous relations that they induce. A typical example of such a pseudovariety is the class of "group relations", defined as the relations recognized by finite-state synchronous permutation automata.
  In order to prove this result, we adapt two pillars of algebraic language to synchronous algebras: (a) any relation admits a syntactic synchronous algebra recognizing it, and moreover, the relation is synchronous if, and only if, its syntactic algebra is finite and (b) classes of synchronous relations with desirable closure properties (i.e. pseudovarieties) correspond to pseudovarieties of synchronous algebras.</description>

      <title>Complete and Terminating Tableau Calculus for Undirected Graph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09162v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hybrid logic is a modal logic with additional operators specifying nominals and is highly expressive. For example, there is no formula corresponding to the irreflexivity of Kripke frames in basic modal logic, but there is in hybrid logic. Irreflexivity is significant in that irreflexive and symmetric Kripke frames can be regarded as undirected graphs reviewed from a graph theoretic point of view. Thus, the study of the hybrid logic with axioms corresponding to irreflexivity and symmetry can help to elucidate the logical properties of undirected graphs. In this paper, we formulate the tableau method of the hybrid logic for undirected graphs. Our main result is to show the completeness theorem and the termination property of the tableau method, which leads us to prove the decidability.</description>

Abstract: In this note we give a very short introduction to Formal Concept Analysis, accompanied by an example in order to build concept lattices from a context. We build the lattice using the Java-based software Concept Explorer (ConExp) in a recent version of Linux. Installing an appropriate Java version is necessary, because ConExp was developed some time ago using a Sun Java version, which is not open-source. As a result, it has been observed that ConExp will not build a lattice when started with an open-source Java version. Therefore, we also sketch the procedure we followed to install an appropriate Java version which makes ConExp work again, i.e., to "build lattices again". We also show how to start ConExp with a 32 bit Java version, which requires a few additional libraries.</description>
