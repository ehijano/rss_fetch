      <title>Boltz-ABFE: Free Energy Perturbation without Crystal Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Free energy perturbation (FEP) is considered the gold-standard simulation method for estimating small molecule binding affinity, a quantity of vital importance to drug discovery. The accuracy of FEP critically depends on an accurate model of the protein-ligand complex as an initial condition for the underlying molecular dynamics simulation. This requirement has limited the impact of FEP in earlier stages of the discovery process, where appropriate experimental crystal structures are rarely available. The latest generation of structure prediction models, such as Boltz-2, promise to overcome this limitation by predicting protein-ligand complex structures. In this work, we combine Boltz-2 with our own absolute FEP protocol to build Boltz-ABFE, a robust pipeline for estimating the absolute binding free energies (ABFE) in the absence of experimental crystal structures. We investigate the quality of the structures predicted by Boltz-2, propose automated approaches to improve structures for use in molecular dynamics simulations, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the Boltz-ABFE pipeline for four protein targets from the FEP+ benchmark set. Demonstrating the feasibility of absolute FEP simulations without experimental crystal structures, Boltz-ABFE significantly expands the domain of applicability of FEP, paving the way towards accelerated early-stage drug discovery via accurate, structure-based affinity estimation.</description>

      <title>Current-Driven Symmetry Breaking and Spin-Orbit Polarization in Chiral Wires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin dynamics of electrons in chiral molecular systems remains a topic of intense interest, particularly regarding whether geometric chirality inherently induces spin polarization or simply modulates spin transport. In this work, we employ ab initio real-time time-dependent density functional theory (rt-TDDFT) to directly simulate the interplay between charge current, spin, and orbital. This real-time tracking goes beyond perturbative treatments, and we analyze how nonequilibrium currents effectively lift the symmetry constraints of screw-rotation and time-reversal symmetry. We find that above a critical current threshold, time-reversal symmetry constraints are dynamically lifted -- leading to pronounced spin and orbital polarizations, even when the underlying Hamiltonian remains symmetric. Notably, the emergence of spin and orbital angular momenta dynamics correlates with a loss of translational (linear) momentum, suggesting a redistribution of angular degrees of freedom as an intrinsic consequence of a current-driven symmetry lowering in a chiral system, with implications for chirality-induced spin selectivity and spintronic device design.</description>

      <title>Universal Generalization Theory for Physical Intuitions from Small Artificial Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical intuitions are native functions from human brains, yet the understanding of how physical intuitions are formulated has remained elusive. In this Letter, we propose a mechanism that simulates how human brain can quickly develop intuitional understandings from limited observations. Conceiving a training algorithm adapted from the well-known variational principle in physics, small artificial neural networks can possess strong physical intuitions that master the problems of brachistochrone and quantum harmonic oscillators, by learning from a few highly similar samples. Our simulations suggest that the variational principle is the governing mechanism for artificial physical intuitions. A unified generalization theory is derived, which hinges upon a variational operation on the Euler-Lagrange equation. Our theory also rationalizes that there is a threshold of artificial neural network size below which satisfactory physical intuitions are not possible. Our work offers insights into how strong physical intuition can be formulated as humans or as artificial intelligences.</description>

      <title>Quantum Resource Management in the NISQ Era: Challenges, Vision, and a Runtime Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computers represent a radical technological advancement in the way information is processed by using the principles of quantum mechanics to solve very complex problems that exceed the capabilities of classical systems. However, in the current NISQ era (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum devices), the available hardware presents several limitations, such as a limited number of qubits, high error rates, and reduced coherence times. Efficient management of quantum resources, both physical (qubits, error rates, connectivity) and logical (quantum gates, algorithms, error correction), becomes particularly relevant in the design and deployment of quantum algorithms. In this work, we analyze the role of resources in the various uses of NISQ devices today, identifying their relevance and implications for software engineering focused on the use of quantum computers. We propose a vision for runtime-aware quantum software development, identifying key challenges to its realization, such as limited introspection capabilities and temporal constraints in current platforms. As a proof of concept, we introduce Qonscious, a prototype framework that enables conditional execution of quantum programs based on dynamic resource evaluation. With this contribution, we aim to strengthen the field of Quantum Resource Estimation (QRE) and move towards the development of scalable, reliable, and resource-aware quantum software.</description>

      <title>SNIC bifurcation and its Application to MEMS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This project focuses on a method to extract a frequency comb in mechanical means, for general interest and numerous practical applications in MEMS. The method of execution is the implementation of a beam that is exhibiting non-linear dynamics that is perturbed and analyzed for its transverse vibrations. The perturbation is an external harmonic driver with a chosen small amplitude and frequency (which is slightly detuned from the beam eigenfrequency), that when engaged with the unperturbed beam oscillations, causes it reach a state of "injection pulling" - an effect that occurs when one harmonic oscillator is coupled with a second one and causes it to oscillate in a frequency near its own. This causes the beam to reach SNIC bifurcation, rendering a frequency comb as desired. Theoretical analysis showed that the problem can be modelled using a non-linear equation of the beam, that translates to a form of the non-linear Duffing equation. While a solution to the dynamics function of the beam is hard to obtain in practice due to mathematical difficulties, a slow evolution model is suggested that is composed of functions of a amplitude and phase. Using several additional mathematical assumptions, the amplitude is seen to be related to the phase, while the phase equation solution is seen to be of the form of Adler's equation. These assumptions ultimately reduce the entire behaviour of the beam to a relatively simple solution to the Adler equation, which has a known analytical solution. Computerized numerical simulations are run on it to check the results and compare them to the theory and desired outcome. The results agreed with the theory and produce the expected frequency comb, showing the assumptions to be valid in extracting the comb.</description>

      <title>Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation for Symplectic Learning: Advancing Hamiltonian Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation-based Hamiltonian Neural Network (KAR-HNN) that replaces the Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) with univariate transformations. While Hamiltonian Neural Networks (HNNs) ensure energy conservation by learning Hamiltonian functions directly from data, existing implementations, often relying on MLPs, cause hypersensitivity to the hyperparameters while exploring complex energy landscapes. Our approach exploits the localized function approximations to better capture high-frequency and multi-scale dynamics, reducing energy drift and improving long-term predictive stability. The networks preserve the symplectic form of Hamiltonian systems, and thus maintain interpretability and physical consistency. After assessing KAR-HNN on four benchmark problems including spring-mass, simple pendulum, two- and three-body problem, we foresee its effectiveness for accurate and stable modeling of realistic physical processes often at high dimensions and with few known parameters.</description>

      <title>Exploiting nonlinear incoherent image formation through linear volume metaoptics for inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We showed that a 2D depth map representing an incoherent 3D opaque scene is directly encoded in the response function of an imaging optics. As a result, the optics creates an image that depends nonlinearly on the depth map. Furthermore, strong spatio-spectral dispersions in volume metaoptics can be engineered to create a complex image in response to a depth map. We hypothesize that this complexity will allow the linear volume metaoptics to nonlinearly sense and process 3D opaque scenes.</description>

      <title>Fourier Feature Networks for High-Fidelity Prediction of Perturbed Optical Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modelling the effects of perturbations on optical fields often requires learning highly oscillatory complex-valued functions. Standard multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) struggle with this task due to an inherent spectral bias, preventing them from fitting high-frequency sinusoids. To overcome this, we incorporate Fourier features - a set of predefined sinusoids dependent on the perturbation - as an additional network input. This reframes the learning problem from approximating a complex function to finding a linear combination of basis functions. We demonstrate this method by training a Fourier Feature Network to predict the transmission matrix of a multimode fibre under mechanical compression. Compared to a standard MLP, our network reduces prediction error in the output field's amplitude and phase by an order of magnitude, achieving a mean complex correlation of 0.995 with the ground truth, despite using 85% fewer parameters. This approach offers a general and robust method for accurately modelling a wide class of oscillatory physical systems.</description>

      <title>Tunable quantum anomalous Hall effect in fullerene monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nearly four decades after its theoretical prediction, the search for material realizations of quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) remains a highly active field of research. Many materials have been predicted to exhibit quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) physics under feasible conditions but the experimental verification remains widely elusive. In this work, we propose an alternative approach towards QAH materials design by engineering customized molecular building blocks. We demonstrate this ansatz for a two-dimensional (2D) honeycomb lattice of C26 fullerenes, which exhibits a ferromagnetic ground state and thus breaks time-reversal symmetry. The molecular system is found to be highly tunable with respect to its magnetic degrees of freedom and applied strain, giving rise to a rich phase diagram with Chern numbers C= +/-2, +/-1, 0. Our proposal offers a versatile platform to realize tunable QAH physics under accessible conditions and provides an experimentally feasible approach for chemical synthesis of molecular networks with QAHE.</description>

      <title>Direct probing of the simulation complexity of open quantum many-body dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating open quantum systems is key to understanding non-equilibrium processes, as persistent influence from the environment induces dissipation and can give rise to steady-state phase transitions. A common strategy is to embed the system-environment into a larger unitary framework, but this obscures the intrinsic complexity of the reduced system dynamics. Here, we investigate the computational complexity of simulating open quantum systems, focusing on two physically relevant parameters, correlation length and mixing time, and explore whether it can be comparable (or even lower) to that of simulating their closed counterparts. In particular, we study the role of dissipation in simulating open-system dynamics using both quantum and classical methods, where the classical complexity is characterised by the bond dimension and operator entanglement entropy. Our results show that dissipation affects correlation length and mixing time in distinct ways at intermediate and long timescales. Moreover, we observe numerically that in classical tensor network simulations, classical complexity does not decrease with stronger dissipation, revealing a separation between quantum and classical resource scaling.</description>

      <title>A Field-Theoretical Paradigm via Hierarchical Coarse-Graining: I. Generalized Mode Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiscale computer simulations facilitate the efficient exploration of large spatiotemporal scales in chemical and physical systems. However, molecular simulations predominantly rely on particle-based representations, which become computationally prohibitive when applied beyond the molecular scale. Field-theoretical simulations have emerged as an alternative to overcome these limitations. Despite their applicability in mesoscopic simulations, these approaches are typically derived from top-down principles, leaving a gap in the bottom-up derivation of field-theoretical models for targeted molecular systems. This work presents a systematic strategy for constructing statistical field models for molecular liquids from the atomistic level, marking a critical step toward bridging particle-based and field-theoretical modeling techniques. By introducing molecular coarse-grained models as an intermediate step, this hierarchical approach reduces the complexity of the atomistic-to-field-theoretical transformation while preserving important microscopic structural correlations. We systematically derive field-theoretical models in reciprocal space for both canonical and grand canonical ensembles using the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation. By incorporating additional fields for both positive and negative Fourier modes, our generalized mode theory extends the applicability of bottom-up field-theoretical models beyond the conventional Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation, which can be limited to positive Fourier modes. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient perturbative approach for approximating Fourier modes of molecular interactions, reducing computational cost and allowing for integrating complex molecular interactions into the field-theoretic description.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We combine the electron attachment (EA) and ionization potential (IP) equation-of-motion (EOM) coupled-cluster (CC) approaches with the CC($P$;$Q$) formalism. The resulting methodologies are used to describe the electronic states of several open-shell molecules, with the goal of approximating high-level EA/IP-EOMCC energetics corresponding to a full treatment of 3-particle-2-hole (3$p$-2$h$) and 3-hole-2-particle (3$h$-2$p$) excitations on top of CC with singles and doubles (CCSD). We show that the active-orbital-based EA/IP-EOMCC CC($P$;$Q$) approaches, abbreviated as EA/IP-CC(t;3), achieve sub-millihartree accuracies relative to the parent EA-EOMCCSD(3$p$-2$h$)/IP-EOMCCSD(3$h$-2$p$) data using reduced computational effort, while improving upon their completely renormalized EA/IP-CR-EOMCC(2,3) counterparts.</description>

Abstract: We investigate proteins within heterogeneous cell membranes where non-equilibrium phenomena arises from spatial variations in concentration and temperature. We develop simulation methods building on non-equilibrium statistical mechanics to obtain stochastic hybrid continuum-discrete descriptions which track individual protein dynamics, spatially varying concentration fluctuations, and thermal exchanges. We investigate biological mechanisms for protein positioning and patterning within membranes and factors in thermal gradient sensing. We also study the kinetics of Brownian motion of particles with temperature variations within energy landscapes arising from heterogeneous microstructures within membranes. The introduced approaches provide self-consistent models for studying biophysical mechanisms involving the drift-diffusion dynamics of individual proteins and energy exchanges and fluctuations between the thermal and mechanical parts of the system. The methods also can be used for studying related non-equilibrium effects in other biological systems and soft materials.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-induced magnetism in fullerene monolayers</title>

Abstract: Using molecular orbital theory, we introduce magnetism in pure-carbon, charge-neutral fullerene monolayers which are otherwise non-magnetic. By controlling either molecular or lattice symmetry, we can realise highly-tuneable magnetic fullerene monolayers. We demonstrate a general design principle based on group theory analysis and explain the origin of magnetism using two representative systems with $S_4$ and $C_3$ molecular symmetries. Moreover, for building blocks that lack appropriate molecular symmetry, we can enforce crystalline symmetry to induce magnetism as well. Finally, we discuss the experimental feasibility of realising our proposed magnetic fullerene monolayers by examining a previously synthesised C$_{60}$ system. Our work opens a new direction in introducing magnetism in non-magnetic building blocks by enforcing either molecular or lattice symmetry.</description>
