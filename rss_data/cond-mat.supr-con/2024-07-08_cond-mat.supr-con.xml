      <title>Geometry fluctuations in chiral superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coupling of chiral superfluids and superconductors to the background geometry leads to surprising geometric induction phenomena. We show that this coupling bears important consequences even in a nearly flat background, through its signature in thermal fluctuations. Starting from the Ginzburg-Landau free energy of a chiral superfluid minimally coupled to the background geometry, we show that the interaction strength between vortices gets renormalized by geometry fluctuations. In our setup, these arise from the shape fluctuations of the underlying two-dimensional substrate, and are controlled by its bending rigidity and tension. In the tensionless limit, the fluctuations lower the vortex interaction strength at large distances, which leads to a lowering of the BKT transition temperature. We study this effect in terms of the renormalization group flow of a dual sine-Gordon theory of the superfluid transition coupled to the substrate shape. It shows that, in turn, the chiral superfluid order can suppress the amplitude of shape fluctuations, resulting in an extended phase diagram which links the superfluid transition to the crumpling transition of the substrate. These reveal thermodynamic signatures of chirality in the superfluid transition.</description>

      <title>High-temperature Superconductivity in Perovskite Hydride below 10 GPa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen and hydrides materials have long been considered promising materials for high-temperature superconductivity. But the extreme pressures required for the metallization of hydrogen-based superconductors limit their applications. Here, we have designed a series of high-temperature perovskite hydrides that can be stable within 10 GPa. Our research covered 182 ternary systems and ultimately determined that 9 compounds were stable within 20 GPa, of which 5 exhibited superconducting transition temperatures exceeding 120 K within 10 GPa. Excitingly, KGaH3 and CsInH3 are thermodynamically stable at 50 GPa. Among these perovskite hydrides, alkali metals are responsible for providing a fixed amount of charge and maintaining structural stability, while the cubic framework formed by IIIA group elements and hydrogen is crucial for high-temperature superconductivity. This work will inspire further experimental exploration and take an important step in the exploration of low-pressure stable high-temperature superconductors.</description>

      <title>Single-gap Isotropic $s-$wave Superconductivity in Single Crystals $\text{AuSn}_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: London, $\lambda_L (T)$, and Campbell, $\lambda_{C} (T)$, penetration depths were measured in single crystals of a topological superconductor candidate $\text{AuSn}_4$. At low temperatures, $\lambda_L (T)$ is exponentially attenuated and, if fitted with the power law, $\lambda(T) \sim T^n$, gives exponents $n&gt;4$, indistinguishable from the isotropic single $s-$wave gap Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) asymptotic. The superfluid density fits perfectly in the entire temperature range to the BCS theory. The superconducting transition temperature, $T_c = 2.40 \pm 0.05\:\text{K}$, does not change after 2.5 MeV electron irradiation, indicating the validity of the Anderson theorem for isotropic $s-$wave superconductors. Campbell penetration depth before and after electron irradiation shows no hysteresis between the zero-field cooling (ZFC) and field cooling (FC) protocols, consistent with the parabolic pinning potential. Interestingly, the critical current density estimated from the original Campbell theory decreases after irradiation, implying that a more sophisticated theory involving collective effects is needed to describe vortex pinning in this system. In general, our thermodynamic measurements strongly suggest that the bulk response of the $\text{AuSn}_4$ crystals is fully consistent with the isotropic $s-$wave weak-coupling BCS superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Upper limit for superconducting transition temperature in Eliashberg-McMillan theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present simple qualitative estimates for the maximal superconducting transition temperature, which may be achieved due to electron - phonon coupling in Eliashberg-McMillan theory. It is shown that in the limit of very strong coupling the upper limit for transition temperature is determined in fact by a combination of atomic constants and density of conduction electrons.</description>

      <title>Elemental noncentrosymmetric superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductivity has been discovered in many materials including elements, cuprates and nickelates. Noncentrosymmetric superconductors get attention due to their physical properties results from spatial inversion symmetry breaking. Here we propose the existence of elemental noncentrosymmetric superconductors which needs to break spatial inversion symmetry in single element phases realized by occupations of more than one Wyckoff positions. Elemental noncentrosymmetric superconductors allow us to study the admixture of spin-singlet and spin-triplet pairing states in elements with simple crystal structures and chemical conditions. We find that four-layer La thin films coming from bulk {\alpha}-La with a double hexagonal close-packed structure are elemental noncentrosymmetric superconductors since the dimension reduction breaks the spatial inversion symmetry. In the normal state, four-layer La is a polar rare-earth metal with a spontaneous polarization having a polar layer group like ferroelectrics. Hence, to be more precise, four-layer La can also be called the elemental polar superconductor in the superconductivity state. Based on this method of breaking inversion symmetry, we discovery polar rare-earth metals, polar transition metals, polar alkali metals and polar alkali earth metals. Other candidate materials are bulk polar materials formed with group 15 elements, Bi thin films with polar stacking, polar double layer plumbene and Al thin films. The question of building the periodic table of elemental noncentrosymmetric superconductors is raised.</description>

      <title>Granular Ta-Te nanowire superconductivity violating the Pauli limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strategies to achieve higher upper-critical-field superconductors ({\mu}0Hc2(0)) are of great interest for both fundamental science and practical applications. While reducing the thickness of two-dimensional (2D) materials to a few layers significantly enhances {\mu}0Hc2(0) with accompanied potential unconventional pairing mechanisms, further dimensional reduction to 1D compounds rarely exceeds the expected Pauli limit. Here, we report the discovery of a 1D granular Ta-Te nanowire that becomes superconducting under high pressure, with a maximum critical temperature (Tc) of 5.1 K. Remarkably, the {\mu}0Hc2(0) reaches 16 T, which is twice the Pauli limit, setting a record of {\mu}0Hc2 (0) in all the reported 1D superconductors. Our work demonstrates that the Ta-Te nanowire not only is a potential candidate for applications in high magnetic fields, but also provides an ideal platform for further investigations of the mechanisms between nanowires and large {\mu}0Hc2(0).</description>

      <title>Quantum dynamics of frustrated Josephson junction arrays embedded in a transmission line: an effective XX spin chain with long-range interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study theoretically a variety of collective quantum phases occurring in frustrated saw-tooth chains of Josephson junctions embedded in a dissipationless transmission line. The basic element of a system, i.e., the triangular superconducting cell, contains two $0$- and one $\pi$- Josephson junctions characterized by $E_J$ and $\alpha E_J$ Josephson energies, accordingly. In the frustrated regime the low energy quantum dynamics of a single cell is determined by anticlockwise or clockwise flowing persistent currents (vortex/antivortex). The direct embedding of $\pi$-Josephson junctions in a transmission line allows to establish a short/long-range interaction between (anti)vortices of well separated cells. By making use of the variational approach, we map the superconducting circuit Hamiltonian to an effective $XX$ spin model with an exchange spin-spin interaction decaying with the distance $x$ as $x^{-\beta}$, and the local $\hat \sigma_{x,n}$-terms corresponding to the coherent quantum beats between vortex and antivortex in a single cell. We obtain that in long arrays as $N \gg \ell_0 \simeq \sqrt{C/C_0}$, where $C$ and $C_0$ are capacitances of $0$-Josephson junction and transmission line, accordingly, the amplitude of quantum beats is strongly suppressed. By means of exact numerical diagonalization, we study the interplay between the coherent quantum beats and the exchange spin-spin interaction leading to the appearance of various collective quantum phases such as the paramagnetic ($P$), compressible superfluid ($CS$) and weakly compressible superfluid ($w$-$CS$) states.</description>

      <title>Unifying principle for Hall coefficient in systems near magnetic instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Typically, Hall coefficient of materials near magnetic instabilities exhibits pronounced temperature dependence. To explore the reasons involved, we studied the temperature dependence of Hall coefficient in $Cr_{1-x}V_x$, $V_{2-y}O_3$ and some high-$T_c$ superconducting cuprates. We argue that it can be rationalized using the following unifying principle:\textit{ When a system is near a magnetic instability and temperature is reduced towards the instability, there is a progressive "loss" of carriers (progressive "tying down" of electrons) as they participate in long-lived and long-ranged magnetic correlations.} In other words, magnetic correlations grow in space and are longer-lived as temperature is reduced towards the magnetic instability. This is the mechanism behind reduced carrier density with reducing temperature and leads to an enhancement of the Hall coefficient. This unifying principle is implemented and quantitative analysis is done using the Gor'kov Teitel'baum Thermal Activation (GTTA) model. We also show that the Hall angle data can be understood using one relaxation time (in contrast to the "two-relaxation" times idea of Anderson) by taking into consideration of temperature dependence of carrier density. This unifying principle is shown to be working in above studied systems, but authors believe that it is of much more general validity.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic Behavior of High-Permittivity Gate Dielectrics: The Impact of the Atomic Layer Deposition Temperature and the Lithography Pattering Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dielectrics featuring a high relative permittivity, i.e., high-k dielectrics, have become the standard insulators in gate architectures, enhancing the electrical performance of both room temperature and cryogenic electronics. This study delves into the cryogenic (3 K) performance of high-k dielectrics commonly used as gate insulators. We fabricated Al2O3 and HfO2 layers via Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) and we extrapolated relative permittivity (k) and dielectric strength (EBD) from AC (100 Hz to 100 kHz) and DC measurements on metal-insulator-metal capacitors. Our findings reveal a strong dependence of HfO2 cryogenic performance on the ALD growth temperature, while the latter shows a negligible impact on Al2O3. We estimated a ~9 % and ~14 % reduction of the relative permittivity of HfO2 and Al2O3, respectively, from 300 K to 3 K. Additionally, we designed and fabricated Al2O3/HfO2 bilayers and we checked their properties at cryogenic temperatures. The study also investigates the impact of the patterning method, namely, UV or electron-beam lithography (acceleration voltage of 10, 20, or 30 kV), on the high-k dielectric properties.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal charge transport and subharmonic structure in voltage-biased Josephson diodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15386v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study charge transport in voltage-biased single-channel junctions involving helical superconductors with finite Cooper pair momentum. For a Josephson junction, the equilibrium current-phase relation shows a superconducting diode effect: the critical current depends on the propagation direction. We formulate a scattering theory for voltage-biased Josephson diodes and show that multiple Andreev reflection processes cause a rich subharmonic structure in the DC current-voltage curve at low temperatures and small voltages due to Doppler shifts of the spectral gap. In the current-biased case, the diode efficiency has maximal rectification efficiency $\eta_0\approx 0.4$ for this model. In the voltage-biased case, however, the rectification efficiency can reach the ideal value $\eta=1$. We also discuss charge transport for NS junctions between a normal metal and a helical superconductor and comment on related models with spin-orbit interactions and magnetic Zeeman fields.</description>

      <title>Investigations of key issues on the reproducibility of high-Tc superconductivity emerging from compressed La3Ni2O7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12361v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the signatures of superconductivity near 80 K have been discovered in the single crystal of La3Ni2O7 under pressure and thus has attracted significant attention. However, there are several critical issues that have been perplexing the scientific community. These include (1) what factors contribute to the poor reproducibility of the experimental results, (2) what the intrinsic nature of the pressure-induced superconductivity is, bulk or filamentary, (3) where the superconducting phase locates within the sample if it is indeed filamentary, and (4) what the oxygen content is necessary for the development and stabilization of superconductivity. In this study, we employ comprehensive high-pressure measurements to address these crucial issues. By demonstrating both zero resistance and diamagnetism, we are the first to confirm the existence of high-temperature superconductivity in La3Ni2O7. Through our sensitive ac susceptibility measurements, we are the first to quantify the superconducting volume fraction in La3Ni2O7 at the level of 1%. In tandem with our observation of the anisotropic zero-resistance state only in some of the samples, we suggest that the superconductivity in this nickelate is filamentary-like. By our scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) investigations, we propose that the filamentary superconductivity most likely emerges at the interface between the La3Ni2O7 and La4Ni3O10 phases. Further, the upper and lower bounds of the oxygen content required for the presence of superconductivity were determined. Our results provide not only new insights into understanding the puzzling issues in this material, but also significant information for achieving a better understanding on the superconductivity of this material.</description>

      <title>Spatially Dependent in-Gap States Induced by Andreev Tunneling through a Single Electronic State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS), we observe in-gap states induced by Andreev tunneling through a single impurity state in a low carrier density superconductor (NaAlSi). The energy-symmetric in-gap states appear when the impurity state is located within the superconducting gap. In-gap states can cross the Fermi level, and they show X-shaped spatial variation. We interpret the in-gap states as a consequence of the Andreev tunneling through the impurity state, which involves the formation or breakup of a Cooper pair. Due to the low carrier density in NaAlSi, the in-gap state is tunable by controlling the STM tip-sample distance. Under strong external magnetic fields, the impurity state shows Zeeman splitting when it is located near the Fermi level. Our findings not only demonstrate the Andreev tunneling involving single electronic state, but also provide new insights for understanding the spatially-dependent in-gap states in low carrier density superconductors.</description>

      <title>Fractional ac Josephson effect as evidence of topological hinge states in a Dirac semimetal NiTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate Josephson current between two 5~$\mu$m spaced superconducting indium leads, coupled to a NiTe$_2$ single crystal flake, which is a type-II Dirac semimetal. Under microwave irradiation, we demonstrate a.c. Josephson effect at millikelvin temperatures as a number of Shapiro steps. In addition to the integer ($n=1,2,3,4...$) steps, we observe fractional ones at half-integer values $n=1/2,3/2,5/2$ and 7/2, which corresponds to $\pi$ periodicity of current-phase relationship. In contrast to previous investigations, we do not observe $4\pi$ periodicity (disappearance of the odd $n=1,3,5...$ Shapiro steps), while the latter is usually considered as a fingerprint of helical surface states in Dirac semimetals and topological insulators. We argue, that our experiment confirms Josephson current through the topological hinge states in NiTe$_2$: since one can exclude bulk supercurrent in 5~$\mu$m long Josephson junctions, interference of the hinge modes is responsible for the $\pi$ periodicity, while stable odd Shapiro steps reflect chiral character of the topological hinge states.</description>
