      <title>Treewidth of Outer $k$-Planar Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Treewidth is an important structural graph parameter that quantifies how closely a graph resembles a tree-like structure. It has applications in many algorithmic and combinatorial problems. In this paper, we study treewidth of outer $k$-planar graphs - graphs admitting a convex drawing where all vertices lie on a circle and each edge crosses at most $k$ other edges. We also consider a more general class of outer min-$k$-planar graphs, which are graphs admitting a convex drawing where for every crossing of two edges at least one of these edges is crossed at most $k$ times.
  Firman, Gutowski, Kryven, Okada and Wolff [GD 2024] proved that every outer $k$-planar graph has treewidth at most $1.5k+2$ and provided a lower bound of $k+2$ for even $k$. We establish a lower bound of $1.5k+0.5$ for every odd $k$. Additionally, they showed that every outer min-$k$-planar graph has treewidth at most $3k+1$. We improve this upper bound to $3 \cdot \lfloor 0.5k \rfloor+4$.
  Our approach also allows us to upper bound the separation number, a parameter closely related to treewidth, of outer min-$k$-planar graphs by $2 \cdot \lfloor 0.5k \rfloor+4$. This improves the previous bound of $2k+1$ and achieves a bound with an optimal multiplicative constant.</description>

      <title>Pairwise similarity method for majority domination problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper considers the problem of finding the number of dominant voters in two-level voting procedures. At the first stage, voting is conducted among local groups of voters, and at the second stage, the results are aggregated to form a final decision. The goal is to determine the minimum proportion of voters supporting a proposal for it to be accepted. The paper uses the method of pairwise comparisons to analyze the structure of the problem and develop heuristic algorithms with guaranteed accuracy. Special cases are considered, including the agent communication graph as a tree, complete graph, or regular graph with an odd number of vertices. New heuristic algorithms are proposed for each case, along with pairwise comparison functions to estimate the accuracy of the solution. Results extend the use of polynomial algorithms to a broader class of problems, providing criteria for selecting the optimal algorithm during the post-processing stage.</description>

      <title>On the spectra of prefix-reversal graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study spectral properties of prefix-reversal graphs. These graphs are obtained by connecting two elements of $C_m\wr S_n$ via prefix reversals. If $m=1,2$, the corresponding prefix-reversal graphs are the classic pancake and burnt pancake graphs. If $m&gt;2$, then one can consider the directed and undirected versions of these graphs. We prove that the spectrum of the undirected prefix-reversal graph $\mathbb{P}_m(n)$ contains all even integers in the interval $[0,2n]\setminus\{2\lfloor n/2\rfloor\}$ and if $m\equiv0\pmod4$, we then show that the spectrum contains all even integers in $[0,2n]$. In the directed case, we show that the spectrum of the directed prefix-reversal graph $P(m,n)$ contains all integers in the interval $[0,n]\setminus\{\lfloor n/2\rfloor\}$. As a consequence, we show that in either case, the prefix-reversal graphs have a small spectral gap.</description>

      <title>Excluding an induced wheel minor in graphs without large induced stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a conjecture due to Dallard, Krnc, Kwon, Milani\v{c}, Munaro, \v{S}torgel, and Wiederrecht stating that for any positive integer $d$ and any planar graph $H$, the class of all $K_{1,d}$-free graphs without $H$ as an induced minor has bounded tree-independence number. A $k$-wheel is the graph obtained from a cycle of length $k$ by adding a vertex adjacent to all vertices of the cycle. We show that the conjecture of Dallard et al. is true when $H$ is a $k$-wheel for any $k\geq 3$. Our proof uses a generalization of the concept of brambles to tree-independence number. As a consequence of our main result, several important $\mathsf{NP}$-hard problems such as Maximum Independent Set are tractable on $K_{1,d}$-free graphs without large induced wheel minors. Moreover, for fixed $d$ and $k$, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm that, given a $K_{1,d}$-free graph $G$ as input, finds an induced minor model of a $k$-wheel in $G$ if one exists.</description>

      <title>Odd coloring graphs with linear neighborhood complexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that any class of bipartite graphs with linear neighborhood complexity has bounded odd chromatic number. As a result, if $\mathcal{G}$ is the class of all circle graphs, or if $\mathcal{G}$ is any class with bounded twin-width, bounded merge-width, or a forbidden vertex-minor, then $\mathcal{G}$ is $\chi_{odd}$-bounded.</description>

      <title>Small maximal clusters are very unlikely in critical random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12451v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a probabilistic methodology, based on random walk estimates, to obtain exponential upper bounds for the probability of observing unusually small maximal components in two classical (near-)critical random graph models. More specifically, we analyse the near-critical Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi model $\mathbb{G}(n,p)$ and the random graph $\mathbb{G}(n,d,p)$ obtained by performing near-critical $p$-bond percolation on a simple random $d$-regular graph and show that, for each one of these models, the probability that the size of a largest component is smaller than $n^{2/3}/A$ is at most of order $\exp(-A^{3/2})$. The exponent $3/2$ is known to be optimal for the near-critical $\mathbb{G}(n,p)$ random graph, whereas for the near-critical $\mathbb{G}(n,d,p)$ model the best known upper bound for the above probability was of order $A^{-3/5}$. As a secondary result we show, by means of an optimized version of the martingale method of Nachmias and Peres, that the above probability of observing an unusually small maximal component is at most of order $\exp(-A^{3/5})$ in other two critical models, namely a random intersection graph and the quantum random graph; this stretched-exponential bounds also improve upon the known (polynomial) bounds available for these other two critical models.</description>

      <title>Lassos: Pushing Tree Decompositions Forward Along Homomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15184v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is folklore that tree-width is monotone under taking subgraphs (i.e. injective graph homomorphisms) and contractions (certain kinds of surjective graph homomorphisms). However, although tree-width is obviously not monotone under any surjective graph homomorphism, it is not clear whether contractions are canonically the only class of surjections with respect to which it is monotone. Under the requirement that the decomposition shape must be preserved, we prove that this is indeed the case.
  Our results provide a framework for answering questions of this sort for many other kinds of combinatorial data structures (such as directed multigraphs, hypergraphs, Petri nets, circular port graphs, half-edge graphs, databases, simplicial sets etc.) for which natural analogues of tree decompositions can be defined. Furthermore and of independent interest, we prove these results by introducing the notion of a lasso, a generalization of contractions of graphs to arbitrary categories with pushouts of monomorphisms.</description>

      <title>Emergence of network communities driven by local rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17042v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Natural systems are modeled by networks with nodes and links. Often the nodes are segregated into communities with different connectivity patterns. Node heterogeneity such as political affiliation in social networks or biological function in gene networks are highlighted as key factors driving the segregation of nodes into communities. Here, by means of numerical simulations, I show that node heterogeneity is not a necessary requirement. To this end I introduce the Ramsey community number, $r_ \kappa$, the minimum graph size that warranties the emergence of network communities with almost certainty. Using the stochastic block model and Infomap methods for community detection, I show that networks generated by local rules have finite $r_ \kappa$ values while their randomized versions do not have emergent communities. I conjecture that network communities are an emergent property of networks evolving with local rules.</description>

      <title>4-tangrams are 4-avoidable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A tangram is a word in which every letter occurs an even number of times. Thus it can be cut into parts that can be arranged into two identical words. The \emph{cut number} of a tangram is the minimum number of required cuts in this process. Tangrams with cut number one corresponds to squares. For $k\ge1$, let $t(k)$ denote the minimum size of an alphabet over which an infinite word avoids tangrams with cut number at most~$k$. The existence of infinite ternary square-free words shows that $t(1)=t(2)=3$. We show that $t(3)=t(4)=4$, answering a question from D\k{e}bski, Grytczuk, Pawlik, Przyby\l{}o, and \'Sleszy\'nska-Nowak.</description>

      <title>An $O(\log \log n)$-approximate budget feasible mechanism for subadditive valuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04665v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In budget-feasible mechanism design, there is a set of items $U$, each owned by a distinct seller. The seller of item $e$ incurs a private cost $\overline{c}_e$ for supplying her item. A buyer wishes to procure a set of items from the sellers of maximum value, where the value of a set $S\subseteq U$ of items is given by a valuation function $v:2^U\to \mathbb{R}_+$. The buyer has a budget of $B \in \mathbb{R}_+$ for the total payments made to the sellers. We wish to design a mechanism that is truthful, that is, sellers are incentivized to report their true costs, budget-feasible, that is, the sum of the payments made to the sellers is at most the budget $B$, and that outputs a set whose value is large compared to $\text{OPT}:=\max\{v(S):\overline{c}(S)\le B,S\subseteq U\}$.
  Budget-feasible mechanism design has been extensively studied, with the literature focussing on (classes of) subadditive valuation functions, and various polytime, budget-feasible mechanisms, achieving constant-factor approximation, have been devised for the special cases of additive, submodular, and XOS valuations. However, for general subadditive valuations, the best-known approximation factor achievable by a polytime budget-feasible mechanism (given access to demand oracles) was only $O(\log n / \log \log n)$, where $n$ is the number of items.
  We improve this state-of-the-art significantly by designing a randomized budget-feasible mechanism for subadditive valuations that achieves a substantially-improved approximation factor of $O(\log\log n)$ and runs in polynomial time, given access to demand oracles.</description>
