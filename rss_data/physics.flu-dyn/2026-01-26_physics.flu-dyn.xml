      <title>Diffusion Model Driven Airfoil Design: From Geometry Encoding to Practical Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion model, the state-of-the-art generative machine learning architecture, has shown promising results airfoil inverse designs. In this study, we implemented and trained a series of diffusion models on three different airfoil geometry data encoding formats -- principal component weights, ordered $x$-$y$ coordinates, and 2D signed distance functions (SDF) -- to generate 2D airfoils. By systematically comparing the performance of diffusion models trained on different data structures, it is found that for 2D airfoil design problems, the diffusion model performs the best when directly trained with coordinates. Training with latent space (PCA weights in this study) limits the model's design freedom, and decreases the training effectiveness. Although the 2D SDF data appears to result in the least performing model, it proves its feasibility in aerodynamic shape generation, paving the way towards 3D problems where SDF is more favored. This study also investigated deploying the diffusion model in practical engineering applications. A multi-target optimization procedure is proposed based on the stochastic nature of the diffusion process, which drastically simplifies the procedure compared to conventional methods. The extrapolation performance of the model is also investigated by tasking the model with both aerodynamic and flow condition labels that are extrapolated beyond the training set boundaries.</description>

      <title>A Study of Improved Limiter Formulations for Second-Order Finite Volume Schemes Applied to Unstructured Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A general, compact way of achieving second-order in finite-volume numerical methods is to perform a MUSCL-like, piecewise linear reconstruction of flow properties at each cell interface. To avoid the surge of spurious oscillations in the discrete solution, a limiter function is commonly employed. This strategy, however, can add a series of drawbacks to the overall numerical scheme. The present paper investigates this behavior by considering three different limiter formulations in the context of a second-order, finite volume scheme for the simulation of steady, turbulent flows on unstructured meshes. Three limiter formulations are considered: the original Venkatakrishnan limiter, Wang's modification to the Venkatakrishnan limiter and Nishikawa's recently introduced R3 limiter. Three different configurations of the fully-developed, two-dimensional, transonic NACA 0012 airfoil are analyzed, configured with different angles of attack and similar freestream properties. The gas dynamics are modeled using the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations, where the negative Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model is used to solve the closure problem. All limiters are shown to yield similar results for all configurations of this case, although with different dissipative characteristics, provided their control constants are used within appropriate intervals. The presented numerical results are in good agreement with experimental data available in the literature.</description>

      <title>Elucidating Three-Dimensional Coherent Structures in a Multi-Stream Jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nominal two-dimensional (2D) shear layers have been studied extensively, and their principal dynamics are well understood. In practical configurations, however, the behavior of such shear layers is affected by proximal surfaces. In this study, we investigate three-dimensional (3D) coherent structures developing downstream of a relatively thick splitter plate in a realistic nozzle featuring sidewalls, an upper boundary formed by a single expansion ramp, and a lower boundary defined by a protruding deck. As a result, in addition to the primary splitter plate shear layer (SPSL) arising from mixing between the core and bypass streams, the flow contains upper (USL) and lower (LSL) shear layers with the ambient. Large-eddy simulation data are analyzed to characterize the unsteady flow dynamics, while the mean flow provides insight into the underlying amplification mechanisms. Spectral proper orthogonal decomposition reveals a clear separation of broadband and tonal dynamics across frequency bands. The broadband low-frequency modes are highly 3D and originate in the USL and LSL. In contrast, tonal high-frequency content is associated with a 2D instability in the SPSL. Both the broadband and tonal signatures also appear in the nonlinear energy transfer mechanisms. Triglobal resolvent analysis further clarifies the amplification mechanisms within the USL and LSL. Low-frequency response modes are excited by forcing localized near the nozzle geometry and are governed by 3D Kelvin-Helmholtz dynamics. The low-frequency streamwise vortices generated at the nozzle corners drive the axis-switching behavior characteristic of rectangular jets. Wavemaker analysis further demonstrates that these corner vortices are part of self-sustaining low-frequency dynamics.</description>

      <title>Relation between the moments of longitudinal velocity derivatives and of dissipation in turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In homogeneous and isotropic turbulence, measurements of the longitudinal velocity derivative, $\partial_1 u_1$, make it possible to estimate a surrogate of the rate of energy dissipation per unit mass, $\epsilon$: $\epsilon_s = 15 \nu (\partial_1 u_1)^2 $, where $\nu$ is the fluid viscosity, in the sense that the averages of $\epsilon$ and $\epsilon_s$ are equal. We show here that the $n^{th}$ moments of the fluctuations $\epsilon$ and $\epsilon_s$, for $n &gt; 2$, are not exactly proportional to each other, and that the expression for the moment $\langle \epsilon_s^n \rangle$ for $ n \ge 3$ involves in addition to a term proportional to $\langle \epsilon^n \rangle$, other contributions involving the invariant of the strain tensor, $\SSs$: ${\rm tr}( \SSs^3)$. The contribution of this term depends on the distribution of the dimensionless ratio $\mathcal{R} \equiv {\rm tr}(\SSs^3)/{\rm tr}(\SSs^2)^{3/2}$. We find, however, that the relation obtained by assuming that $\mathcal{R}$ is uniformly distributed in the interval $-1/\sqrt{6} \le \mathcal{R} \le 1/\sqrt{6}$, which is obtained when the matrix $\SSs$ has a Gaussian distribution, differs by no more than a few percents from the exact distribution.</description>

      <title>Numerical investigation of unsteady flow in a reversible pump-turbine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydropower is an important source of renewable energy that provides clean energy. Pump-turbine type hydraulic turbine is widely used to mitigate the intermittent energy demand and store a large-scale energy. Pump-turbine operates in reverse mode in pump mode to store energy. Flow conditions in turbine mode and pump mode operations is substantially different. This study investigates the unsteady flow field in the model pump-turbine. A computational model of the pump-turbine was created, and the model included hexahedral mesh of 58.19 million nodes. Total verification and validation error was 7.7%. Three operating conditions in turbine mode and four in pump mode were simulated. Flow characteristics, such as blade loading, time-dependent pressure fluctuations, frequency spectra, radial and tangential velocity were investigated. The frequency spectra revealed amplitude of frequencies up to tenth harmonics of the blade passing frequency in pump mode. The higher harmonic frequencies can potentially reach the high mode eigen frequencies and increase the risk of resonance. Flow field analysis in the draft tube indicted the strong presence of Dean vortices causing highly asymmetric flow at the runner inlet in pump mode operation. This study provides essential insights into the complex flow phenomena and advances the understanding of unsteady flow behaviour in pump-turbines.</description>

      <title>Libby-Fox perturbations and the analytic adjoint solution for laminar viscous flow along a flat plate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16718v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties of the solution to the adjoint two-dimensional boundary layer equations on a flat plate are investigated from the viewpoint of Libby-Fox theory that describes the algebraic perturbations to the Blasius boundary layer. The adjoint solution is obtained from the Green's function of the perturbation equation as a sum over the infinite perturbation modes of the Blasius solution. The analysis of the solution allows us to obtain constraints on the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. The extension of the analysis to the case with non-zero pressure gradient, corresponding to the Falkner-Skan solution, is also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamically consistent large-eddy simulation models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Filtered budgets for anelastic turbulence and a general expression of the turbulent sensible heat flux are derived for a multicomponent fluid with an arbitrary equation of state. A family of subgrid-scale closures is then found under the constraint of consistency with (i) the first and second laws of thermodynamics and (ii) invariance with respect to irrelevant thermodynamic constants. A similar family of fully compressible models is also constructed heuristically. These models predict turbulent kinetic energy, assume down-gradient closures for three-dimensional turbulent fluxes and impose certain relationships between the closures for the turbulent fluxes of heat, matter, entropy, and the work of buoyancy forces.
  A key finding is the explicit derivation of the local rate of entropy production in the filtered model. Positive entropy production is guaranteed whenever the turbulent diffusions of heat and composition are positive and no cross-diffusion occurs. Cross-diffusivities are admissible provided their magnitude is within the bounds of an explicit criterion. The filtered model is invariant under a wider class of transformations than the unfiltered model. Furthermore, in the special case of a single turbulent diffusivity, an arbitrary conservative variable can be prognosed while ignoring its precise relationship to entropy.
  These findings show that down-gradient closures are consistent with the first and second law of thermodynamics even when they lead to a turbulent sensible heat flux up the temperature gradient. Indeed, while molecular conduction/diffusion is spontaneous and energy-conserving, stratified turbulent mixing is driven by mechanical turbulence and enabled by the consumption of turbulent kinetic energy.</description>

      <title>Negative Pressure and Cavitation Dynamics in Plant-like Structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that a solid (e.g. wood or rubber) can be put under tensile stress by pulling on it. Once a critical stress is overcome, the solid breaks, leaving an empty space. Similarly, due to internal cohesion, a liquid can withstand tension (i.e. negative pressure), up to a critical point where a large bubble spontaneously forms, releasing the tension and leaving a void (the bubble). This process is known as cavitation. While water at negative pressure is metastable, such a state can be long-lived. In fact, water under tension is found routinely in the plant kingdom, as a direct effect of dehydration, e.g. by evaporation. In this chapter, we provide a brief overview of occurrences of water stress and cavitation in plants, then use a simple thermodynamic and fluid mechanical framework to describe the basic physics of water stress and cavitation. We focus specifically on situations close to those in plants, that is water at negative pressure nested within a structure that is solid, but porous and potentially deformable. We also discuss insights from these simple models as well as from experiments with artificial structures mimicking some essential aspects of the structures found within plants.</description>

      <title>Non-invasive imaging of solute redistribution below evaporating surfaces using 23Na-MRI</title>

Abstract: Evaporation from porous media is a key phenomenon in the terrestrial environment and is linked to accumulation of solutes at or near the evaporative surface. The current study aims at improved understanding of solute accumulation near evaporating surfaces. Analytical and numerical modelling studies have suggested the development of local instabilities due to density differences during evaporation in case of saturated porous media with high permeability. These instabilities lead to density-driven downward flow through fingering, and thus a redistribution of solutes. To experimentally investigate this, we performed evaporation experiments on two types of porous media (F36 and W3) with intrinsic permeabilities that differed by two orders of magnitude. Using magnetic resonance imaging (23Na-MRI), we monitored the development of solute accumulation and subsequent redistribution during evaporation with a continuous supply of water at the bottom of the samples. Significant differences between the Na enrichment patterns were observed for the two porous media. The F36 sample showed an initial enrichment at the surface within the first hour, but soon after a downwards moving plume developed that redistributed NaCl back into the column. Average depth profiles of Na concentrations showed that the surface concentration reached only 2.5 M, well below the solubility limit. In contrast, the W3 sample with lower permeability showed enrichment in a shallow near-surface zone where a concentration of over 6 M was reached. Comparison of experimental results with numerical simulations using DuMux showed qualitative agreement between measured and modelled solute concentrations. This study experimentally confirms the importance of density-driven redistribution of solutes in case of saturated porous media, which has implications for predicting evaporation rates and the time to the start of salt crust formation.</description>

      <title>Slow uniform flow of a rarefied gas past an infinitely thin circular disk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical problem of steady rarefied gas flow past an infinitely thin circular disk is revisited, with particular emphasis on the gas behavior near the disk edge. The uniform flow is assumed to be perpendicular to the disk surface. An integral equation for the velocity distribution function, derived from the linearized Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) model of the Boltzmann equation and subject to diffuse reflection boundary conditions, is solved numerically. The numerical method fully accounts for the discontinuity in the velocity distribution function that arises due to the presence of the edge. It is found that a kinetic boundary layer forms near the disk edge, extending over several mean free paths, and that its magnitude scales as $\mathrm{Kn}^{1/2}$ as the Knudsen number $\mathrm{Kn}$ (defined with respect to the disk radius) tends to zero. A thermal polarization effect, previously studied for spherical geometries, is also observed in the disk case, with a more pronounced manifestation near the edge that exhibits the same $\mathrm{Kn}^{1/2}$ scaling. The drag force acting on the disk is computed over a wide range of Knudsen numbers and shows good agreement with existing results for a hard-sphere gas and in the near-free-molecular regime.</description>

      <title>Studying propagating turbulent structures in the near wake of a sphere using Hilbert proper orthogonal decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Turbulent flows, despite their apparent randomness, exhibit coherent structures that underpin their dynamics. Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) has been widely used to extract these structures from experimental data. While periodic features like vortex shedding can be identified using POD mode pairs when periodicity dominates the flow, detecting such structures in complex flows is more challenging. The Hilbert proper orthogonal decomposition (HPOD) addresses this by applying POD to the analytic signal of the turbulent fluctuations, yielding complex modes with a $90^\circ$ phase shift between the real and imaginary components. These modes capture propagating structures effectively but introduce filtering artefacts from the Hilbert transform that is used to derive the analytic signal. The current work investigates the relationship between the modes of the POD and those of the HPOD on the velocity fluctuations in the wake of a sphere. By comparing their outputs, POD mode pairs that correspond to the same propagating structures revealed by HPOD are identified. Furthermore, this study explored whether computing the analytic signal of the POD modes can replicate the HPOD modes, offering a more computationally efficient method for determining the pairs of POD modes that represent propagating structures. The results show that the pairs of POD modes identified by the HPOD can be more efficiently determined using the Hilbert transform directly on the POD modes. This method enhances the interpretive power of POD, enabling more detailed analysis of turbulent dynamics without introducing the filtering from the Hilbert transform.</description>

      <title>Toward a unified data-driven turbulence model through multi-objective learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Turbulence remains one of the last unresolved problems of classical physics and a major bottleneck to accurate flow prediction in climate, aerospace, and energy systems. Industrial simulations therefore rely on averaged representations of turbulence, which often struggle to predict flows governed by multiple interacting mechanisms. We present a unified, data-driven turbulence modeling framework designed to learn robustly from sparse, indirect observations across diverse flow regimes. The framework embeds physical consistency into a flexible, frame-invariant closure, automatically selects representative training cases based on similarity of flow-feature distributions, and learns a single, unified model through a multi-objective ensemble strategy that balances competing objectives across flows and quantities of interest. The resulting unified foundation model adapts seamlessly across regimes without manual intervention. It outperforms existing turbulence models across a broad spectrum of canonical flows and maintains improved performance in complex three-dimensional configurations of industrial relevance, including a generic car and a gas turbine diffuser. When application-specific accuracy is required, the framework further enables specialist models through additive fine-tuning on targeted flow datasets. The results demonstrate the feasibility of a deployable and generalized turbulence modeling approach that unifies multiple flow mechanisms within a single architecture for a broad range of natural and industrial flows.</description>

      <title>The broken link between space and time in elastic turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Elastic turbulence (ET), observed in flows of sufficiently elastic polymer solution at small inertia, is characterized by chaotic motions and power-law scaling of energy spectrum ($E$) in both wavenumber ($k$) and frequency ($\omega$): $E(k) \sim k^{-\alpha}$ and $E(\omega) \sim \omega^{-\beta}$. Experiments of ET have obtained a vast range of values for the exponent $\beta$. In inertial turbulence, Taylor's frozen-flow hypothesis implies $\alpha = \beta$, i.e., spatial and temporal scales are linearly related to each other. In contrast, from high-resolution simulation in three different setups, a tri-periodic box, a channel, and a planar jet, we show that in ET $\alpha \approx 4$ while $\beta$ varies significantly. Our analysis shows that in general Taylor's hypothesis does not hold in ET as there is no universal relation, linear or otherwise, between space and time. We thus clear the confusion of the different scaling exponents found in ET, and focus the attention of future research on understanding $\alpha$. Our analysis also implies that waves-like dynamics with a linear dispersion relation (e.g., Alfv\'en waves) can not play a role in determining the scaling behavior of ET. The techniques introduced here can be useful for studying smooth chaotic flows in general, e.g., active turbulence.</description>

      <title>Water wave scattering by a surface-mounted rectangular anisotropic elastic plate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17872v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of water wave scattering by a rectangular anisotropic elastic plate mounted on the ocean surface, with either free, clamped or simply-supported edges. The problem is obtained as an expansion over the dry modes of the elastic plate, which are computed using a Rayleigh--Ritz method. In turn, the component diffraction and radiation problems are solved by formulating a boundary integral equation and solving numerically using a constant panel method. The results are presented to highlight the resonant responses of the plate under different forcing scenarios. In particular, we illustrate how the excitation of certain modes can be forbidden due to symmetry.</description>

      <title>Information Propagation in Predator-Prey Dynamics of Turbulent Plasma</title>

Abstract: Magnetically confined fusion plasmas exhibit predator-prey-like cyclic oscillations through the self-regulating interaction between drift-wave turbulence and zonal flow. To elucidate the detailed mechanism and causality underlying this phenomenon, we construct a simple stochastic predator-prey model that incorporates intrinsic fluctuations and analyze its statistical properties from an information-theoretic perspective. We first show that the model exhibits persistent fluctuating cyclic oscillations called quasi-cycles due to amplification of intrinsic noise. This result suggests the possibility that the previously observed periodic oscillations in a toroidal plasma are not limit cycles but quasi-cycles, and that such quasi-cycles may be widely observed under various conditions. For this model, we further prove that information of the zonal flow is propagated to turbulence. This result suggests that turbulence behavior may be predictable to a certain extent based on zonal flow characteristics.</description>

      <title>Hysteresis in the freeze-thaw cycle of emulsions and suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Freeze-thaw cycles can be regularly observed in nature in water and are essential in industry and science. Objects present in the medium will interact with either an advancing solidification front during freezing or a retracting solidification front, i.e., an advancing melting front, during thawing. It is well known that objects show complex behaviours when interacting with the advancing solidification front, but the extent to which they are displaced during the retraction of the solid-liquid interface is less well understood. To study potential hysteresis effects during freeze-thaw cycles, we exploit experimental model systems of oil-in-water emulsions and polystyrene (PS) particle suspensions, in which a water-ice solidification front advances and retracts over an individual immiscible (and deformable) oil droplet or over a solid PS particle. We record several interesting hysteresis effects, resulting in non-zero relative displacements of the objects between freezing and thawing. PS particles tend to migrate further and further away from their initial position, whereas oil droplets tend to return to their starting positions during thawing. We rationalize our experimental findings by comparing them to our prior theoretical model of Meijer, Bertin &amp; Lohse, Phys. Rev. Fluids (2025), yielding a qualitatively good agreement. Additionally, we look into the reversibility of how the droplet deforms and re-shapes throughout one freeze-thaw cycle, which will turn out to be remarkably robust.</description>

      <title>Pre-Generating Multi-Difficulty PDE Data for Few-Shot Neural PDE Solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A key aspect of learned partial differential equation (PDE) solvers is that the main cost often comes from generating training data with classical solvers rather than learning the model itself. Another is that there are clear axes of difficulty--e.g., more complex geometries and higher Reynolds numbers--along which problems become (1) harder for classical solvers and thus (2) more likely to benefit from neural speedups. Towards addressing this chicken-and-egg challenge, we study difficulty transfer on 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes, systematically varying task complexity along geometry (number and placement of obstacles), physics (Reynolds number), and their combination. Similar to how it is possible to spend compute to pre-train foundation models and improve their performance on downstream tasks, we find that by classically solving (analogously pre-generating) many low and medium difficulty examples and including them in the training set, it is possible to learn high-difficulty physics from far fewer samples. Furthermore, we show that by combining low and high difficulty data, we can spend 8.9x less compute on pre-generating a dataset to achieve the same error as using only high difficulty examples. Our results highlight that how we allocate classical-solver compute across difficulty levels is as important as how much we allocate overall, and suggest substantial gains from principled curation of pre-generated PDE data for neural solvers.
