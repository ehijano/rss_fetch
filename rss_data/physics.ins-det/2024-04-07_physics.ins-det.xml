      <title>4D Track Reconstruction on Free-Streaming Data at PANDA at FAIR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new generation of experiments is being developed, where the challenge of separating rare signal processes from background at high intensities requires a change of trigger paradigm. At the future PANDA experiment at FAIR, hardware triggers will be abandoned and instead a purely software-based system will be used. This requires novel reconstruction methods with the ability to process data from many events simultaneously.
  A 4D tracking algorithm based on the cellular automaton has been developed which will utilize the timing information from detector signals. Simulation studies have been performed to test its performance on the foreseen free-streaming data from the PANDA detector. For this purpose, a quality assurance procedure for tracking on free-streaming data was implemented in the PANDA software. The studies show that at higher interaction rates, 4D tracking performs better than the 3D algorithm in terms of efficiency, 84% compared to 77%. The fake track suppression is also greatly improved, compared to the 3D tracking with roughly a 50% decrease in the ghost rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The High Luminosity LHC phase includes an upgrade to the muon stations for the CMS Experiment. CMS trigger and muon identification performance will be crucial, and it is, therefore, necessary to install new GEM stations to extend acceptance in the high-{\eta} region. An explanation of the quality control test and an update on the status of production will be provided.</description>

      <title>Pulse Shape Discrimination in JSNS$^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JSNS$^2$ (J-PARC Sterile Neutrino Search at J-PARC Spallation Neutron Source) is an experiment that is searching for sterile neutrinos via the observation of $\bar{\nu}_{\mu} \rightarrow \bar{\nu}_e$ appearance oscillations using neutrinos with muon decay-at-rest. For this search, rejecting cosmic-ray-induced neutron events by Pulse Shape Discrimination (PSD) is essential because the JSNS$^2$ detector is located above ground, on the third floor of the building. We have achieved 95$\%$ rejection of neutron events while keeping 90$\%$ of signal, electron-like events using a data driven likelihood method.</description>

      <title>Muon Track Reconstruction in the Scintillator Phase of SNO+</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large depth of the SNO+ experiment (2070 m, 6010 m.w.e.) means that only a few muons per day pass through the detector. However, their high energy causes muon induced backgrounds which can affect multiple physics analyses. Reconstructing the muon track would allow for improved rejection for these induced backgrounds. Currently there is no muon tracker for the scintillator phase of SNO+. This poster presents a novel method of muon track reconstruction by using the high photon sampling from muons and the assumption that each PMT first registers a hit from a photon that takes the fastest possible path from the muon entry point to the PMT.</description>

      <title>Muon beamtest results of high-density glass scintillator tiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To achieve the physics goal of precisely measure the Higgs, Z, W bosons and the top quark, future electron-positron colliders require that their detector system has excellent jet energy resolution. One feasible technical option is the high granular calorimetery based on the particle flow algorithm (PFA). A new high-granularity hadronic calorimeter with glass scintillator tiles (GSHCAL) has been proposed, which focus on the significant improvement of hadronic energy resolution with a notable increase of the energy sampling fraction by using high-density glass scintillator tiles. The minimum ionizing particle (MIP) response of a glass scintillator tile is crucial to the hadronic calorimeter, so a dedicated beamtest setup was developed for testing the first batch of large-size glass scintillators. The maximum MIP response of the first batch of glass scintillator tiles can reach up to 107 p.e./MIP, which essentially meets the design requirements of the CEPC GSHCAL. An optical simulation model of a single glass scintillator tile has been established, and the simulation results are consistent with the beamtest results.</description>

      <title>Beam test of a baseline vertex detector prototype for CEPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC) has been proposed to enable more thorough and precise measurements of the properties of Higgs, W, and Z bosons, as well as to search for new physics. In response to the stringent performance requirements of the vertex detector for the CEPC, a baseline vertex detector prototype was tested and characterized for the first time using a 6 GeV electron beam at DESY II Test Beam Line 21. The baseline vertex detector prototype is designed with a cylindrical barrel structure that contains six double-sided detector modules (ladders). Each side of the ladder includes TaichuPix-3 sensors based on Monolithic Active Pixel Sensor (MAPS) technology, a flexible printed circuit, and a carbon fiber support structure. Additionally, the readout electronics and the Data Acquisition system were also examined during this beam test. The performance of the prototype was evaluated using an electron beam that passed through six ladders in a perpendicular direction. The offline data analysis indicates a spatial resolution of about 5 um, with detection efficiency exceeding 99 % and an impact parameter resolution of about 5.1 um. These promising results from this baseline vertex detector prototype mark a significant step toward realizing the optimal vertex detector for the CEPC.</description>

      <title>Upgrade of NaI(Tl) crystal encapsulation for the NEON experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Neutrino Elastic-scattering Observation with NaI(Tl) experiment (NEON) aims to detect coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering~(CE$\nu$NS) in a NaI(Tl) crystal using reactor anti-electron neutrinos at the Hanbit nuclear power plant complex. A total of 13.3 kg of NaI(Tl) crystals were initially installed in December 2020 at the tendon gallery, 23.7$\pm$0.3\,m away from the reactor core, which operates at a thermal power of 2.8\,GW. Initial engineering operation was performed from May 2021 to March 2022 and observed unexpected photomultiplier-induced noise and a decreased light yield that were induced by leakage of liquid scintillator into the detector due to weakness of detector encapsulation. We upgraded the detector encapsulation design to prevent leakage of the liquid scintillator. Meanwhile two small size detectors were replaced with large size detectors returning a total mass of 16.7\,kg. With this new design implementation, the detector system has been operating stably since April 2022 for over a year without detector gain drop. In this paper, we present an improved crystal encapsulation design and stability of the NEON experiment.</description>

      <title>CYG$\nu$S: Detecting solar neutrinos with directional gas time projection chambers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: CYGNUS is a proposed global network of large-scale gas time projection chambers (TPCs) with the capability of directionally detecting nuclear and electron recoils at $\gtrsim$keV energies. The primary focus of CYGNUS so far has been the detection of dark matter, with directional sensitivity providing a means of circumventing the so-called neutrino fog. However, the excellent background rejection and electron/nuclear recoil discrimination provided by directionality could turn the solar neutrino background into an interesting signal in its own right. For example, directionality would facilitate the simultaneous spectroscopy of multiple different flux sources. Here, we evaluate the possibility of measuring solar neutrinos using the same network of gas TPCs built from $10$ m$^3$-scale modules operating under conditions that enable simultaneous sensitivity to both dark matter and neutrinos. We focus in particular on electron recoils, which provide access to low-energy neutrino fluxes like $pp$, $pep$, $^7$Be, and CNO. An appreciable event rate is already detectable in experiments consisting of a single $10$ m$^3$ module, assuming standard fill gases such as CF$_4$ mixed with helium at atmospheric pressure. With total volumes around 1000 m$^3$ or higher, the TPC network could be complementary to dedicated neutrino observatories, whilst entering the dark-matter neutrino fog via the nuclear recoil channel. We evaluate the required directional performance and background conditions to observe, discriminate, and perform spectroscopy on neutrino events. We find that, under reasonable projections for planned technology that will enable 10--30-degree angular resolution and $\sim 10$\% fractional energy resolution, CYGNUS could be a competitive directional neutrino experiment.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of the performance of the event reconstruction algorithms in the JSNS$^2$ experiment using a $^{252}$Cf calibration source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: JSNS$^2$ searches for short baseline neutrino oscillations with a baseline of 24~meters and a target of 17~tonnes of the Gd-loaded liquid scintillator. The correct algorithm on the event reconstruction of events, which determines the position and energy of neutrino interactions in the detector, are essential for the physics analysis of the data from the experiment. Therefore, the performance of the event reconstruction is carefully checked with calibrations using $^{252}$Cf source. This manuscript describes the methodology and the performance of the event reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Unfolding environmental $\gamma$ flux spectrum with portable CZT detector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Environmental $\gamma$-rays constitute a crucial source of background in various nuclear, particle and quantum physics experiments. To evaluate the flux rate and the spectrum of $\gamma$ background, we have developed a novel and straightforward approach to reconstruct the environmental $\gamma$ flux spectrum by applying a portable CZT $\gamma$ detector and iterative Bayesian unfolding, which possesses excellent transferability for broader applications. In this paper, the calibration and GEANT4 Monte-Carlo modeling of the CZT detector, the unfolding procedure as well as the uncertainty estimation are demonstrated in detail. The reconstructed spectrum reveals an environmental $\gamma$ flux intensity of $3.3\pm 0.9\times 10^{7}$~ (m$^2\cdot$sr$\cdot$hour)$^{-1}$ ranging from 73 to 3033~keV, along with characteristic peaks primarily arising from $^{232}$Th series, $^{238}$U series and $^{40}$K. We also give an instance of background rate evaluation with the unfolded spectrum for validation of the approach.</description>

      <title>The CCube reconstruction algorithm for the SoLid experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The SoLid experiment is a very-short-baseline experiment aimed at searching for nuclear reactor-produced active to sterile antineutrino oscillations. The detection principle is based on the pairing of two types of solid scintillators: polyvinyl toluene and $^6$LiF:ZnS(Ag), which is a new technology used in this field of Physics. In addition to good neutron-gamma discrimination, this setup allows the detector to be highly segmented (the basic detection unit is a 5 cm side cube). High segmentation provides numerous advantages, including the precise location of Inverse Beta Decay (IBD) products, the derivation of the considerate antineutrino energy estimator, and a powerful background reduction tool based on the topological signature of the signal. Finally, the system is read out by a network of wavelength-shifting fibres coupled to a photodetector (MPPC). This paper describes the design of the reconstruction algorithm that allows maximum use of the granularity of the detector. The goal of the algorithm is to convert the output of the optical-fibre readout to the list of the detection units from which it originated. This paper provides a performance comparison for three methods and concludes with a choice of the baseline approach for the experiment.</description>
