      <title>Powers of Coxeter elements with unbounded reflection length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For Coxeter groups with sufficiently large braid relations, we prove that the sequence of powers of a Coxeter element has unbounded reflection length. We establish a connection between the reflection length functions on arbitrary Coxeter groups and the reflection length functions on universal Coxeter groups of the same rank through the solution to the word problem for Coxeter groups. For Coxeter groups corresponding to a Coxeter matrix with the same entry everywhere except the diagonal, upper bounds for the reflection length of the powers of Coxeter elements are established.</description>

      <title>Amalgamating inverse semigroups over ample semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A semigroup amalgam (S; T1, T2) is known to be non-embeddable if T1 and T2 are both groups (completely regular semigroups, Clifford semigroups) but S is not such. We prove some non-embeddability conditions for semigroup amalgams (S; T1, T2) in which T1 and T2 are inverse semigroups but S is not such. We also introduce some sufficient conditions that make the inverse hulls of the copies of S in T1 and T2 isomorphic; making, in turn, the amalgam (S; T1, T2) weakly embeddable.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic properties of infinitesimal characters and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by classical results by Benoist, we introduce and study natural objects associated to an integrable tangent vector to the character variety $\mathfrak X(\Gamma,\mathsf G)$ of a semi-group $\Gamma$, with values on a semi-simple real algebraic group $\mathsf G$ of the non-compact type. We obtain non-empty interior of the cone of Jordan variations and, when $\mathsf G$ is split and Benoist's limit cone is sparse, we obtain double-density results associated to these variations, giving in particular non-empty interior of the set of length-normalized variations. We then apply the developed techniques to study pressure forms on the space of Anosov representations, in particular to higher-rank Teichm\"uller spaces. Among other things we exhibit an explicit functional $\varphi\in\mathfrak a^*$ whose pressure form is compatible with Goldman's symplectic form at the Fuchsian points of the Hitchin component. We finally exhibit a Diophantine equation that governs the degeneration of the Hausdorff dimension of higher-quasi-circles.</description>

      <title>A normal version of Brauer's height zero conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The celebrated It\^o-Michler theorem asserts that a prime $p$ does not divide the degree of any irreducible character of a finite group $G$ if and only if $G$ has a normal and abelian Sylow $p$-subgroup. The principal block case of the recently-proven Brauer's height zero conjecture isolates the abelian part in the It\^o-Michler theorem. In this paper, we show that the normal part can also be isolated in a similar way. This is a consequence of work on a strong form of the so-called Brauer's height zero conjecture for two primes of Malle and Navarro. Using our techniques, we also provide an alternate proof of this conjecture.</description>

      <title>$\sigma$-properties of finite groups in polynomial time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $H, K$ be subgroups of the permutation group $G$ of degree $n$ with $K\trianglelefteq G$ and $\sigma$ be a partition of the set of all different prime divisors of $|G/K|$. We prove that in polynomial time (in $n$) one can check $G/K$ for $\sigma$-nilpotency and $\sigma$-solubility; $H/K$ for $\sigma$-subnormality and $\sigma$-$p$-permutability in $G/K$. Moreover one can find the least partition $\sigma$ of $\pi(G/K)$ for which $G/K$ is $\sigma$-nilpotent. Also one can find the least partition $\sigma$ of $\pi(G/K)$ for which $H/K$ is $\sigma$-$p$-permutable in $G/K$.</description>

      <title>On identities in connected topological groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1957, Nemytskii proved the following fact: if in a locally compact or in an Abelian connected group there is a neighborhood of the identity in which some identity holds, then it holds in the entire group. The following question was also posed there: Let G be a connected topological group. In some neighborhood of the identity of the group G the identity $x^3=1$ holds. Is it true that then the identity $x^3=1$ holds in the entire group $G$? The same question is posed for the identity $gx^2 = x^2g$, where $g$ is a fixed element of the group. Platonov formulated the following generalized formulation of the Mytselsky problem: for a topological connected group, is it true that if the identity holds in a neighborhood of the identity, then the identity holds everywhere? In this paper, a negative answer to Platonov's question is given, the following theorem is proven: if $n &gt; 1010$ is odd, then there exists a connected topological group in which the identity $x^n=1$ holds in some neighborhood of unity, but not in the entire group.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Calculus for the Theta Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the stochastic calculus for the theta process. The theta process is a stochastic process of number theoretical origin arising as a scaling limit of quadratic Weyl sums. It has several properties in common with Brownian motion such as its H\"older regularity, uncorrelated increments and quadratic variation. However, crucially, we show that the theta process is not a semimartingale, making It\^o calculus techniques inapplicable. Instead, we use the celebrated rough paths theory to develop the stochastic calculus for the theta process. We do so by constructing the iterated integrals - the ``rough path" - above the theta process. Rough paths theory takes a signal and its iterated integrals and produces a vast and robust theory of stochastic differential equations. In addition, the rough path we construct can be described in terms of higher rank theta sums.</description>

      <title>The class and dynamics of $\alpha$-balanced Polish groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For each ordinal $\alpha&lt;\omega_1$, we introduce the class of $\alpha$-balanced Polish groups. These classes form a hierarchy that completely stratifies the space between the class of Polish groups admitting a two-side-invariant metric (TSI) and the class of Polish groups admitting a complete left-invariant metric (CLI). We establish various closure properties, provide connections to model theory, and we develop a boundedness principle for CLI groups by showing that $\alpha$-balancedness is an initial segment of a regular coanalytic rank.
  In the spirit of Hjorth's turbulence theory we also introduce "generic $\alpha$-unbalancedness": a new dynamical condition for Polish $G$-spaces which serves as an obstruction to classification by actions of $\alpha$-balanced Polish groups. We use this to provide, for each $\alpha&lt;\omega_1$, an action of an $\alpha$-balanced Polish group whose orbit equivalence relation is strongly generically ergodic against actions of any $\beta$-balanced Polish group with $\beta&lt;\alpha$.</description>

      <title>Conjugacy in Semigroups: the Partition and Brauer Diagram Monoids, Conjugacy Growth, and Partial Inner Automorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.04252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The conjugacy relation plays an important role in group theory. If $a$ and $b$ are elements of a group~$G$, $a$ is conjugate to $b$ if $g^{-1}ag=b$ for some $g\in G$. Group conjugacy extends to inverse semigroups in a natural way: for $a$ and $b$ in an inverse semigroup $S$, $a$ is conjugate to $b$ if $g^{-1}ag=b$ and $gbg^{-1}=a$ for some $g\in S$. The fourth author has recently defined a conjugacy for an arbitrary semigroup $S$ that coincides with inverse semigroup conjugacy if $S$ is an inverse semigroup, and is included in all existing semigroup conjugacy relations. We will call it the \emph{natural conjugacy} for semigroups, and denote it by $\cfn$.
  The first purpose of this paper is to study $\cfn$ in various contexts, chiefly the partition monoid and some of its friends (Brauer and partial Brauer monoids), and also to characterize $\cfn$ in several important classes of semigroups, transformation semigroups and in the polycyclic monoids.
  The second purpose of this paper is to show how the notion of natural conjugacy leads to the definition of the inverse semigroup of partial automorphisms of an arbitrary semigroup (in the same way conjugation in groups induces the notion of inner automorphism). Attached to the majority of mathematical objects there is a notion of {\em morphism} and hence notions of automorphism and endomorphism that often encode relevant information about the original object. Our approach allows to attach to the endomorphisms of a mathematical object an inverse semigroup that hopefully will bring the deep results on inverse semigroups to help the study of the original object.
  Finally we extend the notion of conjugacy growth from groups to semigroups and give closed formulas for the conjugacy growth series of the polycyclic monoid, for $\cfn$ and two other semigroup conjugacies.
  The paper ends with some open problems.</description>

      <title>Classification of the conjugacy classes of $\widetilde{\mathrm{SL}}(2,\mathbb{R})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.08617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we classify the conjugacy classes of $\widetilde{\mathrm{SL}}_2(\mathbb{R})$, the universal covering group of $\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{R})$. For any non-central element $\alpha \in \widetilde{\mathrm{SL}}_2(\mathbb{R})$, we show that its conjugacy class may be determined by three invariants:
  (i) Trace: the trace (valued in the set of positive real numbers $\mathbb{R}_{+}$) of its image $\overline{\alpha}$ in $\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{R})$;
  (ii) Direction type: the sign behavior of the induced self-homeomorphism of $\mathbb{R}$ determined by the lifting $\widetilde{\mathrm{SL}}_2(\mathbb{R}) \curvearrowright \mathbb{R}$ of the action $\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{R}) \curvearrowright \mathbb{S}^{1}$;
  (iii) The function $\ell^{\sharp}$: a conjugacy invariant length function introduced by S. Mochizuki [Res. Math. Sci. 3 (2016), 3:6].</description>

      <title>Homology of matching complexes and representations of symmetric groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the homology of the matching complex $M(\Gamma)$, where $\Gamma$ is the complete hypergraph on $n\geq 2$ vertices, and analyse the $S_n$-representations carried by this homology. These results are achieved using standard techniques in combinatorial topology, such as the theory of shellings. We then broaden the scope to the larger class of fibre-closed families of simplicial complexes and consider these through the lens of representation stability. This allows us to prove a number of results of an asymptotic nature, such as an analysis of the growth of Betti numbers and the kinds of irreducible $S_n$-representations that appear.</description>

      <title>On a bijection between a finite group to a non-cyclic group with divisibility of element orders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13247v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a finite group $G$ of order $n$ with a prime divisor $p$. In this article, we establish, among other results, that if the Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$ is neither cyclic nor generalized quaternion, then there exists a bijection $f$ from $G$ onto the abelian group $C_{\frac{n}{p}}\times C_p$ such that for every element $x$ in $G$, the order of $x$ divides the order of $f(x)$. This resolves Question 1.5 posed in [15]. As application of our results, we show that the group with the third largest value of the sum of element orders in the set of all finite groups of order $n$ is a solvable $p$-nilpotent group where $p$ is the smallest prime divisor of $n$ such that the Sylow $p$-subgroups are not cyclic.</description>

Abstract: We prove that every locally compact second countable group $G$ arises as the outer automorphism group Out $M$ of a II$_1$ factor, which was so far only known for totally disconnected groups, compact groups and a few isolated examples. We obtain this result by proving that every locally compact second countable group is a centralizer group, a class of Polish groups that arise naturally in ergodic theory and that may all be realized as Out $M$.</description>

Abstract: We classify in terms of Hopf-type properties mapping tori of residually finite Poincar\'e Duality groups with non-zero Euler characteristic. This generalises and gives a new proof of the analogous classification for fibered 3-manifolds. Various applications are given. In particular, we deduce that rigidity results for Gromov hyperbolic groups hold for the above mapping tori with trivial center.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2104.12318v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the structure of braid graphs in simply-laced Coxeter systems. We prove that every reduced expression has a unique factorization as a product of so-called links, which in turn induces a decomposition of the braid graph into a box product of the braid graphs for each link factor. When the Coxeter graph has no three-cycles, we use the decomposition to prove that braid graphs are partial cubes, i.e., can be isometrically embedded into a hypercube. For a special class of links, called Fibonacci links, we prove that the corresponding braid graphs are Fibonacci cubes.</description>

Abstract: Let $n$ be a positive integer and $q$ a prime power. We prove that a refined version of Brou\'{e}'s abelian defect group conjecture holds for unipotent $\ell$-blocks of ${\rm GL}_n(q)$, where $\ell\nmid q$. We also give a sufficient condition on general $\ell$-blocks of ${\rm GL}_n(q)$ to satisfy the refined abelian defect group conjecture. We explain by an example that this sufficient condition does not hold in general.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Renyi Entropies of Random Walks on Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15827v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce asymptotic R\'enyi entropies as a parameterized family of invariants for random walks on groups. These invariants interpolate between various well-studied properties of the random walk, including the growth rate of the group, the Shannon entropy, and the spectral radius. They furthermore offer large deviation counterparts of the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman Theorem. We prove some basic properties of asymptotic R\'enyi entropies that apply to all groups, and discuss their analyticity and positivity for the free group and lamplighter groups.</description>

      <title>New simple solutions of the Yang--Baxter equation and their permutation groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12904v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new class of indecomposable, irretractable, involutive, non-degenerate set-theoretic solutions of the Yang--Baxter equation is constructed. This class complements the class of such solutions constructed in \cite{CO22} and together they generalize the class of solutions described in \cite[Theorem 4.7{CO21}. Necessary and sufficient conditions are found in order that these new solutions are simple. For a rich subclass of these solutions the structure of their permutation groups, considered as left braces, is determined. In particular, these results answer a question stated in \cite{CO21}. In the finite case, all these solutions have square cardinality. A new class of finite simple solutions of non-square cardinality such that their permutation groups are simple left braces is also constructed.</description>
