      <title>On cusp holonomies in strictly convex projective geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a complete characterization of the holonomies of strictly convex cusps and of round cusps in convex projective geometry. We build families of generalized cusps of non-maximal rank associated to each strictly convex or round cusp. We also extend Ballas-Cooper-Leitner's definition of generalized cusp to allow for virtually solvable fundamental group, and we produce the first such example with non-virtually nilpotent fundamental group.
  Along with a companion paper, this allows to build strictly convex cusps and generalized cusps whose fundamental group is any finitely generated virtually nilpotent group. This also has interesting consequences for the theory of relatively Anosov representations.</description>

      <title>Expansion joints in hyperbolic manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deformations of hyperbolic manifolds through metrics with cone singularities along closed loops were first studied by Thurston as continuous realisations of Dehn fillings. Instead of gluing singular solid tori into rank $2$ cusps, we glue singular $2$-handles into rank $1$ cusps. Our method is to find substructures within which the hyperbolic metric can be `fractured' in a controlled way by direct manipulation of a fundamental polyhedron, changing the cone angle around an ideal arc to interpolate between cusped hyperbolic manifolds and hyperbolic manifolds with conformal surfaces on the visual boundary. As an application, we use cone deformations of a family of arithmetic manifolds derived from the Borromean rings to show that the upper unknotting tunnels of highly twisted $2$-bridge links can be drilled out by cone deformations. We also show that our structures arise naturally in fully augmented links, providing a large family of examples.</description>

      <title>Universal $L^2$-torsion and sutured decomposition for 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an admissible 3-manifold $M$ and a cohomology class $\phi\in H^1(M;\mathbb R)$, we prove that the universal $L^2$-torsion of $M$ detects the fiberedness of $\phi$, except when $M$ is a closed graph manifold that admits no non-positively curved metric. We further extend this invariant to sutured 3-manifolds and derive a decomposition formula for taut sutured decompositions. Moreover, we show that a taut sutured manifold is a product if and only if its universal $L^2$-torsion is trivial. Our methods are based on a detailed study of the leading term map over Linnell's skew field. As an application, we apply the theory to homomorphisms between finitely generated free groups, which enables explicit computations of the invariant for sutured handlebodies.</description>

      <title>Lipschitz Geometry of Mixed Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the (ambient) bi-Lipschitz V-equivalence of two-variable mixed polynomials satisfying the Newton inner non-degeneracy condition. Concerning triviality, we show that ambient bi-Lipschitz V-triviality for families $\{f + \varepsilon \theta\}_{\varepsilon \in \mathbb{R}}$ is guaranteed when $f$ is semi-radially weighted homogeneous and the weighted radial degree of every monomial in $\theta$ is greater than the weighted radial degree associated with $f$. However, in the general case, we prove that it is not guaranteed, even though ambient topological V-triviality still holds.
  For the classification problem, we define two simple metric links and prove that they suffice to determine bi-Lipschitz V-equivalence within the class of mixed polynomials that are $\Gamma_{\rm inn}$-nice. A key outcome is that neither the Newton boundary $\Gamma(f)$ nor the C-face diagram $\Gamma_{\rm inn}$ constitutes an invariant of this equivalence for such mixed polynomials. To outcome this, we introduce new data extracted from the two face diagrams under consideration and prove that, under certain generic conditions, these data become fundamental invariants for the bi-Lipschitz equivalences. This provides a fundamental step toward a bi-Lipschitz classification of these mixed polynomials.</description>

      <title>On vertex-minimal simplicial maps to the sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For positive integers $n,d$, let $\lambda(n,d)$ be the minimal number of vertices of a triangulation of $n$-sphere which admits a degree $d$ simplicial map to the boundary of $(n+1)$-simplex. We show that $\lim_{d\to\infty}\frac{\lambda(n,d)}d=0$ for any $n\ge3$, disproving O. Musin's conjecture. Using similar idea, for any $C$ we construct a triangulation of $\mathbb{S}^n$, $n\ge3$, for which $\frac{f_j}{f_i}&gt;C$, for any $0\le i&lt;j\le n$ such that $i&lt;\lfloor\frac{n-1}2\rfloor$. All triangulations we obtain are isomorphic to boundaries of convex polytopes in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$.</description>

Abstract: We investigated singular points of translation surfaces under the linearly independent condition. In this paper, as completion, we investigate singular points of translation surfaces under the linearly dependent condition, using the theories of generalised framed surfaces and framed surfaces. We introduce the notion of translation generalised framed surfaces and investigate types of singular points that appear on translation generalised framed base surfaces.</description>

      <title>Milnor-type invariants for surface-links and cut-diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.14578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.14578v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize Milnor link invariants to all types of surface-links in $4$--space (possibly with boundary). This is achieved by using the notion of cut-diagram, which is a 2-dimensional generalization of Gauss diagrams, associated to surface-links. We define a notion of group for cut-diagrams, which generalizes the fundamental group of the complement, and we extract Milnor-type invariants from the successive nilpotent quotients of this group. We show that these are invariant under concordance. We give several concrete applications of the resulting Milnor concordance invariants for surface-links, comparing their relative strength with previously known concordance invariants, and providing realization results. We also obtain several classification results up to link-homotopy, as well as a criterion for a surface-link to be ribbon. The theory of cut-diagrams is also further investigated, heading towards a combinatorial approach to the study of surfaces in 4-space.</description>

      <title>A triple coproduct of curves and knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.13672v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a triple coproduct for knots on surfaces, providing a commutative framework that decomposes a single-component diagram into three components (Section 2). This construction is motivated by the interplay between intersection theory and the affine index polynomial, and extends these ideas to a three-component setting (Section 5). Building on Turaev's cobracket theory, we define an integer-valued invariant under stable equivalence by combining the coproduct with an intersection-theoretic function (Theorem 1). Unlike classical cobrackets, which often collapse distinct local configurations, our approach preserves combinatorial traces of smoothing choices, enabling fine-grained detection of local crossing patterns (Definition 4). In the symmetric tensor setting, Reidemeister invariance uniquely determines the relations in the word space (Equations (4), (5)) and canonically fixes smoothing weights, revealing an intrinsic simplicity behind the algebraic framework (Corollary 1). This uniqueness result positions our construction as the canonical commutative analogue of Turaev's non-commutative cobracket and clarifies its interpretation as a classical limit of skein quantization, extending the theoretical scope beyond previously known invariants (Section 6). Examples demonstrate substantial distinguishing power, separating an infinite sequence of knots arising from distinct smoothing choices and broadening the reach of existing invariants (Proposition 2).</description>

Abstract: This paper describes the geometry and topology of leaves of the isoperiodic foliation of the stratum $\Omega\mathcal{M}_1(1,1,-2)$. We prove that each leaf is a surface of infinite genus homeomorphic to the Loch Ness monster surface and supports a singular Euclidean structure whose singularities correspond to isoperiodic forms in the lower stratum $\Omega\mathcal{M}_1(2,-2)$. Along the way we also characterize the possible groups arising as the Veech group of a leaf and give a description of the large-scale conformal geometry of the wall-and-chamber decomposition of the leaves.</description>

Abstract: A pseudo-Anosov flow is said to have perfect fits if there are stable and unstable leaves that are asymptotic in the universal cover. We give an algorithm to decide, given a box decomposition of a pseudo-Anosov flow, if the flow has perfect fits. As a corollary, we obtain an algorithm to decide whether two flows without perfect fits are orbit equivalent.</description>

      <title>Functorial Free Group from Anosov Representations on Bundles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\rho: \Gamma \to G$ be an Anosov representation, with $\Gamma$ a word hyperbolic group and $G$ a semisimple Lie group. Previous works (Guichard--Wienhard, Kapovich--Leeb--Porti, and Carvajales--Stecker) constructed an open domain of discontinuity $\Omega_\rho \subset G/H$, where $H$ is a parabolic or symmetric subgroup. In this paper, we extend the properly discontinuous $\Gamma$-action via $\rho$ to the space of connections on the pullbacks of the tangent bundle over $\Omega_\rho$.
  When $\Omega_\rho$ is a complex curve, we show that the $\Gamma$-action is properly discontinuous on the union of Higgs bundle structures associated with the $(1,0)$ part of the complexified pullback bundles. We further construct a free abelian group $F^{ab}$ generated by these holomorphic line bundles and induce a topoogical structure on it, so that $\rho(\Gamma)$ acts properly discontinuously on $F^{ab} \setminus \{\mathrm{id}\}$. This free abelian group is well-defined up to isomorphism over the character variety of Zariski dense Anosov representations. Finally, we endow the space of Anosov representations with a categorical structure compatible with $\Omega_\rho$ and construct a natural functor to the category of abelian groups.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the detection rate of n-crossing alternating links by many standard link invariants decays exponentially in n, implying that they detect alternating links with probability zero. This phenomenon applies broadly, in particular to the Jones and HOMFLYPT polynomials and integral Khovanov homology. We also use a big-data approach to analyze knots and provide evidence that, for knots as well, these invariants exhibit the same asymptotic failure of detection.</description>

Abstract: A multiple group rack (MGR) is an algebraic system which is used to construct invariants of spatial surfaces, which are compact surfaces embedded in the $3$-sphere $S^{3}$. Seifert surfaces for links are spatial surfaces. In this paper, we present an infinitely many pairs of Seifert surfaces for each link, where each pair satisfies the following condtions: (i) their regular neighborhoods in $S^{3}$ are ambiently isotopic, (ii) their Seifert matrices are unimodularly congruent, and (iii) the two Seifert surfaces are not ambiently isotopic. In order to prove (iii), we distinguish the Seifert surfaces using the above invariants.</description>

Abstract: Let $H$ be a strongly irreducible Heegaard surface in a closed oriented Riemannian $3$-manifold. We prove that $H$ is either isotopic to a minimal surface of index at most one or isotopic to the boundary of a tubular neighborhood about a non-orientable minimal surface with a vertical handle attached. This confirms a long-standing conjecture of J. Pitts and J.H. Rubinstein.</description>

      <title>Khovanov homology and quantum error-correcting codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Error-correcting codes for quantum computing are crucial to address the fundamental problem of communication in the presence of noise and imperfections. Audoux used Khovanov homology to define families of quantum error-correcting codes with desirable properties. We explore Khovanov homology and some of its many extensions, namely reduced, annular, and $\mathfrak{sl}_3$ homology, to generate new families of quantum codes and to establish several properties about codes that arise in this way, such as behavior of distance under Reidemeister moves or connected sums.</description>

      <title>Multiplicative dimensional reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16342v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the multiplicative version of the dimensional reduction theorem in cohomological Donaldson--Thomas theory. More precisely, we show that the BPS cohomology associated with the loop stack of a $0$-shifted symplectic stack admits a description analogous to orbifold cohomology, even though our stacks are not necessarily Deligne--Mumford. As an application, we propose a new, purely two-dimensional formulation of the topological mirror symmetry conjecture for the moduli space of $G$-Higgs bundles, which in turn leads to a formulation of the conjecture for logarithmic $G$-Higgs bundles. We also investigate a twisted version of the multiplicative dimensional reduction, which applies, in particular, to the cohomological Donaldson--Thomas theory for $S^1$-bundles over compact oriented surfaces, and more generally to Seifert-fibred $3$-manifolds.</description>

      <title>On the Classification of $S^3$-Bundles over $\mathbb{C}P^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a classification of the total spaces of $S^3$-bundles over $\mathbb{C}P^2$ up to orientation-preserving homotopy equivalence. Our approach proceeds in two steps: we first derive the PL-homeomorphism classification for these manifolds by computing their Kreck-Stolz invariants. Then, building upon this PL classification result and through an application of surgery theory, we establish the homotopy equivalence classification.</description>
