      <title>Temporal coarse-graining and elimination of slow dynamics with the generalized Langevin equation for time-filtered observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By exact projection in phase space we derive the generalized Langevin equation (GLE) for time-filtered observables. We employ a general convolution filter that directly acts on arbitrary phase-space observables and can involve low-pass, high-pass, band-pass or band-stop components. The derived filter GLE has the same form and properties as the ordinary GLE but exhibits modified potential, mass and memory friction kernel. Our filter-projection approach has diverse applications and can be used to i) systematically derive temporally coarse-grained models by low-pass filtering, ii) undo data smoothening inherent in any experimental measurement process, iii) decompose data exactly into slow and fast variables that can be analyzed separately and each obey Liouville dynamics. The latter application is suitable for removing slow transient or seasonal (i.e. periodic) components that do not equilibrate over simulation or experimental observation time scales and constitutes an alternative to non-equilibrium approaches. We derive integral formulas for the GLE parameters of filtered data for general systems. For the special case of a Markovian system we derive the filter GLE memory kernel in closed form and show that low-band pass smoothening of data induces exponentially decaying memory.</description>

      <title>Dissipation-accuracy tradeoffs in autonomous control of smart active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of motility control by smart agents offers a promising platform for systematically exploring the fundamental physical constraints underlying the functioning of bio-inspired micro-machines operating far from equilibrium. Here, we address the question of the energy cost required for a self-steering active agent to localise itself within a specific region of space or follow a pre-defined trajectory under the influence of fluctuations and external flows. Building on a stochastic thermodynamic formulation of the problem, we derive a generic relationship between dissipation and localisation accuracy, which reveals a fundamental dissipation-accuracy tradeoff constraining the agent's performance. In addition, we illustrate how our framework enables the derivation of optimal steering policies that achieve localisation at minimum energy expenditure.</description>

      <title>Hysteresis Behind A Bottleneck With Location-Dependent Capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Macroscopic fundamental diagrams (MFDs) and related network traffic dynamics models have received both theoretical support and empirical validation with the emergence of new data collection technologies. However, the existence of well-defined MFD curves can only be expected for traffic networks with specific topologies and is subject to various disturbances, most importantly hysteresis phenomena. This study aims to improve the understanding of hysteresis in Macroscopic Fundamental Diagrams and Network Exit Functions (NEFs) during rush hour conditions. We apply the LWR theory to a highway corridor featuring a location-dependent downstream bottleneck to identify a figure-eight hysteresis pattern, clockwise on the top and counter-clockwise on the bottom. We discuss why this general pattern is rare in practical scenarios, where a single clockwise loop is more typical. The paper discusses the impact of the road topology and demand parameters on the formation and intensity of hysteresis loops analytically. To substantiate these findings, we employ numerical simulations using the Cell Transmission Model (CTM). Our simulations show that even a slight reduction in the capacity of the homogeneous section can significantly decrease MFD hysteresis while maintaining outflow at the corridor's downstream end. These reductions can be achieved with minimal intervention through standard traffic control measures, such as dynamic speed limits or ramp metering.</description>

      <title>The number of minima in random landscapes generated by constrained random walk and L\'evy flights: universal properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a uniform framework to compute the exact distribution of the number of minima/maxima in three different random walk landscape models in one dimension. The landscape is generated by the trajectory of a discrete-time continuous space random walk with arbitrary symmetric and continuous jump distribution at each step. In model I, we consider a ``free'' random walk of $N$ steps. In model II, we consider a ``meander landscape'' where the random walk, starting at the origin, stays non-negative up to $N$ steps. In model III, we study a ``first-passage landscape'' which is generated by the trajectory of a random walk that starts at the origin and stops when it crosses the origin for the first time. We demonstrate that while the exact distribution of the number of minima is different in the three models, for each model it is universal for all $N$, in the sense that it does not depend on the jump distribution as long as it is symmetric and continuous. In the last two cases we show that this universality follows from a non trivial mapping to the Sparre Andersen theorem known for the first-passage probability of discrete-time random walks with symmetric and continuous jump distribution. Our analytical results are in excellent agreement with our numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Universal semiclassical dynamics in disordered two-dimensional systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of disordered two-dimensional systems is much less understood than the dynamics of disordered chains, mainly due to the lack of appropriate numerical methods. We demonstrate that a single-trajectory version of the fermionic truncated Wigner approximation (fTWA) gives unexpectedly accurate results for the dynamics of one-dimensional (1D) systems with moderate or strong disorder. Additionally, the computational complexity of calculations carried out within this approximation is small enough to enable studies of two-dimensional (2D) systems larger than standard fTWA. Using this method, we analyze the dynamics of interacting spinless fermions propagating on disordered 1D and 2D lattices. We find for both spatial dimensions that the imbalance exhibits a universal dependence on the rescaled time $t/\xi_W$, where in 2D the time-scale $\xi_W$ follows a stretched-exponential dependence on disorder strength.</description>

      <title>Chaos and spatial prethermalization in driven-dissipative bosonic chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermalization in quantum many-body systems, the process by which they naturally evolve toward thermal equilibrium, typically unfolds over timescales set by the underlying relaxation mechanisms. Yet, the spatial aspect of thermalization in these systems is less understood. We investigate this phenomenon within the nonequilibrium steady state (NESS) of a Bose-Hubbard chain subject at its boundaries to coherent driving and dissipation, a setup inspired by current designs in circuit quantum electrodynamics. We uncover a two-stage thermalization process along the spatial dimension. Close to the coherent drive, the U(1) symmetry of the phase of the photonic field is restored over a short length scale, while its amplitude relaxes over a much larger scale. This opens up an extensive region of the chain characterized by a chaotic yet nonthermal phase. Dynamical fingerprints of chaos in this NESS are probed using semiclassical out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) within the truncated Wigner approximation (TWA). We explore the conditions underlying this protracted thermalization in space and argue that similar prethermal chaotic phases are likely to occur in a broad range of extended driven-dissipative systems.</description>

      <title>Stability and Loop Models from Decohering Non-Abelian Topological Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decohering topological order (TO) is central to the many-body physics of open quantum matter and decoding transitions. We identify relevant statistical mechanical models for decohering non-Abelian TO, which have been crucial for understanding the error threshold of Abelian stabilizer codes. The decohered density matrix can be described by loop models, whose topological loop weight $N$ is given by the quantum dimension of the decohering anyon -- reducing to the Ising model if $N=1$. In particular, the R\'enyi-$n$ moments of the decohered state correspond to $n$ coupled O$(N)$ loop models, and we exactly diagonalize the density matrix at maximal error rate. This allows us to relate the fidelity between two logically distinct ground states to properties of random O$(N)$ loop and spin models. Utilizing the literature on loop models, we find a remarkable stability to quantum channels which proliferate non-Abelian anyons with large quantum dimension, with the possibility of critical phases for smaller dimensions. We confirm our framework with exact results for Kitaev quantum double models, and with numerical simulations for the non-Abelian phase of the Kitaev honeycomb model. The latter is an example of a non-fixed-point wavefunction with non-bosonic and non-integral anyon dimensions. Our work opens up the possibility of non-Abelian TO being robust against maximally proliferating certain anyons, which can inform error-correction studies of these topological memories.</description>

      <title>Ferrimagnetism from triple-q order in Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The candidate Kitaev magnet Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ exhibits a characteristic ferrimagnetic response at low temperatures, with a finite residual magnetization that changes sign at a compensation point located at around half the ordering temperature. We argue that the behavior can be naturally understood to arise in this material as a consequence of a noncollinear triple-$\mathbf{q}$ magnetic ground state. Using large-scale classical Monte Carlo simulations, we study the finite-temperature response of the pertinent honeycomb Heisenberg-Kitaev-$\Gamma$-$\Gamma'$ model in weak training fields. Our model features all symmetry-allowed nearest-neighbor exchange interactions, as well as sublattice-dependent next-nearest-neighbor interactions, consistent with the reported crystal structure of the material. We also consider a six-spin ring exchange perturbation, which allows us to tune between the two different magnetic long-range orders that have been suggested for this material in the literature, namely, a collinear single-$\mathbf{q}$ zigzag state and a noncollinear triple-$\mathbf{q}$ state. We demonstrate that the experimentally-observed ferrimagnetic response of Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ can be well described within our modeling if the magnetic ground state features noncollinear triple-$\mathbf{q}$ order. By contrast, a classical Heisenberg-Kitaev-$\Gamma$-$\Gamma'$-type model with collinear zigzag ground state is insufficient even in principle to describe the observed behavior. Our results illustrate the unconventional physics of noncollinear magnetic long-range orders hosted by frustrated magnets with bond-dependent interactions.</description>

      <title>How does liquidity shape the yield curve?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The phenomenology of the forward rate curve (FRC) can be accurately understood by the fluctuations of a stiff elastic string (Le Coz and Bouchaud, 2024). By relating the exogenous shocks driving such fluctuations to the surprises in the order flows, we elevate the model from purely describing price variations to a microstructural model that incorporates the joint dynamics of prices and order flows, accounting for both impact and cross-impact effects. Remarkably, this framework allows for at least the same explanatory power as existing cross-impact models, while using significantly fewer parameters. In addition, our model generates liquidity-dependent correlations between the forward rate of one tenor and the order flow of another, consistent with recent empirical findings. We show that the model also account for the non-martingale behavior of prices at short timescales.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Difference Method for Variable-Order Diffusion Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An adaptive finite difference scheme for variable-order fractional-time subdiffusion equations in the Caputo form is studied. The fractional time derivative is discretized by the L1 procedure but using nonhomogeneous timesteps. The size of these timesteps is chosen by an adaptive algorithm in order to keep the local error bounded around a preset value, a value that can be chosen at will. For some types of problems this adaptive method is much faster than the corresponding usual method with fixed timesteps while keeping the local error of the numerical solution around the preset values. These findings turns out to be similar to those found for constant-order fractional diffusion equations.</description>

      <title>Any Quantum Many-Body State under Local Dissipation will be Disentangled in Finite Time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that any quantum many-spin state under genetic local dissipation will be fully separable after a finite time independent of the system size. Such a sudden death of many-body entanglement occurs universally provided that there is a finite damping gap and the unique steady-state density matrix is of full rank. This result is rigorously derived by combining a state-reconstruction identity based on random measurements and the convergence bound for quantum channels. Related works and possible generalizations are also discussed.</description>

      <title>On the topology of solutions to random continuous constraint satisfaction problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the set of solutions to $M$ random polynomial equations whose $N$ variables are restricted to the $(N-1)$-sphere. Each equation has independent Gaussian coefficients and a target value $V_0$. When solutions exist, they form a manifold. We compute the average Euler characteristic of this manifold in the limit of large $N$, and find different behavior depending on the target value $V_0$, the ratio $\alpha=M/N$, and the variances of the coefficients. We divide this behavior into five phases with different implications for the topology of the solution manifold. When $M=1$ there is a correspondence between this problem and level sets of the energy in the spherical spin glasses. We conjecture that the transition energy dividing two of the topological phases corresponds to the energy asymptotically reached by gradient descent from a random initial condition, possibly resolving an open problem in out-of-equilibrium dynamics.</description>

      <title>Decoherence and wavefunction deformation of $D_4$ non-Abelian topological order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effect of decoherence on topological order (TO) has been most deeply understood for the toric code, the paragon of Abelian TOs. We show that certain non-Abelian TOs can be analyzed and understood to a similar degree, despite being significantly richer. We consider both wavefunction deformations and quantum channels acting on $D_4$ TO, which has recently been realized on a quantum processor. By identifying the corresponding local statistical mechanical spin or rotor model with $D_4$ symmetry, we find a remarkable stability against proliferating non-Abelian anyons. This is shown by leveraging a reformulation in terms of the tractable O$(2)$ loop model in the pure state case, and $n$ coupled O$(2)$ loop models for R\'enyi-$n$ quantities in the decoherence case -- corresponding to worldlines of the proliferating anyon with quantum dimension $2$. In particular, we find that the purity ($n=2$) remains deep in the $D_4$ TO for any decoherence strength, while the $n \to \infty$ limit becomes critical upon maximally decohering a particular anyon type, similar to our wavefunction deformation result. The information-theoretic threshold ($n\to 1$) appears to be controlled by a disordered version of these stat-mech models, akin to the toric code case although significantly more robust. We furthermore use Monte Carlo simulations to explore the phase diagrams when multiple anyon types proliferate at the same time, leading to a continued stability of the $D_4$ TO in addition to critical phases with emergent $U(1)$ symmetry. Instead of loop models, these are now described by net models corresponding to different anyon types coupled together according to fusion rules.This opens up the exploration of statistical mechanical models for decohered non-Abelian TO, which can inform optimal decoders, and which in an ungauged formulation examples of non-Abelian strong-to-weak symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>How motility affects Ising transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a lattice gas model of hard-core particles on a square lattice experiencing nearest neighbour attraction $J$. Each particle has an internal orientation, independent of the others, that point towards one of the four nearest neighbour and it can move to the neighbouring site along that direction with the usual Metropolis rate if the target site is vacant. The internal orientation of the particle can also change to any of the other three with a constant rate $\omega.$ The dynamics of the model in $\omega\to \infty$ reduces to that of the Lattice Gas (LG) which exhibits a phase separation transition at particle density $\rho=\frac12$ and temperature $T=1,$ when the strength of attraction $J$ crosses a threshold value $\ln(1+ \sqrt{2}).$ This transition belongs to Ising universality class. For any finite $\omega&gt;0,$ the particles can be considered as attractive run-and-tumble particles (RTPs) in two dimensions with motility $\omega^{-1}.$ We find that RTPs also exhibit a phase separation transition, but the critical interaction required is $J_c(\omega)$ which increases monotonically with increased motility $\omega^{-1}.$ It appears that the transition belongs to Ising universality class. Surprisingly, in these models, motility impedes cluster formation process necessitating higher interaction to stabilize microscopic clusters.

      <title>Time-correlation functions of stochastic three-sphere micromachines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss and compare the statistical properties of two stochastic three-sphere micromachines, i.e., odd micromachine and thermal micromachine. We calculate the steady state time-correlation functions for these micromachines and decompose them into the symmetric and antisymmetric parts. In both cases, the cross-correlation between the two spring extensions has an antisymmetric part, which is a direct consequence of the broken time-reversal symmetry. For the odd micromachine, the antisymmetric part of the correlation function is proportional to the odd elasticity, whereas it is proportional to the temperature difference between the two edge spheres for the thermal micromachine. The entropy production rate and the Green-Kubo relations for the two micromachines are also obtained. Comparing the results of the two models, we argue an effective odd elastic constant of the thermal micromachine. The effective odd elasticity of the thermal micromachine is proportional to the temperature difference among the spheres, which causes an internal heat flow and leads to directional locomotion in the presence of hydrodynamic interactions.</description>

      <title>Cattaneo--type subdiffusion equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ordinary subdiffusion equation, with fractional time derivatives of at most first order, describes a process in which the propagation velocity of diffusing molecules is unlimited. To avoid this non-physical property the Cattaneo diffusion equation has been proposed. Compared to the ordinary subdiffusion equation, the Cattaneo equation contains an additional time derivative of order greater than one and less than or equal to two. The fractional order of the additional derivative depends on the subdiffusion exponent. We study a Cattaneo-type subdiffusion equation (CTSE) that differs from the ordinary subdiffusion equation by an additional integro--differential operator (AO) which may be independent of subdiffusion parameters. The AO describes processes affecting ordinary subdiffusion. The equation is derived combining the modified diffusive flux equation with the continuity equation. It can also be obtained within the continuous time random walk model with the waiting time distribution for the molecule to jump controlled by the kernel of AO. We discuss whether the ordinary subdiffusion equation and CTSE provide qualitative differences in the description of subdiffusion. For example, we consider two types of CTSE: the CTSE with AO which is the Caputo fractional time derivative of the order independent of the subdiffusion exponent and with the AO with a kernel that is a slowly varying function. In the first case the effect generated by AO disappears relatively quickly over time. In the second one the effect may be visible for a long time.</description>

      <title>Mean First Passage Times and Eyring-Kramers formula for Fluctuating Hydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermally activated phenomena in physics and chemistry, such as conformational changes in biomolecules, liquid film rupture, or ferromagnetic field reversal, are often associated with exponentially long transition times described by Arrhenius' law. The associated subexponential prefactor, given by the Eyring-Kramers formula, has recently been rigorously derived for systems in detailed balance, resulting in a sharp limiting estimate for transition times and reaction rates. Unfortunately, this formula does not trivially apply to systems with conserved quantities, which are ubiquitous in the sciences: The associated zeromodes lead to divergences in the prefactor. We demonstrate how a generalised formula can be derived, and show its applicability to a wide range of systems, including stochastic partial differential equations from fluctuating hydrodynamics, with applications in rupture of nanofilm coatings and social segregation in socioeconomics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current fluctuations for the one-dimensional totally asymmetric exclusion process (TASEP) connected to reservoirs of particles, and their large scale limit to the KPZ fixed point in finite volume, are studied using exact methods. Focusing on the maximal current phase for TASEP, corresponding to infinite boundary slopes for the KPZ height field, we obtain for general initial condition an exact expression for the late time correction to stationarity, involving extreme value statistics of Brownian paths. In the special cases of stationary and narrow wedge initial conditions, a combination of Bethe ansatz and numerical conjectures alternatively provide fully explicit exact expressions.</description>

      <title>Explosive percolation in finite dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Explosive percolation (EP) has received significant research attention due to its rich and anomalous phenomena near criticality. In our recent study [Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 147101 (2023)], we demonstrated that the correct critical behaviors of EP in infinite dimensions (complete graph) can be accurately extracted using the event-based method, with finite-size scaling behaviors still described by the standard finite-size scaling theory. We perform an extensive simulation of EPs on hypercubic lattices ranging from dimensions $d=2$ to $6$, and find that the critical behaviors consistently obey the standard finite-size scaling theory. Consequently, we obtain a high-precision determination of the percolation thresholds and critical exponents, revealing that EPs governed by the product and sum rules belong to different universality classes. Remarkably, despite the mean of the dynamic pseudocritical point $\mathcal{T}_L$ deviating from the infinite-lattice criticality by a distance determined by the $d$-dependent correlation-length exponent, $\mathcal{T}_L$ follows a normal (Gaussian) distribution across all dimensions, with a standard deviation proportional to $1/\sqrt{V}$, where $V$ denotes the system volume. A theoretical argument associated with the central-limit theorem is further proposed to understand the probability distribution of $\mathcal{T}_L$. These findings offer a comprehensive understanding of critical behaviors in EPs across various dimensions, revealing a different dimension-dependence compared to standard bond percolation.</description>

      <title>Theory of Nonequilibrium Multicomponent Coexistence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multicomponent phase separation is a routine occurrence in both living and synthetic systems. Thermodynamics provides a straightforward path to determine the phase boundaries that characterize these transitions for systems at equilibrium. The prevalence of phase separation in complex systems outside the confines of equilibrium motivates the need for a genuinely nonequilibrium theory of multicomponent phase coexistence. Here, we develop a mechanical theory for coexistence that casts coexistence criteria into the familiar form of equality of state functions. Our theory generalizes traditional equilibrium notions such as the species chemical potential and thermodynamic pressure to systems out of equilibrium. Crucially, while these notions may not be identifiable for all nonequilibrium systems, we numerically verify their existence for a variety of systems by introducing the phenomenological Multicomponent Active Model B+. Our work establishes an initial framework for understanding multicomponent coexistence that we hope can serve as the basis for a comprehensive theory for high-dimensional nonequilibrium phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Consensus effects of social media synthetic influence groups on scale-free networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Online platforms for social interactions are an essential part of modern society. With the advance of technology and the rise of algorithms and AI, content is now filtered systematically and facilitates the formation of filter bubbles. This work investigates the social consensus under limited visibility in a two-state majority-vote model on Barab\'asi-Albert scale-free networks. In the consensus evolution, each individual assimilates the opinion of the majority of their neighbors with probability $1-q$ and disagrees with chance $q$, known as the noise parameter. We define the visibility parameter $V$ as the probability of an individual considering the opinion of a neighbor at a given interaction. The parameter $V$ enables us to model the limited visibility phenomenon that produces synthetic neighborhoods in online interactions. We employ Monte Carlo simulations and finite-size scaling analysis to obtain the critical noise parameter as a function of the visibility $V$ and the growth parameter $z$. We find the critical exponents $\beta/\bar{\nu}$, $\gamma/\bar{\nu}$ and $1/\bar{\nu}$ of and validate their unitary relation for complex networks. Our analysis shows that installing and manipulating synthetic influence groups critically undermines consensus robustness.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Pauli errors on cluster states by weighted distances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of evaluating the difference between quantum states before and after being affected by errors encoded in unitary transformations. Standard distance functions, e.g., the Bures length, are not fully adequate for such a task. Weighted distances are instead appropriate information measures to quantify distinguishability of multipartite states. Here, we employ the previously introduced weighted Bures length and the newly defined weighted Hilbert-Schmidt distance to quantify how much single-qubit Pauli errors alter cluster states. We find that different errors of the same dimension change cluster states in a different way, i.e., their detectability is in general different. Indeed, they transform an ideal cluster state into a state whose weighted distance from the input depends on the specific chosen Pauli rotation, as well as the position of the affected qubit in the graph related to the state. As these features are undetected by using standard distances, the study proves the usefulness of weighted distances to monitor key but elusive properties of many-body quantum systems.</description>

      <title>A Modified Cosmic Brane Proposal for Holographic Renyi Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04625v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new formula for computing holographic Renyi entropies in the presence of multiple extremal surfaces. Our proposal is based on computing the wave function in the basis of fixed-area states and assuming a diagonal approximation for the Renyi entropy. For Renyi index $n\geq1$, our proposal agrees with the existing cosmic brane proposal for holographic Renyi entropy. For $n&lt;1$, however, our proposal predicts a new phase with leading order (in Newton's constant $G$) corrections to the cosmic brane proposal, even far from entanglement phase transitions and when bulk quantum corrections are unimportant. Recast in terms of optimization over fixed-area states, the difference between the two proposals can be understood to come from the order of optimization: for $n&lt;1$, the cosmic brane proposal is a minimax prescription whereas our proposal is a maximin prescription. We demonstrate the presence of such leading order corrections using illustrative examples. In particular, our proposal reproduces existing results in the literature for the PSSY model and high-energy eigenstates, providing a universal explanation for previously found leading order corrections to the $n&lt;1$ Renyi entropies.</description>

Abstract: We investigate both ensemble and time-averaged mean-squared displacements of particles in a polydisperse granular system in a homogeneous cooling state. The system contains an arbitrary number of species of different sizes and masses. The collisions between granular particles are described in terms of the models both of constant and time-dependent restitution coefficients. In our study, we use a powerful low-rank algorithm that allows for efficient simulation of highly polydisperse granular systems. The Monte Carlo simulations are in good agreement with the analytical results.</description>

      <title>Quasiprobabilities in quantum thermodynamics and many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this tutorial, we present the definition, interpretation and properties of some of the main quasiprobabilities that can describe the statistics of measurement outcomes evaluated at two or more times. Such statistics incorporate the incompatibility of the measurement observables and the state of the measured quantum system. We particularly focus on Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobabilities and related distributions. We also discuss techniques to experimentally access a quasiprobability distribution, ranging from the weak two-point measurement scheme, to a Ramsey-like interferometric scheme and procedures assisted by an external detector. We illustrate the use of quasiprobabilities in quantum thermodynamics to describe the quantum statistics of work and heat, and to explain anomalies in the energy exchanges entailed by a given thermodynamic transformation. On the one hand, in work protocols, we show how absorbed energy can be converted to extractable work and vice versa due to Hamiltonian incompatibility at distinct times. On the other hand, in exchange processes between two quantum systems initially at different temperatures, we explain how quantum correlations in their initial state may induce cold-to-hot energy exchanges, which are unnatural between any pair of equilibrium nondriven systems. We conclude the tutorial by giving simple examples where quasiprobabilities are applied to many-body systems: scrambling of quantum information, sensitivity to local perturbations, and quantum work statistics in the quenched dynamics of models that can be mapped onto systems of free fermions, for instance the Ising model with a transverse field. We meticulously present derivations of essential concepts alongside straightforward examples, aiming to enhance comprehension and facilitate learning.</description>

Abstract: Information is everywhere in nature which is very uncertain and unpredictable. But information, in itself, is a very ambiguous term. In this cursory write-up, we attempt to understand the formal meaning of information by quantifying uncertainty and discuss how it naturally appears in two core topics of classical physics -- classical mechanics and statistical mechanics. In the process, we witness how the concepts of the information theory render a unique viewpoint in physics. Except for the presentation of the material, the author claims no originality; however, the responsibility of every inadvertent error lies entirely with the author.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Insight into the blockage vulnerability of evolving spatial networks is important for understanding transport resilience, robustness, and failure of a broad class of real-world structures such as porous media and utility, urban traffic, and infrastructure networks. By exhaustive search for central transport hubs on porous lattice structures, we recursively determine and block the emerging main hub until the evolving network reaches the impenetrability limit. We find that the blockage backbone is a self-similar path with a fractal dimension which is distinctly smaller than that of the universality class of optimal path crack models. The number of blocking steps versus the rescaled initial occupation fraction collapses onto a master curve for different network sizes, allowing for the prediction of the onset of impenetrability. The shortest-path length distribution broadens during the blocking process reflecting an increase of spatial correlations. We address the reliability of our predictions upon increasing the disorder or decreasing the fraction of processed structural information.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discovering mixed state quantum orders is an on-going issue. Recently, it has been recognized that there are (at least) two kinds of symmetries in the mixed state; strong and weak symmetries. Under symmetry-respective decoherence, spontaneous strong-to-weak symmetry breaking (SSSB) can occur. This work provides a scheme to describe SSSB and other decoherence phenomena in the mixed state by employing the stabilizer formalism and the efficient numerical algorithm of Clifford circuits. We present two systematic numerical studies.In a two-dimensional (2D) circuit with a stochastic Ising type decoherence, an SSSB phase transition is clearly observed and its criticality is elucidated by the numerical methods. In particular, we calculate R\'{e}nyi-2 correlations and estimate critical exponents of the SSSB transition. For the second system, we introduce an idea of subgroup SSSB. As an example, we study a system with symmetry-protected-topological (SPT) order provided by both one-form and zero-form symmetries, and observe how the system evolves under decoherence. After displaying numerical results, we show that viewpoint of percolation is quite useful to understand the SSSB transition, which is applicable for a wide range of decohered states. Finally, we comment on SSSB of one-form-symmetry exemplifying toric code.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that randomness in quadratic bosonic Hamiltonians results in certain information scrambling diagnostics, mirroring those in chaotic systems. Specifically, for initial Gaussian states, we observe the disappearance of the memory effect in the entanglement dynamics of disjoint blocks and the negative values of tripartite mutual information. We also find that the spectral form factor for these integrable systems exhibits a ramp. However, in contrast to chaotic systems, the ramp is nonlinear, and the out-of-time-ordered correlators display power-law growth for certain operators and Gaussian dynamics. These findings indicate that information scrambling driven by randomness is distinct from quantum chaos. Moreover, our results provide insight into the dynamics of Gaussian states in continuous-variable systems, which are useful and available resources for quantum information processing.</description>

Abstract: Recently, a framework for computing the symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy for non-invertible symmetries in $1{+}1$d conformal field theories has been proposed by Saura-Bastida, Das, Sierra and Molina-Vilaplana [Phys. Rev. D109, 105026]. We revisit their theoretical setup, paying particular attention to possible contributions from the conformal boundary conditions imposed at the entangling surface -- a potential subtlety that was not addressed in the original proposal. We find that the presence of boundaries modifies the construction of projectors onto irreducible sectors, compared to what can be expected from a pure bulk approach. This is a direct consequence of the fusion algebra of non-invertible symmetries being different in the presence or absence of boundaries on which defects can end. We apply our formalism to the case of the Fibonacci category symmetry in the three-state Potts and tricritical Ising model and the Rep($S_3$) fusion category symmetry in the $SU(2)_4$ Wess-Zumino-Witten conformal field theory. We numerically corroborate our findings by simulating critical anyonic chains with these symmetries as a finite lattice substitute for the expected entanglement Hamiltonian. Our predictions for the symmetry-resolved entanglement for non-invertible symmetries seem to disagree with the recent work by Saura-Bastida et al.</description>
