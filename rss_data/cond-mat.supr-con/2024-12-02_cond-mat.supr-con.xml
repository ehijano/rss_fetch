      <title>Reply to Comment on 'The Law of Entropy Increase and the Meissner Effect'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jorge Hirsch, in his Comment on my article published in Entropy, agrees that the conventional BCS theory of superconductivity contradicts the second law of thermodynamics. He tries to prove that this theory cannot be valid because of this contradiction, since the Meissner effect is consistent with the second law of thermodynamics, according to his alternative theory of superconductivity, which can explain how the persistent currents can be annihilated before the resistance appearance. First of all I draw attention on experimental facts according to which the persistent currents observed in rings can be not annihilated not only before but even after the resistance appearance, in accordance with the conventional theory of superconductivity and contrary to the second law of thermodynamics. Hirsch's proof of the consistency of the Meissner effect with the second law of thermodynamics is based on mistakes provoked by ignoring the contradictions between books on superconductivity and the false analogy of the Gorter cycle with the Carnot cycle. In fact, Hirsch did not refute, but confirmed the conclusion made in my article about the contradiction of the Meissner effect to the second law of thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Pressure induced transition from chiral charge order to time-reversal symmetry-breaking superconducting state in Nb-doped CsV$_3$Sb$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The experimental realisation of unconventional superconductivity and charge order in kagome systems \textit{A}V$_3$Sb$_5$ is of critical importance. We conducted a highly systematic study of Cs(V$_{1-x}$Nb$_x$)$_3$Sb$_5$ with $x$=0.07 (Nb$_{0.07}$-CVS) by employing a unique combination of tuning parameters such as doping, hydrostatic pressure, magnetic fields, and depth, using muon spin rotation, AC susceptibility, and STM. We uncovered tunable magnetism in the normal state of Nb$_{0.07}$-CVS, which transitions to a time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking superconducting state under pressure. Specifically, our findings reveal that the bulk of Nb$_{0.07}$-CVS (at depths greater than 20 nm from the surface) experiences TRS breaking below $T^*=40~$K, lower than the charge order onset temperature, $T_\mathrm{CO}$ = 58 K. However, near the surface (within 20 nm from the surface), the TRS breaking signal doubles and onsets at $T_\mathrm{CO}$, indicating that Nb-doping decouples TRS breaking from charge order in the bulk but synchronises them near the surface. Additionally, Nb-doping raises the superconducting critical temperature $T_\mathrm{C}$ from 2.5 K to 4.4 K. Applying hydrostatic pressure enhances both $T_\mathrm{C}$ and the superfluid density by a factor of two, with a critical pressure $p_\mathrm{cr}$ ${\simeq}$ 0.85 GPa, suggesting competition with charge order. Notably, above $p_\mathrm{cr}$, we observe nodeless electron pairing and weak internal fields below $T_\mathrm{C}$, indicating broken TRS in the superconducting state. Overall, these results demonstrate a highly unconventional normal state with a depth-tunable onset of TRS breaking at ambient pressure, a transition to TRS-breaking superconductivity under low hydrostatic pressure, and an unconventional scaling between $T_\mathrm{C}$ and the superfluid density.</description>

      <title>The Higgs-Amplitude mode in the optical conductivity in the presence of a supercurrent: Gauge invariant forumulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observing the amplitude-Higgs mode in superconductors has been a central challenge in condensed matter physics. Unlike the phase mode in the electromagnetic (EM) response, the amplitude mode is not needed to satisfy gauge invariance. Indeed, it couples to linear EM response properties only in special superconductors that are associated with a pairing vector $\mathbf{Q} \neq 0$. In this paper we characterize the amplitude-mode contribution within a gauge-invariant treatment of the linear optical conductivity for these non-uniform superconductors, noting that they are by their very nature particularly vulnerable to pair-breaking from non-magnetic impurities. This leads to inevitable damping of the Higgs mode. Our gauge-invariant formulation provides an in-depth understanding of two sets of $f$-sum rules which must be obeyed. We illustrate how difficult it is to disentangle the neutral amplitude mode contributions from those of the charged quasi-particles. These observations are presented in the context of an applied supercurrent, where we observe a new low-frequency feature that reflects the superfluid density and appears consistent with recent experiments.</description>

      <title>Prediction of high-Tc superconductivity under submegabar pressure in ternary actinium borohydrides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ternary hydrides are considered as the ideal candidates with high critical temperature (Tc) stabilized at submegabar pressure, evidenced by the recent discoveries in LaBeH8 (110 K at 80 GPa) and LaB2H8 (106 K at 90 GPa). Here, we investigate the crystal structures and superconductivity of an Ac-B-H system under pressures of 100 and 200 GPa by using an advanced structure method combined with first-principles calculations. As a result, nine stable compounds were identified, where B atoms are bonded with H atoms in the formation with diverse BHx motifs, e.g., methanelike (BH4), polythenelike, (BH2)n,andBH6 octahedron. Among them, seven Ac-B-H compounds were found to become superconductive. In particular, AcBH7 was estimated to have a Tc of 122 K at 70 GPa. Our in-depth analysis reveals that the B-H interactions in the BH6 units play a key role in its high superconductivity and stability at submegabar pressure. Our current results provide a guidance for future experiments to synthesize ternary hydride superconductors with high-Tc at moderate pressure.</description>

      <title>Prediction of high-Tc superconductivity in ternary actinium beryllium hydrides at low pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen-rich superconductors are promising candidates to achieve room-temperature superconductivity. However, the extreme pressures needed to stabilize these structures significantly limit their practical applications. An effective strategy to reduce the external pressure is to add a light element M that binds with H to form MHx units, acting as a chemical precompressor. We exemplify this idea by performing ab initio calculations of the Ac-Be-H phase diagram, proving that the metallization pressure of Ac-H binaries, for which critical temperatures as high as 200 K were predicted at 200 GPa, can be significantly reduced via beryllium incorporation. We identify three thermodynamically stable (AcBe2H10, AcBeH8, and AcBe2H14) and four metastable compounds (fcc AcBeH8, AcBeH10, AcBeH12 and AcBe2H16). All of them are superconductors. In particular, fcc AcBeH8 remains dynamically stable down to 10 GPa, where it exhibits a superconducting transition temperature Tc of 181 K. The Be-H bonds are responsible for the exceptional properties of these ternary compounds and allow them to remain dynamically stable close to ambient pressure. Our results suggest that high-Tc superconductivity in hydrides is achievable at low pressure and may stimulate experimental synthesis of ternary hydrides.</description>

      <title>Diode effect in Fraunhofer patterns of disordered multi-terminal Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the role of different spatial inhomogeneities in generating the conditions for the appearance of a superconducting diode effect in the Fraunhofer pattern of wide Josephson junctions. Through the scattering matrix approach, we highlight the role of mirror symmetry of the junction in forbidding the diode effect in both the two-terminal and the multi-terminal case. As sources of mirror symmetry breaking, we study spatial potentials of long and short wavelength with respect to the size of the system, mimicking the effect of side gates and atomic scale disorder, respectively, as well as the geometry of the junction, and assess their impact on the diode effect. As a common trend, we observe qualitatively similar rectification patterns magnified at the nodal points of the Fraunhofer pattern by destructing interference. In multi-terminal mirror-symmetric setups, we single out the phase at additional terminals as a controllable knob to tune the diode effect at the finite field. The work presents a comprehensive treatment of the role of pure spatial inhomogeneity in the emergence of a diode effect in wide junctions.</description>

      <title>SNS Junctions along the BCS-BEC Crossover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theory of SNS junctions, a normal metal sandwiched between two superconductors, along the crossover from the BCS to the BEC regime. We calculate the Josephson current as a function of the chemical potential relative to the band edge in the superconducting region, $\mu_S$, where the BEC phase is indicated by $\mu_S &lt;0$. The chemical potential relative to the band edge in the normal metal, $\mu_N$, allows us to tune the junction between the SNS case ($\mu_N&gt;0$) and the SIS case, where the superconductors are separated by a tunneling barrier. We find that there are Andreev levels in the BEC regime, as long as there is sufficient density of states in the normal region, i.e. when $\mu_N&gt;\Delta$, where $\Delta$ is the amplitude of the superconducting order parameter. For 1D SNS junctions, we find the Josephson current $I_S$ carried by these Andreev levels to be a function of the ratio $\Delta/\Delta_d$, where $\Delta_d$ is the Andreev level spacing. At zero temperature, the Josephson current has a maximum on the BCS side of the transition where $\Delta$ is maximal. At finite temperature, however, we find that the maximum moves to the BEC side of the crossover. We identify the mechanism for this phenomenon to be the decrease in the number of Andreev levels at the BCS-BEC crossover, accompanied by an increase in excitation energy to the unoccupied levels, making it less likely that these states are thermally occupied. Thereby, at finite temperature, the Josephson current is more strongly reduced on the BCS side of the crossover, resulting in a maximal Josephson current at the BCS-BEC crossover.</description>

      <title>Design of structured La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_{4}$ films as superconducting transition-edge sensors at 4.2K</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the effects of carrier-density structuration and patterning on thin films of the cuprate superconductor La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_{4}$, in order to optimize its functional characteristics as sensing material for resistive transition-edge bolometers at liquid-He temperature. We perform finite-element computations considering two major contributions to structuration: The intrinsic random nanoscale disorder associated to carrier density nonstoichiometry, plus the imposition of regular arrangements of zones with different nominal carrier densities. Using ad-hoc seek algorithms, we obtain various structuration designs that markedly improve the bolometric performance, mainly the saturation power and dynamic range. Bolometric operation becomes favorable even in the easier-to-implement constant current mode of measurement.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of the superconducting transition temperature due to multiband effect in the topological nodal-line semimetal Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_{x}$TaSe$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a systematic study of the normal-state and superconducting properties of single crystal Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_{x}$TaSe$_{2}$ $(0\leq x \leq 0.23)$. Sn doping enhances the superconducting temperature $T_{c}$ up to 5.1 K, while also significantly increasing impurity scattering in the crystals. For $x=0$, the specific heat jump at $T_{c}$ exceeds the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) weak-coupling value of 1.43, indicating the realization of strong-coupling superconductivity in PbTaSe$_{2}$. In contrast, substituting Pb with Sn lowers the specific heat jump at $T_{c}$ below the BSC value of 1.43, which cannot be explained by a single-gap model. Rather, the observed specific heat of Sn-doped PbTaSe$_{2}$ is reproduced by a two-gap model. Our observations suggest that additional Fermi pockets appear due to a reduction of the spin-orbit gap with Sn doping, and the multiband effect arising from these emergent Fermi pockets enhances the effective electron-phonon coupling strength, leading to the increase in $T_{c}$.</description>

      <title>Theory of the photonic Joule effect in superconducting circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When a small system is coupled to a bath, it is generally assumed that the state of the bath remains unaffected by the system due to the bath's large number of degrees of freedom. Here we show theoretically that this assumption can be easily violated for photonic baths typically used in experiments involving superconducting circuits. We analyze the dynamics of a voltage-biased Josephson junction coupled to a photonic bath, represented as a long Josephson junction chain. Our findings show that the system can reach a non-equilibrium steady state where the photonic degrees of freedom become significantly overheated, leading to a qualitative change in the current-voltage $I-V$ curve. This phenomenon is analogous to the Joule effect observed in electrical conductors, where flowing current can substantially heat up electrons. Recognizing this effect is crucial for the many applications of high-impedance environments in quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2007.14388v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the coexistence of superconductivity (SC) and density-wave state and reconcile various puzzling experimental data in organic superconductors (TMTSF)$_{2}$PF$_{6}$ and (TMTSF)$_{2}$ClO$_{4}$. The anisotropic resistance drop above $T_c$ is qualitatively described by nascent isolated SC islands within a bulk analytical model. However, the observed anisotropic SC onset is explained only when the finite size and flat needle shape of samples is considered. Our results pave a way to estimate the volume fraction and the typical size of SC islands in far from the sample surface, and apply to many inhomogeneous superconductors, including high-$T_c$ cuprate or Fe-based ones.</description>

      <title>Two-fluid model analysis of the terahertz conductivity of YBaCuO samples: optimally doped, underdoped and overdoped cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The complex conductivity of underdoped and optimally doped YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ samples and overdoped similar compound Y$_{0.7}$Ca$_{0.3}$Ba$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ was measured using time-domain terahertz spectroscopy. In the normal state, the frequency dependence is described by the Drude model. Below the critical temperature $T_\mathrm{c}$, the two-fluid model was successfully employed to fit all the spectra, from 5 K up to $T_\mathrm{c}$. The temperature behaviour of fundamental parameters such as the scattering rate $1/\tau$, the superfluid (normal) fraction $f_\mathrm{s}$ ($f_\mathrm{n}$) and the conductivity $\sigma$ was investigated at given frequencies. For the optimally doped and the overdoped samples, even at 5 K, a fifth of the electrons do not condense to the superfluid fraction. We observed that a substantial fraction of electrons do not condense to the superfluid fraction even at 5 K for optimally doped and overdoped samples. The real part of the conductivity $\sigma_1(T)$ exhibits a peak at low frequencies. It can be observed for all three stoichiometries and its exact shape depends on the quality of the sample. A further analysis shows that this peak is a consequence of the competition between the scattering time $\tau(T)$ and the superfluid fraction $f_\mathrm{s}(T)$.</description>

      <title>Strong enhancement of superconductivity on finitely ramified fractal lattices</title>

Abstract: Using the Sierpinski gasket (triangle) and carpet (square) lattices as examples, we theoretically study the properties of fractal superconductors. For that, we focus on the phenomenon of $s$-wave superconductivity in the Hubbard model with attractive on-site potential and employ the Bogoliubov-de Gennes approach and the theory of superfluid stiffness. For the case of the Sierpinski gasket, we demonstrate that fractal geometry of the underlying crystalline lattice can be strongly beneficial for superconductivity, not only leading to a considerable increase of the critical temperature $T_c$ as compared to the regular triangular lattice but also supporting macroscopic phase coherence of the Cooper pairs. In contrast, the Sierpinski carpet geometry does not lead to pronounced effects, and we find no substantial difference as compared with the regular square lattice. We conjecture that the qualitative difference between these cases is caused by different ramification properties of the fractals.</description>

      <title>A numerical method for designing topological superconductivity induced by s-wave pairing</title>

Abstract: Topological superconductors have garnered significant attention due to their potential for realizing topological quantum computation. However, a universal computational tool based on first-principles calculations for predicting topological superconductivity has not yet been fully developed, posing substantial challenges in identifying topological superconducting materials. In this paper, we present a numerical method to characterize the superconducting spectrum and topological invariants of two-dimensional (2D) slab systems using first-principles calculations, implemented in the open-source software WannierTools. To more accurately model the superconducting proximity effect, we integrate an SC pairing decay module into the program. Our approach can be applied to classical superconductor-topological insulator (SC-TI) heterostructures, SC-semiconductor heterostructures, and intrinsic topological superconductors. The program's validity is demonstrated using the topological crystal insulator SnTe, the Rashba semiconductor InSb, and the superconductor NbSe2 as examples. We anticipate that this tool will accelerate the discovery of topological superconductor candidates.</description>

      <title>Thermal Hall Effect and Neutral Spinons in a Doped Mott Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05711v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the pseudogap phase of the cuprate, a thermal Hall response of neutral objects has been recently detected experimentally, which continuously persists into the antiferromagnetic insulating phase. In this work, we study the transport properties of neutral spinons as the elementary excitation of a doped Mott insulator, which is governed by a mutual Chern-Simons topological gauge structure. We show that such a chiral spinon as a composite of an $S=1/2$ spin sitting at the core of a supercurrent vortex, can contribute to the thermal Hall effect, thermopower, and Hall effect due to its intrinsic transverse (cyclotron) motion under internal fictitious fluxes. In particular, the magnitudes of the transport coefficients are phenomenologically determined by two basic parameters: the doping concentration and $T_c$, quantitatively consistent with the experimental measurements including the signs and qualitative temperature and magnetic field dependence. Combined with the predictions of the spinon longitudinal transport properties, including the Nernst and spin Hall effects, a phenomenological description of the pseudogap phase is established as characterized by the neutral spinon excitations, which eventually become "confined" with an intrinsic superconducting transition at $T_c$. Finally, within this theoretical framework, the "order to order" phase transition between the superconducting and antiferromagnetic insulating phases are briefly discussed, with the thermal Hall monotonically increasing into the latter.</description>

      <title>Limitations of Caldeira-Leggett model for description of phase transitions in superconducting circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15951v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inherent complexity of system-bath interactions often requires making critical approximations, which we here show to have a radical influence on the renormalization group flow and the resulting phase diagram. Specifically, for the Caldeira-Leggett model Schmid and Bulgadaev (SB) predicted a phase transition, whose experimental verification in resistive superconducting circuits is currently hotly debated. For normal metal and Josephson junction array resistors, we show that the mapping to Caldeira-Leggett is only exact when applying approximations which decompactify the superconducting phase. We show that there exist treatments that retain phase compactness, which immediately lead to a phase diagram depending on four instead of two parameters. While we still find an SB-like transition in the transmon regime, the critical parameter is controlled exclusively by the capacitive coupling. In contrast, the Cooper pair box maps to the anisotropic Kondo model, where a pseudoferromagnetic phase is not allowed for regular electrostatic interactions.</description>

      <title>AI-driven inverse design of materials: Past, present and future</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09429v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of advanced materials is the cornerstone of human technological development and progress. The structures of materials and their corresponding properties are essentially the result of a complex interplay of multiple degrees of freedom such as lattice, charge, spin, symmetry, and topology. This poses significant challenges for the inverse design methods of materials. Humans have long explored new materials through a large number of experiments and proposed corresponding theoretical systems to predict new material properties and structures. With the improvement of computational power, researchers have gradually developed various electronic structure calculation methods, such as the density functional theory and high-throughput computational methods. Recently, the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology in the field of computer science has enabled the effective characterization of the implicit association between material properties and structures, thus opening up an efficient paradigm for the inverse design of functional materials. A significant progress has been made in inverse design of materials based on generative and discriminative models, attracting widespread attention from researchers. Considering this rapid technological progress, in this survey, we look back on the latest advancements in AI-driven inverse design of materials by introducing the background, key findings, and mainstream technological development routes. In addition, we summarize the remaining issues for future directions. This survey provides the latest overview of AI-driven inverse design of materials, which can serve as a useful resource for researchers.</description>

      <title>A facile route to synthesize cubic gauche polymeric nitrogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10331v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, the long-sought cg-N with N-N single bond has been synthesized for the first time by a thermal-driven-only chemical route at ambient conditions. The successful synthesis of cg-N was achieved by first creating a solution of azides, which was then pretreated under vacuum conditions. Following the pretreatment, the resultant concentrated azide was heated at temperatures ranging from 260{\deg}C to 330{\deg}C for a reaction time of 3 hours, ultimately leading to the formation of cg-N. The emergent intense Raman peak characterized of cg-N provides solid evidence that the double bonded nitrogen-nitrogen transforms into a single bond form, which agrees well with cg-N structure. To date, this is the only work achieving the quantity of cg-N synthesized at ambient conditions by a facile route that can be further developed for the scalable synthesis and applications of polymerized nitrogen-based materials as high energy density materials.</description>

      <title>Dirac and chiral spin liquids on spin-1/2 square-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the challenging problem of identifying the quantum spin liquid candidate in the spin-1/2 $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the square lattice. By integrating the Gutzwiller-guided density matrix renormalization group method with analytical analyses, we present clear evidence that the ground state is a Z$_2$ Dirac spin liquid. This state can be efficiently described by a Gutzwiller-projected parton theory characterized by its projective symmetry group. To distinguish the difference between the projected Z$_2$ and U(1) parton state, we investigate the chiral spin liquid ground states as topological orders by incorporating a $J_\chi$ term into the $J_1$-$J_2$ model and observe a transition from a Z$_2$ chiral spin liquid to a U(1)$_2$ chiral spin liquid as $J_\chi$ increases.</description>
