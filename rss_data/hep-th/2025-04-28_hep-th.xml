      <title>Bounds on the next-to-leading Wilson coefficient in maximal supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One expects type II string theory to be the unique ultraviolet completion of maximal supergravity. Motivated by the recent computation of the unitary bound on the leading Wilson coefficient within the S-matrix bootstrap, we analyse the minimum of the next-to-leading Wilson coefficient in string theory in seven spacetime dimensions. We find that the next-to-leading Wilson coefficient is minimum at the same point as the leading Wilson coefficient.</description>

      <title>Extended AdS spacetime without boundaries and entanglement without holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We glue together two copies of pure AdS spacetime along their conformal boundaries creating a manifold without boundaries. The resulting space, which in dimension $d+2$ we denote by $AdS^{d+2}_\pm$, has the topology of $S^2\times \Sigma^d$, where $\Sigma^d$ is a $d$-manifold without boundary. Acting with $\mathbb Z_n$ on the $S^2$ factor amounts to coupling a pair of membranes at the north and south poles of the 2-sphere. Moreover, extending the domain of the 2-sphere polar coordinate from $[0, \pi]$ to the interval $[0, (2N-1)\pi]$, where $N&gt;1$, enables the coupling of one stack of $N$ coincident membranes at each pole of the 2-sphere ($2N$ membranes in total). Assuming the existence of a quantum gravity theory on the glued spacetime, we compute the classical approximation of the entanglement entropy across an entangling surface consisting of the two antipodal stacks of membranes. In odd dimensions, we find that each pair of membranes contributes with a quarter of their area to the entropy of the system. In even dimensions, the entropy is dependent on a boundary cutoff whose divergence can be suppressed by taking an infinite number of membranes. This cancellation yields exactly to a quarter of the area formula. The calculation does not require details of the quantum theory other than its infrared limit, that we assume to be Einstein gravity.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of effective actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the same quantum field theory distinct effective actions can be obtained by coupling sources to different choices of field variables. This is the same as considering effective actions for theories related by a change of variables and thus differ only by the values of so called inessential couplings. The effective actions will appear quite different since they generate correlation functions of different operators. Here we show that the effective actions are related by an implicit change of variables of the mean field, i.e. the argument of the effective action. Conversely, one can go the other way: by making a change of variables of the mean variable we obtain a new effective action which generates correlation functions of an implicitly defined composite field. The existence of the implicit transformations in both cases rests on the existence of solutions to initial value problems where the ``time'' parameter is an inessential coupling. Non-perturbatively the solutions may only exist for some non-zero amount of this time. However, at each order in perturbation theory one obtains linear equations which implies that unique solutions exist. We then show that scattering amplitudes are independent of inessential couplings without use of perturbation theory. For gauge theories we expect our correspondence to extend to effective actions which differ by a choice of gauge.</description>

      <title>The Weyl anomaly in interacting quantum field theory on curved spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define the notion of Weyl anomalies, measuring the violation of local scale invariance, in interacting quantum field theory on curved spacetimes in the framework of locally covariant field theory. We discuss some general properties of Weyl anomalies, such as their relation to the trace anomaly. We study the trace anomaly in detail for the $\phi^4$ theory, in particular determining it up to second order in the interaction. We also show that at third order in the interaction a potential $\Box \phi^2$ term can be removed by finite renormalization.</description>

      <title>Revisiting a family of five-dimensional charged, rotating black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the absence of a higher-dimensional analogue to the Kerr-Newman black hole, 5-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory with a Chern-Simons term has become a natural setting for studying charged, stationary solutions. A prominent example is the Chong-Cveti\v{c}-L\"{u}-Pope (CCLP) solution, which describes a non-extremal black hole with electric charge and two independent angular momenta. This solution has been widely studied, and generalizations have been proposed. In this paper, we revisit a large family of five-dimensional black hole solutions to Einstein-Maxwell-Chern-Simons (EMCS) field equations, which admits to be written in terms of a generalized Pleba\'{n}ski-Demia\'{n}ski ansatz and includes the CCLP and the Kerr-NUT-Anti-de Sitter solutions as particular cases. We show that the complete family can be brought to the CCLP form by means of a suitable coordinate transformation and a complex redefinition of parameters. Then, we compute the conserved charges associated to the CCLP form of the metric by analyzing the near-horizon asymptotic symmetries. We show that the zero-mode of the near-horizon charges exactly match the result of the Komar integrals.</description>

      <title>Celestial closed strings at one-loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we continue our investigation of superstring scattering amplitudes in the conformal basis. We focus on the case of four graviton scattering processes at 1-loop in \emph{closed} superstring theory. We write the expression for such a process in the celestial variables and confirm previous expectations. In particular, we find the adequate overall factorization of the $\alpha'$ dependence which organizes the loop expansion of closed string celestial amplitudes. We also show that, at 1-loop, the field theory limit, when properly defined, commutes with the Mellin transform of the amplitudes for all values of the conformally invariant cross-ratio, something that had already been observed for gluon processes at 1-loop in open string theory and is to be compared with the tree-level computations. This indicates that many of the features satisfied for open string gluon amplitudes at tree and 1-loop levels are also universal properties of graviton celestial amplitudes in closed string theory. As a by-product, we also compute field theory graviton amplitudes at 1-loop in the conformal basis.</description>

      <title>Local symmetry and extended spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the previously proposed local transformations in E theory have a closing algebra if one adopts a simple constraint on the parameters of the transformations that constrains their dependence on the extended spacetime of E theory. We evaluate these local transformations for the decomposition of E11 that leads to the IIA theory at level zero. This has the same fields and spacetime as Siegel theory (Double field theory) and although the local transformations agree, the constraint is different to the generic section conditions used in that theory. We discuss what additional alternative constraints might be required for the invariance of this theory and also argue that the dependence on the coordinates beyond those of the usual spacetime is due to the presence of branes.</description>

      <title>Symmetric orbifold OPE from string theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss how to obtain the symmetric orbifold fusion rule/OPE from the dual string theory. We consider two explicit examples: $k_b=3$ bosonic strings in ${\rm AdS_3}\times X$ in the near-boundary limit and $k=1$ hybrid strings in $\rm AdS_3\times S^3\times\mathbb{T}^4$. The main advantage of these two examples is that they have explicit expressions for the vertex operators in the $x$-basis. We show that the OPE of such vertex operators explicitly captures the longest cycle contribution in the symmetric orbifold fusion rule/OPE. We then argue how one can obtain the shorter-cycle contributions using the screening operators existing in the theories. We also discuss how our general result reduces to the earlier results in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the approach for considering fast charged particles scattering on targets of complex structure, which contain some isolated substructures, is introduced. Based on this approach, the differential cross section for scattering on the set of parallel planes with uniformly distributed atoms in each plane is obtained. It is shown that for the case of zero thermal vibrations, the differential scattering cross section may be expressed analytically which simplifies the calculations.</description>

      <title>Virial theorem for rigidly rotating matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scaling property of the thermodynamic free energy ($\Phi$) of a system at global equilibrium has been examined using a real-time method known as the virial theorem. We demonstrate these scaling properties through a derived relation based on the general structure of equal-time commutators among Poincare charges and their densities. This relation is applicable to any renormalizable fields with spin $\leq 1$, excluding gauge fields. In this particular study, we investigate a rigidly rotating solution ($\Omega = \text{const}$) at global equilibrium for massless fermionic matter. It has been shown that the applicability of a hydrodynamic description requires a hierarchy $\Omega R \gg \Omega \beta_{0}$, where $R$ is the radius of the cylindrical-shaped rotating matter and $\beta_{0} = 1/T_{0}$ is the inverse temperature on the rotation axis. Consequently, the thermodynamic free energy $\Phi$ depends on the angular velocity through the product $\Omega R$, a dependency that extends to other thermodynamic variables as well. These findings are consistent with recent lattice QCD simulation results. Furthermore, we compute the moment of inertia for massless fermions and estimate the light quark contribution to the total moment of inertia of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) produced in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Twists of trigonometric sigma models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the $\mathbb{Z}_N$-twisted trigonometric sigma models, a new class of integrable deformations of the principal chiral model. Starting from 4d Chern-Simons theory on a cylinder, the models are constructed by introducing a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ branch cut running along the non-compact direction. As we pass through the branch cut we apply a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ automorphism to the algebra-valued and group-valued fields of the theory. Two instances of models in this class have appeared in the literature and we explain how these fit into our general construction. We generalise both to the case of $\mathbb{Z}_N$-twistings, and for each we construct two further deformations, leading to four doubly-deformed models.
  Mapping the cylinder to a sphere, a novel feature of the construction is that the branch points are at the simple poles corresponding to the ends of the cylinder. As a result, the untwisted and twisted models have the same number of degrees of freedom. While twisting does not always lead to inequivalent models, we show that if we use the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ outer automorphism of $\mathfrak{g}^{\mathbb{C}} = \mathfrak{sl}(n;\mathbb{C})$ to twist, then the untwisted and twisted models have different symmetries, hence the latter are new integrable sigma models.</description>

      <title>SymTFT, Protected Gaplessness, and Spontaneous Breaking of Non-invertible Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years we have learned that several four-dimensional field theories can manifest non-invertible zero-form symmetries generalizing the Kramers-Wannier duality defect of the 2d critical Ising model. Several recent works by various groups have observed a deep interplay among such non-invertible symmetries in 3+1 dimensions, their anomalies, and the properties of the ground state(s). The purpose of this work is to present a first coarse classification of all possible classes of non-invertible symmetries of this type that can either enforce gaplessness or be spontaneously broken in the infrared exploiting the topological symmetry theory formalism. Our methods also generalize to non-invertible KW-like duality symmetries graded by non-abelian finite subgroups. As a first application of our results we present examples of symmetry-breaking relevant deformations of supersymmetric models. Along the way we notice the potential for further global structures that could be realized by non-SUSY versions of Argyres-Douglas type fixed points.</description>

      <title>Inflationary background renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In cosmic inflation, non-linearities of the curvature perturbation can induce backreaction to the background. To obtain observational predictions at non-linear order on the correct background, one has to redefine the background or introduce background renormalization. We explicitly demonstrate it with a vanishing one-point function of the curvature perturbation as a renormalization condition, so that proper observational predictions can be made even at the nonlinear level. Due to non-linear symmetry of the curvature perturbation, such a procedure induces corrections to the two-point functions, which yield a finite renormalized one-loop correction that depends on the regularization scheme. Cancellation of the divergence is a manifestation of Maldacena's consistency condition. The finite term can be large and highly time-dependent, which indicates evolution outside the horizon.</description>

      <title>Linearised Second Law for Higher Curvature Gravity and Non-Minimally Coupled Vector Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05411v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Expanding the work of arXiv:1504.08040, we show that black holes obey a second law for linear perturbations to bifurcate Killing horizons, in any covariant higher curvature gravity coupled to scalar and vector fields. The vector fields do not need to be gauged, and (like the scalars) can have arbitrary non-minimal couplings to the metric. The increasing entropy has a natural expression in covariant phase space language, which makes it manifestly invariant under JKM ambiguities. An explicit entropy formula is given for f(Riemann) gravity coupled to vectors, where at most one derivative acts on each vector. Besides the previously known curvature terms, there are three extra terms involving differentiating the Lagrangian by the symmetric vector derivative (which therefore vanish for gauge fields).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The latest ACT data release disfavors the attractor $n_s=1-2/N$. In inflationary models with nonminimal coupling, such attractors typically arise in the strong coupling limit. To align with observational constraints, we focus on nonminimal coupling models with small coupling constants. For the model with the coupling function $\Omega(\phi) = 1 + \xi f(\phi)$ and the potential $V(\phi) = \lambda^2 f^2(\phi)$, we find that observational data constrain the parameters as $0.1 \lesssim \xi \lesssim 35$ and $0 \lesssim k \lesssim 1.5$ for $f(\phi) = \phi^k$ at the $1\sigma$ confidence level. With the help of the nonmiminal coupling $\Omega(\phi) = 1 + \xi \phi^2$, the hilltop inflation and power-law inflation models with power indices $2/3$ and $1/3$ can be consistent with observational data within the $1\sigma$ range. We also give the viable parameter regions for $\xi$ for these three models.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Information From Non-vacuum Localised Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit Hawking's black hole radiation derivation, including the quantum state of the initial matter forming the black hole. We investigate how non-vacuum initial quantum states, at the past of a black hole geometry, influence the black hole radiation observed at future null infinity $( \mathcal{I}^+)$. We further classify which of the initial state excitations are distinguishable from one another through measurements on the black hole radiation state. We use Algebraic Quantum Field Theory (AQFT) to provide a clear physical interpretation of the results, in terms of localised operations. We then take a concrete example of a black hole made of one large collapsing excitation of mass $M$ and compare it to a same-mass black hole formed due to the collapse of two smaller excitations, of mass $M/2$ each. We find using our formalism that the two cases yield different radiation states and can in principle be distinguished. Our results provide a mechanism for partial information recovery in evaporating black holes, classify what information is recoverable through stimulated emission, and a concrete understanding of the classification based on the AQFT localisation.</description>

      <title>Lecture Notes on Normalizing Flows for Lattice Quantum Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of quantum field theories on lattices serve as a fundamental tool for studying the non-perturbative regime of the theories, where analytic tools often fall short. Challenges arise when one takes the continuum limit or as the system approaches a critical point, especially in the presence of non-trivial topological structures in the theory. Rapid recent advances in machine learning provide a promising avenue for progress in this area. These lecture notes aim to give a brief account of lattice field theories, normalizing flows, and how the latter can be applied to study the former. The notes are based on the lectures given by the first author in various recent research schools.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Harvesting from Quantum Field: Insights via the Partner Formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the condition necessary for extracting entanglement from a quantum field through the use of two local modes A and B (detector modes). We show that Simon's entanglement criterion for the bipartite Gaussian state can be reformulated in terms of commutators between the canonical operators of the detector mode B and the partner mode P of the detector mode A. Using the profile representation of detector modes, we identify that harvesting is prohibited under certain specific conditions. According to analyses based on moving mirror models, Hawking radiation originates from the Milne modes at past null infinity, that reflect off at the mirror and ultimately transform into real particle modes. Drawing parallels between the Unruh effect and Hawking radiation, our findings indicate an absence of quantum correlations between ``real particles" emitted as Hawking radiation.</description>

      <title>Preparing the Gutzwiller wave function for attractive SU(3) fermions on a quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We implement the Gutzwiller wave function for attractive SU(3) fermion systems on a quantum computer using a quantum-classical hybrid scheme based on the discrete Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation. In this approach, the nonunitary Gutzwiller operator is decomposed into a linear combination of unitaries constructed from two-qubit fermionic Givens rotation gates, whose rotation angles are dictated by the auxiliary fields. We develop and reformulate two complementary methods to perform the sum over these auxiliary fields. In the first method, the Gutzwiller wave function is probabilistically prepared on the register qubits by projectively postselecting the desired state via measurements of ancilla qubits. We analyze the success rate both analytically and numerically as a function of the Gutzwiller variational parameter $g$ for the Fermi-sea and BCS-like trial states at half filling. The success rate is found to decay exponentially for small $|g|$, but remains finite in the $|g|\to\infty$ limit, with increasing $|g|$. In the second method, we employ importance sampling to address the Gutzwiller variational problem, where the central objective is to estimate the expectation values of observables. We demonstrate the proposed scheme by calculating the energy and triple occupancy of the attractive SU(3) Hubbard model in the framework of digital quantum simulation. Moreover, we present experimental results obtained on a trapped-ion quantum computer for the two-site attractive SU(3) Hubbard model, showing good agreement with exact values within statistical errors.</description>

      <title>On a lower-dimensional Killing vector origin of irreducible Killing tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Considering a spacetime foliated by co-dimension-2 hypersurfaces, we find the conditions under which lower-dimensional symmetries of a base space can be lifted up to irreducible Killing tensors of the full spacetime. In this construction, the key ingredient for irreducibility is the non-commutativity of the underlying Killing vectors. It gives rise to a tower of growing rank Killing tensors determined by the structure constants of the corresponding Lie algebra. A canonical example of a metric with such emergent non-trivial hidden symmetries in all dimensions is provided by rotating (off-shell) generalized Lense-Thirring spacetimes, where the irreducible Killing tensors arise from the underlying spherical symmetry of the base space. A physical on-shell realization of this construction in four dimensions is embodied by a rotating black hole in the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-Axion theory. Further examples of equal spinning Myers-Perry spacetimes and spacetimes built on planar and Taub-NUT base metrics are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Emergent random matrix universality in quantum operator dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The memory function description of quantum operator dynamics involves a carefully chosen split into 'fast' and 'slow' modes. An approximate model for the fast modes can then be used to solve for Green's functions $G(z)$ of the slow modes. One common approach is to form a Krylov operator basis $\{O_m \}_{m\ge 0}$, and then approximate the dynamics restricted to the 'fast space' $\{O_m \}_{m\ge n}$ for $n\gg 1$. Denoting the fast space Green's function by $G_n (z)$, in this work we prove that $G_n (z)$ exhibits universality in the $n \to \infty$ limit, approaching different universal scaling forms in different regions of the complex $z$-plane. This universality of $G_n (z)$ is precisely analogous to the universality of eigenvalue correlations in random matrix theory (RMT). At finite $z$, we show that $G_n (z)$ approaches the Wigner semicircle law, the same as the average bulk resolvent for the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble. When $G(z)$ is the Green's function of certain hydrodynamical variables, we show that at low frequencies $G_n (z)$ is instead governed by the Bessel universality class from RMT. As an application we give a new numerical method, the spectral bootstrap, for approximating spectral functions from Lanczos coefficients. Our proof is complex analytic in nature, involving a Riemann-Hilbert problem which we solve using a steepest-descent-type method, controlled in the $n\to\infty$ limit. This proof technique assumes some regularity conditions on the spectral function, and we comment on their possible connections to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. We are led via steepest-descent to a related Coulomb gas ensemble, and we discuss how a recent conjecture -- the 'Operator Growth Hypothesis' -- is linked to a confinement transition in this Coulomb gas. We then explain the implications of this criticality for the computational resources required to estimate transport coefficients.</description>

Abstract: We extend the geometric framework of field-space covariance for loop computations, thereby unifying the treatment of scalars, fermions, and gauge bosons in effective field theories. This allows us to derive a manifestly covariant formula for one-loop UV divergences that includes contributions from mixed boson-fermion graphs. The result is expressed in terms of geometric invariants of the field-space supermanifold. As a demonstration of this formula, we compute the renormalization group equations for two-fermion operators at the dimension-eight level in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory.</description>

Abstract: This research paper explores the interplay between quintessence and a cloud of strings, focusing on their influence on critical points, behaviors, and fractional-order phase transitions in AdS black holes. We analyze the thermodynamic properties of AdS black holes surrounded by quintessence and a cloud of strings, with particular attention to the effects of thermal fluctuations on their thermodynamics. Using critical conditions, we derive approximate analytical expressions for the critical points applicable to all types of these black holes. We further study the impact of the quintessence parameter and the intensity of the cloud of strings on critical behaviors, employing three-dimensional visualizations to depict these effects for different values of \(\omega_q\). Our results show how these factors affect the locations of phase transitions and the regions where both phases coexist. In addition, we examine fractional-order phase transitions, which reveal significant transformations in the black hole system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11600v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we conjecture the Coulomb branch partition function, including flux and instanton contributions, for the $\mathcal{N}=2$ vector multiplet on weighted projective space $\mathbb{CP}^2_{\boldsymbol{N}}$ for equivariant Donaldson-Witten and ``Pestun-like'' theories. We claim that this partition function agrees with the one obtained from dimensional reduction of the 5d $\mathcal{N}=1$ vector multiplet on a certain branched cover of $S^5$. More precisely, the branch locus and indices have to be such that they match the singular locus and deficit angles in $\mathbb{CP}^2_{\boldsymbol{N}}$. Our conjecture is substantiated by checking that partition functions on spindles are similarly obtained from dimensional reduction of the 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ vector multiplet on branched covers of $S^3$. This work paves the way for obtaining partition functions on more generic symplectic toric orbifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17848v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the evolution of a vacuum configuration when perturbed by an oscillon. We consider the $\phi^4$ scenario with a single scalar field only. For highly excited oscillons, we find that new composite solutions appear. They are formed by multiple antikink-kink pairs and a centered reminiscent oscillon. The overall process gives rise to a resonant structure whose pattern resembles that of a genuine kink-antikink scattering. We then approximate the initial oscillon by a lumplike profile constructed as a kink-antikink pair. We map the numerical results previously obtained. The developments proposed here may contribute to the understanding of the mechanism through which an oscillon decay reproduces the structure typically related to a kink-antikink collision.</description>

      <title>Fusion rule in conformal field theories and topological orders: A unified view of correspondence and (fractional) supersymmetry and their relation to topological holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05178v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The algebraic or ring structure of anyons called the fusion rule, is one of the most fundamental research interests in contemporary studies on topological orders (TOs) and the corresponding conformal field theories (CFTs). Recently, the algebraic structure realized as generalized symmetry, including non-invertible and categorical symmetry, captured attention in the fields. Such non-abelian anyonic objects appear in a bulk CFT or chiral CFT (CCFT), but it has been known that the construction of a CCFT contains theoretical difficulties in general. In this work, we study the structure of the fusion rule in $Z_{N}$ symmetric chiral and bulk conformal field theories and the corresponding TOs. We propose a nontrivial expression of subalgebra structure in the fusion rule of a bulk CFT. We name this subalgebra ``bulk semion". This corresponds to the fusion rule of the CCFTs and categorical symmetry of the TOs or symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT). This gives a bulk-edge correspondence based on the symmetry analysis and corresponds to an anyon algebraic expression of topological holography in the recent literature. The recent topological holography is expected to apply to systems in general space-time dimensions. Moreover, we give a concise way of unifying duality (or fractional supersymmetry), generalized or categorical symmetry, and Lagrangian subalgebra. Our method is potentially useful to formulate and study general TOs, fundamentally only from the data of bulk CFTs or vice versa, and gives a clue in understanding CCFT (or ancillary CFT more generally).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the half-sided translations associated to Rindler wedge algebras for conformal field theories in 1+1 Minkowski spacetime, generated by an unbounded operator $\mathcal{G}$, in terms of bilinear forms $G, G'$ made from entanglement Hamiltonians of the underlying algebras such that $\mathcal{G} = G+G'$. We show that despite entanglement Hamiltonians being ill-defined operators on Hilbert space, $G, G'$ can be regularized using smooth bump functions to operators $\hat{G}, \hat{G}'$ with well-defined commutators, and use them to do a centered Zassenhaus expansion of $\exp(i \mathcal{G} s)$ in terms of $\hat{G}$ and $\hat{G}'$ which is tractable and respects causality. We show that in fact half-sided translations is a special case in a large class of operators $\mathcal{O}$ for which a similar decomposition can be done by defining $\mathcal{O} = O_L+O_R$ with $O_{L}, O_{R}$ chosen approriately.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02537v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we generalize the deformations driven by the stress-energy tensor $T$ and investigate their relation to the flow equation for the background metric at the classical level. For a deformation operator $\mathcal{O}$ as a polynomial function of the stress-energy tensor, we develop a formalism that relates a deformed action to a flow equation for the metric in arbitrary spacetime dimensions. It is shown that in the $T\bar{T}$ deformation and the $\mathcal{O}(T)=\text{tr}[\textbf{T}]^m$ deformation, the flow equations for the metric allow us to directly obtain exact solutions in closed forms. We also demonstrate the perturbative approach to find the same results. As several applications of the $\mathcal{O}(T)=\text{tr}[\textbf{T}]^m$ deformation, we discuss the relation between the deformations and gravitational models. Besides, we also deform the Lagrangians for scalar field theories.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the linearized stability and causality properties of relativistic viscous superfluid hydrodynamics. The Landau-Lifshitz-Clark-Putterman formulation for the theory of relativistic viscous superfluids suffers from the same instability and acausality issues as the relativistic Navier-Stokes equation for normal fluids when written in the formulations of Eckart or Landau and Lifshitz. We show that conditions to ensure stability and causality can be satisfied with judicious redefinitions of the hydrodynamic variables. The conditions we obtain hold at non-zero superfluid velocity as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11501v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory in the $\kappa$-space-time. We derive Yang-Mills equations in the $\kappa$-deformed space-time, valid up to first order in the deformation parameter $a$, using the generalisation of Feynman's approach. We first derive the $\kappa$-deformed Wong's equation and using it, in the Jacobi identity involving velocities and coordinates of $\kappa$-deformed space-time, derive the $\kappa$-deformed homogeneous Yang-Mills equations. We also obtain expression for the $\kappa$-deformed gauge covariant derivative, valid up to first order in the deformation parameter $a$. We show the compatibility between the $\kappa$-deformed field strength derived using Jacobi identity and the commutators of gauge covariant derivative, up to first order in $a$. The $\kappa$-deformed field strength is covariant under $SU(N)$ gauge transformations as the $a$-dependent corrections come with overall multiplicative factors only, that is $\hat{F}^a_{0i} =F^a_{0i} (1-\frac{ap_0}{\hbar})$ and $\hat{F}^a_{ij} = F^a_{ij} (1-\frac{2ap_0}{\hbar})$, where $F^{a}_{\mu \nu}$ is the field strength in the commutative space-time. We found that the $a$-dependent term in the deformed Wong's equation does not contribute to the modification of Yang-Mills equation, up to first order in $a$. We then construct the Lagrangian for Yang-Mills theory in $\kappa$-deformed space-time and show that it is invariant under $SU(N)$ transformation. We also derive the expression for the force experienced by an isospin-carrying particle in the presence of Yang-Mills field in the $\kappa$-space-time.</description>

      <title>An Atlas for 3d Conformal Field Theories with a U(1) Global Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a collection of numerical bootstrap computations for 3d CFTs with a U(1) global symmetry. We test the accuracy of our method and fix conventions through a computation of bounds on the OPE coefficients for low-lying operators in the free fermion, free scalar, and generalised free vector field theories. We then compute new OPE bounds for scalar operators in the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model, $O(2)$ model, and large $N$ limit of the $O(N)$ model. Additionally, we present a number of exclusion plots for such 3d CFTs. In particular, we look at the space of even and odd parity scalar operators in the low-lying spectrum that are compatible with crossing symmetry. As well as recovering the known theories, there are some kinks that indicate new unknown theories.</description>

      <title>Mixed state entanglement in deformed field theory at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19680v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study mixed state entanglement measures in a higher dimensional $T\bar{T}$ deformed field theory at finite temperature. The holographic dual is described by AdS$_{d+1}$ black brane geometry with a finite cutoff. We compute the entanglement wedge cross section (EWCS), proposed to be dual to entanglement of purification (EoP) and holographic entanglement negativity (HEN) for strip like subsystems. The behavior of EWCS and HEN is studied across different regimes of temperature and deformation parameter. It is observed that the deformation and temperature exhibit similar effects on these two entanglement measures. Increasing the deformation leads to a decrease in the entanglement between the subsystems.</description>

      <title>The spinning self-force EFT: 1SF waveform recursion relation and Compton scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02025v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building on recent approaches, we develop an effective field theory for the interaction of spinning particles modeling Kerr black holes within the gravitational self-force expansion. To incorporate dimensional regularization into this framework, we analyze the Myers-Perry black hole and its particle description, obtaining a novel form of the corresponding linearized stress tensor. We then derive the 1SF self-force effective action up to quadratic order in the spin expansion, identifying a new type of spinning recoil term that arises from integrating out the heavy dynamics. Next, we study the 1SF metric perturbation both from the traditional self-force perspective and through the diagrammatic background field expansion, making contact with the radiative waveform. This leads us to consider a novel recursion relation for the curved space 1SF Compton amplitude, which we study up to one-loop in the wave regime and compare with the flat space one-loop Compton amplitude for Kerr up to quadratic order in spin. Finally, we investigate the 1SF spinning Compton amplitude in the eikonal regime, clarifying how strong-field effects -- such as the location of the separatrix -- emerge from the resummation of the perturbative weak-field expansion.</description>

      <title>Covariant quantization of gauge theories with Lagrange multipliers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04666v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisited the equivalence between the second- and first-order formulations of the Yang-Mills (YM) and gravity using the path integral formalism. We demonstrated that structural identities can be derived to relate Green's functions of auxiliary fields, computed in the first-order formulation, to Green's functions of composite fields in the second-order formulation. In YM theory, these identities can be verified at the integrand level of the loop integrals. For gravity, the path integral was obtained through the Faddeev-Senjanovi\'c procedure. The Senjanovi\'c determinant plays a key role in canceling tadpole-like contributions, which vanish in the dimensional regularization scheme but persist at finite temperature. Thus, the equivalence between the two formalisms is maintained at finite temperature. We also studied the coupling to matter. In YM theory, we investigated both minimal and non-minimal couplings. We derived first-order formulations, equivalent to the respective second-order formulations, by employing a procedure that introduces Lagrange multipliers (LM). This procedure can be easily generalized to gravity. We also considered an alternative gravity model, which is both renormalizable and unitary, that uses LM to restrict the loop expansion to one-loop order. However, this approach leads to a doubling of one-loop contributions due to the additional degrees of freedom associated with Ostrogradsky instabilities. To address this, we proposed a modified formalism that resolves these issues by requiring the path integral to be invariant under field redefinitions. This introduces ghost fields responsible for canceling the extra one-loop contributions arising from the LM fields, while also removing unphysical degrees of freedom. We also demonstrated that the modified formalism and the Faddeev-Popov procedure commute, indicating that the LM can be viewed as purely quantum fields.</description>

      <title>Average Spread Complexity and the Higher-Order Level Spacing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the spread complexity of a generic two-level subsystem of a larger system to analyze the influence of energy level statistics, comparing chaotic and integrable systems. Initially focusing on the nearest-neighbor level spacing, we observe the characteristic slope-dip-ramp-plateau structure. Further investigation reveals that certain matrix models exhibit additional iterative peaks, motivating us to generalize the known spacing distributions to higher-order level spacings. While this structure persists in chaotic systems, we find that integrable systems can also display similar features, highlighting limitations in using complexity as a universal diagnostic of quantum chaos.</description>

      <title>Topological defect formation in a phase transition with tunable order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01259v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) describes the non-equilibrium dynamics and topological defect formation in systems undergoing second-order phase transitions. KZM has found applications in fields such as cosmology and condensed matter physics. However, it is generally not suitable for describing first-order phase transitions. It has been demonstrated that transitions in systems like superconductors or charged superfluids, typically classified as second-order, can exhibit weakly first-order characteristics when the influence of fluctuations is taken into account. Moreover, the order of the phase transition (i.e., the extent to which it becomes first rather than second order) can be tuned. We explore quench-induced formation of topological defects in such tunable phase transitions and propose that their density can be predicted by combining KZM with nucleation theory.</description>

      <title>Skyrmion crystal phase on a magnetic domain wall in chiral magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07943v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a magnetic domain wall in the ferromagnetic phase in chiral magnets in two dimensions with an in-plane easy-axis anisotropy and an out-of-plane Zeeman magnetic field, and find a chiral soliton lattice (spiral) phase beside a ferromagnetic phase inside the domain line, where the former represents a domain-wall skyrmion crystal from the bulk point of view. We first determine the phase diagram on the domain wall by numerically constructing domain-wall solutions. We then analytically reproduce the phase diagram in a domain-wall theory (a chiral double sine-Gordon model) that we construct within the moduli approximation by treating the Zeeman magnetic field perturbatively. While we find good agreements between the phase diagrams of the numerical and effective theory methods, the numerical solution exhibits a decomposition of the topological charge into a bimeron which cannot be captured by the effective theory.</description>

      <title>Fisher Forecast of Finite-Size Effects with Future Gravitational Wave Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use Fisher information theory to forecast the bounds on the finite-size effects of astrophysical compact objects with next-generation gravitational wave detectors, including the ground-based Cosmic Explorer (CE) and Einstein Telescope (ET), as well as the space-based Laser Interferomet Space Antenna (LISA). Exploiting the worldline effective field theory (EFT) formalism, we first characterize three types of quadrupole finite-size effects: the spin-induced quadrupole moments, the conservative tidal deformations, and the tidal heating. We then derive the corresponding contributions to the gravitational waveform phases for binary compact objects in aligned-spin quasi-circular orbits. We separately estimate the constraints on these finite-size effects for black holes using the power spectral densities (PSDs) of the CE+ET detector network and LISA observations. For the CE+ET network, we find that the bounds on the mass-weighted spin-independent dissipation number $H_0$ are of the order $O(1)$, while the bounds on the mass-weighted tidal Love number $\tilde{\Lambda}$ are of the order $O(10)$. For high-spin binary black holes with dimensionless spin $\chi \simeq 0.8$, the bounds on the symmetric spin-induced quadrupole moment $\kappa_s$ are of the order $O(10^{-1})$. LISA observations of supermassive black hole mergers offer slightly tighter constraints on all three finite-size parameters. Additionally, we perform a Fisher analysis for a binary neutron star merger within the CE+ET network. The bounds on the tidal parameter $H_0$ and on $\tilde \Lambda$ are around two orders of magnitude better than the current LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) bounds.</description>

      <title>Locating Critical Points Using Ratios of Lee-Yang Zeros</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19345v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to numerically determine the location of a critical point in general systems using the finite-size scaling of Lee-Yang zeros. This method makes use of the fact that the ratios of Lee-Yang zeros on various spatial volumes intersect at the critical point. While the method is similar to the Binder-cumulant analysis, it is advantageous in suppressing the finite-volume effects arising from the mixing of variables in general systems. We show that the method works successfully for numerically locating the CP in the three-dimensional three-state Potts model with a nonzero external field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02748v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay of generalized global symmetries in 2+1 dimensions in a lattice model that couples a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ clock model to a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ gauge theory via a topological interaction. This coupling binds the charges of one symmetry to the disorder operators of the other, and when these composite objects condense, they give rise to emergent generalized symmetries with mixed 't Hooft anomalies. These anomalies result in phases with ordinary symmetry breaking, topological order, and symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order, where the different types of order are not independent but intimately related. We further explore the gapped boundary states of these exotic phases and develop theories for phase transitions between them. Additionally, we extend this lattice model to incorporate a non-invertible global symmetry, which can be spontaneously broken, leading to domain walls with non-trivial fusion rules.</description>

      <title>Gravitational focusing and horizon entropy for higher-spin fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previously, the Raychaudhuri equation and the focusing theorem in General Relativity were generalised to diffeomorphism-invariant theories of gravity coupled to scalar and vector fields on linearly perturbed Killing horizons. The Wall entropy can be extracted from the generalised focusing equation and it satisfies the first and the second laws of thermodynamics. In this paper, we further extend the discussion of gravitational focusing on the horizon to include arbitrary bosonic fields with spin $s \geq 2$. These higher-spin fields introduce indefinite terms into the generalised focusing equation, obstructing the proof of the focusing theorem and the existence of an increasing horizon entropy. To resolve this issue, we propose a higher-spin focusing condition that eliminates these indefinite terms, thereby restoring the focusing theorem and the associated thermodynamic laws. We speculate that the focusing condition could be a necessary condition for the physical consistency of higher-spin theories.</description>

Abstract: We review the shift (translation) and time reversal symmetries of Hamiltonian staggered fermions and their connection to continuum symmetries concentrating in particular on the case of massless fermions and (3+1) dimensions. We construct operators using the staggered fields that implement these symmetries on finite lattices. We show that shifts composed of an odd multiple of the elementary shift anti-commute with time reversal and are related to continuum axial transformations. We argue that the presence of these non-trivial commutators implies the existence of exact lattice 't Hooft anomalies.</description>

      <title>Bipartite Fluctuations and Charge Fractionalization in Quantum Wires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a quantum information method for measuring fractional charges in ballistic quantum wires generalizing bipartite fluctuations to the chiral quasiparticles in Luttinger liquids. This is equivalent to add charge and current fluctuations in a region of the wire. This reveals from an equilibrium approach the entangled nature of the two counter-propagating fractional charges associated to the same electron in the system. Bipartite fluctuations at equilibrium are characterized through a logarithmic scaling with distance encoding the entangled nature of these fractional charges in one-dimensional (1D) fluids. This approach also clarifies the physical meaning of the dephasing factor of electronic interferences in a ring geometry at zero temperature from a space-time correspondence in 1D. We formulate an analogy towards ground-state energetics. We show how bipartite current fluctuations represent a useful tool to locate quantum phase transitions associated to Mott physics. We address a spin chain equivalence and verify the fractional charges through an algorithm such as Density Matrix Renormalization Group. Adding a potential difference between the two sides (parties) of the wire, also we show how bipartite fluctuations can detect the presence of a bound state localized at the interface through the Jackiw-Rebbi model coexisting with fractional charges.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we analyze a scalar field model which gives rise to stable bound states in field space characterized by nonzero motion that breaks the underlying time translation symmetry of its Hamiltonian, known as time crystals. We demonstrate that an ideal fluid made up of these time crystals behaves as phantom dark energy characterized by an equation of state $w \le -1$, speed of sound squared $c_{s}^{2} &gt; 0$, and nonnegative energy density $\rho \ge 0$.</description>

Abstract: We show how to compute the probability distributions of the order parameter of the $O(n)$ model at two-loop order of perturbation theory generalizing the methods developed for computing the same in case of the Ising model \cite{Sahu:2025bkp}. We show that even for the $O(n)$ model, there exists not one but a family of these probability distribution functions indexed by $\zeta$ which is the ratio of system size $L$ to the bulk correlation length $\xi_{\infty}$. We also compare these PDFs to the Monte-Carlo simulations and the existing FRG results \cite{Rancon:2025bjf} for the $O(2)$ and $O(3)$ models.</description>
