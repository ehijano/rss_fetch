      <title>Laplacian eigenvalues with a large negative Robin parameter on a part of the boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Laplacian eigenvalues for smooth planar domains with strongly attractive Robin conditions imposed on a part of the boundary and Neumann condition on the remaining boundary. The asymptotics of individual eigenvalues is described in terms of an effective operator on an interval with boundary conditions at the endpoints. For several typical geometries a more precise asymptotics in terms of the boundary curvature is obtained.</description>

      <title>The pseudospectrum of an operator with Bessel-type singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we examine the asymptotic structure of the pseudospectrum of the singular Sturm-Liouville operator $L=\partial_x(f\partial_x)+\partial_x$ subject to periodic boundary conditions on a symmetric interval, where the coefficient $f$ is a regular odd function that has only a simple zero at the origin. The operator $L$ is closely related to a remarkable model examined by Davies in 2007, which exhibits surprising spectral properties balancing symmetries and strong non-self-adjointness. In our main result, we derive a concrete construction of classical pseudo-modes for $L$ and give explicit exponential bounds of growth for the resolvent norm in rays away from the spectrum.</description>

      <title>The phenomenon of revivals on complex potential Schr\"odinger's equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mysterious phenomena of revivals in linear dispersive periodic equations was discovered first experimentally in optics in the 19th century, then rediscovered several times by theoretical and experimental investigations. While the term has been used systematically and consistently by many authors, there is no consensus on a rigorous definition. In this paper, we describe revivals modulo a regularity condition in a large class of Schr\"odinger's equations with complex bounded potentials. As we show, at rational times the solution is given explicitly by finite linear combinations of translations and dilations of the initial datum, plus an additional continuous term.</description>

      <title>Leveraging advances in machine learning for the robust classification and interpretation of networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to simulate realistic networks based on empirical data is an important task across scientific disciplines, from epidemiology to computer science. Often simulation approaches involve selecting a suitable network generative model such as Erd\"os-R\'enyi or small-world. However, few tools are available to quantify if a particular generative model is suitable for capturing a given network structure or organization. We utilize advances in interpretable machine learning to classify simulated networks by our generative models based on various network attributes, using both primary features and their interactions. Our study underscores the significance of specific network features and their interactions in distinguishing generative models, comprehending complex network structures, and the formation of real-world networks.</description>
