      <title>WavChat: A Survey of Spoken Dialogue Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in spoken dialogue models, exemplified by systems like GPT-4o, have captured significant attention in the speech domain. Compared to traditional three-tier cascaded spoken dialogue models that comprise speech recognition (ASR), large language models (LLMs), and text-to-speech (TTS), modern spoken dialogue models exhibit greater intelligence. These advanced spoken dialogue models not only comprehend audio, music, and other speech-related features, but also capture stylistic and timbral characteristics in speech. Moreover, they generate high-quality, multi-turn speech responses with low latency, enabling real-time interaction through simultaneous listening and speaking capability. Despite the progress in spoken dialogue systems, there is a lack of comprehensive surveys that systematically organize and analyze these systems and the underlying technologies. To address this, we have first compiled existing spoken dialogue systems in the chronological order and categorized them into the cascaded and end-to-end paradigms. We then provide an in-depth overview of the core technologies in spoken dialogue models, covering aspects such as speech representation, training paradigm, streaming, duplex, and interaction capabilities. Each section discusses the limitations of these technologies and outlines considerations for future research. Additionally, we present a thorough review of relevant datasets, evaluation metrics, and benchmarks from the perspectives of training and evaluating spoken dialogue systems. We hope this survey will contribute to advancing both academic research and industrial applications in the field of spoken dialogue systems.

      <title>Sequence-to-Sequence Neural Diarization with Automatic Speaker Detection and Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel Sequence-to-Sequence Neural Diarization (SSND) framework to perform online and offline speaker diarization. It is developed from the sequence-to-sequence architecture of our previous target-speaker voice activity detection system and then evolves into a new diarization paradigm by addressing two critical problems. 1) Speaker Detection: The proposed approach can utilize incompletely given speaker embeddings to discover the unknown speaker and predict the target voice activities in the audio signal. It does not require a prior diarization system for speaker enrollment in advance. 2) Speaker Representation: The proposed approach can adopt the predicted voice activities as reference information to extract speaker embeddings from the audio signal simultaneously. The representation space of speaker embedding is jointly learned within the whole diarization network without using an extra speaker embedding model. During inference, the SSND framework can process long audio recordings blockwise. The detection module utilizes the previously obtained speaker-embedding buffer to predict both enrolled and unknown speakers' voice activities for each coming audio block. Next, the speaker-embedding buffer is updated according to the predictions of the representation module. Assuming that up to one new speaker may appear in a small block shift, our model iteratively predicts the results of each block and extracts target embeddings for the subsequent blocks until the signal ends. Finally, the last speaker-embedding buffer can re-score the entire audio, achieving highly accurate diarization performance as an offline system. (......)</description>

      <title>Single-Model Attribution for Spoofed Speech via Vocoder Fingerprints in an Open-World Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As speech generation technology advances, so do the potential threats of misusing spoofed speech signals. One way to address these threats is by attributing the signals to their source generative model. In this work, we are the first to tackle the single-model attribution task in an open-world setting, that is, we aim at identifying whether spoofed speech signals from unknown sources originate from a specific vocoder. We show that the standardized average residual between audio signals and their low-pass filtered or EnCodec filtered versions can serve as powerful vocoder fingerprints. The approach only requires data from the target vocoder and allows for simple but highly accurate distance-based model attribution. We demonstrate its effectiveness on LJSpeech and JSUT, achieving an average AUROC of over 99% in most settings. The accompanying robustness study shows that it is also resilient to noise levels up to a certain degree.</description>

      <title>BEST-STD: Bidirectional Mamba-Enhanced Speech Tokenization for Spoken Term Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spoken term detection (STD) is often hindered by reliance on frame-level features and the computationally intensive DTW-based template matching, limiting its practicality. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that encodes speech into discrete, speaker-agnostic semantic tokens. This facilitates fast retrieval using text-based search algorithms and effectively handles out-of-vocabulary terms. Our approach focuses on generating consistent token sequences across varying utterances of the same term. We also propose a bidirectional state space modeling within the Mamba encoder, trained in a self-supervised learning framework, to learn contextual frame-level features that are further encoded into discrete tokens. Our analysis shows that our speech tokens exhibit greater speaker invariance than those from existing tokenizers, making them more suitable for STD tasks. Empirical evaluation on LibriSpeech and TIMIT databases indicates that our method outperforms existing STD baselines while being more efficient.</description>

      <title>MVANet: Multi-Stage Video Attention Network for Sound Event Localization and Detection with Source Distance Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sound event localization and detection with source distance estimation (3D SELD) involves not only identifying the sound category and its direction-of-arrival (DOA) but also predicting the source's distance, aiming to provide full information about the sound position. This paper proposes a multi-stage video attention network (MVANet) for audio-visual (AV) 3D SELD. Multi-stage audio features are used to adaptively capture the spatial information of sound sources in videos. We propose a novel output representation that combines the DOA with distance of sound sources by calculating the real Cartesian coordinates to address the newly introduced source distance estimation (SDE) task in the Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) 2024 Challenge. We also employ a variety of effective data augmentation and pre-training methods. Experimental results on the STARSS23 dataset have proven the effectiveness of our proposed MVANet. By integrating the aforementioned techniques, our system outperforms the top-ranked method we used in the AV 3D SELD task of the DCASE 2024 Challenge without model ensemble. The code will be made publicly available in the future.</description>

      <title>Tiny-Align: Bridging Automatic Speech Recognition and Large Language Model on the Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The combination of Large Language Models (LLM) and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), when deployed on edge devices (called edge ASR-LLM), can serve as a powerful personalized assistant to enable audio-based interaction for users. Compared to text-based interaction, edge ASR-LLM allows accessible and natural audio interactions. Unfortunately, existing ASR-LLM models are mainly trained in high-performance computing environments and produce substantial model weights, making them difficult to deploy on edge devices. More importantly, to better serve users' personalized needs, the ASR-LLM must be able to learn from each distinct user, given that audio input often contains highly personalized characteristics that necessitate personalized on-device training. Since individually fine-tuning the ASR or LLM often leads to suboptimal results due to modality-specific limitations, end-to-end training ensures seamless integration of audio features and language understanding (cross-modal alignment), ultimately enabling a more personalized and efficient adaptation on edge devices. However, due to the complex training requirements and substantial computational demands of existing approaches, cross-modal alignment between ASR audio and LLM can be challenging on edge devices. In this work, we propose a resource-efficient cross-modal alignment framework that bridges ASR and LLMs on edge devices to handle personalized audio input. Our framework enables efficient ASR-LLM alignment on resource-constrained devices like NVIDIA Jetson Orin (8GB RAM), achieving 50x training time speedup while improving the alignment quality by more than 50\%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to study efficient ASR-LLM alignment on resource-constrained edge devices.</description>

      <title>X-CrossNet: A complex spectral mapping approach to target speaker extraction with cross attention speaker embedding fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Target speaker extraction (TSE) is a technique for isolating a target speaker's voice from mixed speech using auxiliary features associated with the target speaker. This approach addresses the cocktail party problem and is generally considered more promising for practical applications than conventional speech separation methods. Although academic research in this area has achieved high accuracy and evaluation scores on public datasets, most models exhibit significantly reduced performance in real-world noisy or reverberant conditions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel TSE model, X-CrossNet, which leverages CrossNet as its backbone. CrossNet is a speech separation network specifically optimized for challenging noisy and reverberant environments, achieving state-of-the-art performance in tasks such as speaker separation under these conditions. Additionally, to enhance the network's ability to capture and utilize auxiliary features of the target speaker, we integrate a Cross-Attention mechanism into the global multi-head self-attention (GMHSA) module within each CrossNet block. This facilitates more effective integration of target speaker features with mixed speech features. Experimental results show that our method performs superior separation on the WSJ0-2mix and WHAMR! datasets, demonstrating strong robustness and stability.</description>

      <title>HARP: A Large-Scale Higher-Order Ambisonic Room Impulse Response Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This contribution introduces a dataset of 7th-order Ambisonic Room Impulse Responses (HOA-RIRs), created using the Image Source Method. By employing higher-order Ambisonics, our dataset enables precise spatial audio reproduction, a critical requirement for realistic immersive audio applications. Leveraging the virtual simulation, we present a unique microphone configuration, based on the superposition principle, designed to optimize sound field coverage while addressing the limitations of traditional microphone arrays. The presented 64-microphone configuration allows us to capture RIRs directly in the Spherical Harmonics domain. The dataset features a wide range of room configurations, encompassing variations in room geometry, acoustic absorption materials, and source-receiver distances. A detailed description of the simulation setup is provided alongside for an accurate reproduction. The dataset serves as a vital resource for researchers working on spatial audio, particularly in applications involving machine learning to improve room acoustics modeling and sound field synthesis. It further provides a very high level of spatial resolution and realism crucial for tasks such as source localization, reverberation prediction, and immersive sound reproduction.</description>

      <title>Attention-Based Audio Embeddings for Query-by-Example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.08624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An ideal audio retrieval system efficiently and robustly recognizes a short query snippet from an extensive database. However, the performance of well-known audio fingerprinting systems falls short at high signal distortion levels. This paper presents an audio retrieval system that generates noise and reverberation robust audio fingerprints using the contrastive learning framework. Using these fingerprints, the method performs a comprehensive search to identify the query audio and precisely estimate its timestamp in the reference audio. Our framework involves training a CNN to maximize the similarity between pairs of embeddings extracted from clean audio and its corresponding distorted and time-shifted version. We employ a channel-wise spectral-temporal attention mechanism to better discriminate the audio by giving more weight to the salient spectral-temporal patches in the signal. Experimental results indicate that our system is efficient in computation and memory usage while being more accurate, particularly at higher distortion levels, than competing state-of-the-art systems and scalable to a larger database.</description>

      <title>PixIT: Joint Training of Speaker Diarization and Speech Separation from Real-world Multi-speaker Recordings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A major drawback of supervised speech separation (SSep) systems is their reliance on synthetic data, leading to poor real-world generalization. Mixture invariant training (MixIT) was proposed as an unsupervised alternative that uses real recordings, yet struggles with overseparation and adapting to long-form audio. We introduce PixIT, a joint approach that combines permutation invariant training (PIT) for speaker diarization (SD) and MixIT for SSep. With a small extra requirement of needing SD labels, it solves the problem of overseparation and allows stitching local separated sources leveraging existing work on clustering-based neural SD. We measure the quality of the separated sources via applying automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems to them. PixIT boosts the performance of various ASR systems across two meeting corpora both in terms of the speaker-attributed and utterance-based word error rates while not requiring any fine-tuning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06371v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present mHuBERT-147, the first general-purpose massively multilingual HuBERT speech representation model trained on 90K hours of clean, open-license data. To scale up the multi-iteration HuBERT approach, we use faiss-based clustering, achieving 5.2x faster label assignment than the original method. We also apply a new multilingual batching up-sampling strategy, leveraging both language and dataset diversity. After 3 training iterations, our compact 95M parameter mHuBERT-147 outperforms larger models trained on substantially more data. We rank second and first on the ML-SUPERB 10min and 1h leaderboards, with SOTA scores for 3 tasks. Across ASR/LID tasks, our model consistently surpasses XLS-R (300M params; 436K hours) and demonstrates strong competitiveness against the much larger MMS (1B params; 491K hours). Our findings indicate that mHuBERT-147 is a promising model for multilingual speech tasks, offering an unprecedented balance between high performance and parameter efficiency.</description>

      <title>Classification of Heart Sounds Using Multi-Branch Deep Convolutional Network and LSTM-CNN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10689v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a fast and cost-effective method for diagnosing cardiac abnormalities with high accuracy and reliability using low-cost systems in clinics. The primary limitation of automatic diagnosing of cardiac diseases is the rarity of correct and acceptable labeled samples, which can be expensive to prepare. To address this issue, two methods are proposed in this work. The first method is a unique Multi-Branch Deep Convolutional Neural Network (MBDCN) architecture inspired by human auditory processing, specifically designed to optimize feature extraction by employing various sizes of convolutional filters and audio signal power spectrum as input. In the second method, called as Long short-term memory-Convolutional Neural (LSCN) model, Additionally, the network architecture includes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network blocks to improve feature extraction in the time domain. The innovative approach of combining multiple parallel branches consisting of the one-dimensional convolutional layers along with LSTM blocks helps in achieving superior results in audio signal processing tasks. The experimental results demonstrate superiority of the proposed methods over the state-of-the-art techniques. The overall classification accuracy of heart sounds with the LSCN network is more than 96%. The efficiency of this network is significant compared to common feature extraction methods such as Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and wavelet transform. Therefore, the proposed method shows promising results in the automatic analysis of heart sounds and has potential applications in the diagnosis and early detection of cardiovascular diseases.</description>

      <title>A Transformer Model for Segmentation, Classification, and Caller Identification of Marmoset Vocalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23279v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Marmoset, a highly vocalized primate, has become a popular animal model for studying social-communicative behavior and its underlying mechanism comparing with human infant linguistic developments. In the study of vocal communication, it is vital to know the caller identities, call contents, and vocal exchanges. Previous work of a CNN has achieved a joint model for call segmentation, classification, and caller identification for marmoset vocalizations. However, the CNN has limitations in modeling long-range acoustic patterns; the Transformer architecture that has been shown to outperform CNNs, utilizes the self-attention mechanism that efficiently segregates information parallelly over long distances and captures the global structure of marmoset vocalization. We propose using the Transformer to jointly segment and classify the marmoset calls and identify the callers for each vocalization.</description>

Abstract: Rapidly developing large language models (LLMs) have brought tremendous intelligent applications. Especially, the GPT-4o's excellent duplex speech interaction ability has brought impressive experience to users. Researchers have recently proposed several multi-modal LLMs in this direction that can achieve user-agent speech-to-speech conversations. This paper proposes a novel speech-text multimodal LLM architecture called Freeze-Omni. Our main contribution is that the speech input and output modalities can be easily connected to a textual LLM while keeping the LLM's parameters frozen throughout the training process. We design a three-stage training strategy for modeling both the speech input and output, enabling Freeze-Omni to obtain speech-to-speech conversation ability using text-speech paired data (such as ASR and TTS data) and only 60,000 multi-round text Q&amp;A data on 8 GPUs. Moreover, we can effectively ensure that the intelligence of the Freeze-Omni in the speech modality is at the same level compared with that in the text modality of its backbone LLM, while achieving low latency end-to-end spoken response. In addition, we also designed a method to achieve duplex dialogue ability through multi-task training, giving Freeze-Omni a more natural style of dialogue ability between users and agents. In summary, Freeze-Omni holds great potential to conduct speech-to-speech dialogue based on a multimodal LLM under the condition of a frozen LLM, avoiding the catastrophic forgetting problem caused by limited data and training resources.</description>

Abstract: The field of AI-assisted music creation has made significant strides, yet existing systems often struggle to meet the demands of iterative and nuanced music production. These challenges include providing sufficient control over the generated content and allowing for flexible, precise edits. This thesis tackles these issues by introducing a series of advancements that progressively build upon each other, enhancing the controllability and editability of text-to-music generation models.
  First, we introduce Loop Copilot, a system that tries to address the need for iterative refinement in music creation. Loop Copilot leverages a large language model (LLM) to coordinate multiple specialised AI models, enabling users to generate and refine music interactively through a conversational interface. Central to this system is the Global Attribute Table, which records and maintains key musical attributes throughout the iterative process, ensuring that modifications at any stage preserve the overall coherence of the music. While Loop Copilot excels in orchestrating the music creation process, it does not directly address the need for detailed edits to the generated content.
  To overcome this limitation, MusicMagus is presented as a further solution for editing AI-generated music. MusicMagus introduces a zero-shot text-to-music editing approach that allows for the modification of specific musical attributes, such as genre, mood, and instrumentation, without the need for retraining. By manipulating the latent space within pre-trained diffusion models, MusicMagus ensures that these edits are stylistically coherent and that non-targeted attributes remain unchanged. This system is particularly effective in maintaining the structural integrity of the music during edits, but it encounters challenges with more complex and real-world audio scenarios.
