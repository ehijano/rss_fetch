      <title>A Deep Learning Framework for Joint Channel Acquisition and Communication Optimization in Movable Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end deep learning framework in a movable antenna (MA)-enabled multiuser communication system. In contrast to the conventional works assuming perfect channel state information (CSI), we address the practical CSI acquisition issue through the design of pilot signals and quantized CSI feedback, and further incorporate the joint optimization of channel estimation, MA placement, and precoding design. The proposed mechanism enables the system to learn an optimized transmission strategy from imperfect channel data, overcoming the limitations of conventional methods that conduct channel estimation and antenna position optimization separately. To balance the performance and overhead, we further extend the proposed framework to optimize the antenna placement based on the statistical CSI. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently outperforms traditional benchmarks in terms of achievable sum-rate of users, especially under limited feedback and sparse channel environments. Notably, it achieves a performance comparable to the widely-adopted gradient-based methods with perfect CSI, while maintaining significantly lower CSI feedback overhead. These results highlight the effectiveness and adaptability of learning-based MA system design for future wireless systems.</description>

      <title>MAGNET-KG: Maximum-Entropy Geometric Networks for Temporal Knowledge Graphs: Theoretical Foundations and Mathematical Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified theoretical framework for temporal knowledge graphs grounded in maximum-entropy principles, differential geometry, and information theory. We prove a unique characterization of scoring functions via the maximum-entropy principle and establish necessity theorems for specific geometric choices. We further provide rigorous derivations of generalization bounds with explicit constants and outline conditions under which consistency guarantees hold under temporal dependence. The framework establishes principled foundations for temporal knowledge graph modeling with formal connections to differential geometric methods.</description>

      <title>Uniquely-Decodable Coding for Zero-Error Network Function Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider uniquely-decodable coding for zero-error network function computation, where in a directed acyclic graph, the single sink node is required to compute with zero error a target function multiple times, whose arguments are the information sources generated at a set of source nodes. We are interested in the computing capacity from the information theoretic point of view, which is defined as the infimum of the maximum expected number of bits transmitted on all the edges for computing the target function once on average. We first prove some new results on clique entropy, in particular, the substitution lemma of clique entropy for probabilistic graphs with a certain condition. With them, we prove a lower bound on the computing capacity associated with clique entropies of the induced characteristic graphs, where the obtained lower bound is applicable to arbitrary network topologies, arbitrary information sources, and arbitrary target functions. By refining the probability distribution of information sources, we further strictly improve the obtained lower bound. In addition, we compare uniquely-decodable network function-computing coding and fixed-length network function-computing coding, and show that the former indeed outperforms the latter in terms of the computing capacity. Therein, we provide a novel graph-theoretic explanation of the key parameter in the best known bound on the computing capacity for fixed-length network function-computing codes, which would be helpful to improve the existing results.</description>

      <title>A Broadcast Channel Framework for MIMO-OFDM Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is expected to be one of the major features of 6G wireless networks. In an ISAC system, communications and sensing functionalities are jointly performed using the same waveform, frequency band and hardware, thereby enabling various use cases such as in cyber physical systems, digital twin and smart cities. A major challenge to the design and analysis of ISAC is a unified framework that incorporates the two distinct functions. By viewing ISAC as a type of broadcast channel, in this paper, we propose a unified ISAC framework in which communication and sensing signals are broadcast to the actual communication users and virtual sensing users. This framework allows the application of existing multiplexing schemes, such as dirty paper coding (DPC) and frequency division multiplexing (FDM) that have been intensively studied in data communications and information theory. Within this framework, we propose different superposition coding schemes, for cases when the sensing waveform is known or unknown to the communication receiver. We propose the waveform optimization algorithms in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) setting accounting for the effects of clutter and Doppler shift. The proposed framework is numerically evaluated for different schemes under various sensing and communications performance metrics.</description>

      <title>Detectability Thresholds for Network Attacks on Static Graphs and Temporal Networks: Information-Theoretic Limits and Nearly-Optimal Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a consolidated theory for the detectability of network-borne attacks under two canonical observation models: (i) a static graph drawn from an Erdos-Renyi background with a planted anomalous community, and (ii) a temporal interaction network modeled by multivariate point processes (Poisson or Hawkes). Our main contribution is to match, up to universal constants, information-theoretic lower and upper bounds that govern when reliable testing is possible. In the static case, the core quantity is the accumulated edgewise signal k^2 * chi^2(Bern(p+Delta) || Bern(p)), where chi^2 ~ Delta^2 / [p(1-p)] for small Delta; detection is impossible when this falls below c * log n, and a non-backtracking spectral statistic succeeds above C * log n. In the temporal case, detectability is controlled by the KL information rate I contributed by internal edges over a window of length T, yielding a threshold T I &gt;= log n; a likelihood-based cumulative-sum (CUSUM) test achieves first-order optimal delay approximately abs(log alpha) / I at false-alarm level alpha. We also quantify robustness to bounded edge perturbations and outline conditional statistical-computational separations. A brief case study shows how to turn these bounds into concrete design choices.</description>

      <title>Rate-Distortion Limits for Multimodal Retrieval: Theory, Optimal Codes, and Finite-Sample Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the first information-theoretic limits for multimodal retrieval. Casting ranking as lossy source coding, we derive a single-letter rate-distortion function $R(D)$ for reciprocal-rank distortion and prove a converse bound that splits into a modality-balanced term plus a skew penalty $\kappa\,\Delta H$ capturing entropy imbalance and cross-modal redundancy. We then construct an explicit entropy-weighted stochastic quantizer with an adaptive, per-modality temperature decoder; a Blahut-Arimoto argument shows this scheme achieves distortion within $O(n^{-1})$ of $R(D)$ using $n$ training triples. A VC-type analysis yields the first finite-sample excess-risk bound whose complexity scales sub-linearly in both the number of modalities and the entropy gap. Experiments on controlled Gaussian mixtures and Flickr30k confirm that our adaptive codes sit within two percentage points of the theoretical frontier, while fixed-temperature and naive CLIP baselines lag significantly. Taken together, our results give a principled answer to "how many bits per query are necessary" for high-quality multimodal retrieval and provide design guidance for entropy-aware contrastive objectives, continual-learning retrievers, and retrieval-augmented generators.</description>

      <title>Active Sequential Hypothesis Testing with Non-Homogeneous Costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Non-Homogeneous Sequential Hypothesis Testing (NHSHT), where a single active Decision-Maker (DM) selects actions with heterogeneous positive costs to identify the true hypothesis under an average error constraint \(\delta\), while minimizing expected total cost paid. Under standard arguments, we show that the objective decomposes into the product of the mean number of samples and the mean per-action cost induced by the policy. This leads to a key design principle: one should optimize the ratio of expectations (expected information gain per expected cost) rather than the expectation of per-step information-per-cost ("bit-per-buck"), which can be suboptimal. We adapt the Chernoff scheme to NHSHT, preserving its classical \(\log 1/\delta\) scaling. In simulations, the adapted scheme reduces mean cost by up to 50\% relative to the classic Chernoff policy and by up to 90\% relative to the naive bit-per-buck heuristic.</description>

      <title>Task-Agnostic Learnable Weighted-Knowledge Base Scheme for Robust Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the emergence of diverse and massive data in the upcoming sixth-generation (6G) networks, the task-agnostic semantic communication system is regarded to provide robust intelligent services. In this paper, we propose a task-agnostic learnable weighted-knowledge base semantic communication (TALSC) framework for robust image transmission to address the real-world heterogeneous data bias in KB, including label flipping noise and class imbalance. The TALSC framework incorporates a sample confidence module (SCM) as meta-learner and the semantic coding networks as learners. The learners are updated based on the empirical knowledge provided by the learnable weighted-KB (LW-KB). Meanwhile, the meta-learner evaluates the significance of samples according to the task loss feedback, and adjusts the update strategy of learners to enhance the robustness in semantic recovery for unknown tasks. To strike a balance between SCM parameters and precision of significance evaluation, we design an SCM-grid extension (SCM-GE) approach by embedding the Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KAN) within SCM, which leverages the concept of spline refinement in KAN and enables scalable SCM with customizable granularity without retraining. Simulations demonstrate that the TALSC framework effectively mitigates the effects of flipping noise and class imbalance in task-agnostic image semantic communication, achieving at least 12% higher semantic recovery accuracy (SRA) and multi-scale structural similarity (MS-SSIM) compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Reflexive Partitions Induced by Rank Support and Non-Reflexive Partitions Induced by Rank Weight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study partitions of finite modules induced by rank support and rank weight. First, we show that partitions induced by rank support are mutually dual with respect to suitable non-degenerate pairings, and hence are reflexive; moreover, we compute the associated generalized Krawtchouk matrices. Similar results are established for partitions induced by isomorphic relation of rank support. These results generalize counterpart results established for row space partitions and rank partitions of matrix spaces over finite fields. Next, we show that partitions of free modules over a finite chain ring $R$ induced by rank weight are non-reflexive provided that $R$ is not a field; moreover, we characterize the dual partitions explicitly. As a corollary, we show that rank partitions of matrix spaces over $R$ are reflexive if and only if $R$ is a field; moreover, two matrices belong to the same member of the dual partition if and only if their transposes are equivalent. In particular, we show that opposite to matrices over finite fields, rank metric does not induce an association scheme provided that $R$ is not a field, which further settles an open question proposed by Blanco-Chac\'{o}n, Boix, Greferath and Hieta-Aho in \cite{2}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [4] we describe a variation of the classical permutation decoding algorithm that can be applied to any binary affine-invariant code; in particular, it can be applied to first-order Reed-Muller codes successfully. In this paper we study how to implement it for the family of first-order Generalized Reed-Muller codes. Then, we give examples which show that we improve the number of errors we can correct in comparison with the known results for this family of codes. Finally, we deal, from a probabilistic point of view, with the problem of determining when the algorithm only needs to use a smaller PD-like set.</description>

      <title>Energy Efficiency Maximization for Movable Antenna-Enhanced MIMO Downlink System Based on S-CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an innovative movable antenna (MA)-enhanced multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) downlink system. We aim to maximize the energy efficiency (EE) under statistical channel state information (S-CSI) through a joint optimization of the precoding matrix and the antenna position vectors (APVs). To solve the resulting stochastic problem, we first resort to deterministic equivalent (DE) tecnology to formulate the deterministic minorizing function of the system EE and the deterministic function of each user terminal (UT)'s average achievable rate w.r.t. the transmit variables (i.e., the precoding matrix and the transmit APV) and the corresponding receive APV, respectively. Then, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm to alternatively optimize the transmit variables and the receive APVs to maximize the formulated deterministic objective functions, respectively. Finally, the above AO algorithm is tailored for the single-user scenario. Our numerical results reveal that, the proposed MA-enhanced system can significantly improve the system EE compared to several benchmark schemes based on the S-CSI and the optimal performance can be achieved with a finite size of movement regions for MAs.</description>

      <title>Secure Semantic Communication over Wiretap Channels: Rate-Distortion-Equivocation Tradeoff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates an information-theoretic model of secure semantic-aware communication. For this purpose, we consider the lossy joint source-channel coding (JSCC) of a memoryless semantic source transmitted over a memoryless wiretap channel. The source consists of two correlated parts that represent semantic and observed aspects of the information. Our model assumes separate fidelity and secrecy constraints on each source component and, in addition, encompasses two cases for the source output, in order to evaluate the performance gains if the encoder has an extended access to the source. Specifically, in Case 1, the encoder has direct access only to the samples from a single (observed) source component, while in Case 2 it has additional direct access to the samples of the underlaying semantic information. We derive single-letter converse and achievability bounds on the rate-distortion-equivocation region. The converse bound explicitly contains rate-distortion functions, making it easy to evaluate, especially for some common distributions. The proposed achievability coding scheme involves novel stochastic superposition coding with two private parts to enable analysis of the equivocation for each source component, separately. Our results generalise some of the previously established source and source-channel coding problems. The general results are further specialised to Gaussian and Bernoulli sources transmitted over Gaussian and binary wiretap channels, respectively. The numerical evaluations illustrate the derived bounds for these distributions.</description>

      <title>Agentic DDQN-Based Scheduling for Licensed and Unlicensed Band Allocation in Sidelink Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an agentic artificial intelligence (AI)-driven double deep Q-network (DDQN) scheduling framework for licensed and unlicensed band allocation in New Radio (NR) sidelink (SL) networks. SL must share licensed spectrum with cellular communications (CC) and unlicensed bands with Wi-Fi, posing significant challenges for coexistence. Unlike prior rule-based or threshold-based methods, the proposed agentic scheduler autonomously perceives queueing dynamics, channel conditions, and coexistence states, and adapts its policy to maintain quality-of-service (QoS). Simulation results show that our framework reduces the blocking rate by up to 87.5% compared to threshold-based scheduling under limited licensed bandwidth. These findings demonstrate the potential of Agentic AI to enable stable, QoS-aware, and adaptive scheduling for future NR SL systems.</description>

      <title>Green Learning for STAR-RIS mmWave Systems with Implicit CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a green learning (GL)-based precoding framework is proposed for simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS)-aided millimeter-wave (mmWave) MIMO broadcasting systems. Motivated by the growing emphasis on environmental sustainability in future 6G networks, this work adopts a broadcasting transmission architecture for scenarios where multiple users share identical information, improving spectral efficiency and reducing redundant transmissions and power consumption. Different from conventional optimization methods, such as block coordinate descent (BCD) that require perfect channel state information (CSI) and iterative computation, the proposed GL framework operates directly on received uplink pilot signals without explicit CSI estimation. Unlike deep learning (DL) approaches that require CSI-based labels for training, the proposed GL approach also avoids deep neural networks and backpropagation, leading to a more lightweight design. Although the proposed GL framework is trained with supervision generated by BCD under full CSI, inference is performed in a fully CSI-free manner. The proposed GL integrates subspace approximation with adjusted bias (Saab), relevant feature test (RFT)-based supervised feature selection, and eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)-based decision learning to jointly predict the STAR-RIS coefficients and transmit precoder. Simulation results show that the proposed GL approach achieves competitive spectral efficiency compared to BCD and DL-based models, while reducing floating-point operations (FLOPs) by over four orders of magnitude. These advantages make the proposed GL approach highly suitable for real-time deployment in energy- and hardware-constrained broadcasting scenarios.</description>

      <title>Cost-Free Personalization via Information-Geometric Projection in Bayesian Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian Federated Learning (BFL) combines uncertainty modeling with decentralized training, enabling the development of personalized and reliable models under data heterogeneity and privacy constraints. Existing approaches typically rely on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling or variational inference, often incorporating personalization mechanisms to better adapt to local data distributions. In this work, we propose an information-geometric projection framework for personalization in parametric BFL. By projecting the global model onto a neighborhood of the user's local model, our method enables a tunable trade-off between global generalization and local specialization. Under mild assumptions, we show that this projection step is equivalent to computing a barycenter on the statistical manifold, allowing us to derive closed-form solutions and achieve cost-free personalization. We apply the proposed approach to a variational learning setup using the Improved Variational Online Newton (IVON) optimizer and extend its application to general aggregation schemes in BFL. Empirical evaluations under heterogeneous data distributions confirm that our method effectively balances global and local performance with minimal computational overhead.</description>

      <title>Distributed Gossip-GAN for Low-overhead CSI Feedback Training in FDD mMIMO-OFDM Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The deep autoencoder (DAE) framework has turned out to be efficient in reducing the channel state information (CSI) feedback overhead in massive multiple-input multipleoutput (mMIMO) systems. However, these DAE approaches presented in prior works rely heavily on large-scale data collected through the base station (BS) for model training, thus rendering excessive bandwidth usage and data privacy issues, particularly for mMIMO systems. When considering users' mobility and encountering new channel environments, the existing CSI feedback models may often need to be retrained. Returning back to previous environments, however, will make these models perform poorly and face the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To solve the above challenging problems, we propose a novel gossiping generative adversarial network (Gossip-GAN)-aided CSI feedback training framework. Notably, Gossip-GAN enables the CSI feedback training with low-overhead while preserving users' privacy. Specially, each user collects a small amount of data to train a GAN model. Meanwhile, a fully distributed gossip-learning strategy is exploited to avoid model overfitting, and to accelerate the model training as well. Simulation results demonstrate that Gossip-GAN can i) achieve a similar CSI feedback accuracy as centralized training with real-world datasets, ii) address catastrophic forgetting challenges in mobile scenarios, and iii) greatly reduce the uplink bandwidth usage. Besides, our results show that the proposed approach possesses an inherent robustness.</description>

      <title>Landscape Analysis of Simultaneous Blind Deconvolution and Phase Retrieval via Structured Low-Rank Tensor Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a geometric analysis of the simultaneous blind deconvolution and phase retrieval (BDPR) problem via a structured low-rank tensor recovery framework. Due to the highly complicated structure of the associated sensing tensor, directly characterizing its optimization landscape is intractable. To address this, we introduce a tensor sensing problem as a tractable surrogate that preserves the essential structural features of the target low-rank tensor while enabling rigorous theoretical analysis. As a first step toward understanding this surrogate model, we study the corresponding population risk, which captures key aspects of the underlying low-rank tensor structure. We characterize the global landscape of the population risk on the unit sphere and show that Riemannian gradient descent (RGD) converges linearly under mild conditions. We then extend the analysis to the tensor sensing problem, establishing local geometric properties, proving convergence guarantees for RGD, and quantifying robustness under measurement noise. Our theoretical results are further supported by extensive numerical experiments. These findings offer foundational insights into the optimization landscape of the structured low-rank tensor recovery problem, which equivalently characterizes the original BDPR problem, thereby providing principled guidance for solving the original BDPR problem.</description>

      <title>Erasing Classical Memory with Quantum Fluctuations: Shannon Information Entropy of Reverse Quantum Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum annealers can provide non-local optimization by tunneling between states in a process that ideally eliminates memory of the initial configuration. We study the crossover between memory loss and retention due to quantum fluctuations, in a transverse Ising model on odd numbered antiferromagnetic rings of thousands of spins with periodic boundary conditions, by performing reverse quantum annealing experiments on three programmable superconducting flux qubit quantum annealers. After initializing the spins to contain a single domain wall, we then expose it to quantum fluctuations by turning on the transverse Zeeman energy. We characterize the crossover between memory retention at low transverse field, and memory loss at high transverse field by extracting the Shannon information entropy of magnetic domain wall distributions. We demonstrate a clear crossover in memory retention, and its dependence on hardware platform and simulation time. Our approach establishes a general probe of the interplay between quantum fluctuations and memory.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modal Sensing Aided mmWave Beamforming for V2V Communications with Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beamforming techniques are utilized in millimeter wave (mmWave) communication to address the inherent path loss limitation, thereby establishing and maintaining reliable connections. However, adopting standard defined beamforming approach in highly dynamic vehicular environments often incurs high beam training overheads and reduces the available airtime for communications, which is mainly due to exchanging pilot signals and exhaustive beam measurements. To this end, we present a multi-modal sensing and fusion learning framework as a potential alternative solution to reduce such overheads. In this framework, we first extract the features individually from the visual and GPS coordinates sensing modalities by modality specific encoders, and subsequently fuse the multimodal features to obtain predicted top-k beams so that the best line-of-sight links can be proactively established. To show the generalizability of the proposed framework, we perform a comprehensive experiment in four different vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) scenarios from real-world multi-modal sensing and communication dataset. From the experiment, we observe that the proposed framework achieves up to 77.58% accuracy on predicting top-15 beams correctly, outperforms single modalities, incurs roughly as low as 2.32 dB average power loss, and considerably reduces the beam searching space overheads by 76.56% for top-15 beams with respect to standard defined approach.</description>

      <title>An Incentive-Compatible Reward Sharing Mechanism for Mitigating Mirroring Attacks in Decentralized Data-Feed Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralized data-feed systems enable blockchain-based smart contracts to access off-chain information by aggregating values from multiple oracles. To improve accuracy, these systems typically use an aggregation function, such as majority voting, to consolidate the inputs they receive from oracles and make a decision. Depending on the final decision and the values reported by the oracles, the participating oracles are compensated through shared rewards. However, such incentive mechanisms are vulnerable to mirroring attacks, where a single user controls multiple oracles to bias the decision of the aggregation function and maximize rewards. This paper analyzes the impact of mirroring attacks on the reliability and dependability of majority voting-based data-feed systems. We demonstrate how existing incentive mechanisms can unintentionally encourage rational users to implement such attacks. To address this, we propose a new incentive mechanism that discourages Sybil behavior. We prove that the proposed mechanism leads to a Nash Equilibrium in which each user operates only one oracle. Finally, we discuss the practical implementation of the proposed incentive mechanism and provide numerical examples to demonstrate its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Learning to Equalize: Data-Driven Frequency-Domain Signal Recovery in Molecular Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In molecular communications (MC), inter-symbol interference (ISI) and noise are key factors that degrade communication reliability. Although time-domain equalization can effectively mitigate these effects, it often entails high computational complexity concerning the channel memory. In contrast, frequency-domain equalization (FDE) offers greater computational efficiency but typically requires prior knowledge of the channel model. To address this limitation, this letter proposes FDE techniques based on long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks, enabling temporal correlation modeling in MC channels to improve ISI and noise suppression. To eliminate the reliance on prior channel information in conventional FDE methods, a supervised training strategy is employed for channel-adaptive equalization. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed LSTM-FDE significantly reduces the bit error rate compared to traditional FDE and feedforward neural network-based equalizers. This performance gain is attributed to the LSTM's temporal modeling capabilities, which enhance noise suppression and accelerate model convergence, while maintaining comparable computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Long-time dynamics and universality of nonconvex gradient descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a general approach to characterize the long-time trajectory behavior of nonconvex gradient descent in generalized single-index models in the large aspect ratio regime. In this regime, we show that for each iteration the gradient descent iterate concentrates around a deterministic vector called the `Gaussian theoretical gradient descent', whose dynamics can be tracked by a state evolution system of two recursive equations for two scalars. Our concentration guarantees hold universally for a broad class of design matrices and remain valid over long time horizons until algorithmic convergence or divergence occurs. Moreover, our approach reveals that gradient descent iterates are in general approximately independent of the data and strongly incoherent with the feature vectors, a phenomenon previously known as the `implicit regularization' effect of gradient descent in specific models under Gaussian data.
  As an illustration of the utility of our general theory, we present two applications of different natures in the regression setting. In the first, we prove global convergence of nonconvex gradient descent with general independent initialization for a broad class of structured link functions, and establish universality of randomly initialized gradient descent in phase retrieval for large aspect ratios. In the second, we develop a data-free iterative algorithm for estimating state evolution parameters along the entire gradient descent trajectory, thereby providing a low-cost yet statistically valid tool for practical tasks such as hyperparameter tuning and runtime determination.
  As a by-product of our analysis, we show that in the large aspect ratio regime, the Gaussian theoretical gradient descent coincides with a recent line of dynamical mean-field theory for gradient descent over the constant-time horizon.</description>

      <title>Optimal single-mode squeezing for beam displacement sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimation of an optical beam's transverse displacement is a canonical imaging problem fundamental to numerous optical imaging and sensing tasks. Quantum enhancements to the measurement precision in this problem have been studied extensively. However, previous studies have neither accounted for diffraction loss in full generality, nor have they addressed how to jointly optimize the spatial mode and the balance between squeezing and coherent amplitude. Here we show that, in the small-displacement limit, the seemingly intractable infinite-spatial-mode problem can be reduced to a compact three-mode interaction framework. We quantify the improvement afforded by an optimized single-spatial-mode Gaussian-state probe over the optimal classical laser probe, and show that a two-spatial-mode homodyne receiver is asymptotically optimal for the former in the limit of high probe energy. Our findings reveal a strategy for identifying quantum-optimal probes in the presence of generic multimode linear probe-target interaction and photon loss.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Length FSK Waveforms for Joint Communications and Radar</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the constant modulus property of frequency shift keying (FSK) based waveforms and the stabilisation of its radar performance with an increase in the number of subpulses, in this paper an FSK-based dynamic subpulse number joint communications and radar waveform design is proposed. From a communications point of view, the system operates based on traditional FSK modulation. From a sensing point of view, although the subpulses are continuously generated and transmitted, radar waveforms are dynamically formed by monitoring the flatness of the spectrum which in turn guarantees the accuracy of the delay estimation. Other constraints on the waveform length are used to ensure satisfactory values of the root mean square time duration, ambiguity function sidelobe levels and prevent overly long waveforms. To provide an estimation of the probability of generating extremely long waveforms, the distribution of the number of subpulses is approximated using a Brownian motion process and an existing result on its one-sided exit density. Numerical examples are provided to evaluate the accuracy of the approximate distribution, as well as the ambiguity function sidelobe levels and the delay and Doppler shift estimation performance of the transmitted waveforms.</description>

      <title>On Spatial-Provenance Recovery in Wireless Networks with Relaxed-Privacy Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) networks with multi-hop communication, Road Side Units (RSUs) intend to gather location data from the vehicles to offer various location-based services. Although vehicles use the Global Positioning System (GPS) for navigation, they may refrain from sharing their exact GPS coordinates to the RSUs due to privacy considerations. Thus, to address the localization expectations of the RSUs and the privacy concerns of the vehicles, we introduce a relaxed-privacy model wherein the vehicles share their partial location information in order to avail the location-based services. To implement this notion of relaxed-privacy, we propose a low-latency protocol for spatial-provenance recovery, wherein vehicles use correlated linear Bloom filters to embed their position information. Our proposed spatial-provenance recovery process takes into account the resolution of localization, the underlying ad hoc protocol, and the coverage range of the wireless technology used by the vehicles. Through a rigorous theoretical analysis, we present extensive analysis on the underlying trade-off between relaxed-privacy and the communication-overhead of the protocol. Finally, using a wireless testbed, we show that our proposed method requires a few bits in the packet header to provide security features such as localizing a low-power jammer executing a denial-of-service attack.</description>

Abstract: Consider $L$ users, who each hold private data, and one fusion center who must compute a function of the private data of the $L$ users. To accomplish this task, each user may utilize a public and noiseless broadcast channel in a non-interactive manner. In this setting, and in the absence of any additional resources such as secure links, we study the optimal communication rates and minimum information leakages on the private user data that are achievable. Specifically, we study the information leakage of the user data at the fusion center (beyond the knowledge of the function output), as well as at predefined groups of colluding users who eavesdrop one another. We derive the capacity region when the user data is independent, and inner and outer regions for the capacity region when the user data is correlated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.10414v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Today, the vast majority of the world's digital information is represented using the fundamental assumption, introduced by Claude Shannon in 1948, that ``...the semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to the engineering problem (of the design of communication systems)...''. Consider, nonetheless, the observation that we often combine a message with other information in order to deduce new facts, thereby expanding the value of such a message. It is noteworthy that to-date, no rigorous theory of communication has been put forth which postulates the existence of deductive capabilities on the receiver's side.
  The purpose of this paper is to present such a theory. We formally model such deductive capabilities using logic reasoning, and present a rigorous theory which covers the following generic scenario: Alice and Bob each have knowledge of some logic sentence, and they wish to communicate as efficiently as possible with the shared goal that, following their communication, Bob should be able to deduce a particular logic sentence that Alice knows to be true, but that Bob currently cannot prove. Many variants of this general setup are considered in this article; in all cases we are able to provide sharp upper and lower bounds. Our contribution includes the identification of the most fundamental requirements that we place on a logic and associated logical language for all of our results to apply. Practical algorithms that are in some cases asymptotically optimal are provided, and we illustrate the potential practical value of the design of communication systems that incorporate the assumption of deductive capabilities at the receiver using experimental results that suggest significant possible gains compared to classical systems.</description>

      <title>Multiuser Commitment over Noisy Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider multi-user commitment models that capture the problem of enabling multiple bidders to simultaneously submit auctions to verifiers while ensuring that i) verifiers do not obtain information on the auctions until bidders reveal them at a later stage; and, ii) bidders cannot change their auction once committed. Specifically, we assume that bidders and verifiers have access to a noiseless channel as well as a noisy multiple-access channel or broadcast channel, where inputs are controlled by the bidders and outputs are observed by verifiers. In the case of multiple bidders and a single verifier connected by a non-redundant multiple-access channel, we characterize the commitment capacity region when bidders are not colluding. When the bidders are colluding, we derive an achievable region and a tight converse for the sum rate. In both cases our proposed achievable commitment schemes are constructive. In the case of a single bidder and multiple verifiers connected by a non-redundant broadcast channel, in which verifiers could drop out of the network after auctions are committed, we also characterize the commitment capacity. Our results demonstrate how commitment schemes can benefit from multi-user protocols, and develop resilience when some verifiers may become unavailable.</description>

      <title>Securing Integrated Sensing and Communication Against a Mobile Adversary: A Stackelberg Game with Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a secure integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system employing a full-duplex base station with sensing capabilities against a mobile proactive adversarial target$\unicode{x2014}$a malicious unmanned aerial vehicle (M-UAV). We develop a game-theoretic model to enhance communication security, radar sensing accuracy, and power efficiency. The interaction between the legitimate network and the mobile adversary is formulated as a non-cooperative Stackelberg game (NSG), where the M-UAV acts as the leader and strategically adjusts its trajectory to improve its eavesdropping ability while conserving power and avoiding obstacles. In response, the legitimate network, acting as the follower, dynamically allocates resources to minimize network power usage while ensuring required secrecy rates and sensing performance. To address this challenging problem, we propose a low-complexity successive convex approximation (SCA) method for network resource optimization combined with a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm for adaptive M-UAV trajectory planning through sequential interactions and learning. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in addressing security challenges of dynamic ISAC systems in 6G, i.e., achieving a Stackelberg equilibrium with robust performance while mitigating the adversary's ability to intercept network signals.</description>

      <title>Delay Analysis of 5G HARQ in the Presence of Decoding and Feedback Latencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing demand for stringent quality of service (QoS) guarantees in 5G networks requires accurate characterisation of delay performance, often measured using Delay Violation Probability (DVP) for a given target delay. Widely used retransmission schemes like Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) and Hybrid ARQ (HARQ) improve QoS through effective feedback, incremental redundancy (IR), and parallel retransmission processes. However, existing works to quantify the DVP under these retransmission schemes overlook practical aspects such as decoding complexity, feedback delays, and the resulting need for multiple parallel ARQ/HARQ processes that enable packet transmissions without waiting for previous feedback, thus exploiting valuable transmission opportunities. This work proposes a comprehensive multi-server delay model for ARQ/HARQ that incorporates these aspects. Using a finite blocklength error model, we derive closed-form expressions and algorithms for accurate DVP evaluation under realistic 5G configurations aligned with 3GPP standards. Our numerical evaluations demonstrate notable improvements in DVP accuracy over the state-of-the-art, highlight the impact of parameter tuning and resource allocation, and reveal how DVP affects system throughput.</description>

      <title>Demystifying 5G Polar and LDPC Codes: A Comprehensive Review and Foundations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11053v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how 5G networks correct errors is no trivial matter. At the heart of the process lie two sophisticated families of codes: LDPC and polar codes. This paper opens the black box, not only by explaining how these codes are designed, but also by showing how they are encoded and decoded in practice. To map where research currently stands, we present a detailed survey of the literature supplemented with insights that are often buried deep within technical standards. These foundations are not just historical footnotes: they are strong candidates for powering error correction in 6G and beyond. In bringing clarity to these building blocks, we aim to help engineers and researchers navigate what is both a complex and increasingly vital part of wireless communication.</description>

      <title>Radio Map-Enabled 3D Trajectory and Communication Optimization for Low-Altitude Air-Ground Cooperation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06944v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-altitude economy includes the application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) serving ground robots. This paper investigates the 3-dimensional (3D) trajectory and communication optimization for low-altitude air-ground cooperation systems, where mobile unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) upload data to UAVs. We propose a joint optimization algorithm to maximize the minimal sum-rate of UGVs while ensuring quality of service and navigation constraints. The proposed algorithm integrates a successive convex approximation (SCA)-penalty method for UGV-UAV scheduling, an SCA-based approach for UGV transmit power control, and a novel warm-start particle swarm optimization with cross mutation (WS-PSO-CM). The WS-PSO-CM leverages convex optimization results from a statistical channel model to initialize particle swarm, significantly improving the performance, compared with celebrated PSO-CM. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves a $45.8$\% higher minimal sum-rate compared to the baseline PSO-CM under the same iterations. This gain can be translated to reducing computational time by $46.7$\% of PSO-CM. Furthermore, our simulation results reveal that UAVs dynamically adjust trajectories to avoid interference by buildings, and maintain proximity to UGVs to mitigate path-loss.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Resilience Against Jamming Attacks: A Cooperative Anti-Jamming Method Using Direction Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The inherent vulnerability of wireless communication necessitates strategies to enhance its security, particularly in the face of jamming attacks. This paper uses the collaborations of multiple sensing nodes (SNs) in the wireless network to present a cooperative anti-jamming approach (CAJ) designed to neutralize the impact of jamming attacks. We propose an eigenvector (EV) method to estimate the direction of the channel vector from pilot symbols. Through our analysis, we demonstrate that with an adequate number of pilot symbols, the performance of the proposed EV method is comparable to the scenario where the perfect channel state information (CSI) is utilized. Both analytical formulas and simulations illustrate the excellent performance of the proposed EV-CAJ under strong jamming signals. Considering severe jamming, the proposed EV-CAJ method exhibits only a 0.7 dB degradation compared to the case without jamming especially when the number of SNs is significantly larger than the number of jamming nodes (JNs). Moreover, the extension of the proposed method can handle multiple jammers at the expense of degrees of freedom (DoF). We also investigate the method's ability to remain robust in fast-fading channels with different coherence times. Our proposed approach demonstrates good resilience, particularly when the ratio of the channel's coherence time to the time frame is small. This is especially important in the case of mobile jammers with large Doppler shifts.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Jamming Detection Using Low-Rank Structure of Received Signal Matrix</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wireless communication can be simply subjected to malicious attacks due to its open nature and shared medium. Detecting jamming attacks is the first and necessary step to adopt the anti-jamming strategies. This paper presents novel cooperative jamming detection methods that use the low-rank structure of the received signal matrix. We employed the likelihood ratio test to propose detectors for various scenarios. We regarded several scenarios with different numbers of friendly and jamming nodes and different levels of available statistical information on noise. We also provided an analytical examination of the false alarm performance of one of the proposed detectors, which can be used to adjust the detection threshold. We discussed the synthetic signal generation and the Monte Carlo (MC)-based threshold setting method, where knowledge of the distribution of the jamming-free signal, as well as several parameters such as noise variance and channel state information (CSI), is required to accurately generate synthetic signals for threshold estimation. Extensive simulations reveal that the proposed detectors outperform several existing methods, offering robust and accurate jamming detection in a collaborative network of sensing nodes.</description>

      <title>Efficient Pauli channel estimation with logarithmic quantum memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14326v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here we revisit one of the prototypical tasks for characterizing the structure of noise in quantum devices: estimating every eigenvalue of an $n$-qubit Pauli noise channel to error $\epsilon$. Prior work [14] proved no-go theorems for this task in the practical regime where one has a limited amount of quantum memory, e.g. any protocol with $\le 0.99n$ ancilla qubits of quantum memory must make exponentially many measurements, provided it is non-concatenating. Such protocols can only interact with the channel by repeatedly preparing a state, passing it through the channel, and measuring immediately afterward.
  This left open a natural question: does the lower bound hold even for general protocols, i.e. ones which chain together many queries to the channel, interleaved with arbitrary data-processing channels, before measuring? Surprisingly, in this work we show the opposite: there is a protocol that can estimate the eigenvalues of a Pauli channel to error $\epsilon$ using only $O(\log n/\epsilon^2)$ ancilla and $\tilde{O}(n^2/\epsilon^2)$ measurements. In contrast, we show that any protocol with zero ancilla, even a concatenating one, must make $\Omega(2^n/\epsilon^2)$ measurements, which is tight.
  Our results imply, to our knowledge, the first quantum learning task where logarithmically many qubits of quantum memory suffice for an exponential statistical advantage. Our protocol can be naturally extended to a protocol that learns the eigenvalues of Pauli terms within any subset $A$ of a Pauli channel with $O(\log\log(|A|)/\epsilon^2)$ ancilla and $\tilde{O}(n^2/\epsilon^2)$ measurements.</description>

      <title>MIMO Channel Shaping and Rate Maximization Using Beyond-Diagonal RIS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15196v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the limits to which a passive Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) can reshape a point-to-point Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) channel in terms of singular values and their functions (e.g., achievable rate and harvestable power) for improved wireless performance. We depart from the Diagonal (D) scattering model and adopt a Beyond-Diagonal (BD) model that exploits element-wise connections for passive signal amplitude and phase manipulation. Specifically, analytical tight bounds are derived under typical RIS deployment scenarios to unveil the channel shaping potentials of BD-RIS regarding communication Degrees of Freedom (DoF), singular value spread, power gain, and capacity. An efficient numerical method is then proposed to optimize BD-RIS for any locally Lipschitz function of channel singular values, and showcased to characterize the achievable singular value region. As a side product, we tackle BD-RIS-aided MIMO rate maximization problem by a local-optimal Alternating Optimization (AO) approach and a low-complexity shaping approach. Results show that BD-RIS significantly improves the dynamic range of channel singular values and the tradeoff in manipulating them, thus offering enhanced data rate, harvestable power, and physical-layer security. These advantages become more pronounced when the number of RIS elements, group size, or MIMO dimensions increase. Of particular interest, BD-RIS is shown to activate multi-stream transmission and achieve the asymptotic DoF at much lower transmit power than D-RIS thanks to its proficiency in channel shaping.</description>

      <title>Explaining Robust Quantum Metrology by Counting Codewords</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum sensing holds great promise for high-precision magnetic field measurements. However, its performance is significantly limited by noise. The investigation of active quantum error correction to address this noise led to the Hamiltonian-Not-in-Lindblad-Span (HNLS) condition. This states that Heisenberg scaling is achievable if and only if the signal Hamiltonian is orthogonal to the span of the Lindblad operators describing the noise. In this work, we consider a robust quantum metrology setting where the probe state is inspired from CSS codes for noise resilience but there is no active error correction performed. After the state picks up the signal, we measure the code's $\hat{X}$ stabilizers to infer the magnetic field parameter, $\theta$. Given $N$ copies of the probe state, we derive the probability that all stabilizer measurements return $+1$, which depends on $\theta$. The uncertainty in $\theta$ (estimated from these measurements) is bounded by a new quantity, the \textit{Robustness Bound}, which ties the Quantum Fisher Information of the measurement to the number of weight-$2$ codewords of the dual code. Through this novel lens of coding theory, we show that for nontrivial CSS code states the HNLS condition still governs the Heisenberg scaling in our robust metrology setting. Our finding suggests fundamental limitations in the use of linear quantum codes for dephased magnetic field sensing applications both in the near-term robust sensing regime and in the long-term fault tolerant era. We also extend our results to general scenarios beyond dephased magnetic field sensing.</description>

      <title>Fast Fourier Transform-Based Spectral and Temporal Gradient Filtering for Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differential Privacy (DP) has emerged as a key framework for protecting sensitive data in machine learning, but standard DP-SGD often suffers from significant accuracy loss due to injected noise. To address this limitation, we introduce the FFT-Enhanced Kalman Filter (FFTKF), a differentially private optimization method that improves gradient quality while preserving $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP guarantees. FFTKF applies frequency-domain filtering to shift privacy noise into less informative high-frequency components, preserving the low-frequency gradient signals that carry most learning information. A scalar-gain Kalman filter with a finite-difference Hessian approximation further refines the denoised gradients. The method has per-iteration complexity $\mathcal{O}(d \log d)$ and achieves higher test accuracy than DP-SGD and DiSK on MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet with CNNs, Wide ResNets, and Vision Transformers. Theoretical analysis shows that FFTKF ensures equivalent privacy while delivering a stronger privacy--utility trade-off through reduced variance and controlled bias.</description>

      <title>Rotatable Array-Aided Hybrid Beamforming for Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA) technology has been proposed to enhance the performance of Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems. However, within 6DMA-related research, studies on the ISAC system based on rotatable array (RA) remains relatively limited. Given the significant advantages of hybrid beamforming technology in balancing system performance and hardware complexity, this paper focuses on a channel model that accounts for the efficiency of the antenna radiation pattern and studies the sub-connected hybrid beamforming design for multi-user RA-aided ISAC systems. Aiming at the non-convex nature with coupled variables in this problem, this paper transforms the complex fractional objective function using the Fractional Programming (FP) method, and then proposes an algorithm based on the Alternating Optimization (AO) framework, which achieves optimization by alternately solving five subproblems. For the analog beamforming optimization subproblem, we adopt Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) method to transform the objective function, thereby deriving the closed-form update expression for the analog beamforming matrix. For the antenna rotation optimization subproblem, we derive the closed-form derivative expression of the array rotation angle and propose a two-stage Gradient Ascent (GA) based method to optimize the antenna rotation angle. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RA-aided hybrid beamforming design method. It not only significantly improves the overall system performance while reducing hardware costs, but also achieves performance comparable to that of the fully-digital beamforming design with fixed-position antennas (FPA) under specific parameter configurations.</description>

      <title>Vendi Information Gain for Active Learning and its Application to Ecology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While monitoring biodiversity through camera traps has become an important endeavor for ecological research, identifying species in the captured image data remains a major bottleneck due to limited labeling resources. Active learning -- a machine learning paradigm that selects the most informative data to label and train a predictive model -- offers a promising solution, but typically focuses on uncertainty in the individual predictions without considering uncertainty across the entire dataset. We introduce a new active learning policy, Vendi information gain (VIG), that selects images based on their impact on dataset-wide prediction uncertainty, capturing both informativeness and diversity. We applied VIG to the Snapshot Serengeti dataset and compared it against common active learning methods. VIG needs only 3% of the available data to reach 75\% accuracy, a level that baselines require more than 10% of the data to achieve. With 10% of the data, VIG attains 88\% predictive accuracy, 12% higher than the best of the baselines. This improvement in performance is consistent across metrics and batch sizes, and we show that VIG also collects more diverse data in the feature space. VIG has broad applicability beyond ecology, and our results highlight its value for biodiversity monitoring in data-limited environments.</description>
