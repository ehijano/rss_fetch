      <title>Non-commutative error correcting codes and proper subgroup testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Property testing has been a major area of research in computer science in the last three decades. By property testing we refer to an ensemble of problems, results and algorithms which enable to deduce global information about some data by only reading small random parts of it. In recent years, this theory found its way into group theory, mainly via group stability.
  In this paper, we study the following problem: Devise a randomized algorithm that given a subgroup $H$ of $G$, decides whether $H$ is the whole group or a proper subgroup, by checking whether a single (random) element of $G$ is in $H$. The search for such an algorithm boils down to the following purely group theoretic problem: For $G$ of rank $k$, find a small as possible test subset $A\subseteq G$ such that for every proper subgroup $H$, $|H\cap A|\leq (1-\delta)|A|$ for some absolute constant $\delta&gt;0$, which we call the detection probability of $A$. It turns out that the search for sets $A$ of size linear in $k$ and constant detection probability is a non-commutative analogue of the classical search for families of good error correcting codes. This paper is devoted to proving that such test subsets exist, which implies good universal error correcting codes exist -- providing a far reaching generalization of the classical result of Shannon.
  In addition, we study this problem in certain subclasses of groups -- such as abelian, nilpotent, and finite solvable groups -- providing different constructions of test subsets for these subclasses with various qualities. Finally, this generalized theory of non-commutative error correcting codes suggests a plethora of interesting problems and research directions.</description>

      <title>Generalized nonautonomous dynamics through groupoid morphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the notions of nonautonomous dynamics to arbitrary groups, through groupoid morphisms. This also presents a generalization of classic dynamical systems and group actions. We introduce the structure of cotranslations, as a specific kind of groupoid morphism, and establish a correspondence between cotranslations and skew-products. We give applications of cotranslations to nonautonomous equations, both in differences and differential. Our results delve into the differentiability of cotranslations, along with dimension invariance and diagonalization, utilizing a generalized notion of kinematic similarity.</description>

      <title>Small-ball estimates for random walks on groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a new inequality bounding the probability that the random walk on a group has small total displacement in terms of the spectral and isoperimetric profiles of the group. This inequality implies that if the random walk on the group is diffusive then Cheeger's inequality is sharp in the sense that the isoperimetric profile $\Phi$ and spectral profile $\Lambda$ of the group are related by $\Lambda \simeq \Phi^2$. Our inequality also yields substantial progress on a conjecture of Lyons, Peres, Sun, and Zheng (2017) stating that for any transient random walk on an infinite, finitely generated group, the expected occupation time of the ball of radius $r$ is $O(r^2)$: We prove that this conjecture holds for every group of superpolynomial growth whose spectral profile is slowly varying, which we conjecture is always the case. For groups of exponential or stretched-exponential growth satisfying a further mild regularity assumption on their spectral profile, our method yields the strong quantitative small-ball estimate \[-\log \mathbb{P}\bigl(d(X_0,X_n) \leq \varepsilon n^{1/2}\bigr) \succeq \frac{1}{\varepsilon^2} \wedge (-\log \mathbb{P}(X_n=X_0)),\] which is sharp for the lamplighter group. Finally, we prove that the regularity assumptions needed to apply the strongest versions our results are satisfied for several classical examples where the spectral profile is not known explicitly, including the first Grigorchuk group and Thompson's group $F$.</description>

      <title>Counting of surfaces and computational complexity in column sums of symmetric group character tables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The character table of the symmetric group $S_n$, of permutations of $n$ objects, is of fundamental interest in theoretical physics, combinatorics as well as computational complexity theory. We investigate the implications of an identity, which has a geometrical interpretation in combinatorial topological field theories, relating the column sum of normalised central characters of $S_n$ to a sum of structure constants of multiplication in the centre of the group algebra of $S_n$. The identity leads to the proof that a combinatorial computation of the column sum belongs to complexity class \shP. The sum of structure constants has an interpretation in terms of the counting of branched covers of the sphere. This allows the identification of a tractable subset of the structure constants related to genus zero covers. We use this subset to prove that the column sum for a conjugacy class labelled by partition $\lambda$ is non-vanishing if and only if the permutations in the conjugacy class are even. This leads to the result that the determination of the vanishing or otherwise of the column sum is in complexity class \pP. The subset gives a positive lower bound on the column sum for any even $ \lambda$. For any disjoint decomposition of $ \lambda$ as $\lambda_1 \sqcup \lambda_2 $ we obtain a lower bound for the column sum at $ \lambda$ in terms of the product of the column sums for $ \lambda_1$ and$\lambda_2$. This can be expressed as a super-additivity property for the logarithms of column sums of normalized characters.</description>

      <title>Chromatic congruences and Bernoulli numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For every natural number $n$ and a fixed prime $p$, we prove a new congruence for the orbifold Euler characteristic of a group. The $p$-adic limit of these congruences as $n$ tends to infinity recovers the Brown-Quillen congruence. We apply these results to mapping class groups and using the Harer-Zagier formula we obtain a family of congruences for Bernoulli numbers. We show that these congruences in particular recover classical congruences for Bernoulli numbers due to Kummer, Voronoi, Carlitz, and Cohen.</description>

      <title>Tactical decompositions in finite polar spaces and non-spreading classical group actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For finite classical groups acting naturally on the set of points of their ambient polar spaces, the symmetry properties of \emph{synchronising} and \emph{separating} are equivalent to natural and well-studied problems on the existence of certain configurations in finite geometry. The more general class of \emph{spreading} permutation groups is harder to describe, and it is the purpose of this paper to explore this property for finite classical groups. In particular, we show that for most finite classical groups, their natural action on the points of its polar space is non-spreading. We develop and use a result on tactical decompositions (an \emph{AB-Lemma}) that provides a useful technique for finding witnesses for non-spreading permutation groups. We also consider some of the other primitive actions of the classical groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2106.05983v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce \emph{k-positive representations}, a large class of $\{1,\ldots,k\}$--Anosov surface group representations into PGL(E) that share many features with Hitchin representations, and we study their degenerations: unless they are Hitchin, they can be deformed to non-discrete representations, but any limit is at least (k-3)-positive and irreducible limits are (k-1)-positive. A major ingredient, of independent interest, is a general limit theorem for positively ratioed representations.</description>

      <title>Shi arrangements and low elements in Coxeter groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.16569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an arbitrary Coxeter system $(W,S)$ and a nonnegative integer $m$, the $m$-Shi arrangement of $(W,S)$ is a subarrangement of the Coxeter hyperplane arrangement of $(W,S)$. The classical Shi arrangement ($m=0$) was introduced in the case of affine Weyl groups by Shi to study Kazhdan-Lusztig cells for $W$. As two key results, Shi showed that each region of the Shi arrangement contains exactly one element of minimal length in $W$ and that the union of their inverses form a convex subset of the Coxeter complex. The set of $m$-low elements in $W$ were introduced to study the word problem of the corresponding Artin-Tits (braid) group and they turn out to produce automata to study the combinatorics of reduced words in $W$.
  In this article, we generalize and extend Shi's results to any Coxeter system for any $m$: (1) the set of minimal length elements of the regions in a $m$-Shi arrangement is precisely the set of $m$-low elements, settling a conjecture of the first and third authors in this case; (2) the union of the inverses of the ($0$-)low elements form a convex subset in the Coxeter complex, settling a conjecture by the third author, Nadeau and Williams.</description>

      <title>The Choquet-Deny Property for Groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A countable discrete group is called Choquet-Deny if for any non-degenerate probability measure on the group, the corresponding space of bounded harmonic functions is trivial. Building on the previous work of Jaworski, a complete characterization of Choquet-Deny groups was recently achieved by Frisch, Hartman, Tamuz, and Ferdowski. In this article, we extend the study of the Choquet-Deny property to the framework of discrete measured groupoids. Our primary result offers a complete characterization of this property in terms of the isotropy groups and the equivalence relation associated with the given groupoid. Additionally, we use the implications derived from our main theorem to classify the Choquet-Deny property of transformation groupoids.</description>
