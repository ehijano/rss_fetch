      <title>Huge Ensembles Part I: Design of Ensemble Weather Forecasts using Spherical Fourier Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying low-likelihood high-impact extreme weather events in a warming world is a significant and challenging task for current ensemble forecasting systems. While these systems presently use up to 100 members, larger ensembles could enrich the sampling of internal variability. They may capture the long tails associated with climate hazards better than traditional ensemble sizes. Due to computational constraints, it is infeasible to generate huge ensembles (comprised of 1,000-10,000 members) with traditional, physics-based numerical models. In this two-part paper, we replace traditional numerical simulations with machine learning (ML) to generate hindcasts of huge ensembles. In Part I, we construct an ensemble weather forecasting system based on Spherical Fourier Neural Operators (SFNO), and we discuss important design decisions for constructing such an ensemble. The ensemble represents model uncertainty through perturbed-parameter techniques, and it represents initial condition uncertainty through bred vectors, which sample the fastest growing modes of the forecast. Using the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) as a baseline, we develop an evaluation pipeline composed of mean, spectral, and extreme diagnostics. Using large-scale, distributed SFNOs with 1.1 billion learned parameters, we achieve calibrated probabilistic forecasts. As the trajectories of the individual members diverge, the ML ensemble mean spectra degrade with lead time, consistent with physical expectations. However, the individual ensemble members' spectra stay constant with lead time. Therefore, these members simulate realistic weather states, and the ML ensemble thus passes a crucial spectral test in the literature. The IFS and ML ensembles have similar Extreme Forecast Indices, and we show that the ML extreme weather forecasts are reliable and discriminating.</description>

      <title>A probabilistic framework for learning non-intrusive corrections to long-time climate simulations from short-time training data</title>

Abstract: Chaotic systems, such as turbulent flows, are ubiquitous in science and engineering. However, their study remains a challenge due to the large range scales, and the strong interaction with other, often not fully understood, physics. As a consequence, the spatiotemporal resolution required for accurate simulation of these systems is typically computationally infeasible, particularly for applications of long-term risk assessment, such as the quantification of extreme weather risk due to climate change. While data-driven modeling offers some promise of alleviating these obstacles, the scarcity of high-quality simulations results in limited available data to train such models, which is often compounded by the lack of stability for long-horizon simulations. As such, the computational, algorithmic, and data restrictions generally imply that the probability of rare extreme events is not accurately captured. In this work we present a general strategy for training neural network models to non-intrusively correct under-resolved long-time simulations of chaotic systems. The approach is based on training a post-processing correction operator on under-resolved simulations nudged towards a high-fidelity reference. This enables us to learn the dynamics of the underlying system directly, which allows us to use very little training data, even when the statistics thereof are far from converged. Additionally, through the use of probabilistic network architectures we are able to leverage the uncertainty due to the limited training data to further improve extrapolation capabilities. We apply our framework to severely under-resolved simulations of quasi-geostrophic flow and demonstrate its ability to accurately predict the anisotropic statistics over time horizons more than 30 times longer than the data seen in training.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions in Anisotropic Turbulence</title>

Abstract: Turbulence is a widely observed state of fluid flows, characterized by complex, nonlinear interactions between motions across a broad spectrum of length and time scales. While turbulence is ubiquitous, from teacups to planetary atmospheres, oceans and stars, its manifestations can vary considerably between different physical systems. For instance, three-dimensional (3D) turbulent flows display a forward energy cascade from large to small scales, while in two-dimensional (2D) turbulence, energy cascades from small to large scales. In a given physical system, a transition between such disparate regimes of turbulence can occur when a control parameter reaches a critical value. The behavior of flows close to such transition points, which separate qualitatively distinct \textit{phases} of turbulence, has been found to be unexpectedly rich. Here, we survey recent findings on such transitions in highly anisotropic turbulent fluid flows, including turbulence in thin layers and under the influence of rapid rotation. We also review recent work on transitions induced by turbulent fluctuations, such as random reversals and transitions between large-scale vortices and jets, among others. The relevance of these results and their ramifications for future investigations are discussed.</description>

      <title>ORBIT: Oak Ridge Base Foundation Model for Earth System Predictability</title>

Abstract: Earth system predictability is challenged by the complexity of environmental dynamics and the multitude of variables involved. Current AI foundation models, although advanced by leveraging large and heterogeneous data, are often constrained by their size and data integration, limiting their effectiveness in addressing the full range of Earth system prediction challenges. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Oak Ridge Base Foundation Model for Earth System Predictability (ORBIT), an advanced vision transformer model that scales up to 113 billion parameters using a novel hybrid tensor-data orthogonal parallelism technique. As the largest model of its kind, ORBIT surpasses the current climate AI foundation model size by a thousandfold. Performance scaling tests conducted on the Frontier supercomputer have demonstrated that ORBIT achieves 684 petaFLOPS to 1.6 exaFLOPS sustained throughput, with scaling efficiency maintained at 41% to 85% across 49,152 AMD GPUs. These breakthroughs establish new advances in AI-driven climate modeling and demonstrate promise to significantly improve the Earth system predictability.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Emulator for Atmospheric Chemical ODE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling atmospheric chemistry is complex and computationally intense. Given the recent success of Deep neural networks in digital signal processing, we propose a Neural Network Emulator for fast chemical concentration modeling. We consider atmospheric chemistry as a time-dependent Ordinary Differential Equation. To extract the hidden correlations between initial states and future time evolution, we propose ChemNNE, an Attention based Neural Network Emulator (NNE) that can model the atmospheric chemistry as a neural ODE process. To efficiently simulate the chemical changes, we propose the sinusoidal time embedding to estimate the oscillating tendency over time. More importantly, we use the Fourier neural operator to model the ODE process for efficient computation. We also propose three physical-informed losses to supervise the training optimization. To evaluate our model, we propose a large-scale chemical dataset that can be used for neural network training and evaluation. The extensive experiments show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in modeling accuracy and computational speed.</description>
