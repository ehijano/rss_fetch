      <title>Repair Brain Damage: Real-Numbered Error Correction Code for Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a neural network (NN) that may experience memory faults and computational errors. In this paper, we propose a novel real-number-based error correction code (ECC) capable of detecting and correcting both memory errors and computational errors. The proposed approach introduces structures in the form of real-number-based linear constraints on the NN weights to enable error detection and correction, without sacrificing classification performance or increasing the number of real-valued NN parameters.</description>

      <title>MO-ELA: Rigorously Expanding Exploratory Landscape Features for Automated Algorithm Selection in Continuous Multi-Objective Optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated Algorithm Selection (AAS) is a popular meta-algorithmic approach and has demonstrated to work well for single-objective optimisation in combination with exploratory landscape features (ELA), i.e., (numerical) descriptive features derived from sampling the black-box (continuous) optimisation problem. In contrast to the abundance of features that describe single-objective optimisation problems, only a few features have been proposed for multi-objective optimisation so far. Building upon recent work on exploratory landscape features for box-constrained continuous multi-objective optimization problems, we propose a novel and complementary set of additional features (MO-ELA). These features are based on a random sample of points considering both the decision and objective space. The features are divided into 5 feature groups depending on how they are being calculated: non-dominated-sorting, descriptive statistics, principal component analysis, graph structures and gradient information. An AAS study conducted on well-established multi-objective benchmarks demonstrates that the proposed features contribute to successfully distinguishing between algorithm performance and thus adequately capture problem hardness resulting in models that come very close to the virtual best solver. After feature selection, the newly proposed features are frequently among the top contributors, underscoring their value in algorithm selection and problem characterisation.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning-assisted Constraint Relaxation for Constrained Expensive Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constraint handling plays a key role in solving realistic complex optimization problems. Though intensively discussed in the last few decades, existing constraint handling techniques predominantly rely on human experts' designs, which more or less fall short in utility towards general cases. Motivated by recent progress in Meta-Black-Box Optimization where automated algorithm design can be learned to boost optimization performance, in this paper, we propose learning effective, adaptive and generalizable constraint handling policy through reinforcement learning. Specifically, a tailored Markov Decision Process is first formulated, where given optimization dynamics features, a deep Q-network-based policy controls the constraint relaxation level along the underlying optimization process. Such adaptive constraint handling provides flexible tradeoff between objective-oriented exploitation and feasible-region-oriented exploration, and hence leads to promising optimization performance. We train our approach on CEC 2017 Constrained Optimization benchmark with limited evaluation budget condition (expensive cases) and compare the trained constraint handling policy to strong baselines such as recent winners in CEC/GECCO competitions. Extensive experimental results show that our approach performs competitively or even surpasses the compared baselines under either Leave-one-out cross-validation or ordinary train-test split validation. Further analysis and ablation studies reveal key insights in our designs.</description>

      <title>Surrogate Ensemble in Expensive Multi-Objective Optimization via Deep Q-Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surrogate-assisted Evolutionary Algorithms~(SAEAs) have shown promising robustness in solving expensive optimization problems. A key aspect that impacts SAEAs' effectiveness is surrogate model selection, which in existing works is predominantly decided by human developer. Such human-made design choice introduces strong bias into SAEAs and may hurt their expected performance on out-of-scope tasks. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning-assisted ensemble framework, termed as SEEMOO, which is capable of scheduling different surrogate models within a single optimization process, hence boosting the overall optimization performance in a cooperative paradigm. Specifically, we focus on expensive multi-objective optimization problems, where multiple objective functions shape a compositional landscape and hence challenge surrogate selection. SEEMOO comprises following core designs: 1) A pre-collected model pool that maintains different surrogate models; 2) An attention-based state-extractor supports universal optimization state representation of problems with varied objective numbers; 3) a deep Q-network serves as dynamic surrogate selector: Given the optimization state, it selects desired surrogate model for current-step evaluation. SEEMOO is trained to maximize the overall optimization performance under a training problem distribution. Extensive benchmark results demonstrate SEEMOO's surrogate ensemble paradigm boosts the optimization performance of single-surrogate baselines. Further ablation studies underscore the importance of SEEMOO's design components.</description>

      <title>NegaBent, No Regrets: Evolving Spectrally Flat Boolean Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Negabent Boolean functions are defined by having a flat magnitude spectrum under the nega-Hadamard transform. They exist in both even and odd dimensions, and the subclass of functions that are simultaneously bent and negabent (bent-negabent) has attracted interest due to the combined optimal periodic and negaperiodic spectral properties. In this work, we investigate how evolutionary algorithms can be used to evolve (bent-)negabent Boolean functions. Our experimental results indicate that evolutionary algorithms, especially genetic programming, are a suitable approach for evolving negabent Boolean functions, and we successfully evolve such functions in all dimensions we consider.</description>

      <title>Organismal Agency and Rapid Adaptation: The Phenopoiesis Algorithm for Phenotype-First Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolutionary success depends on the capacity to adapt: organisms must respond to environmental challenges through both genetic innovation and lifetime learning. The gene-centric paradigm attributes evolutionary causality exclusively to genes, while Denis Noble's phenotype-first framework argues that organisms are active agents capable of interpreting genetic resources, learning from experience, and shaping their own development. However, this framework has remained philosophically intuitive but algorithmically opaque.
  We show for the first time that organismal agency can be implemented as a concrete computational process through heritable phenotypic patterns. We introduce the Phenopoiesis Algorithm, where organisms inherit not just genes but also successful phenotypic patterns discovered during lifetime learning. Through experiments in changing environments, these pattern-inheriting organisms achieve 3.4 times faster adaptation compared to gene-centric models. Critically, these gains require cross-generational inheritance of learned patterns rather than within-lifetime learning alone.
  We conclude that organismal agency is not a philosophical abstraction but an algorithmic mechanism with measurable adaptive value. The mechanism works through compositional reuse: organisms discover how to compose primitive elements into solutions, encode those compositional recipes, and transmit them to offspring. Evolution operates across multiple timescales -- fast, reversible phenotypic inheritance and slow, permanent genetic inheritance -- providing adaptive flexibility that single-channel mechanisms cannot achieve.</description>

      <title>The Stacked Autoencoder Evolution Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel theoretical framework, the Stacked Autoencoder Evolution Hypothesis, which proposes that biological evolutionary systems operate through multi-layered self-encoding and decoding processes, analogous to stacked autoencoders in deep learning. Rather than viewing evolution solely as gradual changes driven by mutation and selection, this hypothesis suggests that self-replication inherently compresses and reconstructs genetic information across hierarchical layers of abstraction. This layered structure enables evolutionary systems to explore diverse possibilities not only at the sequence level but also across progressively more abstract layers of representation, making it possible for even simple mutations to navigate these higher-order spaces.Such a mechanism may explain punctuated evolutionary patterns and changes that can appear as if they are goal-directed in natural evolution, by allowing mutations at deeper latent layers to trigger sudden, large-scale phenotypic shifts. To illustrate the plausibility of this mechanism, artificial chemistry simulations were conducted, demonstrating the spontaneous emergence of hierarchical autoencoder structures. This framework offers a new perspective on the informational dynamics underlying both continuous and discontinuous evolutionary change.</description>

      <title>Parallel Training in Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bio-inspired integrate-fire-reset mechanism of spiking neurons constitutes the foundation for efficient processing in Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). Recent progress in large models demands that spiking neurons support highly parallel computation to scale efficiently on modern GPUs. This work proposes a novel functional perspective that provides general guidance for designing parallel spiking neurons. We argue that the reset mechanism, which induces complex temporal dependencies and hinders parallel training, should be removed. However, any such modification should satisfy two principles: 1) preserving the functions of reset as a core biological mechanism; and 2) enabling parallel training without sacrificing the serial inference ability of spiking neurons, which underpins their efficiency at test time. To this end, we identify the functions of the reset and analyze how to reconcile parallel training with serial inference, upon which we propose a dynamic decay spiking neuron. We conduct comprehensive testing of our method in terms of: 1) Training efficiency and extrapolation capability. On 16k-length sequences, we achieve a 25.6x training speedup over the pioneering parallel spiking neuron, and our models trained on 2k-length can stably perform inference on sequences as long as 30k. 2) Generality. We demonstrate the consistent effectiveness of the proposed method across five task categories (image classification, neuromorphic event processing, time-series forecasting, language modeling, and reinforcement learning), three network architectures (spiking CNN/Transformer/SSMs), and two spike activation modes (spike/integer activation). 3) Energy consumption. The spiking firing of our neuron is lower than that of vanilla and existing parallel spiking neurons.</description>

      <title>Unleashing the Potential of Differential Evolution through Individual-Level Strategy Diversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since Differential Evolution (DE) is sensitive to strategy choice, most existing variants pursue performance through adaptive mechanisms or intricate designs. While these approaches focus on adjusting strategies over time, the structural benefits that static strategy diversity may bring remain largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we study the impact of individual-level strategy diversity on DE's search dynamics and performance, and introduce iStratDE (DE with individual-level strategies), a minimalist variant that assigns mutation and crossover strategies independently to each individual at initialization and keeps them fixed throughout the evolutionary process. By injecting diversity at the individual level without adaptation or feedback, iStratDE cultivates persistent behavioral heterogeneity that is especially effective with large populations. Moreover, its communication-free construction possesses intrinsic concurrency, thereby enabling efficient parallel execution and straightforward scaling for GPU computing. We further provide a convergence analysis of iStratDE under standard reachability assumptions, which establishes the almost-sure convergence of the best-so-far fitness. Extensive experiments on the CEC2022 benchmark suite and robotic control tasks demonstrate that iStratDE matches or surpasses established adaptive DE variants. These results highlight individual-level strategy assignment as a straightforward yet effective mechanism for enhancing DE's performance. The source code of iStratDE is publicly accessible at: https://github.com/EMI-Group/istratde.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Heuristic Neuromorphic Solver for the Edge User Allocation Problem with Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a neuromorphic solver for the NP-hard Edge User Allocation problem using an attractor network with Winner-Takes-All (WTA) mechanism implemented with the Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN) framework. Unlike previous energy-based attractor networks, our solver uses dynamic heuristic biasing to guide allocations in real time and introduces a "no allocation" state to each WTA motif, achieving near-optimal performance with an empirically upper-bounded number of time steps. The approach is compatible with neuromorphic architectures and may offer improvements in energy efficiency.</description>

      <title>SpikingGamma: Surrogate-Gradient Free and Temporally Precise Online Training of Spiking Neural Networks with Smoothed Delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuromorphic hardware implementations of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) promise energy-efficient, low-latency AI through sparse, event-driven computation. Yet, training SNNs under fine temporal discretization remains a major challenge, hindering both low-latency responsiveness and the mapping of software-trained SNNs to efficient hardware. In current approaches, spiking neurons are modeled as self-recurrent units, embedded into recurrent networks to maintain state over time, and trained with BPTT or RTRL variants based on surrogate gradients. These methods scale poorly with temporal resolution, while online approximations often exhibit instability for long sequences and tend to fail at capturing temporal patterns precisely. To address these limitations, we develop spiking neurons with internal recursive memory structures that we combine with sigma-delta spike-coding. We show that this SpikingGamma model supports direct error backpropagation without surrogate gradients, can learn fine temporal patterns with minimal spiking in an online manner, and scale feedforward SNNs to complex tasks and benchmarks with competitive accuracy, all while being insensitive to the temporal resolution of the model. Our approach offers both an alternative to current recurrent SNNs trained with surrogate gradients, and a direct route for mapping SNNs to neuromorphic hardware.</description>

Abstract: We establish a theoretical connection between wavelet transforms and spiking neural networks through scale-space theory. We rely on the scale-covariant guarantees in the leaky integrate-and-fire neurons to implement discrete mother wavelets that approximate continuous wavelets. A reconstruction experiment demonstrates the feasibility of the approach and warrants further analysis to mitigate current approximation errors. Our work suggests a novel spiking signal representation that could enable more energy-efficient signal processing algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays, neural networks act as a synonym for artificial intelligence. Present neural network models, although remarkably powerful, are inefficient both in terms of data and energy. Several alternative forms of neural networks have been proposed to address some of these problems. Specifically, spiking neural networks are suitable for efficient hardware implementations. However, effective learning algorithms for spiking networks remain elusive, although it is suspected that effective plasticity mechanisms could alleviate the problem of data efficiency. Here, we present a new framework for spiking neural networks - Spark - built upon the idea of modular design, from simple components to entire models. The aim of this framework is to provide an efficient and streamlined pipeline for spiking neural networks. We showcase this framework by solving the sparse-reward cartpole problem with simple plasticity mechanisms. We hope that a framework compatible with traditional ML pipelines may accelerate research in the area, specifically for continuous and unbatched learning, akin to the one animals exhibit.</description>

      <title>Introns and Templates Matter: Rethinking Linkage in GP-GOMEA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GP-GOMEA is among the state-of-the-art for symbolic regression, especially when it comes to finding small and potentially interpretable solutions. A key mechanism employed in any GOMEA variant is the exploitation of linkage, the dependencies between variables, to ensure efficient evolution. In GP-GOMEA, mutual information between node positions in GP trees has so far been used to learn linkage. For this, a fixed expression template is used. This however leads to introns for expressions smaller than the full template. As introns have no impact on fitness, their occurrences are not directly linked to selection. Consequently, introns can adversely affect the extent to which mutual information captures dependencies between tree nodes. To overcome this, we propose two new measures for linkage learning, one that explicitly considers introns in mutual information estimates, and one that revisits linkage learning in GP-GOMEA from a grey-box perspective, yielding a measure that needs not to be learned from the population but is derived directly from the template. Across five standard symbolic regression problems, GP-GOMEA achieves substantial improvements using both measures. We also find that the newly learned linkage structure closely reflects the template linkage structure, and that explicitly using the template structure yields the best performance overall.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient Neuromorphic Computing for Edge AI: A Framework with Adaptive Spiking Neural Networks and Hardware-Aware Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Edge AI applications increasingly require ultra-low-power, low-latency inference. Neuromorphic computing based on event-driven spiking neural networks (SNNs) offers an attractive path, but practical deployment on resource-constrained devices is limited by training difficulty, hardware-mapping overheads, and sensitivity to temporal dynamics. We present NeuEdge, a framework that combines adaptive SNN models with hardware-aware optimization for edge deployment. NeuEdge uses a temporal coding scheme that blends rate and spike-timing patterns to reduce spike activity while preserving accuracy, and a hardware-aware training procedure that co-optimizes network structure and on-chip placement to improve utilization on neuromorphic processors. An adaptive threshold mechanism adjusts neuron excitability from input statistics, reducing energy consumption without degrading performance. Across standard vision and audio benchmarks, NeuEdge achieves 91-96% accuracy with up to 2.3 ms inference latency on edge hardware and an estimated 847 GOp/s/W energy efficiency. A case study on an autonomous-drone workload shows up to 312x energy savings relative to conventional deep neural networks while maintaining real-time operation.</description>

      <title>LOGOS-CA: A Cellular Automaton Using Natural Language as State and Rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), trained solely on massive text data, have achieved high performance on the Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC), a benchmark proposed to measure commonsense knowledge and reasoning abilities about the real world. This suggests that the language produced by humanity describes a significant portion of the world with considerable nuance. In this study, we attempt to harness the high expressive power of language within cellular automata. Specifically, we express cell states and rules in natural language and delegate their updates to an LLM. Through this approach, cellular automata can transcend the constraints of merely numerical states and fixed rules, providing us with a richer platform for simulation. Here, we propose LOGOS-CA (Language Oriented Grid Of Statements - Cellular Automaton) as a natural framework to achieve this and examine its capabilities. We confirmed that LOGOS-CA successfully performs simple forest fire simulations and also serves as an intriguing subject for investigation from an Artificial Life (ALife) perspective. In this paper, we report the results of these experiments and discuss directions for future research using LOGOS-CA.</description>

      <title>Quality-Diversity Optimization as Multi-Objective Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Quality-Diversity (QD) optimization aims to discover a collection of high-performing solutions that simultaneously exhibit diverse behaviors within a user-defined behavior space. This paradigm has stimulated significant research interest and demonstrated practical utility in domains including robot control, creative design, and adversarial sample generation. A variety of QD algorithms with distinct design principles have been proposed in recent years. Instead of proposing a new QD algorithm, this work introduces a novel reformulation by casting the QD optimization as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem with a huge number of optimization objectives. By establishing this connection, we enable the direct adoption of well-established MOO methods, particularly set-based scalarization techniques, to solve QD problems through a collaborative search process. We further provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that our approach inherits theoretical guarantees from MOO while providing desirable properties for the QD optimization. Experimental studies across several QD applications confirm that our method achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art QD algorithms.</description>

      <title>Evolving Interpretable Constitutions for Multi-Agent Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.00755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constitutional AI has focused on single-model alignment using fixed principles. However, multi-agent systems create novel alignment challenges through emergent social dynamics. We present Constitutional Evolution, a framework for automatically discovering behavioral norms in multi-agent LLM systems. Using a grid-world simulation with survival pressure, we study the tension between individual and collective welfare, quantified via a Societal Stability Score S in [0,1] that combines productivity, survival, and conflict metrics. Adversarial constitutions lead to societal collapse (S= 0), while vague prosocial principles ("be helpful, harmless, honest") produce inconsistent coordination (S = 0.249). Even constitutions designed by Claude 4.5 Opus with explicit knowledge of the objective achieve only moderate performance (S= 0.332). Using LLM-driven genetic programming with multi-island evolution, we evolve constitutions maximizing social welfare without explicit guidance toward cooperation. The evolved constitution C* achieves S = 0.556 +/- 0.008 (123% higher than human-designed baselines, N = 10), eliminates conflict, and discovers that minimizing communication (0.9% vs 62.2% social actions) outperforms verbose coordination. Our interpretable rules demonstrate that cooperative norms can be discovered rather than prescribed.</description>

      <title>IDEM Enough? Evolving Highly Nonlinear Idempotent Boolean Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Idempotent Boolean functions form a highly structured subclass of Boolean functions that is closely related to rotation symmetry under a normal-basis representation and to invariance under a fixed linear map in a polynomial basis. These functions are attractive as candidates for cryptographic design, yet their additional algebraic constraints make the search for high nonlinearity substantially more difficult than in the unconstrained case. In this work, we investigate evolutionary methods for constructing highly nonlinear idempotent Boolean functions for dimensions $n=5$ up to $n=12$ using a polynomial basis representation with canonical primitive polynomials. Our results show that the problem of evolving idempotent functions is difficult due to the disruptive nature of crossover and mutation operators. Next, we show that idempotence can be enforced by encoding the truth table on orbits, yielding a compact genome of size equal to the number of distinct squaring orbits.</description>

      <title>Navigating Simply, Aligning Deeply: Winning Solutions for Mouse vs. AI 2025</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.00982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual robustness and neural alignment remain critical challenges in developing artificial agents that can match biological vision systems. We present the winning approaches from Team HCMUS_TheFangs for both tracks of the NeurIPS 2025 Mouse vs. AI: Robust Visual Foraging Competition. For Track 1 (Visual Robustness), we demonstrate that architectural simplicity combined with targeted components yields superior generalization, achieving 95.4% final score with a lightweight two-layer CNN enhanced by Gated Linear Units and observation normalization. For Track 2 (Neural Alignment), we develop a deep ResNet-like architecture with 16 convolutional layers and GLU-based gating that achieves top-1 neural prediction performance with 17.8 million parameters. Our systematic analysis of ten model checkpoints trained between 60K to 1.14M steps reveals that training duration exhibits a non-monotonic relationship with performance, with optimal results achieved around 200K steps. Through comprehensive ablation studies and failure case analysis, we provide insights into why simpler architectures excel at visual robustness while deeper models with increased capacity achieve better neural alignment. Our results challenge conventional assumptions about model complexity in visuomotor learning and offer practical guidance for developing robust, biologically-inspired visual agents.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Generalization in Evolutionary Feature Construction for Symbolic Regression through Vicinal Jensen Gap Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Genetic programming-based feature construction has achieved significant success in recent years as an automated machine learning technique to enhance learning performance. However, overfitting remains a challenge that limits its broader applicability. To improve generalization, we prove that vicinal risk, estimated through noise perturbation or mixup-based data augmentation, is bounded by the sum of empirical risk and a regularization term-either finite difference or the vicinal Jensen gap. Leveraging this decomposition, we propose an evolutionary feature construction framework that jointly optimizes empirical risk and the vicinal Jensen gap to control overfitting. Since datasets may vary in noise levels, we develop a noise estimation strategy to dynamically adjust regularization strength. Furthermore, to mitigate manifold intrusion-where data augmentation may generate unrealistic samples that fall outside the data manifold-we propose a manifold intrusion detection mechanism. Experimental results on 58 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of Jensen gap minimization compared to other complexity measures. Comparisons with 15 machine learning algorithms further indicate that genetic programming with the proposed overfitting control strategy achieves superior performance.</description>

      <title>Online Fine-Tuning of Pretrained Controllers for Autonomous Driving via Real-Time Recurrent RL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02236v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deploying pretrained policies in real-world applications presents substantial challenges that fundamentally limit the practical applicability of learning-based control systems. When autonomous systems encounter environmental changes in system dynamics, sensor drift, or task objectives, fixed policies rapidly degrade in performance. We show that employing Real-Time Recurrent Reinforcement Learning (RTRRL), a biologically plausible algorithm for online adaptation, can effectively fine-tune a pretrained policy to improve autonomous agents' performance on driving tasks. We further show that RTRRL synergizes with a recent biologically inspired recurrent network model, the Liquid-Resistance Liquid-Capacitance RNN. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this closed-loop approach in a simulated CarRacing environment and in a real-world line-following task with a RoboRacer car equipped with an event camera.</description>

      <title>Backpropagation as Physical Relaxation: Exact Gradients in Finite Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Backpropagation, the foundational algorithm for training neural networks, is typically understood as a symbolic computation that recursively applies the chain rule. We show it emerges exactly as the finite-time relaxation of a physical dynamical system. By formulating feedforward inference as a continuous-time process and applying Lagrangian theory of non-conservative systems to handle asymmetric interactions, we derive a global energy functional on a doubled state space encoding both activations and sensitivities. The saddle-point dynamics of this energy perform inference and credit assignment simultaneously through local interactions. We term this framework ''Dyadic Backpropagation''. Crucially, we prove that unit-step Euler discretization, the natural timescale of layer transitions, recovers standard backpropagation exactly in precisely 2L steps for an L-layer network, with no approximations. Unlike prior energy-based methods requiring symmetric weights, asymptotic convergence, or vanishing perturbations, our framework guarantees exact gradients in finite time. This establishes backpropagation as the digitally optimized shadow of a continuous physical relaxation, providing a rigorous foundation for exact gradient computation in analog and neuromorphic substrates where continuous dynamics are native.</description>

      <title>Proxy Target: Bridging the Gap Between Discrete Spiking Neural Networks and Continuous Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24161v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer low-latency and energy-efficient decision making on neuromorphic hardware, making them attractive for Reinforcement Learning (RL) in resource-constrained edge devices. However, most RL algorithms for continuous control are designed for Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), particularly the target network soft update mechanism, which conflicts with the discrete and non-differentiable dynamics of spiking neurons. We show that this mismatch destabilizes SNN training and degrades performance. To bridge the gap between discrete SNNs and continuous-control algorithms, we propose a novel proxy target framework. The proxy network introduces continuous and differentiable dynamics that enable smooth target updates, stabilizing the learning process. Since the proxy operates only during training, the deployed SNN remains fully energy-efficient with no additional inference overhead. Extensive experiments on continuous control benchmarks demonstrate that our framework consistently improves stability and achieves up to $32\%$ higher performance across various spiking neuron models. Notably, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach that enables SNNs with simple Leaky Integrate and Fire (LIF) neurons to surpass their ANN counterparts in continuous control. This work highlights the importance of SNN-tailored RL algorithms and paves the way for neuromorphic agents that combine high performance with low power consumption.

      <title>When Routers, Switches and Interconnects Compute: A processing-in-interconnect Paradigm for Scalable Neuromorphic AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19548v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Routing, switching, and the interconnect fabric are essential components in implementing large-scale neuromorphic computing architectures. While this fabric plays only a supporting role in the process of computing, for large AI workloads, this fabric ultimately determines the overall system's performance, such as energy consumption and speed. In this paper, we offer a potential solution to address this bottleneck by addressing two fundamental questions: (a) What computing paradigms are inherent in existing routing, switching, and interconnect systems, and how can they be used to implement a Processing-in-Interconnect ($\pi^2$) computing paradigm? and (b) How to train $\pi^2$ network on standard AI benchmarks? To address the first question, we demonstrate that all operations required for typical AI workloads can be mapped onto delays, causality, time-outs, packet drops, and broadcast operations, all of which are already implemented in current packet-switching and packet-routing hardware. {We then show that existing buffering and traffic-shaping embedded algorithms can be minimally modified to implement $\pi^2$ neuron models and synaptic operations. To address the second question, we show how a knowledge distillation framework can be used to train and cross-map well-established neural network topologies onto $\pi^2$ architectures without any degradation in the generalization performance. Our analysis show that the effective energy utilization of a $\pi^2$ network is significantly higher than that of other neuromorphic computing platforms; as a result, we believe that the $\pi^2$ paradigm offers a more scalable architectural path toward achieving brain-scale AI inference.</description>

      <title>A Neural Surrogate-Enhanced Multi-Method Framework for Robust Wing Design Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08582v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a modular and scalable design optimization framework for the wing design process that enables faster early-phase design while ensuring aerodynamic stability. The pipeline starts with the generation of initial wing geometries and then proceeds to optimize the wing using several algorithms. Aerodynamic performance is assessed using a Vortex Lattice Method (VLM) applied to a carefully selected dataset of wing configurations. These results are employed to develop surrogate neural network models, which can predict lift and drag rapidly and accurately. The stability evaluation is implemented by setting the control surfaces and components to fixed positions in order to have realistic flight dynamics. The approach unifies and compares several optimization techniques, including Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithms (GA), gradient-based MultiStart methods, Bayesian optimization, and Lipschitz optimization. Each method ensures constraint management via adaptive strategies and penalty functions, where the targets for lift and design feasibility are enforced. The progression of aerodynamic characteristics and geometries over the optimization iterations will be investigated in order to clarify each algorithm's convergence characteristics and performance efficiency. Our results show improvement in aerodynamic qualities and robust stability properties, offering a mechanism for wing design at speed and precision. In the interest of reproducibility and community development, the complete implementation is publicly available at Github.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel predict-then-optimize framework for maritime search operations that integrates trajectory forecasting with UAV deployment optimization-an end-to-end approach not addressed in prior work. A large language model predicts the drifter's trajectory, and spatial uncertainty is modeled using Gaussian-based particle sampling. Unlike traditional static deployment methods, we dynamically adapt UAV detection radii based on distance and optimize their placement using meta-heuristic algorithms. Experiments on real-world data from the Korean coastline demonstrate that our method, particularly the repair mechanism designed for this problem, significantly outperforms the random search baselines. This work introduces a practical and robust integration of trajectory prediction and spatial optimization for intelligent maritime rescue.</description>

      <title>A Backpropagation-Free Feedback-Hebbian Network for Continual Learning Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06758v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Feedback-rich neural architectures can regenerate earlier representations and inject temporal context, making them a natural setting for strictly local synaptic plasticity. Existing literature raises doubt about whether a minimal, backpropagation-free feedback-Hebbian system can already express interpretable continual-learning-relevant behaviors under controlled training schedules. In this work, we introduce a compact prediction-reconstruction architecture with a dedicated feedback pathway providing lightweight, locally trainable temporal context for continual adaptation. All synapses are updated by a unified local rule combining centered Hebbian covariance, Oja-style stabilization, and a local supervised drive where targets are available. With a simple two-pair association task, learning is characterized through layer-wise activity snapshots, connectivity trajectories (row and column means of learned weights), and a normalized retention index across phases. Under sequential A to B training, forward output connectivity exhibits a long-term depression (LTD)-like suppression of the earlier association, while feedback connectivity preserves an A-related trace during acquisition of B. Under an alternating sequence, both associations are concurrently maintained rather than sequentially suppressed. Architectural controls and rule-term ablations isolate the role of dedicated feedback in regeneration and co-maintenance, alongside the role of the local supervised term in output selectivity and unlearning. Together, the results show that a compact feedback pathway trained with local plasticity can support regeneration and continual-learning-relevant dynamics in a minimal, mechanistically transparent setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.17899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neighborhood search operators are critical to the performance of Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) and rely heavily on expert design. Although recent LLM-based Automated Heuristic Design (AHD) methods have made notable progress, they primarily optimize individual heuristics or components independently, lacking explicit exploration and exploitation of dynamic coupling relationships between operators. In this paper, multi-operator optimization in MOEAs is formulated as a Markov decision process, enabling the improvement of interdependent operators through sequential decision-making. To address this, we propose the Evolution of Operator Combination (E2OC) framework for MOEAs, which achieves the co-evolution of design strategies and executable codes. E2OC employs Monte Carlo Tree Search to progressively search combinations of operator design strategies and adopts an operator rotation mechanism to identify effective operator configurations while supporting the integration of mainstream AHD methods as the underlying designer. Experimental results across AHD tasks with varying objectives and problem scales show that E2OC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art AHD and other multi-heuristic co-design frameworks, demonstrating strong generalization and sustained optimization capability.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Benchmark: Black-Box Optimization Benchmark Design through Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Benchmark Design in Black-Box Optimization (BBO) is a fundamental yet open-ended topic. Early BBO benchmarks are predominantly human-crafted, introducing expert bias and constraining diversity. Automating this design process can relieve the human-in-the-loop burden while enhancing diversity and objectivity. We propose Evolution of Benchmark (EoB), an automated BBO benchmark designer empowered by the large language model (LLM) and its program evolution capability. Specifically, we formulate benchmark design as a bi-objective optimization problem towards maximizing (i) landscape diversity and (ii) algorithm-differentiation ability across a portfolio of BBO solvers. Under this paradigm, EoB iteratively prompts LLM to evolve a population of benchmark programs and employs a reflection-based scheme to co-evolve the landscape and its corresponding program. Comprehensive experiments validate our EoB is a competitive candidate in multi-dimensional usages: 1) Benchmarking BBO algorithms; 2) Training and testing learning-assisted BBO algorithms; 3) Extending proxy for expensive real-world problems.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Interplay of Parameterization and Optimizer in Gradient-Free Topology Optimization: A Cantilever Beam Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gradient-free black-box optimization (BBO) is widely used in engineering design and provides a flexible framework for topology optimization (TO), enabling the discovery of high-performing structural designs without requiring gradient information from simulations. Yet, its success depends on two key choices: the geometric parameterization defining the search space and the optimizer exploring it.
  This study investigates this interplay through a compliance minimization problem for a cantilever beam subject to a connectivity constraint. We benchmark three geometric parameterizations, each combined with three representative BBO algorithms: differential evolution, covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy, and heteroscedastic evolutionary Bayesian optimization, across 10D, 20D, and 50D design spaces.
  Results reveal that parameterization quality has a stronger influence on optimization performance than optimizer choice: a well-structured parameterization enables robust and competitive performance across algorithms, whereas weaker representations increase optimizer dependency. Overall, this study highlights the dominant role of geometric parameterization in practical BBO-based TO and shows that algorithm performance and selection cannot be fairly assessed without accounting for the induced design space.</description>

      <title>COBRA++: Enhanced COBRA Optimizer with Augmented Surrogate Pool and Reinforced Surrogate Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The optimization problems in realistic world present significant challenges onto optimization algorithms, such as the expensive evaluation issue and complex constraint conditions. COBRA optimizer (including its up-to-date variants) is a representative and effective tool for addressing such optimization problems, which introduces 1) RBF surrogate to reduce online evaluation and 2) bi-stage optimization process to alternate search for feasible solution and optimal solution. Though promising, its design space, i.e., surrogate model pool and selection standard, is still manually decided by human expert, resulting in labor-intensive fine-tuning for novel tasks. In this paper, we propose a learning-based adaptive strategy (COBRA++) that enhances COBRA in two aspects: 1) An augmented surrogate pool to break the tie with RBF-like surrogate and hence enhances model diversity and approximation capability; 2) A reinforcement learning-based online model selection policy that empowers efficient and accurate optimization process. The model selection policy is trained to maximize overall performance of COBRA++ across a distribution of constrained optimization problems with diverse properties. We have conducted multi-dimensional validation experiments and demonstrate that COBRA++ achieves substantial performance improvement against vanilla COBRA and its adaptive variant. Ablation studies are provided to support correctness of each design component in COBRA++.</description>

      <title>A Spatiotemporal Perspective on Dynamical Computation in Neural Information Processing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13669v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal flows of neural activity, such as traveling waves, have been observed throughout the brain since the earliest recordings; yet there is still little consensus on their functional role. Recent experiments and models have linked traveling waves to visual and physical motion, but these observations have been difficult to reconcile with standard accounts of topographically organized selectivity and feedforward receptive fields. Here, we introduce a theoretical framework that formalizes and generalizes the connection between 'motion' and flowing neural dynamics in the language of equivariant neural network theory. We consider 'motion' not only in physical or visual spaces, but also in more abstract representational spaces, and we argue that recurrent traveling-wave-like dynamics are not just useful but necessary for accurate and stable processing of any signal undergoing such motion. Formally, we show that for any non-trivial recurrent neural network to process a sequence undergoing a flow transformation (such as visual motion) in a structured equivariant manner, its hidden state dynamics must actively realize a homomorphic representation of the same flow through recurrent connectivity. In this ''spatiotemporal perspective on dynamical computation'', traveling waves and related flows are best understood as faithful dynamic representations of stimulus flows; and consequently the natural inclination of biological systems towards such dynamics may be viewed as an innate inductive bias towards efficiency and generalization in the spatiotemporally-structured dynamical world they inhabit.</description>

      <title>Future frame prediction in chest and liver cine MRI using the PCA respiratory motion model: comparing transformers and dynamically trained recurrent neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Respiratory motion complicates accurate irradiation of thoraco-abdominal tumors in radiotherapy, as treatment-system latency entails target-location uncertainties. This work addresses frame forecasting in chest and liver cine MRI to compensate for such delays. We investigate RNNs trained with online learning algorithms, enabling adaptation to changing respiratory patterns via on-the-fly parameter updates, and transformers, increasingly common in time series forecasting for their ability to capture long-term dependencies. Experiments were conducted using 12 sagittal thoracic and upper-abdominal cine-MRI sequences from ETH Z\"urich and OvGU. PCA decomposes the Lucas-Kanade optical-flow field into static deformations and low-dimensional time-dependent weights. We compare various methods forecasting the latter: linear filters, population and sequence-specific encoder-only transformers, and RNNs trained with real-time recurrent learning (RTRL), unbiased online recurrent optimization, decoupled neural interfaces, and sparse one-step approximation (SnAp-1). Predicted displacements were used to warp the reference frame and generate future images. Prediction accuracy decreased with the horizon h. Linear regression performed best at short horizons (1.3mm geometrical error at h=0.32s, ETH Z\"urich data), while RTRL and SnAp-1 outperformed the other algorithms at medium-to-long horizons, with geometrical errors below 1.4mm and 2.8mm on the sequences from ETH Z\"urich and OvGU (the latter featuring higher motion variability, noise, and lower contrast), respectively. The sequence-specific transformer was competitive for low-to-medium horizons, but transformers remained overall limited by data scarcity and domain shift between datasets. Predicted frames visually resembled the ground truth, with notable errors occurring near the diaphragm at end-inspiration and regions affected by out-of-plane motion.</description>

      <title>PaceLLM: Brain-Inspired Large Language Models for Long-Context Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance across domains, their long-context capabilities are limited by transient neural activations causing information decay and unstructured feed-forward network (FFN) weights leading to semantic fragmentation. Inspired by the brain's working memory and cortical modularity, we propose PaceLLM, featuring two innovations: (1) a Persistent Activity (PA) Mechanism that mimics prefrontal cortex (PFC) neurons' persistent firing by introducing an activation-level memory bank to dynamically retrieve, reuse, and update critical FFN states, addressing contextual decay; and (2) Cortical Expert (CE) Clustering that emulates task-adaptive neural specialization to reorganize FFN weights into semantic modules, establishing cross-token dependencies and mitigating fragmentation. Extensive evaluations show that PaceLLM achieves 6% improvement on LongBench's Multi-document QA and 12.5-17.5% performance gains on Infinite-Bench tasks, while extending measurable context length to 200K tokens in Needle-In-A-Haystack (NIAH) tests. This work pioneers brain-inspired LLM optimization and is complementary to other works. Besides, it can be generalized to any model and enhance their long-context performance and interpretability without structural overhauls.</description>

      <title>Pulling Back the Curtain on Deep Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22832v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Post-hoc explainability methods typically associate each output score of a deep neural network with an input-space direction, most commonly instantiated as the gradient and visualized as a saliency map. However, these approaches often yield explanations that are noisy, lack perceptual alignment and, thus, offer limited interpretability. While many explanation methods attempt to address this issue via modified backward rules or additional heuristics, such approaches are often difficult to justify theoretically and frequently fail basic sanity checks. We introduce Semantic Pullbacks (SP), a faithful and effective post-hoc explanation method for deep neural networks. Semantic Pullbacks address the limitations above by isolating the network's effective linear action via a principled pullback formulation and refining it to recover coherent local structures learned by the target neuron. As a result, SP produces perceptually aligned, class-conditional explanations that highlight meaningful features, support compelling counterfactual perturbations, and admit a clear theoretical motivation. Across standard faithfulness benchmarks, Semantic Pullbacks significantly outperform established attribution methods on both classical convolutional architectures (ResNet50, VGG) and transformer-based models (PVT), while remaining general and computationally efficient. Our method can be easily plugged into existing deep learning pipelines and extended to other modalities.</description>

      <title>SCAR: State-Space Compression for Scalable AI-Based Network Management of Vehicular Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing demand for connected vehicular services poses significant challenges for AI-based network and service management due to the high volume and rapid variability of network state information. Traditional management and control mechanisms struggle to scale when processing fine-grained metrics such as Channel Quality Indicators (CQIs) in dynamic vehicular environments. To address this challenge, we propose SCAR (State-Space Compression for AI-Based Network Management), an edge-assisted framework that improves scalability and fairness in vehicular services through network state abstraction. SCAR employs machine-learning (ML)-based compression techniques, including clustering and radial basis function (RBF) networks, to reduce the dimensionality of CQI-derived state information while preserving essential features relevant to management decisions. The resulting compressed states are used to train reinforcement learning (RL)-based management policies that aim to maximize network efficiency while satisfying service-level fairness objectives defined by the NGMN. Simulation results show that SCAR increases the time spent in feasible management regions by 14% and reduces unfair service allocation time by 15% compared to reinforcement learning baselines operating on uncompressed state information. Furthermore, simulated annealing with stochastic tunneling (SAST)-based clustering reduces state compression distortion by 10%, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed approach. These results demonstrate that SCAR enables scalable and fair AI-assisted network and service management in dynamic vehicular systems.</description>

      <title>QUASAR: An Evolutionary Algorithm to Accelerate High-Dimensional Numerical Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13843v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional numerical optimization presents a persistent challenge in computational science. This paper introduces Quasi-Adaptive Search with Asymptotic Reinitialization (QUASAR), an evolutionary algorithm to accelerate convergence in complex, non-differentiable problems afflicted by the curse of dimensionality. QUASAR expands upon the core principles of Differential Evolution (DE), introducing quasi-adaptive mechanisms to dynamically balance exploration and exploitation in its search. Inspired by the behavior of quantum particles, the algorithm utilizes three highly stochastic mechanisms that augment standard DE: 1) probabilistic mutation strategies and scaling factors; 2) rank-based crossover rates; 3) asymptotically decaying covariance reinitializations.
  Evaluated on the notoriously difficult CEC2017 benchmark suite of 29 test functions, QUASAR achieved the lowest overall rank sum (367) using the Friedman test, outperforming DE (735) and L-SHADE (452). Geometric mean comparisons show average final solution quality improvements of $3.85 \times$ and $2.07 \times$ compared to DE and L-SHADE, respectively ($p \ll 0.001$), with average optimization speed averaging $1.40 \times$ and $5.16 \times$ faster. QUASAR's performance establishes it as an effective, efficient, and user-friendly evolutionary algorithm for complex high-dimensional problems.</description>

      <title>Discount Model Search for Quality Diversity Optimization in High-Dimensional Measure Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quality diversity (QD) optimization searches for a collection of solutions that optimize an objective while attaining diverse outputs of a user-specified, vector-valued measure function. Contemporary QD algorithms are typically limited to low-dimensional measures because high-dimensional measures are prone to distortion, where many solutions found by the QD algorithm map to similar measures. For example, the state-of-the-art CMA-MAE algorithm guides measure space exploration with a histogram in measure space that records so-called discount values. However, CMA-MAE stagnates in domains with high-dimensional measure spaces because solutions with similar measures fall into the same histogram cell and hence receive the same discount value. To address these limitations, we propose Discount Model Search (DMS), which guides exploration with a model that provides a smooth, continuous representation of discount values. In high-dimensional measure spaces, this model enables DMS to distinguish between solutions with similar measures and thus continue exploration. We show that DMS facilitates new capabilities for QD algorithms by introducing two new domains where the measure space is the high-dimensional space of images, which enables users to specify their desired measures by providing a dataset of images rather than hand-designing the measure function. Results in these domains and on high-dimensional benchmarks show that DMS outperforms CMA-MAE and other existing black-box QD algorithms.</description>
