      <title>Unveiling Online Conspiracy Theorists: a Text-Based Approach and Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In today's digital landscape, the proliferation of conspiracy theories within the disinformation ecosystem of online platforms represents a growing concern. This paper delves into the complexities of this phenomenon. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of two distinct X (formerly known as Twitter) datasets: one comprising users with conspiracy theorizing patterns and another made of users lacking such tendencies and thus serving as a control group. The distinguishing factors between these two groups are explored across three dimensions: emotions, idioms, and linguistic features. Our findings reveal marked differences in the lexicon and language adopted by conspiracy theorists with respect to other users. We developed a machine learning classifier capable of identifying users who propagate conspiracy theories based on a rich set of 871 features. The results demonstrate high accuracy, with an average F1 score of 0.88. Moreover, this paper unveils the most discriminating characteristics that define conspiracy theory propagators.</description>

      <title>Combining Twitter and Mobile Phone Data to Observe Border-Rush: The Turkish-European Border Opening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following Turkey's 2020 decision to revoke border controls, many individuals journeyed towards the Greek, Bulgarian, and Turkish borders. However, the lack of verifiable statistics on irregular migration and discrepancies between media reports and actual migration patterns require further exploration. The objective of this study is to bridge this knowledge gap by harnessing novel data sources, specifically mobile phone and Twitter data, to construct estimators of cross-border mobility and to cultivate a qualitative comprehension of the unfolding events. By employing a migration diplomacy framework, we analyse emergent mobility patterns at the border. Our findings demonstrate the potential of mobile phone data for quantitative metrics and Twitter data for qualitative understanding. We underscore the ethical implications of leveraging Big Data, particularly considering the vulnerability of the population under study. This underscores the imperative for exhaustive research into the socio-political facets of human mobility, with the aim of discerning the potentialities, limitations, and risks inherent in these data sources and their integration. This scholarly endeavour contributes to a more nuanced understanding of migration dynamics and paves the way for the formulation of regulations that preclude misuse and oppressive surveillance, thereby ensuring a more accurate representation of migration realities.</description>

      <title>Detecting and Mitigating Bias in Algorithms Used to Disseminate Information in Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social connections are a conduit through which individuals communicate, information propagates, and diseases spread. Identifying individuals that are more likely to adopt ideas or technologies and spread them to others is essential in order to develop effective information campaigns, fight epidemics, and to maximize the reach of limited resources. Consequently a lot of work has focused on identifying sets of influencers. Here we show that seeding information using these influence maximization methods, only benefits connected and central individuals, consistently leaving the most vulnerable behind. Our results highlights troublesome outcomes of influence maximization algorithms: they do not disseminate information in an equitable manner threatening to create an increasingly unequal society. To overcome this issue we devise a simple, multi-objective algorithm, which maximises both influence and information equity. Our work demonstrates how to find fairer influencer sets, highlighting that in our search for maximizing information, we do not need to compromise on information equality.</description>

      <title>Refined Graph Encoder Embedding via Self-Training and Latent Community Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a refined graph encoder embedding method, enhancing the original graph encoder embedding using linear transformation, self-training, and hidden community recovery within observed communities. We provide the theoretical rationale for the refinement procedure, demonstrating how and why our proposed method can effectively identify useful hidden communities via stochastic block models, and how the refinement method leads to improved vertex embedding and better decision boundaries for subsequent vertex classification. The efficacy of our approach is validated through a collection of simulated and real-world graph data.</description>

      <title>Cascade-based Randomization for Inferring Causal Effects under Diffusion Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The presence of interference, where the outcome of an individual may depend on the treatment assignment and behavior of neighboring nodes, can lead to biased causal effect estimation. Current approaches to network experiment design focus on limiting interference through cluster-based randomization, in which clusters are identified using graph clustering, and cluster randomization dictates the node assignment to treatment and control. However, cluster-based randomization approaches perform poorly when interference propagates in cascades, whereby the response of individuals to treatment propagates to their multi-hop neighbors. When we have knowledge of the cascade seed nodes, we can leverage this interference structure to mitigate the resulting causal effect estimation bias. With this goal, we propose a cascade-based network experiment design that initiates treatment assignment from the cascade seed node and propagates the assignment to their multi-hop neighbors to limit interference during cascade growth and thereby reduce the overall causal effect estimation error. Our extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approaches in estimating causal effects in network data.</description>

      <title>How Universal Polynomial Bases Enhance Spectral Graph Neural Networks: Heterophily, Over-smoothing, and Over-squashing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectral Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), alternatively known as graph filters, have gained increasing prevalence for heterophily graphs. Optimal graph filters rely on Laplacian eigendecomposition for Fourier transform. In an attempt to avert prohibitive computations, numerous polynomial filters have been proposed. However, polynomials in the majority of these filters are predefined and remain fixed across different graphs, failing to accommodate the varying degrees of heterophily. Addressing this gap, we demystify the intrinsic correlation between the spectral property of desired polynomial bases and the heterophily degrees via thorough theoretical analyses. Subsequently, we develop a novel adaptive heterophily basis wherein the basis vectors mutually form angles reflecting the heterophily degree of the graph. We integrate this heterophily basis with the homophily basis to construct a universal polynomial basis UniBasis, which devises a polynomial filter based graph neural network - UniFilter. It optimizes the convolution and propagation in GNN, thus effectively limiting over-smoothing and alleviating over-squashing. Our extensive experiments, conducted on a diverse range of real-world and synthetic datasets with varying degrees of heterophily, support the superiority of UniFilter. These results not only demonstrate the universality of UniBasis but also highlight its proficiency in graph explanation.</description>

      <title>Improving Ego-Cluster for Network Effect Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05945v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The network effect, wherein one user's activity impacts another user, is common in social network platforms. Many new features in social networks are specifically designed to create a network effect, enhancing user engagement. For instance, content creators tend to produce more when their articles and posts receive positive feedback from followers. This paper discusses a new cluster-level experimentation methodology for measuring creator-side metrics in the context of A/B experiments. The methodology is designed to address cases where the experiment randomization unit and the metric measurement unit differ. It is a crucial part of LinkedIn's overall strategy to foster a robust creator community and ecosystem. The method is developed based on widely-cited research at LinkedIn but significantly improves the efficiency and flexibility of the clustering algorithm. This improvement results in a stronger capability for measuring creator-side metrics and an increased velocity for creator-related experiments.</description>

      <title>Disentangling the Potential Impacts of Papers into Diffusion, Conformity, and Contribution Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09262v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The potential impact of an academic paper is determined by various factors, including its popularity and contribution. Existing models usually estimate original citation counts based on static graphs and fail to differentiate values from nuanced perspectives. In this study, we propose a novel graph neural network to Disentangle the Potential impacts of Papers into Diffusion, Conformity, and Contribution values (called DPPDCC). Given a target paper, DPPDCC encodes temporal and structural features within the constructed dynamic heterogeneous graph. Particularly, to capture the knowledge flow, we emphasize the importance of comparative and co-cited/citing information between papers and aggregate snapshots evolutionarily. To unravel popularity, we contrast augmented graphs to extract the essence of diffusion and predict the accumulated citation binning to model conformity. We further apply orthogonal constraints to encourage distinct modeling of each perspective and preserve the inherent value of contribution. To evaluate models' generalization for papers published at various times, we reformulate the problem by partitioning data based on specific time points to mirror real-world conditions. Extensive experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that DPPDCC significantly outperforms baselines for previously, freshly, and immediately published papers. Further analyses confirm its robust capabilities. We will make our datasets and codes publicly available.</description>

      <title>Scalable Continuous-time Diffusion Framework for Network Inference and Influence Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of continuous-time information diffusion has been an important area of research for many applications in recent years. When only the diffusion traces (cascades) are accessible, cascade-based network inference and influence estimation are two essential problems to explore. Alas, existing methods exhibit limited capability to infer and process networks with more than a few thousand nodes, suffering from scalability issues. In this paper, we view the diffusion process as a continuous-time dynamical system, based on which we establish a continuous-time diffusion model. Subsequently, we instantiate the model to a scalable and effective framework (FIM) to approximate the diffusion propagation from available cascades, thereby inferring the underlying network structure. Furthermore, we undertake an analysis of the approximation error of FIM for network inference. To achieve the desired scalability for influence estimation, we devise an advanced sampling technique and significantly boost the efficiency. We also quantify the effect of the approximation error on influence estimation theoretically. Experimental results showcase the effectiveness and superior scalability of FIM on network inference and influence estimation.</description>

      <title>Learning Social Graph for Inactive User Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social relations have been widely incorporated into recommender systems to alleviate data sparsity problem. However, raw social relations don't always benefit recommendation due to their inferior quality and insufficient quantity, especially for inactive users, whose interacted items are limited. In this paper, we propose a novel social recommendation method called LSIR (\textbf{L}earning \textbf{S}ocial Graph for \textbf{I}nactive User \textbf{R}ecommendation) that learns an optimal social graph structure for social recommendation, especially for inactive users. LSIR recursively aggregates user and item embeddings to collaboratively encode item and user features. Then, graph structure learning (GSL) is employed to refine the raw user-user social graph, by removing noisy edges and adding new edges based on the enhanced embeddings. Meanwhile, mimic learning is implemented to guide active users in mimicking inactive users during model training, which improves the construction of new edges for inactive users. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that LSIR achieves significant improvements of up to 129.58\% on NDCG in inactive user recommendation. Our code is available at~\url{https://github.com/liun-online/LSIR}.</description>
