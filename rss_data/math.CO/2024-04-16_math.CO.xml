      <title>Twist polynomial as a weight system for set systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Chmutov proved that the partial-dual polynomial considered as a function on chord diagrams satisfies the four-term relation. Deng et al. then proved that this function on framed chord diagrams also satisfies the four-term relation, i.e., is a framed weight system. In this paper, we extend their results to the twist polynomial of a set system by proving that the twist polynomial on set systems satisfies the four-term relation.</description>

      <title>Log-concavity in Combinatorics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We survey some of the mechanisms used to prove that naturally defined sequences in combinatorics are log-concave. Among these mechanisms are Alexandrov's inequality for mixed discriminants, the Alexandrov Fenchel inequality for mixed volumes, Lorentzian polynomials, and the Hard Lefschetz theorem. We use these mechanisms to prove some new log-concavity and extremal results related to partially ordered sets and matroids. We present joint work with Ramon van Handel and Xinmeng Zeng to give a complete characterization for the extremals of the Kahn-Saks inequality. We extend Stanley's inequality for regular matroids to arbitrary matroids using the technology of Lorentzian polynomials. As a result, we provide a new proof of the weakest Mason conjecture. We also prove necessary and sufficient conditions for the Gorenstein ring associated to the basis generating polynomial of a matroid to satisfy Hodge-Riemann relations of degree one on the facets of the positive orthant.</description>

      <title>Increasing Binary Trees and the $(\alpha,\beta)$-Eulerian Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In light of the grammar given by Ji for the $(\alpha,\beta)$-Eulerian polynomials introduced by Carlitz and Scoville, we provide a labeling scheme for increasing binary trees. In this setting, we obtain a combinatorial interpretation of the $\gamma$-coefficients of the $\alpha$-Eulerian polynomials in terms of forests of planted 0-1-2-plane trees, which specializes to a combinatorial interpretation of the $\gamma$-coefficients of the derangement polynomials in the same vein. By means of a decomposition of an increasing binary tree into a forest, we find combinatorial interpretations of the sums involving two identities of Ji, one of which can be viewed as $(\alpha,\beta)$-extensions of the formulas of Petersen and Stembridge.</description>

      <title>Sublinear hitting sets for some geometric graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an $n$-vertex graph $G$, let $h(G)$ denote the smallest size of a subset of $V(G)$ such that it intersects every maximum independent set of $G$. A conjecture posed by Bollob\'{a}s, Erd\H{o}s and Tuza in early 90s remains widely open, asserting that for any $n$-vertex graph $G$, if the independence number $\alpha(G) =\Omega(n) $, then $h(G) = o(n)$. In this paper, we establish the validity of this conjecture for various classes of graphs, including disk graphs, even-hole-free graphs, circle graphs, and those hereditary graphs having sublinear balanced separators. We also determine the exact values of smallest possible hitting sets in comparability graphs, incomparability graphs and the graphs with VC-dimension one.</description>

      <title>Complexity and algorithms for Arc-Kayles and Non-Disconnecting Arc-Kayles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arc-Kayles is a game where two players alternate removing two adjacent vertices until no move is left. Introduced in 1978, its computational complexity is still open. More recently, subtraction games, where the players cannot disconnect the graph while removing vertices, were introduced. In particular, Arc-Kayles admits a non-disconnecting variant that is a subtraction game. We study the computational complexity of subtraction games on graphs, proving that they are PSPACE-complete even on very structured graph classes (split, bipartite of any even girth). We prove that Non-Disconnecting Arc-Kayles can be solved in polynomial-time on unicyclic graphs, clique trees, and subclasses of threshold graphs. We also show that a sufficient condition for a second player-win on Arc-Kayles is equivalent to the graph isomorphism problem.</description>

      <title>An upper bound on the number of relevant variables for Boolean functions on the Hamming graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectrum of a complex-valued function $f$ on $\mathbb{Z}_{q}^n$ is the set $\{|u|:u\in \mathbb{Z}_q^n~\mathrm{and}~\widehat{f}(u)\neq 0\}$, where $|u|$ is the Hamming weight of $u$ and $\widehat{f}$ is the Fourier transform of $f$. Let $1\leq d'\leq d\leq n$. In this work, we study Boolean functions on $\mathbb{Z}_{q}^n$, $q\geq 3$, whose spectrum is a subset of $\{0\}\cup \{d',\ldots,d\}$. We prove that such functions have at most $\frac{d}{2}\cdot \frac{q^{d+d'}}{2^{d'}(q-1)^{d'}}$ relevant variables for $d'+d\leq n+1$. In particular, we prove that any Boolean function of degree $d$ on $\mathbb{Z}_{q}^n$, $q\geq 3$, has at most $\frac{dq^{d+1}}{4(q-1)}$ relevant variables. We also show that any equitable 2-partition of the Hamming graph $H(n,q)$, $q\geq 3$, associated with the eigenvalue $n(q-1)-qd$ has at most $\frac{d}{2}\cdot \frac{q^{2d}}{2^d(q-1)^{d}}$ relevant variables for $d\leq \frac{n+1}{2}$.</description>

      <title>Finiteness of the number of irreducible $\lambda$-quiddities over a finite commutative and unitary ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\lambda$-quiddities of size $n$ are $n$-tuples of elements of a fixed set, solutions of a matrix equation appearing in the study of Coxeter's friezes. The study of these solutions involves in particular the use of a notion of irreducibility. The main objective of this text is to show that there is a finite number of irreducible $\lambda$-quiddities over a finite unitary commutative ring and to obtain in this case an upper bound of the maximal size of them.</description>

      <title>Macdonald identities, Weyl-Kac denominator formulas and affine Grassmannians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We expand the affine Weyl denominator formulas as signed $q$-series of ordinary Weyl characters running over the affine Grassmannian. Here the grading in $q$ coincides with the (dual) atomic length of the root system considered as introduced by Chapelier-Laget and Gerber. Next, we give simple expressions of the atomic lengths in terms of self-conjugate core partitions. This permits in particular to rederive, from the general theory of affine root systems, some results of the second author obtained by case-by-case computations on determinants and the use of particular families of strict partitions. These families are proved to be in simple one-to-one correspondences with the previous core partition model and, through this correspondence, the atomic length on cores equates the rank of the strict partitions considered. Finally, we make explicit some interactions between the affine Grassmannian elements and the Nekrasov-Okounkov type formulas.</description>

      <title>Exploring Homological Properties of Independent Complexes of Kneser Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the topological properties of the independence complex of Kneser graphs, Ind(KG$(n, k))$, with $n\geq 3$ and $k\geq 1$. By identifying one kind of maximal simplices through projective planes, we obtain homology generators for the $6$-dimensional homology of the complex Ind(KG$(3, k))$. Using cross-polytopal generators, we provide lower bounds for the rank of $p$-dimensional homology of the complex Ind(KG$(n, k))$ where $p=1/2\cdot {2n+k\choose 2n}$.
  Denote $\mathcal{F}_n^{[m]}$ to be the collection of $n$-subsets of $[m]$ equipped with the symmetric difference metric. We prove that if $\ell$ is the minimal integer with the $q$th dimensional reduced homology $\tilde{H}_q(\mathcal{VR}(\mathcal{F}^{[\ell]}_n; 2(n-1)))$ being non-trivial, then $$\text{rank} (\tilde{H}_q(\mathcal{VR}(\mathcal{F}_n^{[m]}; 2(n-1)))\geq \sum_{i=\ell}^m{i-2\choose \ell-2}\cdot \text{rank} (\tilde{H}_q(\mathcal{VR}(\mathcal{F}_n^{[\ell]}; 2(n-1))). $$ Since the independence complex Ind(KG$(n, k))$ and the Vietoris-Rips complex $\mathcal{VR}(\mathcal{F}^{[2n+k]}_n; 2(n-1))$ are the same, we obtain a homology propagation result in the setting of independence complexes of Kneser graphs. Connectivity of these complexes is also discussed in this paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that, under suitable hypotheses, the foundation of a generalized parallel connection of matroids is the relative tensor product of the foundations. Using this result, we show that the foundation of a 2-sum of matroids is the absolute tensor product of the foundations, and that the foundation of a matroid is invariant under segment-cosegment exchange.</description>

      <title>A note on the invertibility of oriented graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an oriented graph $D$ and a set $X\subseteq V(D)$, the inversion of $X$ in $D$ is the graph obtained from $D$ by reversing the orientation of each edge that has both endpoints in $X$. Define the inversion number of $D$, denoted $inv(D)$, to be the minimum number of inversions required to obtain an acyclic oriented graph from $D$. We show that $inv({D_1 \rightarrow D_2}) &gt; inv(D_1)$, for any oriented graphs $D_1$ and $D_2$ such that $inv(D_1) = inv(D_2) \ge 1$. This resolves a question of Aubian, Havet, H\"{o}rsch, Klingelhoefer, Nisse, Rambaud and Vermande. Our proof proceeds via a natural connection between the graph inversion number and the subgraph complementation number.</description>

      <title>Antidirected trees in dense digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that if $D$ is an $n$-vertex digraph with more than $(k-1)n$ arcs that does not contain any of three forbidden digraphs, then $D$ contains every antidirected tree on $k$ arcs. The forbidden digraphs are those orientations of $K_{2, \lceil k/12\rceil}$ where each of the vertices in the class of size two has either out-degree $0$ or in-degree $0$. This proves a conjecture of Addario-Berry et al. for a broad class of digraphs, and generalises a result for $K_{2, \lfloor k/12\rfloor}$-free graphs by Balasubramanian and Dobson.
  We also show that every digraph $D$ on $n$ vertices with more than $(k-1)n$ arcs contains every antidirected $k$-arc caterpillar, thus solving the above conjecture for caterpillars. This generalises a result of Perles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a new class of enumerative invariants called $k$-leaky double Hurwitz descendants, generalizing both descendant integrals of double ramification cycles and the $k$-leaky double Hurwitz numbers introduced in previous work of Cavalieri, Markwig and Ranganathan. These numbers are defined as intersection numbers of the logarithmic DR cycle against $\psi$-classes and logarithmic classes coming from piecewise polynomials encoding fixed branch point conditions. We give a tropical graph sum formula for these new invariants, allowing us to show their piecewise polynomiality and a wall-crossing formula in genus zero. We also prove that in genus zero the invariants are always non-negative and give a complete classification of the cases where they vanish.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider toric maximum likelihood estimation over the field of Puiseux series and study critical points of the likelihood function using tropical methods. This problem translates to finding the intersection points of a tropical affine space with a classical linear subspace. We derive new structural results on tropical affine spaces and use these to give a complete and explicit description of the tropical critical points in certain cases. In these cases, we associate tropical critical points to the simplices in a regular triangulation of the polytope giving rise to the toric model.</description>

      <title>A Fast 3-Approximation for the Capacitated Tree Cover Problem with Edge Loads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The capacitated tree cover problem with edge loads is a variant of the tree cover problem, where we are given facility opening costs, edge costs and loads, as well as vertex loads. We try to find a tree cover of minimum cost such that the total edge and vertex load of each tree does not exceed a given bound. We present an $\mathcal{O}(m\log n)$ time 3-approximation algorithm for this problem.
  This is achieved by starting with a certain LP formulation. We give a combinatorial algorithm that solves the LP optimally in time $\mathcal{O}(m\log n)$. Then, we show that a linear time rounding and splitting technique leads to an integral solution that costs at most 3 times as much as the LP solution. Finally, we prove that the integrality gap of the LP is $3$, which shows that we can not improve the rounding step in general.</description>

We derive improved upper and lower bounds based on the entropy of a distribution related to the Boltzmann distribution, which work for any coordinate-additive metric. Additionally, we derive new closed-form upper and lower bounds specifically for the sum-rank metric that outperform existing closed-form bounds.</description>

      <title>The Simultaneous Interval Number: A New Width Parameter that Measures the Similarity to Interval Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel way of generalizing the class of interval graphs, via a graph width parameter called the simultaneous interval number. This parameter is related to the simultaneous representation problem for interval graphs and defined as the smallest number $d$ of labels such that the graph admits a $d$-simultaneous interval representation, that is, an assignment of intervals and label sets to the vertices such that two vertices are adjacent if and only if the corresponding intervals, as well as their label sets, intersect. We show that this parameter is $\mathsf{NP}$-hard to compute and give several bounds for the parameter, showing in particular that it is sandwiched between pathwidth and linear mim-width. For classes of graphs with bounded parameter values, assuming that the graph is equipped with a simultaneous interval representation with a constant number of labels, we give $\mathsf{FPT}$ algorithms for the clique, independent set, and dominating set problems, and hardness results for the independent dominating set and coloring problems. The $\mathsf{FPT}$ results for independent set and dominating set are for the simultaneous interval number plus solution size. In contrast, both problems are known to be $\mathsf{W}[1]$-hard for linear mim-width plus solution size.</description>

      <title>Minimal cellular resolutions of powers of matching field ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a family of monomial ideals, called block diagonal matching field ideals, which arise as monomial Gr\"obner degenerations of determinantal ideals. Our focus is on the minimal free resolutions of these ideals and all of their powers. Initially, we establish their linear quotient property and compute their Betti numbers, illustrating that their minimal free resolution is supported on a regular CW complex. Our proof relies on the results of Herzog and Takayama, demonstrating that ideals with a linear quotient property have a minimal free resolution, and on the construction by Dochtermann and Mohammadi of cellular realizations of these resolutions. We begin by proving the linear quotient property for each power of such an ideal. Subsequently, we show that their corresponding decomposition map is regular, resulting in a minimal cellular resolution. Finally, we demonstrate that distinct decomposition maps lead to different cellular complexes with the same face numbers.</description>

      <title>A representation theorem for end spaces of infinite graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.12670v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: End-structures of infinite graphs sit at the interface between graph theory, group theory and topology. They arise as the boundary of an infinite graph in a standard sense generalising the theory of the Freudenthal boundary developed by Freudenthal and Hopf in the 1940's for infinite~groups.
  A long-standing quest in infinite graph theory with a rich body of literature seeks to represent or capture the end-structures of infinite graphs. Halin, Diestel and Carmesin raised open questions that formalise this quest from different perspectives. In this paper, we introduce a new decomposition technique which allows us to systematically solve three of their open questions in amended form, leading to a topological representation theorem showing that every end space is homeomorphic to the end space of some (uniform graph on a) special order tree.</description>

      <title>Ramsey-type problems on induced covers and induced partitions toward the Gy\'{a}rf\'{a}s-Sumner conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.14466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gy\'{a}rf\'{a}s and Sumner independently conjectured that for every tree $T$, there exists a function $f_{T}:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ such that every $T$-free graph $G$ satisfies $\chi (G)\leq f_{T}(\omega (G))$, where $\chi (G)$ and $\omega (G)$ are the {\it chromatic number} and the {\it clique number} of $G$, respectively. This conjecture gives a solution of a Ramsey-type problem on the chromatic number.
  For a graph $G$, the {\it induced SP-cover number ${\rm inspc}(G)$} (resp. the {\it induced SP-partition number ${\rm inspp}(G)$}) of $G$ is the minimum cardinality of a family $\mathcal{P}$ of induced subgraphs of $G$ such that each element of $\mathcal{P}$ is a star or a path and $\bigcup _{P\in \mathcal{P}}V(P)=V(G)$ (resp. $\dot\bigcup _{P\in \mathcal{P}}V(P)=V(G)$). Such two invariants are directly related concepts to the chromatic number. From the viewpoint of this fact, we focus on Ramsey-type problems for two invariants ${\rm inspc}$ and ${\rm inspp}$, which are analogies of the Gy\'{a}rf\'{a}s-Sumner conjecture, and settle them. As a corollary of our results, we also settle other Ramsey-type problems for widely studied invariants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.05947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the recent years, the generalization of the Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado (EKR) theorem to permutation groups has been of much interest. A transitive group is said to satisfy the EKR-module property if the characteristic vector of every maximum intersecting set is a linear combination of the characteristic vectors of cosets of stabilizers of points. This generalization of the well-know permutation group version of the Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado (EKR) theorem, was introduced by K. Meagher. In this article, we present several infinite families of permutation groups satisfying the EKR-module property, which shows that permutation groups satisfying this property are quite diverse.</description>

Abstract: Richard Arnold Epstein (1927-2016) published the first edition of "The Theory of Gambling and Statistical Logic" in 1967. He introduced some material on round-robin tournaments (complete oriented graphs) with n labeled vertices in Chapter 9; in particular, he stated, without proof, that the probability that there is a unique vertex with the maximum score tends to 1 as n tends to infinity. Our object here is to give a proof of this result along with some historical remarks and comments.</description>

      <title>Perfect matchings in random sparsifications of Dirac hypergraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.01325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For all integers $n \geq k &gt; d \geq 1$, let $m_{d}(k,n)$ be the minimum integer $D \geq 0$ such that every $k$-uniform $n$-vertex hypergraph $\mathcal H$ with minimum $d$-degree $\delta_{d}(\mathcal H)$ at least $D$ has an optimal matching. For every fixed integer $k \geq 3$, we show that for $n \in k \mathbb{N}$ and $p = \Omega(n^{-k+1} \log n)$, if $\mathcal H$ is an $n$-vertex $k$-uniform hypergraph with $\delta_{k-1}(\mathcal H) \geq m_{k-1}(k,n)$, then a.a.s.\ its $p$-random subhypergraph $\mathcal H_p$ contains a perfect matching. Moreover, for every fixed integer $d &lt; k$ and $\gamma &gt; 0$, we show that the same conclusion holds if $\mathcal H$ is an $n$-vertex $k$-uniform hypergraph with $\delta_d(\mathcal H) \geq m_{d}(k,n) + \gamma\binom{n - d}{k - d}$. Both of these results strengthen Johansson, Kahn, and Vu's seminal solution to Shamir's problem and can be viewed as ``robust'' versions of hypergraph Dirac-type results. In addition, we also show that in both cases above, $\mathcal H$ has at least $\exp((1-1/k)n \log n - \Theta (n))$ many perfect matchings, which is best possible up to an $\exp(\Theta(n))$ factor.</description>

      <title>On distinguishing digraphs by its quasisymmetric B-polynomial</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.07409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $B$-polynomial defined by J. Awan and O. Bernardi is a generalization of Tutte Polynomial to digraphs. In this paper, we solve an open question raised by J. Awan and O. Bernardi regarding the expansion of $B$-polynomial in elementary symmetric polynomials. We show that the quasisymmetric generalization of the $B$-polynomial distinguishes a class of oriented proper caterpillars and the class of oriented paths. We present a recurrence relation for the quasisymmetric $B$-polynomial involving the deletion of a source or a sink. As a consequence, we prove that a class of digraph $\mathcal{D}$ is distinguishable if and only if the class $\mathcal{D}^{\vee}$ obtained by taking directed join of $K_1$ with each digraph in $\mathcal{D}$ is distinguishable, which concludes that the digraph analogue of Stanley's Tree conjecture holds for a large class of acyclic digraphs. We further study the symmetric properties of the quasisymmetric $B$-polynomial and its relation with certain digraphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.08589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a graph $H$, we say that an edge-coloured graph $G$ is $H$-rainbow saturated if it does not contain a rainbow copy of $H$, but the addition of any non-edge in any colour creates a rainbow copy of $H$. The rainbow saturation number $\text{rsat}(n,H)$ is the minimum number of edges among all $H$-rainbow saturated edge-coloured graphs on $n$ vertices. We prove that for any non-empty graph $H$, the rainbow saturation number is linear in $n$, thus proving a conjecture of Gir\~{a}o, Lewis, and Popielarz. In addition, we also give an improved upper bound on the rainbow saturation number of the complete graph, disproving a second conjecture of Gir\~{a}o, Lewis, and Popielarz.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.07880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the twin-width of the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph $G(n,p)$. We unveil a surprising behavior of this parameter by showing the existence of a constant $p^*\approx 0.4$ such that with high probability, when $p^*\le p\le 1-p^*$, the twin-width is asymptotically $2p(1-p)n$, whereas, when $0&lt;p&lt;p^*$ or $1&gt;p&gt;1-p^*$, the twin-width is significantly higher than $2p(1-p)n$. In addition, we show that the twin-width of $G(n,1/2)$ is concentrated around $n/2 - \sqrt{3n \log n}/2$ within an interval of length $o(\sqrt{n\log n})$. For the sparse random graph, we show that with high probability, the twin-width of $G(n,p)$ is $\Theta(n\sqrt{p})$ when $(726\ln n)/n\leq p\leq1/2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09407v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $A(\ell,n,k)$ denote the number of $\ell$-tuples of commuting permutations of $n$ elements whose permutation action results in exactly $k$ orbits or connected components. We provide a new proof of an explicit formula for $A(\ell,n,k)$ which is essentially due to Bryan and Fulman, in their work on orbifold higher equivariant Euler characteristics. Our proof is self-contained, elementary, and relies on the construction of an explicit bijection, in order to perform the $\ell+1\rightarrow \ell$ reduction. We also investigate a conjecture by the first author, regarding the log-concavity of $A(\ell,n,k)$ with respect to $k$. The conjecture generalizes a previous one by Heim and Neuhauser related to the Nekrasov-Okounkov formula.</description>

      <title>Cup Stacking in Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here we introduce a new game on graphs, called cup stacking, following a line of what can be considered as $0$-, $1$-, or $2$-person games such as chip firing, percolation, graph burning, zero forcing, cops and robbers, graph pebbling, and graph pegging, among others. It can be more general, but the most basic scenario begins with a single cup on each vertex of a graph. (This simplification coincides with an earlier game devised by Gordon Hamilton.) For a vertex with $k$ cups on it we can move all its cups to a vertex at distance $k$ from it, provided the second vertex already has at least one cup on it. The object is to stack all cups onto some pre-described target vertex. We say that a graph is stackable if this can be accomplished for all possible target vertices.
  In this paper we study cup stacking on many families of graphs, developing a characterization of stackability in graphs and using it to prove the stackability of complete graphs, paths, cycles, grids, the Petersen graph, many Kneser graphs, some trees, cubes of dimension up to 20, "somewhat balanced" complete $t$-partite graphs, and Hamiltonian diameter two graphs. Additionally we use the Gallai-Edmonds Structure Theorem, the Edmonds Blossom Algorithm, and the Hungarian algorithm to devise a polynomial algorithm to decide if a diameter two graph is stackable.
  Our proof that cubes up to dimension 20 are stackable uses Kleitman's Symmetric Chain Decomposition and the new result of Merino, M\"utze, and Namrata that all generalized Johnson graphs (excluding the Petersen graph) are Hamiltonian. We conjecture that all cubes and higher-dimensional grids are stackable, and leave the reader with several open problems, questions, and generalizations.</description>

      <title>Sparse graph counting and Kelley-Meka bounds for binary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent breakthrough, Kelley and Meka (FOCS 2023) obtained a strong upper bound on the density of sets of integers without nontrivial three-term arithmetic progressions. In this work, we extend their result, establishing similar bounds for all linear patterns defined by translation-invariant binary systems of linear forms, where ``binary'' indicates that every linear form depends on exactly two variables. Prior to our work, no strong bounds were known for such systems even in the finite field model setting.
  A key ingredient in our proof is a graph counting lemma. The classical graph counting lemma, developed by Thomason (Random Graphs 1985) and Chung, Graham, and Wilson (Combinatorica 1989), is a fundamental tool in combinatorics. For a fixed graph $H$, it states that the number of copies of $H$ in a pseudorandom graph $G$ is similar to the number of copies of $H$ in a purely random graph with the same edge density as $G$. However, this lemma is only non-trivial when $G$ is a dense graph. In this work, we prove a graph counting lemma that is also effective when $G$ is sparse. Moreover, our lemma is well-suited for density increment arguments in additive number theory.
  As a sample application, we obtain a strong bound for the Tur\'an problem in Abelian Cayley graphs: we prove that an Abelian Cayley graph on $N$ vertices that does not contain any $r$-clique as a subgraph must have at most $2^{-\Omega_r(\log^{1/16}N)}\cdot N^2$ edges.
  These results hinge on the technology developed by Kelley and Meka and the follow-up work by Kelley, Lovett, and Meka (STOC 2024).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17469v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we give a combinatorial formula for a certain class of Koornwinder polynomials, also known as Macdonald polynomials of type $\tilde{C}$. In particular, we give a combinatorial formula for the Koornwinder polynomials $K_{\lambda} = K_{\lambda}(z_1,\dots,z_N; a,b,c,d; q,t)$, where $\lambda = (1,\dots,1,0,\dots,0)$. We also give combinatorial formulas for all ``open boundary ASEP polynomials'' $F_{\mu}$, where $\mu$ is a composition in $\{-1,0,1\}^N$; these polynomials are related to the nonsymmetric Koornwinder polynomials $E_{\mu}$ up to a triangular change of basis. Our formulas are in terms of rhombic staircase tableaux, certain tableaux that we introduced in previous work to give a formula for the stationary distribution of the two-species asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) on a line with open boundaries.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathcal {F}$ be a given family of graphs. A graph $G$ is $\mathcal {F}$-free if it does not contain any member of $\mathcal {F}$ as a subgraph. Let $C_{l, l}$ be a graph obtained from $2C_l$ such that the two cycles share a common vertex, where $l\geqslant3 $. A $\mathrm{Theta}$ graph is obtained from a cycle $C_k$ by adding an additional edge between two non-consecutive vertices on $C_k$, where $k\geqslant 4$. Let $\Theta_k$ be the set of $\mathrm{Theta}$ graphs on $k$ vertices, where $k \geqslant 4$. For sufficiently large $n $, the unique extremal planar graph with the maximum spectral radius among $C_{l, l}$-free planar graphs on $n$ vertices and among $\Theta_k$-free planar graphs on $n$ vertices are characterized respectively, where $l \geqslant 3$ and $k \geqslant 4$.</description>

Abstract: A subset $S$ of the Boolean hypercube $\mathbb{F}_2^n$ is a sumset if $S = A+A = \{a + b \ | \ a, b\in A\}$ for some $A \subseteq \mathbb{F}_2^n$. We prove that the number of sumsets in $\mathbb{F}_2^n$ is asymptotically $(2^n-1)2^{2^{n-1}}$. Furthermore, we show that the family of sumsets in $\mathbb{F}_2^n$ is almost identical to the family of all subsets of $\mathbb{F}_2^n$ that contain a complete linear subspace of co-dimension $1$.</description>

      <title>Intersection patterns in spaces with a forbidden homological minor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2103.09286v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study generalizations of classical results on intersection patterns of set systems in $\mathbb{R}^d$, such as the fractional Helly theorem or the $(p,q)$-theorem, in the setting of arbitrary triangulable spaces with a forbidden homological minor.
  Given a simplicial complex $K$ and an integer $b$, we say that a family $\mathcal{F}$ of subcomplexes of some simplicial complex $\mathcal{U}$ is a \emph{$(K,b)$-free cover} if (i) $K$ is a forbidden homological minor of $\mathcal{U}$, and (ii) the $j$th reduced Betti number $\tilde{\beta}_j(\bigcap_{S\in {\mathcal{G}}}S,\mathbb{Z}_2)$ is strictly less than $b$ for all $0\leq j &lt; \dim K$ and all nonempty subfamilies $\mathcal{G}\subseteq \mathcal{F}$.
  We show that for every $K$ and $b$, the fractional Helly number of a $(K,b)$-free cover is at most $\mu(K)+1$, where $\mu(K)$ is the maximum sum of the dimensions of two disjoint faces in~$K$. This implies that the assertion of the $(p,q)$-theorem holds for every $p \ge q &gt; \mu(K)$ and every $(K,b)$-free cover $\mathcal{F}$. For $b=1$ and a suitable $K$ this recovers the original $(p,q)$-theorem and its generalization to good covers. Interestingly, our results show that that the range of parameters $(p,q)$ for which the $(p,q)$-theorem holds is independent of $b$.
  Our proofs use Ramsey-type arguments combined with the notion of stair convexity of Bukh et al. to construct (forbidden) homological minors in cubical complexes.</description>

      <title>Robustness of Excitations in the Random Dimer Model</title>

Abstract: The ground state solution of the random dimer model is at a critical point after, which has been shown with random link excitations. In this paper we test the robustness of the random dimer model to the random link excitation by imposing the maximum weight excitation. We numerically compute the scaling exponents of the curves arising in the model as well as the fractal dimension. Although strong finite size corrections are present, the results are compatible with that of the random link excitation. Furthermore, another form of excitation, the {\epsilon} - coupling excitation is studied. We find that near-optimal configurations belong to the same universality class as the travelling salesman problem. Thus, we confirm a conjecture on the scaling properties of combinatorial optimisation problems, for the specific case of minimum weight perfect matchings on 2-dimensional lattices. This document was submitted as my thesis project for the MSc Complex Systems Modelling course at King's College London in 2021. In particular, I would like to thank my supervisor, Dr Gabriele Sicuro for his insights and guidance.</description>

      <title>A geometric approach to conjugation-invariant random permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10116v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new approach to conjugation-invariant random permutations. Namely, we explain how to construct uniform permutations in given conjugacy classes from certain point processes in the plane. This enables the use of geometric tools to study various statistics of such permutations. For their longest decreasing subsequences, we prove universality of the $2\sqrt n$ asymptotic. For Robinson--Schensted shapes, we prove universality of the Vershik--Kerov--Logan--Shepp limit curve, thus solving a conjecture of Kammoun. For the number of records, we establish a phase transition phenomenon as the number of fixed points grows. For pattern counts, we obtain an asymptotic normality result, partially answering a conjecture of Hamaker and Rhoades.</description>

      <title>Digraphs, pro-$p$ groups and Massey products in Galois cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime. We characterize the oriented right-angled Artin pro-$p$ groups whose $\mathbb{F}_p$-cohomology algebra yields no essential $n$-fold Massey products for every $n&gt;2$, in terms of the associated digraph. Moreover, we show that the $\mathbb{F}_p$-cohomology algebra of such oriented right-angled Artin pro-$p$ groups is isomorphic to the exterior Stanley-Reisner $\mathbb{F}_p$-algebra associated to the same digraph. This work also aims at providing a concrete and group-theoretic introduction to the study of Massey products in Galois cohomology for non-specialists, especially graduate students working in profinite group theory.</description>

      <title>What is the Modular Fourier Transform?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discrete Fourier transform can be viewed as an isomorphism of the group algebra of a cyclic group to its decomposition in terms of irreducible representations when the characteristic of the field does not divide the order of the group. We describe the DFT when $p|n$ by factoring $x^N - 1$ over finite fields. For the symmetric group, the Fourier transform is implemented using representations, Specht modules $S^\lambda$ for partitions $\lambda$, and Maschke's theorem. In the modular case, we construct the Pierce decomposition using central primitive orthogonal idempotents $e_i$ in SageMath, yielding a change-of-basis matrix which generalizes the DFT.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic estimates of the diameters of the Rubik's Cube groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The diameter of the Cayley graph of the Rubik's Cube group is the fewest number of turns needed to solve the Cube from any initial configurations. For the 2$\times$2$\times$2 Cube, the diameter is 11 in the half-turn metric, 14 in the quarter-turn metric, 19 in the semi-quarter-turn metric, and 10 in the bi-quarter-turn metric. For the 3$\times$3$\times$3 Cube, the diameter was determined by Rikicki et al. to be 20 in the half-turn metric and 26 in the quarter-turn metric. This study shows that a modified version of the coupon collector's problem in probabilistic theory can predict the diameters correctly for both 2$\times$2$\times$2 and 3$\times$3$\times$3 Cubes insofar as the quarter-turn metric is adopted. In the half-turn metric, the diameters are overestimated by one and two, respectively, for the 2$\times$2$\times$2 and 3$\times$3$\times$3 Cubes, whereas for the 2$\times$2$\times$2 Cube in the semi-quarter-turn and bi-quarter-turn metrics, they are overestimated by two and underestimated by one, respectively. Invoking the same probabilistic logic, the diameters of the 4$\times$4$\times$4 and 5$\times$5$\times$5 Cubes are predicted to be 48 (41) and 68 (58) in the quarter-turn (half-turn) metric, whose precise determinations are far beyond reach of classical supercomputing. It is shown that the probabilistically estimated diameter is approximated by $\ln N / \ln r + \ln N / r$, where $N$ is the number of configurations and $r$ is the branching ratio.</description>
