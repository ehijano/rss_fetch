      <title>SACodec: Asymmetric Quantization with Semantic Anchoring for Low-Bitrate High-Fidelity Neural Speech Codecs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural Speech Codecs face a fundamental trade-off at low bitrates: preserving acoustic fidelity often compromises semantic richness. To address this, we introduce SACodec, a novel codec built upon an asymmetric dual-quantizer that employs our proposed Semantic Anchoring mechanism. This design strategically decouples the quantization of Semantic and Acoustic details. The semantic anchoring is achieved via a lightweight projector that aligns acoustic features with a frozen, large-scale mHuBERT codebook, injecting linguistic priors while guaranteeing full codebook utilization. Sequentially, for acoustic details, a residual activation module with SimVQ enables a single-layer quantizer (acoustic path) to faithfully recover fine-grained information. At just 1.5 kbps, SACodec establishes a new state of the art by excelling in both fidelity and semantics: subjective listening tests confirm that its reconstruction quality is perceptually highly comparable to ground-truth audio, while its tokens demonstrate substantially improved semantic richness in downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Towards Practical Automatic Piano Reduction using BERT with Semi-supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we present a novel automatic piano reduction method with semi-supervised machine learning. Piano reduction is an important music transformation process, which helps musicians and composers as a musical sketch for performances and analysis. The automation of such is a highly challenging research problem but could bring huge conveniences as manually doing a piano reduction takes a lot of time and effort. While supervised machine learning is often a useful tool for learning input-output mappings, it is difficult to obtain a large quantity of labelled data. We aim to solve this problem by utilizing semi-supervised learning, so that the abundant available data in classical music can be leveraged to perform the task with little or no labelling effort. In this regard, we formulate a two-step approach of music simplification followed by harmonization. We further propose and implement two possible solutions making use of an existing machine learning framework -- MidiBERT. We show that our solutions can output practical and realistic samples with an accurate reduction that needs only small adjustments in post-processing. Our study forms the groundwork for the use of semi-supervised learning in automatic piano reduction, where future researchers can take reference to produce more state-of-the-art results.</description>

      <title>Foundation Model-based Evaluation of Neuropsychiatric Disorders: A Lifespan-Inclusive, Multi-Modal, and Multi-Lingual Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neuropsychiatric disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), depression, and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), are characterized by linguistic and acoustic abnormalities, offering potential biomarkers for early detection. Despite the promise of multi-modal approaches, challenges like multi-lingual generalization and the absence of a unified evaluation framework persist. To address these gaps, we propose FEND (Foundation model-based Evaluation of Neuropsychiatric Disorders), a comprehensive multi-modal framework integrating speech and text modalities for detecting AD, depression, and ASD across the lifespan. Leveraging 13 multi-lingual datasets spanning English, Chinese, Greek, French, and Dutch, we systematically evaluate multi-modal fusion performance. Our results show that multi-modal fusion excels in AD and depression detection but underperforms in ASD due to dataset heterogeneity. We also identify modality imbalance as a prevalent issue, where multi-modal fusion fails to surpass the best mono-modal models. Cross-corpus experiments reveal robust performance in task- and language-consistent scenarios but noticeable degradation in multi-lingual and task-heterogeneous settings. By providing extensive benchmarks and a detailed analysis of performance-influencing factors, FEND advances the field of automated, lifespan-inclusive, and multi-lingual neuropsychiatric disorder assessment. We encourage researchers to adopt the FEND framework for fair comparisons and reproducible research.</description>

      <title>ESDD 2026: Environmental Sound Deepfake Detection Challenge Evaluation Plan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in audio generation systems have enabled the creation of highly realistic and immersive soundscapes, which are increasingly used in film and virtual reality. However, these audio generators also raise concerns about potential misuse, such as generating deceptive audio content for fake videos and spreading misleading information. Existing datasets for environmental sound deepfake detection (ESDD) are limited in scale and audio types. To address this gap, we have proposed EnvSDD, the first large-scale curated dataset designed for ESDD, consisting of 45.25 hours of real and 316.7 hours of fake sound. Based on EnvSDD, we are launching the Environmental Sound Deepfake Detection Challenge. Specifically, we present two different tracks: ESDD in Unseen Generators and Black-Box Low-Resource ESDD, covering various challenges encountered in real-life scenarios. The challenge will be held in conjunction with the 2026 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2026).</description>

      <title>DiTSinger: Scaling Singing Voice Synthesis with Diffusion Transformer and Implicit Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent progress in diffusion-based Singing Voice Synthesis (SVS) demonstrates strong expressiveness but remains limited by data scarcity and model scalability. We introduce a two-stage pipeline: a compact seed set of human-sung recordings is constructed by pairing fixed melodies with diverse LLM-generated lyrics, and melody-specific models are trained to synthesize over 500 hours of high-quality Chinese singing data. Building on this corpus, we propose DiTSinger, a Diffusion Transformer with RoPE and qk-norm, systematically scaled in depth, width, and resolution for enhanced fidelity. Furthermore, we design an implicit alignment mechanism that obviates phoneme-level duration labels by constraining phoneme-to-acoustic attention within character-level spans, thereby improving robustness under noisy or uncertain alignments. Extensive experiments validate that our approach enables scalable, alignment-free, and high-fidelity SVS.</description>

      <title>VCB Bench: An Evaluation Benchmark for Audio-Grounded Large Language Model Conversational Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in large audio language models (LALMs) have greatly enhanced multimodal conversational systems. However, existing benchmarks remain limited -- they are mainly English-centric, rely on synthetic speech, and lack comprehensive, discriminative evaluation across multiple dimensions. To address these gaps, we present Voice Chat Bot Bench (VCB Bench) -- a high-quality Chinese benchmark built entirely on real human speech. VCB Bench evaluates LALMs from three complementary perspectives: instruction following (including speech-level control beyond text commands), knowledge understanding (general knowledge, reasoning, and daily dialogue), and robustness (stability under perturbations in content, environment, and speaker traits). Experiments on representative LALMs reveal notable performance gaps and highlight future directions for improvement. VCB Bench provides a reproducible and fine-grained evaluation framework, offering standardized methodology and practical insights for advancing Chinese voice conversational models.</description>

      <title>SingingSDS: A Singing-Capable Spoken Dialogue System for Conversational Roleplay Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With recent advances in automatic speech recognition (ASR), large language models (LLMs), and text-to-speech (TTS) technologies, spoken dialogue systems (SDS) have become widely accessible. However, most existing SDS are limited to conventional spoken responses. We present SingingSDS, a cascaded SDS that responds through singing rather than speaking, fostering more affective, memorable, and pleasurable interactions in character-based roleplay and interactive entertainment scenarios. SingingSDS employs a modular ASR-LLM-SVS pipeline and supports a wide range of configurations across character personas, ASR and LLM backends, SVS models, melody sources, and voice profiles, tailored to different needs in terms of latency, quality, and musical style. SingingSDS is available as a plug-and-play web demo, featuring modular, open-source code that supports customization and extension. Demo: https://huggingface.co/spaces/espnet/SingingSDS. Code: https://github.com/SingingSDS/SingingSDS.</description>

      <title>A Data-Centric Approach to Generalizable Speech Deepfake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving robust generalization in speech deepfake detection (SDD) remains a primary challenge, as models often fail to detect unseen forgery methods. While research has focused on model-centric and algorithm-centric solutions, the impact of data composition is often underexplored. This paper proposes a data-centric approach, analyzing the SDD data landscape from two practical perspectives: constructing a single dataset and aggregating multiple datasets. To address the first perspective, we conduct a large-scale empirical study to characterize the data scaling laws for SDD, quantifying the impact of source and generator diversity. To address the second, we propose the Diversity-Optimized Sampling Strategy (DOSS), a principled framework for mixing heterogeneous data with two implementations: DOSS-Select (pruning) and DOSS-Weight (re-weighting). Our experiments show that DOSS-Select outperforms the naive aggregation baseline while using only 3% of the total available data. Furthermore, our final model, trained on a 12k-hour curated data pool using the optimal DOSS-Weight strategy, achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming large-scale baselines with greater data and model efficiency on both public benchmarks and a new challenge set of various commercial APIs.</description>

      <title>Speaker Recognition -- Wavelet Packet Based Multiresolution Feature Extraction Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel Wavelet Packet based feature extraction approach for the task of text independent speaker recognition. The features are extracted by using the combination of Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) and Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT).Hybrid Features technique uses the advantage of human ear simulation offered by MFCC combining it with multi-resolution property and noise robustness of WPT. To check the validity of the proposed approach for the text independent speaker identification and verification we have used the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and Hidden Markov Model (HMM) respectively as the classifiers. The proposed paradigm is tested on voxforge speech corpus and CSTR US KED Timit database. The paradigm is also evaluated after adding standard noise signal at different level of SNRs for evaluating the noise robustness. Experimental results show that better results are achieved for the tasks of both speaker identification as well as speaker verification.</description>

      <title>Hearing to Translate: The Effectiveness of Speech Modality Integration into LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) expand beyond text, integrating speech as a native modality has given rise to SpeechLLMs, which aim to translate spoken language directly, thereby bypassing traditional transcription-based pipelines. Whether this integration improves speech-to-text translation quality over established cascaded architectures, however, remains an open question. We present Hearing to Translate, the first comprehensive test suite rigorously benchmarking 5 state-of-the-art SpeechLLMs against 16 strong direct and cascade systems that couple leading speech foundation models (SFM), with multilingual LLMs. Our analysis spans 16 benchmarks, 13 language pairs, and 9 challenging conditions, including disfluent, noisy, and long-form speech. Across this extensive evaluation, we find that cascaded systems remain the most reliable overall, while current SpeechLLMs only match cascades in selected settings and SFMs lag behind both, highlighting that integrating an LLM, either within the model or in a pipeline, is essential for high-quality speech translation.</description>
