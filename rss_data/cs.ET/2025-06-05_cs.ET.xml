      <title>Distributionally Robust Wireless Semantic Communication with Large AI Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 6G wireless systems are expected to support massive volumes of data with ultra-low latency. However, conventional bit-level transmission strategies cannot support the efficiency and adaptability required by modern, data-intensive applications. The concept of semantic communication (SemCom) addresses this limitation by focusing on transmitting task-relevant semantic information instead of raw data. While recent efforts incorporating deep learning and large-scale AI models have improved SemCom's performance, existing systems remain vulnerable to both semantic-level and transmission-level noise because they often rely on domain-specific architectures that hinder generalizability. In this paper, a novel and generalized semantic communication framework called WaSeCom is proposed to systematically address uncertainty and enhance robustness. In particular, Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization is employed to provide resilience against semantic misinterpretation and channel perturbations. A rigorous theoretical analysis is performed to establish the robust generalization guarantees of the proposed framework. Experimental results on image and text transmission demonstrate that WaSeCom achieves improved robustness under noise and adversarial perturbations. These results highlight its effectiveness in preserving semantic fidelity across varying wireless conditions.</description>

      <title>The Cloud Next Door: Investigating the Environmental and Socioeconomic Strain of Datacenters on Local Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Datacenters have become the backbone of modern digital infrastructure, powering the rapid rise of artificial intelligence and promising economic growth and technological progress. However, this expansion has brought growing tensions in the local communities where datacenters are already situated or being proposed. While the mainstream discourse often focuses on energy usage and carbon footprint of the computing sector at a global scale, the local socio-environmental consequences -- such as health impacts, water usage, noise pollution, infrastructural strain, and economic burden -- remain largely underexplored and poorly addressed. In this work, we surface these community-level consequences through a mixed-methods study that combines quantitative data with qualitative insights. Focusing on Northern Virginia's ``Data Center Valley,'' we highlight how datacenter growth reshapes local environments and everyday life, and examine the power dynamics that determine who benefits and who bears the costs. Our goal is to bring visibility to these impacts and prompt more equitable and informed decisions about the future of digital infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Does Prompt Design Impact Quality of Data Imputation by LLMs?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating realistic synthetic tabular data presents a critical challenge in machine learning. It adds another layer of complexity when this data contain class imbalance problems. This paper presents a novel token-aware data imputation method that leverages the in-context learning capabilities of large language models. This is achieved through the combination of a structured group-wise CSV-style prompting technique and the elimination of irrelevant contextual information in the input prompt. We test this approach with two class-imbalanced binary classification datasets and evaluate the effectiveness of imputation using classification-based evaluation metrics. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the input prompt size while maintaining or improving imputation quality compared to our baseline prompt, especially for datasets that are of relatively smaller in size. The contributions of this presented work is two-fold -- 1) it sheds light on the importance of prompt design when leveraging LLMs for synthetic data generation and 2) it addresses a critical gap in LLM-based data imputation for class-imbalanced datasets with missing data by providing a practical solution within computational constraints. We hope that our work will foster further research and discussions about leveraging the incredible potential of LLMs and prompt engineering techniques for synthetic data generation.</description>

      <title>MenTeR: A fully-automated Multi-agenT workflow for end-to-end RF/Analog Circuits Netlist Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: RF/Analog design is essential for bridging digital technologies with real-world signals, ensuring the functionality and reliability of a wide range of electronic systems. However, analog design procedures are often intricate, time-consuming and reliant on expert intuition, and hinder the time and cost efficiency of circuit development. To overcome the limitations of the manual circuit design, we introduce MenTeR - a multiagent workflow integrated into an end-to-end analog design framework. By employing multiple specialized AI agents that collaboratively address different aspects of the design process, such as specification understanding, circuit optimization, and test bench validation, MenTeR reduces the dependency on frequent trial-and-error-style intervention. MenTeR not only accelerates the design cycle time but also facilitates a broader exploration of the design space, demonstrating robust capabilities in handling real-world analog systems. We believe that MenTeR lays the groundwork for future "RF/Analog Copilots" that can collaborate seamlessly with human designers.</description>
