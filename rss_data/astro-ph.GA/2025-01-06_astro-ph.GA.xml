      <title>A 22-Billion Solar Mass Black Hole in Holmberg 15A with Keck KCWI Spectroscopy and Triaxial Orbit Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Holmberg 15A (H15A), the brightest cluster galaxy of Abell 85, has an exceptionally low central surface brightness even among local massive elliptical galaxies with distinct stellar cores, making it exceedingly challenging to obtain high-quality spectroscopy to detect a supermassive black hole (SMBH) at its center. Aided by the superb sensitivity and efficiency of KCWI at the Keck II Telescope, we have obtained spatially resolved stellar kinematics over a ${\sim}100''\times 100''$ contiguous field of H15A for this purpose. The velocity field exhibits a low amplitude (${\sim}20\mathrm{~km~s}^{-1}$) rotation along a kinematic axis that is prominently misaligned from the photometric major axis, a strong indicator that H15A is triaxially shaped with unequal lengths for the three principal axes. Using 2500 observed kinematic constraints, we perform extensive calculations of stellar orbits with the triaxial Schwarzschild code, TriOS, and search over ${\sim}$40,000 galaxy models to simultaneously determine the mass and intrinsic 3D shape parameters of H15A. We determine a ratio of $p=0.89$ for the middle-to-long principal axes and $q=0.65$ for the short-to-long principal axes. Our best estimate of the SMBH mass, $M_\mathrm{BH}=(2.16^{+0.23}_{-0.18})\times 10^{10}M_{\odot}$, makes H15A -- along with NGC 4889 -- the galaxies hosting the most massive SMBHs known in the local universe. Both SMBHs lie significantly above the mean $M_\mathrm{BH}-\sigma$ scaling relation. Repeating the orbit modeling with the axisymmetrized version of TriOS produces worse fits to the KCWI kinematics and increases $M_\mathrm{BH}$ to $(2.55\pm 0.20) \times 10^{10}M_{\odot}$, which is still significantly below $M_\mathrm{BH}=(4.0\pm 0.8) \times 10^{10}M_{\odot}$ reported in a prior axisymmetric study of H15A.</description>

      <title>Microlensing of lensed supernovae Zwicky &amp; iPTF16geu: constraints on the lens galaxy mass slope and dark compact object fraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To date, only two strongly lensed type Ia supernovae (SNIa) have been discovered with an isolated galaxy acting as the lens: iPTF16geu and SN Zwicky. The observed image fluxes for both lens systems were inconsistent with predictions from a smooth macro lens model. A potential explanation for the anomalous flux ratios is microlensing: additional (de)magnification caused by stars and other compact objects in the lens galaxy. In this work, we combine observations of iPTF16geu and SN Zwicky with simulated microlensing magnification maps, leveraging their standardizable candle properties to constrain the lens galaxy mass slope, $\eta$, and the fraction of dark compact objects, $f_{\rm dc}$. The resulting mass slopes are $\eta = 1.70 \pm 0.07$ for iPTF16geu and $\eta = 1.81 \pm 0.10$ for SN Zwicky. Our results indicate no evidence for a population of dark compact objects, placing upper limits at the $95\%$ confidence level of $f_{\rm dc} &lt; 0.25$ for iPTF16geu and $f_{\rm dc} &lt; 0.47$ for SN Zwicky. Assuming a constant fraction of dark compact objects for both lensed SNe, we obtain $f_{\rm dc} &lt; 0.19$. These results highlight the potential of strongly lensed SNIa to probe the innermost parts of lens galaxies and learn about compact matter.</description>

      <title>Fire and Ice in the Whirlpool: Spatially Resolved Scaling Relations between X-ray Emitting Hot Gas and Cold Molecular Gas in M51</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cold and hot interstellar medium (ISM) in star forming galaxies resembles the reservoir for star formation and associated heating by stellar winds and explosions during stellar evolution, respectively. We utilize data from deep $Chandra$ observations and archival millimeter surveys to study the interconnection between these two phases and the relation to star formation activities in M51 on kiloparsec scales. A sharp radial decrease is present in the hot gas surface brightness profile within the inner 2 kpc of M51. The ratio between the total infrared luminosity ($L_{\rm IR}$) and the hot gas luminosity ($L_{\rm 0.5 - 2\,keV}^{\rm gas}$) shows a positive correlation with the galactic radius in the central region. For the entire galaxy, a twofold correlation is revealed in the $L_{\rm 0.5 - 2\,keV}^{\rm gas}$${-}$$L_{\rm IR}$ diagram, where $L_{\rm 0.5 - 2\,keV}^{\rm gas}$ sharply increases with $L_{\rm IR}$ in the center but varies more slowly in the disk. The best fit gives a steep relation of ${\rm log}(L_{\rm 0.5-2\,keV}^{\rm gas} /{\rm erg\,s^{-1}})=1.82\,{\rm log}(L_{\rm IR} /{L_{\rm \odot}})+22.26$ for the center of M51. The similar twofold correlations are also found in the $L_{\rm 0.5 - 2\,keV}^{\rm gas}$${-}$molecular line luminosity ($L^\prime_{\rm gas}$) relations for the four molecular emission lines CO(1-0), CO(2-1), HCN(1-0), and HCO$^+$(1-0). We demonstrate that the core-collapse supernovae (SNe) are the primary source of energy for heating gas in the galactic center of M51, leading to the observed steep $L_{\rm 0.5 - 2\,keV}^{\rm gas}$${-}$$L_{\rm IR}$ and $L_{\rm 0.5 - 2\,keV}^{\rm gas}$${-}$$L^\prime_{\rm gas}$ relations, as their X-ray radiation efficiencies ($\eta$ $\equiv$ $L_{\rm 0.5 - 2\,keV}^{\rm gas}$/$\dot{E}_\mathrm{SN}$) increase with the star formation rate surface densities, where $\dot{E}_\mathrm{SN}$ is the SN mechanical energy input rate.</description>

      <title>Chemistry in the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gas and dust in the Galactic Center are subjected to energetic processing by intense UV radiation fields, widespread shocks, enhanced rates of cosmic-rays and X-rays, and strong magnetic fields. The Giant Molecular Clouds in the Galactic Center present a rich chemistry in a wide variety of chemical compounds, some of which are prebiotic. We have conducted unbiased, ultrasensitive and broadband spectral surveys toward the G+0.693-0.027 molecular cloud located in the Galactic Center, which have yielded the discovery of new complex organic molecules proposed as precursors of the "building blocks" of life. I will review our current understanding of the chemistry in Galactic Center molecular clouds, and summarize the recent detections toward G+0.693-0.027 of key precursors of prebiotic chemistry. All this suggests that the ISM is an important source of prebiotic material that could have contributed to the process of the origin of life on Earth and elsewhere in the Universe.</description>

      <title>H$\alpha$-X-ray Surface Brightness Correlation for Filaments in Cooling Flow Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive galaxies in cooling flow clusters display clear evidence of feedback from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Joint X-ray and radio observations have shown that AGN radio jets push aside the surrounding hot gas and form cavities in the hot intracluster medium (ICM). These systems host complex, kiloparsec-scale, multiphase filamentary structures, from warm ionized (10,000 K) to cold molecular ($&lt;$100 K). These striking clumpy filaments are believed to be a natural outcome of thermally unstable cooling from the hot ICM, likely triggered by feedback processes while contributing to feeding the AGN via Chaotic Cold Accretion (CCA). However, the detailed constraints on the formation mechanism of the filaments are still uncertain, and the connection between the different gas phases has to be fully unveiled. By leveraging a sample of seven X-ray bright cooling-flow clusters, we have discovered a tight positive correlation between the X-ray surface brightness and the H$\alpha$ surface brightness of the filaments over two orders of magnitude, as also found in stripped tails.</description>

      <title>Lyman-alpha resonant-line radiative transfer in expanding media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lyman-alpha (LyA) line of atomic hydrogen encodes crucial information about both the intrinsic sources and surrounding environments of star-forming regions throughout the Universe. Due to the complexity of resonant scattering, analytic solutions remain scarce, with most studies focusing on idealized, static configurations. However, observations of LyA emitting galaxies consistently reveal signatures of outflows, imprinted through red-peak dominance in spectral line profiles. In this paper, we derive novel analytic solutions for resonant-line radiative transfer in moving media, specifically homologous-like cloud expansion and unbounded cosmological flows, which capture the main physics of velocity gradients. To validate these analytic solutions and identify regimes where diffusion-based assumptions hold, we introduce a robust Gridless Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer (GMCRT) method. By integrating optical depths exactly in the comoving frame, GMCRT updates photon frequencies continuously to account for Doppler shifts induced by velocity gradients. We demonstrate excellent consistency between GMCRT and our analytic solutions in regimes where diffusion approximations apply. At higher velocities or lower optical depths, discrepancies highlight the limitations of simplified formalisms. We also provide scaling relations for a point source in a cloud with a maximum-to-thermal velocity ratio beta = V_max / v_th, as modifying the standard dependence on line centre optical depth of (atau_0)^1/3 by additional factors, e.g. characteristic escape frequency scale as x_esc ~ beta^1/3, force multipliers as M_F ~ beta^-1/3, and trapping time as t_trap ~ beta^-2/3. Our work complements numerical simulations by improving physical intuition about nonstatic environments when interpreting LyA observations and guiding future subgrid prescriptions in galaxy formation models.</description>

      <title>Identification of the interstellar 1-cyano propargyl radical (HCCCHCN) in TMC-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first detection in interstellar medium of the 1-cyano propargyl radical, HC$_3$HCN. This species is an isomer of the 3-cyano propargyl radical (CH$_2$C$_3$N), which was recently discovered in TMC-1. The 1-cyano propargyl radical was observed in the cold dark cloud TMC-1 using data from the ongoing QUIJOTE line survey, which is being carried out with the Yebes 40m telescope. A total of seven rotational transitions with multiple hyperfine components were detected in the 31.0-50.4 GHz range. We derived a column density of (2.2$\pm$0.2)$\times$10$^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$ and a rotational temperature of 7$\pm$1\,K. The abundance ratio between HC$_3$HCN and CH$_2$C$_3$N is 1.4. The almost equal abundance of these isomers indicates that the two species may be produced in the same reaction with a similar efficiency, probably in the reaction C + CH$_2$CHCN and perhaps also in the reaction C$_2$ + CH$_3$CN and the dissociative recombination with electrons of CH$_2$C$_3$NH$^+$</description>

      <title>Dwarf Galaxies in the TNG50 Field: connecting their Star-formation Rates with their Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dwarf galaxies comparable to the LMC and SMC, with stellar masses $7.5 &lt;{\rm log}(M_{\ast}/M_{\odot})&lt;9.5$, are found in a diversity of environments and have long quenching timescales. The way this phenomenon results from the dwarfs' halo properties or their locations in the large-scale structure is not well understood. We study the star-formation rates of dwarfs in the Illustris TNG50 simulation across different environments, focusing on the dwarfs having host halos with virial masses $9 &lt; {\rm log}(M_{200}/M_{\odot}) &lt; 11.5$, which we demonstrate are in the field as opposed to dwarf satellites in hosts with ${\rm log}(M_{200}/M_{\odot}) \geq 11.5$. Our field dwarf sample is heterogeneous, consisting of primary (central) galaxies, with smaller numbers of secondaries and dwarf galaxies that are on backsplash orbits around massive galaxies. We quantify the field dwarfs' large-scale environmental using the tidal index $\Theta_1$ and the distance to the nearest massive galaxy ${\rm d_{massive}}$, and we study how the quenched fraction and star-formation histories are correlated with these metrics. Those with ${\rm d_{massive}}&gt;1.5$ Mpc and $\Theta_1&lt;0$ are well isolated, with only $\sim 1\%$ being quenched. The quenched field dwarfs are in majority the backsplash dwarfs located in the neighborhood of cluster-scale halos. We discover a two-halo galactic conformity signal that arises from the tendency of the quenched dwarfs, particularly the backsplash sample, to have a quenched massive galaxy as a neighbor. We attribute the low quenched fractions of the simulated LMC/SMC analogs in the field to the locations of their low-mass hosts in the sparse large-scale environment, which predominate over the relatively small number of backsplash and pre-processed dwarfs in denser environments.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical Black holes: An Explanation for the Galaxy Quenching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose models of Astrophysical Black holes (ABHs) without event horizons (EHs), as a more viable explanation for the long-term quenching phenomenon in galaxies. At the same time, the short-term quenching is explained here in terms of an efficient feedback expected in the models of stellar-mass astrophysical black holes (StMABHs). We have calculated the radiative flux from the disk in a general spherically symmetric metric background and used it to contrast the distinctive features of the BHs and ABHs scenarios. The nature of the feedbacks arising from accretion onto a BH and an ABH in the `quasar' and `radio' modes are compared and some possible observational signatures of the StMABHs are pointed out.</description>

      <title>A Near-IR Search for Helium in the Superluminous Supernova SN 2024ahr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of SN 2024ahr, a hydrogen-poor superluminous supernova (SLSN-I), for which we determine a redshift of $z=0.0861$. SN 2024ahr has a peak absolute magnitude of $M_g\approx M_r\approx -21$ mag, rest-frame rise and decline times (50$\%$ of peak) of about 40 and 80 days, respectively, and typical spectroscopic evolution in the optical band. Similarly, modeling of the UV/optical light curves with a magnetar spin-down engine leads to typical parameters: an initial spin period of $\approx 3.3$ ms, a magnetic field strength of $\approx 6\times 10^{13}$ G, and an ejecta mass of $\approx 9.5$ M$_\odot$. Due to its relatively low redshift we obtained a high signal-to-noise ratio near-IR spectrum about 43 rest-frame days post-peak to search for the presence of helium. We do not detect any significant feature at the location of the He I $\,\lambda 2.058$ $\mu$m feature, and place a conservative upper limit of $\sim 0.05$ M$_\odot$ on the mass of helium in the outer ejecta. We detect broad features of Mg I $\,\lambda 1.575$ $\mu$m and a blend of Co II $\,\lambda 2.126$ $\mu$m and Mg II, $\lambda 2.136$ $\mu$m, which are typical of Type Ic SNe, but with higher velocities. Examining the sample of SLSNe-I with NIR spectroscopy, we find that, unlike SN 2024ahr, these events are generally peculiar. This highlights the need for a large sample of prototypical SLSNe-I with NIR spectroscopy to constrain the fraction of progenitors with helium (Ib-like) and without helium (Ic-like) at the time of the explosion, and hence the evolutionary path(s) leading to the rare outcome of SLSNe-I.</description>

      <title>Sub-MHz Radio Background from Ultralight Dark Photon Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark photons are a well-motivated candidate for dark matter, but their detection becomes challenging for ultralight masses with both experimental and astrophysical probes. In this work, we propose a new approach to explore this regime through the dark inverse Compton scattering of ultralight dark photons with cosmic ray electrons and positrons. We show this process generates a potentially observable background radiation that is most prominent at frequencies below MHz. We compute this effect using the latest cosmic ray models and radio absorption maps. Comparing it to observations of the Milky Way's radio spectrum from Explorer 43, Radio Astronomy Explorer 2, and the Parker Solar Probe, we place leading constraints on the kinetic mixing of dark photon dark matter for masses $\lesssim 2 \times 10^{-17} \ \rm eV$.</description>

      <title>Multi-Tracer Correlated Stacking: A Novel Way to Discover Anisotropy in nano-Hz Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The isotropic stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) generated by a population of supermassive black hole binaries (BHBs) provides a unique window into their cosmic evolution. In addition to the isotropic power spectrum, the anisotropic component of the signal carries additional information about the supermassive black holes (BHs) and host galaxy connection. The measurement of this signal is usually carried out by angular power spectra, which is only a sufficient measure for a Gaussian and statistically isotropic distribution. In contrast, the contribution from supermassive BHBs in nano-hertz SGWB will be hosted by fewer massive galaxies, making the nano-hertz background anisotropic and non-Gaussian. As a result, the performance of angular power spectra in extracting the underlying physics is limited. In this work, we propose a novel technique called the Multi-Tracer Correlated Stacking, which enables the detection of anisotropies in the SGWB by stacking the signal from regions of the sky with tracers of BHs such as active galactic nucleus (AGNs), quasars, bright galaxies, etc., that can be mapped up to high redshift. We demonstrate this technique on a simulated supermassive BHBs distribution using an AGN catalog, which maps the underlying matter distribution approximately up to redshift $z=5$. This stacking technique uniquely distinguishes between isotropic and anisotropic distributions of SGWB source, surpassing the capabilities of angular power spectrum-based methods in detecting anisotropic signals. This highlights the effectiveness of this technique in detecting anisotropic SGWB signals and in the future, this technique can play a crucial role in its discovery.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Turbulence: the Small-Scale Limit of the Cold-Dark-Matter Power Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The matter power spectrum, $P(k)$, is one of the fundamental quantities in the study of large-scale structure in cosmology. Here, we study its small-scale asymptotic limit, and show that for cold dark matter in $d$ spatial dimensions, $P(k)$ has a universal $k^{-d}$ asymptotic scaling with the wave-number $k$, for $k \gg k_{\rm nl}$, where $k_{\rm nl}^{-1}$ denotes the length scale at which non-linearities in gravitational interactions become important. We propose a theoretical explanation for this scaling, based on a non-perturbative analysis of the system's phase-space structure. Gravitational collapse is shown to drive a turbulent phase-space flow of the quadratic Casimir invariant, where the linear and non-linear time scales are balanced, and this balance dictates the $k$ dependence of the power spectrum. A parallel is drawn to Batchelor turbulence in hydrodynamics, where large scales mix smaller ones via tidal interactions. The $k^{-d}$ scaling is also derived by expressing $P(k)$ as a phase-space integral in the framework of kinetic field theory, which is analysed by the saddle-point method; the dominant critical points of this integral are precisely those where the time scales are balanced. The coldness of the dark-matter distribution function -- its non-vanishing only on a $d$-dimensional sub-manifold of phase-space -- underpins both approaches. The theory is accompanied by $1\mathrm{D}$ Vlasov--Poisson simulations, which confirm it.</description>

      <title>Photometric Determination of Unresolved Main-sequence Binaries in the Pleiades: Binary Fraction and Mass Ratio Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate determination of binary fractions ($f_{\rm b}$) and mass ratio ($q$) distributions is crucial for understanding the dynamical evolution of open clusters. We present an improved multiband fitting technique to enhance the analysis of binary properties. This approach enables an accurate photometric determination of $f_{\rm b}$ and $q$ distribution in a cluster. The detectable mass ratio can be down to the $q_{\rm lim}$, limited by the minimum stellar mass in theoretical models. First, we derived an empirical model for magnitudes of Gaia DR3 and 2MASS bands that match the photometry of single stars in the Pleiades. We then performed a multiband fitting for each cluster member, deriving the probability density function (PDF) of its primary mass ($\mathcal{M}_1$) and $q$ in the Bayesian framework. 1154 main-sequence (MS) single stars or unresolved MS+MS binaries are identified as members of the Pleiades. By stacking their PDFs, we conducted a detailed analysis of binary properties of the cluster. We found the $f_{\rm b}$ of this sample is $0.34 \pm 0.02$. The $q$ distribution exhibits a three-segment power-law profile: an initial increase, followed by a decrease, and then another increase. This distribution can be interpreted as a fiducial power-law profile with an exponent of -1.0 that is determined in the range of $0.3 &lt; q &lt; 0.8$, but with a deficiency of binaries at lower $q$ and an excess at higher $q$. The variations of $f_{\rm b}$ and $q$ with $\mathcal{M}_1$ reveal a complex binary distribution within the Pleiades, which might be attributed to a combination of primordial binary formation mechanisms, dynamical interactions, and the observational limit of photometric binaries imposed by $q_{\rm lim} (\mathcal{M}_1)$.</description>

      <title>Non-evolutionary effects on period change in Magellanic Cepheids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical Cepheids are a cornerstone class of pulsators, fundamental to testing stellar evolution and pulsation theories. Their secular period changes, characterized through $O-C$ (Observed minus Calculated) diagrams, offer valuable insights into their evolution. While evolutionary period changes are well understood from both observational and theoretical perspectives, shorter timescale period changes (on the order of ($\sim$ 10$^{2}$-10$^{4}$ days) - known as non-evolutionary period changes are yet to be systematically explored.
  In this work, we present a detailed and comprehensive search for non-evolutionary period changes using $O-C$ analysis of Magellanic Cloud (MC) Cepheids, based on 20+ years of OGLE photometry data. Our sample includes both the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) Cepheids, focusing on single radial mode Cepheids (both fundamental (FU) and first overtone (FO) modes). The results are grouped into two phenomena: (a) Cepheids in binary systems (b) Non-linear period changes.</description>

      <title>AT2021aeuk: A Repeating Partial Tidal Disruption Event Candidate in a Narrow-line Seyfert 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A black hole (BH) can tear apart a star that ventures within its tidal radius, producing a luminous flare as the stellar debris falls back, known as a tidal disruption event (TDE). While TDEs in quiescent galaxies are relatively well understood, identifying TDEs in active galactic nuclei (AGN) still remains a significant challenge. We present the discovery of AT2021aeuk, a transient exhibiting dual flares within around three years in a narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy. Multi-wavelength observations triggered during the second flare in 2023 revealed an extraordinary X-ray V-shaped light curve, strongly anti-correlated with the optical light curve and accompanied by a lag of $\sim$40 days. This behavior is inconsistent with both supernova and pure AGN origins. In addition, a new broad component emerges in the Balmer lines during the second flare, showing a clear reverberation signal to the continuum variation. We propose that the dual-flare may be linked to a repeating partial TDE (rpTDE), where the second flare results from a collision between the TDE stream and the inner accretion disk, triggering an optical flare while simultaneously partially destroying the X-ray corona. However, other mechanisms, such as a stellar-mass BH (sBH) merger within an accretion disk, could produce similar phenomena, which we cannot entirely rule out. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory will be a powerful tool for further investigating the nature of such events in the future.</description>

      <title>Superstrong magnetic fields in sunspot bipolar light bridges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent solar observations of bipolar light bridges (BLBs) in sunspots have, in a few individual cases, revealed magnetic fields up to 8.2 kG, which is at least twice as strong as typical values measured in sunspot umbrae. However, the small number of such observations hinted that such strong fields in these bright photospheric features that separate two opposite-polarity umbrae, are a rare phenomenon. We determine the field strength in a large sample of BLBs with the aim of establishing how prevalent such strong fields are in BLBs. We apply a state-of-the-art inversion technique that accounts for the degradation of the data by the intrinsic point spread function of the telescope, to the so far largest set of spectropolarimetric observations, by Hinode/Solar Optical Telescope spectropolarimeter, of sunspots containing BLBs. We identified 98 individual BLBs within 51 distinct sunspot groups. Since 66.3% of the BLBs were observed multiple times, a total of 630 spectropolarimetric scans of these 98 BLBs were analysed. All analysed BLBs contain magnetic fields stronger than 4.5 kG at unit optical depth. The field strengths decrease faster with height than the fields in umbrae and penumbrae. BLBs display a unique continuum intensity and field strength combination, forming a population well separated from umbrae and the penumbrae. The high brightness of BLBs in spite of their very strong magnetic fields points to the presence of a so far largely unexplored regime of magnetoconvection.</description>

      <title>Observations of the Ultraviolet-bright Star III-60 in the Globular Cluster NGC 6723</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have analyzed archival far-ultraviolet spectra of the UV-bright star III-60 in the globular cluster NGC 6723 obtained with the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) and the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS). We find that the star's photospheric parameters (effective temperature $T_{\rm eff} = 44{,}800 \pm 1200$, surface gravity $\log g = 4.89 \pm 0.18$, and helium abundance $\log N({\rm He})/N({\rm H}) = -0.84 \pm 0.29$) are consistent with the values derived from its optical spectrum, suggesting that optically-derived values are generally accurate for evolved stars with $T_{\rm eff} \lesssim$ 50,000 K. Relative to the cluster's RGB stars, III-60 is enhanced in nitrogen and depleted in carbon and oxygen. The star exhibits strong P Cygni profiles in both components of the N V $\lambda 1240$ doublet, but the resonance lines of other species show no evidence of a stellar wind. The star's effective temperature and luminosity place it on the evolutionary tracks of stars evolving from the blue horizontal branch, but its high mass ($\sim 1.2 \, M_{\odot}$) indicates that it is the product of a stellar merger. Its helium, carbon, and nitrogen abundances suggest that it is following an evolutionary path similar to that of the low-carbon, intermediate helium-rich hot subdwarfs.</description>

      <title>No massive black holes in the Milky Way halo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02386v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gravitational wave detectors have unveiled a population of massive black holes that do not resemble those observed in the Milky Way and whose origin is debated. According to one possible explanation, these black holes may have formed from density fluctuations in the early Universe (primordial black holes), and they should comprise from several to 100% of dark matter to explain the observed black hole merger rates. If such black holes existed in the Milky Way dark matter halo, they would cause long-timescale gravitational microlensing events lasting years. The previous experiments were not sufficiently sensitive to such events. Here we present the results of the search for long-timescale microlensing events among the light curves of nearly 80 million stars located in the Large Magellanic Cloud that were monitored for 20 years by the OGLE survey. We did not find any events with timescales longer than one year, whereas all shorter events detected may be explained by known stellar populations. We find that compact objects in the mass range from $1.8 \times 10^{-4}$ to $6.3\,M_{\odot}$ cannot compose more than 1% of dark matter, and those in the mass range from $1.3 \times 10^{-5}$ to $860\,M_{\odot}$ cannot make up more than 10% of dark matter. Thus, primordial black holes in this mass range cannot simultaneously explain a significant fraction of dark matter and gravitational wave events.</description>

      <title>COSMOS-Web: The Role of Galaxy Interactions and Disk Instabilities in Producing Starbursts at z&lt;4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study of the role of galaxy-galaxy interactions and disk instabilities in producing starburst activity in galaxies out to z = 4. For this, we use a sample of 387 galaxies with robust total star formation rate measurements from Herschel, gas masses from ALMA, stellar masses and redshifts from multi-band photometry, and JWST/NIRCam rest-frame optical imaging. Using mass-controlled samples, we find an increased fraction of interacting galaxies in the starburst regime at all redshifts out to z = 4. This increase correlates with star formation efficiency (SFE), but not with gas fraction. However, the correlation is weak (and only significant out to z = 2), which could be explained by the short duration of SFE increase during interaction. In addition, we find that isolated disk galaxies make up a significant fraction of the starburst population. The fraction of such galaxies with star-forming clumps ("clumpy disks") is significantly increased compared to the main-sequence disk population. Furthermore, this fraction directly correlates with SFE. This is direct observational evidence for a long-term increase of SFE maintained due to disk instabilities, contributing to the majority of starburst galaxies in our sample and hence to substantial mass growth in these systems. This result could also be of importance for explaining the growth of the most massive galaxies at z &gt; 6.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Modelling of Polarized Dust Emission in Intermediate-Mass YSOs: I: Constraining the Role of Iron Inclusions and Inelastic Relaxation on Grain Alignment with ALMA Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10079v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Iron inclusions embedded inside dust grains play a crucial role in both internal alignment (IA) via Barnett relaxation and external alignment via the MAgnetically Enhanced RAdiative Torque (MRAT) mechanism. Moreover, inelastic relaxation is predicted to dominate over Barnett relaxation in driving the IA of micron-sized and very large grains above $10\mu m$ (VLGs). Yet, a detailed modeling of polarized thermal dust emission from Class 0/I Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) taking into account these effects and their observational constraints is still lacking. In this paper, we update the POLARIS code and use it to perform synthetic dust polarization modeling for MHD simulations of an intermediate-mass YSO. Results will be post-processed with CASA to confront ALMA polarimetric observations. We found that to reproduce the high polarization degree of $p \sim 5-30\%$ observed in protostellar envelopes by ALMA, micron-sized and VLGs must contain iron inclusions with $N_{\rm cl} \sim 5 - 10^{3}$ iron atoms per cluster, assuming $30\%$ of iron abundance locked inside dust grains under the cluster form. Inside the inner $\sim 500$ au region, inelastic relaxation must participate in driving the grain internal alignment, and grains must contain larger iron inclusions of $N_{\rm cl} \sim 10^{2}-10^{4}$ and grow beyond $\geq 10\mu m$ to reproduce $\sim 3-10\%$ of dust polarization observed by ALMA. But given such a combination, the internal alignment and MRAT efficiency acting on VLGs still decrease toward the center, inducing the decrease of $p(\%)$ with increasing gas density, reaching $p \sim 1\%$ inside the disk.</description>

      <title>High-resolution HI mapping of nearby extremely metal-poor blue compact dwarf galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21221v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical observations of Blue Compact Dwarf galaxies (BCDs) show they typically have high specific star formation rates and low metallicites. A subset of these galaxies (those with the lowest gas phase metallicities) display cometary optical morphologies similar to those found at high redshift. Whether this combination of properties predominantly arises from interactions with neighbours or accretion from the cosmic web or something else remains unclear. We used high resolution HI mapping to gain insights into the processes driving the observed properties of a sample of extremely metal poor (XMP) BCDs. We present Very Large Array B- and C-configuration HI mapping of four BCDs. For three of the targeted BCDs we also detect and map the HI in their nearby companions. In these three cases there is HI evidence for a recent flyby interaction between the BCD and a nearby companion. The HI evidence for recent interactions for these three BCDs is corroborated by our analysis of the tidal forces exerted on the BCDs by companions with available spectroscopic redshifts. For J0204-1009 we had sufficient spatial resolution to determine that it is dark matter dominated and estimate its DM halo mass to be in the range 1.2 x 10^11 to 5.2 x 10^11 solar masses. It is the most isolated BCD in our small sample, J0301-0052, which shows one of the most asymmetric HI morphologies. J0301-0052 has a similar cometary HI morphology to the BCD's optical morphology, although the HI column density maximum is projected at the end of the of the optical tail. Our HI observations suggest J0301-0052 may be undergoing a merger, while the other BCDs show evidence of a recent tidal interaction with a near neighbour. While our selection criteria favoured BCDs with companions our results are consistent with the earlier finding by other authors that most BCDs are associated with either mild tidal interactions or mergers.</description>

      <title>A Large Molecular Gas Reservoir in the Protocluster SPT2349$-$56 at $z\,{=}\,4.3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Atacama Compact Array (ACA) Band-3 observations of the protocluster SPT2349$-$56, an extreme system hosting ${\gtrsim}\,12$ submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) at $z\,{=}\,4.3$, to study its integrated molecular gas content via CO(4-3) and long-wavelength dust continuum. The $\sim$30-hour integration represents one of the longest exposures yet taken on a single pointing with the ACA 7-m. The low-resolution ACA data ($21.0''\,{\times}\,12.2''$) reveal a 75% excess CO(4-3) flux compared to the sum of individual sources detected in higher-resolution Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) data ($1.0''\,{\times}\,0.8''$). Our work also reveals a similar result by tapering the ALMA data to $10''$. In contrast, the 3.2mm dust continuum shows little discrepancy between ACA and ALMA. A single-dish [CII] spectrum obtained by APEX/FLASH supports the ACA CO(4-3) result, revealing a large excess in [CII] emission relative to ALMA. The missing flux is unlikely due to undetected faint sources but instead suggests that high-resolution ALMA observations might miss extended and low-surface-brightness gas. Such emission could originate from the circum-galactic medium (CGM) or the pre-heated proto-intracluster medium (proto-ICM). If this molecular gas reservoir replenishes the star formation fuel, the overall depletion timescale will exceed 400Myr, reducing the requirement for the simultaneous SMG activity in SPT2349$-$56. Our results highlight the role of an extended gas reservoir in sustaining a high star formation rate (SFR) in SPT2349$-$56, and potentially establishing the ICM during the transition phase to a mature cluster.</description>

      <title>The angular momentum of 1.2$M_\odot$ to 2.0$M_\odot$ main-sequence and turn-off stars constrain the relationship between star-forming environment and galactic evolution history</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: \textit{Kepler} and \textit{Gaia} data shows an anomaly in the angular momentum-age relationship for 1.2-2 main-sequence stars. After considering model-induced correlation of parameters, the moment of inertia, stellar velocity distribution, sample selection effects, interactions between the Milky Way and dwarf galaxies, the star-disk interaction during the early pre-main sequence, and the angular momentum change on the main sequence, this work suggests that the earlier the star within this mass range born, the smaller the angular momentum at the time of born, following an exponential decay relationship. This relationship should be attributed to the variation in molecular cloud parameters throughout the history of the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Detection of polarized Fermi-bubble synchrotron and dust emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00933v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The elusive polarized microwave signal from the Fermi bubbles is disentangled from the more extended polarized lobes, which similarly emanate from the Galactic plane but stretch farther west of the bubbles. The projected ~20% synchrotron polarization reveals magnetic fields preferentially parallel to the bubble edges, as expected downstream of a strong shock. The projected ~20% polarization of thermal dust emission is similarly oriented, constraining grain alignment in an extreme environment. We argue that the larger lobes arise from an older Galactic-center, likely supermassive black-hole, outburst.</description>

      <title>Double white dwarf binary population in MOCCA star clusters -- Comparisons with observations of close and wide binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04314v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There could be a significant population of double white dwarf binaries (DWDs) inside globular clusters (GCs), however, these are often too faint to be individually observed. We have utilized a large number GC models evolved with the Monte Carlo Cluster Simulator (MOCCA) code, to create a large statistical dataset of DWDs. These models include multiple-stellar populations, resulting in two distinct initial populations: one dense and another less dense. Due to the lower density of one population, a large number of objects escape during the early GC evolution, leading to a high mass-loss rate. In this dataset we have analysed three main groups of DWDs, namely in-cluster binaries, escaped binaries, and isolated evolution of primordial binaries. We compared the properties of these groups to observations of close and wide binaries. We find that the number of escaping DWDs is significantly larger than the number of in-cluster binaries and those that form via the isolated evolution of all promiridial binaries in our GC models. This suggests that dynamics play an important role in the formation of DWDs. For close binaries, we found a good agreement in the separations of escaped binaries and isolated binaries, but in-cluster binaries showed slight differences. We could not reproduce the observed extremely low mass WDs due to the limitations of our stellar and binary evolution prescriptions. For wide binaries, we also found a good agreement in the separations and masses, after accounting for observational selection effects. We conclude that, even though the current observational samples of DWDs are extremely biased and incomplete, our results compare reasonably well with observations.</description>

      <title>Discovery and Detailed Study of the M31 Classical Nova AT 2023tkw: Evidence for Internal Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of an extragalactic slow classical nova in M31 exhibiting multiple peaks in its light curve. Spectroscopic and photometric observations were used to investigate the underlying physical processes. Shock-induced heating events resulting in the expansion and contraction of the photosphere are likely responsible for the observed multiple peaks. Deviation of the observed spectrum at the peak from the models also suggests the presence of shocks. The successive peaks occurring at increasing intervals could be due to the series of internal shocks generated near or within the photosphere. Spectral modeling suggests a low-mass white dwarf accreting slowly from a companion star. The ejecta mass, estimated from spectral analysis, is $\sim 10^{-4}\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, which is typical for a slow nova. We estimate the binary, by comparing the archival HST data and eruption properties with stellar and novae models, to comprise a 0.65 $\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ primary white dwarf and a K III cool evolved secondary star.</description>
