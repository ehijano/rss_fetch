      <title>Leveraging Covariates in Regression Discontinuity Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is common practice to incorporate additional covariates in empirical economics. In the context of Regression Discontinuity (RD) designs, covariate adjustment plays multiple roles, making it essential to understand its impact on analysis and conclusions. Typically implemented via local least squares regressions, covariate adjustment can serve three main distinct purposes: (i) improving the efficiency of RD average causal effect estimators, (ii) learning about heterogeneous RD policy effects, and (iii) changing the RD parameter of interest. This article discusses and illustrates empirically how to leverage covariates effectively in RD designs.</description>

      <title>A New Perspective of the Meese-Rogoff Puzzle: Application of Sparse Dynamic Shrinkage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the Markov Switching Dynamic Shrinkage process (MSDSP), nesting the Dynamic Shrinkage Process (DSP) of Kowal et al. (2019). We revisit the Meese-Rogoff puzzle (Meese and Rogoff, 1983a,b, 1988) by applying the MSDSP to the economic models deemed inferior to the random walk model for exchange rate predictions. The flexibility of the MSDSP model captures the possibility of zero coefficients (sparsity), constant coefficient (dynamic shrinkage), as well as sudden and gradual parameter movements (structural change) in the time-varying parameter model setting. We also apply MSDSP in the context of Bayesian predictive synthesis (BPS) (McAlinn and West, 2019), where dynamic combination schemes exploit the information from the alternative economic models. Our analysis provide a new perspective to the Meese-Rogoff puzzle, illustrating that the economic models, enhanced with the parameter flexibility of the MSDSP, produce predictive distributions that are superior to the random walk model, even when stochastic volatility is considered.</description>

      <title>Testing Clustered Equal Predictive Ability with Unknown Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop new tests of clustered equal predictive ability (C-EPA) in panels where the clusters are unknown and estimated by a Panel Kmeans algorithm. This algorithm differs from the standard Kmeans algorithm by employing the time series variation of the panel rather than relying merely on time averages of observations. To address the challenge of testing hypotheses that depend on data-driven cluster estimates, we adopt a selective conditional inference framework. Specifically, we derive a Wald-type test statistic for pairwise equality and show that the limiting distribution of its square root conditional on the estimated cluster structure is that of a truncated $\chi$ random variable. We characterize the associated truncation set as a polyhedron in the data space. As a test of the C-EPA hypothesis, we propose a $p$-value combination method which aggregates the evidence against the pairwise equality and overall EPA null hypotheses. In addition, we prove that using an information criterion to select the unknown number of clusters under the alternative hypothesis prior to testing does not require further conditioning to obtain a valid test. Monte Carlo simulations confirm the excellent finite sample performance of the proposed tests. An empirical application to forecasting exchange rates using traditional time series models as well as machine learning methods illustrates the practical importance of our procedure.</description>

      <title>Volatility Spillovers and Interconnectedness in OPEC Oil Markets: A Network-Based log-ARCH Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines several network-based volatility models for oil prices, capturing spillovers among OPEC oil-exporting countries by embedding novel network structures into ARCH-type models. We apply a network-based log-ARCH framework that incorporates weight matrices derived from time-series clustering and model-implied distances into the conditional variance equation. These weight matrices are constructed from return data and standard multivariate GARCH model outputs (CCC, DCC, and GO-GARCH), enabling a comparative analysis of volatility transmission across specifications. Through a rolling-window forecast evaluation, the network-based models demonstrate competitive forecasting performance relative to traditional specifications and uncover intricate spillover effects. These results provide a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness within the OPEC network, with important implications for financial risk assessment, market integration, and coordinated policy among oil-producing economies.</description>

      <title>Regional compositional trajectories and structural change: A spatiotemporal multivariate autoregressive framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compositional data, such as regional shares of economic sectors or property transactions, are central to understanding structural change in economic systems across space and time. This paper introduces a spatiotemporal multivariate autoregressive model tailored for panel data with composition-valued responses at each areal unit and time point. The proposed framework enables the joint modelling of temporal dynamics and spatial dependence under compositional constraints and is estimated via a quasi maximum likelihood approach. We build on recent theoretical advances to establish identifiability and asymptotic properties of the estimator when both the number of regions and time points grow. The utility and flexibility of the model are demonstrated through two applications: analysing property transaction compositions in an intra-city housing market (Berlin), and regional sectoral compositions in Spain's economy. These case studies highlight how the proposed framework captures key features of spatiotemporal economic processes that are often missed by conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Policy relevance of causal quantities in networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In settings where units' outcomes are affected by others' treatments, there has been a proliferation of ways to quantify effects of treatments on outcomes. Here we describe how many proposed estimands can be represented as involving one of two ways of averaging over units and treatment assignments. The more common representation often results in quantities that are irrelevant, or at least insufficient, for optimal choice of policies governing treatment assignment. The other representation often yields quantities that lack an interpretation as summaries of unit-level effects, but that we argue may still be relevant to policy choice. Among various estimands, the expected average outcome -- or its contrast between two different policies -- can be represented both ways and, we argue, merits further attention.</description>

      <title>Predicting the Distribution of Treatment Effects via Covariate-Adjustment, with an Application to Microcredit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14635v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Important questions for impact evaluation require knowledge not only of average effects, but of the distribution of treatment effects. The inability to observe individual counterfactuals makes answering these empirical questions challenging. I propose an inference approach for points of the distribution of treatment effects by incorporating predicted counterfactuals through covariate adjustment. I provide finite-sample valid inference using sample-splitting, and asymptotically valid inference using cross-fitting, under arguably weak conditions. Revisiting five randomized controlled trials on microcredit that reported null average effects, I find important distributional impacts, with some individuals helped and others harmed by the increased credit access.</description>

      <title>Panel Data Estimation and Inference: Homogeneity versus Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we define an underlying data generating process that allows for different magnitudes of cross-sectional dependence, along with time series autocorrelation. This is achieved via high-dimensional moving average processes of infinite order (HDMA($\infty$)). Our setup and investigation integrates and enhances homogenous and heterogeneous panel data estimation and testing in a unified way. To study HDMA($\infty$), we extend the Beveridge-Nelson decomposition to a high-dimensional time series setting, and derive a complete toolkit set. We exam homogeneity versus heterogeneity using Gaussian approximation, a prevalent technique for establishing uniform inference. For post-testing inference, we derive central limit theorems through Edgeworth expansions for both homogenous and heterogeneous settings. Additionally, we showcase the practical relevance of the established asymptotic theory by (1). connecting our results with the literature on grouping structure analysis, (2). examining a nonstationary panel data generating process, and (3). revisiting the common correlated effects (CCE) estimators. Finally, we verify our theoretical findings via extensive numerical studies using both simulated and real datasets.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Testability of Slutsky Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Economic theory implies strong limitations on what types of consumption behavior are considered rational. Rationality implies that the Slutsky matrix, which captures the substitution effects of compensated price changes on demand for different goods, is symmetric and negative semi-definite. While empirically informed versions of negative semi-definiteness have been shown to be nonparametrically testable, the analogous question for Slutsky symmetry has remained open. Recently, it has even been shown that the symmetry condition is not testable via the average Slutsky matrix, prompting conjectures about its non-testability. We settle this question by deriving nonparametric conditional quantile restrictions on observable data that permit construction of a fully nonparametric test for Slutsky symmetry in an empirical setting with individual heterogeneity and endogeneity. The theoretical contribution is a multivariate generalization of identification results for partial effects in nonseparable models without monotonicity, which is of independent interest. This result has implications for different areas in econometric theory, including nonparametric welfare analysis with individual heterogeneity for which, in the case of more than two goods, the symmetry condition introduces a nonlinear correction factor.</description>

      <title>Breakdown Analysis for Instrumental Variables with Binary Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the partial identification of treatment effects in Instrumental Variables (IV) settings with binary outcomes under violations of independence. I derive the identified sets for the treatment parameters of interest in the setting, as well as breakdown values for conclusions regarding the true treatment effects. I derive $\sqrt{N}$-consistent nonparametric estimators for the bounds of treatment effects and for breakdown values. These results can be used to assess the robustness of empirical conclusions obtained under the assumption that the instrument is independent from potential quantities, which is a pervasive concern in studies that use IV methods with observational data. In the empirical application, I show that the conclusions regarding the effects of family size on female unemployment using same-sex sibling as the instrument are highly sensitive to violations of independence.</description>
