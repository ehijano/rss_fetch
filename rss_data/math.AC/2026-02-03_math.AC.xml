      <title>Lengths of irreducible decompositions of numerical semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A numerical semigroup is an additive subsemigroup of the natural numbers that contains zero and has finite complement. A numerical semigroup is irreducible if it cannot be written as an intersection of numerical semigroups properly containing it. It is known that every numerical semigroup can be decomposed as an intersection of irreducible numerical semigroups, but there can be multiple such decompositions, even when irredundancy is required. In this paper, we study the set of all decomposition lengths of a given numerical semigroup. It is conjectured that the set of decomposition lengths is always an interval; we prove this conjecture for numerical semigroups whose smallest positive element is at most six. Additionally, we examine a class of numerical semigroups that was recently shown to achieve arbitrarily large minimum decomposition length, and construct a family of irreducible decompositions whose lengths form a large interval.</description>

      <title>Lifting systems for finite length modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with lifting modules along a surjective map of noetherian local rings, say $\varphi \colon R \twoheadrightarrow S$. A finitely generated $R$-module $L$ is a naive lift of an $S$-module $M$ if $L \otimes_R S \cong M$. We are concerned with the maximum depth and dimension among all naive lifts of $M$, which we call the liftable depth and liftable dimension, respectively, of $M$ along $\varphi$. We approach this via a notion of lifting systems that we introduce in this paper. We then provide a necessary and sufficient condition for a module of finite length to lift and Serre lift to a regular local ring in terms of lifting systems.</description>

      <title>Normality of monomial ideals in three variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An ideal $I$ in a Noetherian ring is called \textit{normal} if $I^n$ is integrally closed for all $n \geq 1$. Zariski proved that in two-dimensional regular local rings, every integrally closed ideal is normal. However, in dimension three and higher, this is no longer true in general, including monomial ideals in polynomial rings.
  In this paper, we study the normality of integrally closed monomial ideals in the polynomial ring $k[x,y,z]$ over a field $k$. We prove that every such ideal with at most seven minimal monomial generators is normal, thereby giving a sharp bound for normality in this setting. The proof is based on a detailed case-by-case analysis, combined with valuation-theoretic and combinatorial methods via Newton polyhedra.</description>

      <title>Strongly $FP$-injective dimensions and Gorenstein projective precovers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of the Gorenstein projective precovers over arbitrary rings is an open question. In this paper, we use the strongly $FP$-injective modules to present some situations where there exists Gorenstein projective precovers, also make use of a semidualizing bimodule $_S C_R$ for the same purpose. We prove that the pair $(\mathcal{GP} , \mathcal{GP} ^{\perp})$ forms a complete cotorsion pair under some mild conditions and from there we provide a family of induced cotorsion pairs. We also prove that if $M$ has finite strongly $FP$-injective dimension, then the Gorenstein projective (resp. Gorenstein flat) dimension and the projective (resp. flat) dimension coincide over a general ring</description>

      <title>A new criterion for the absolute irreducibility of multivariate polynomials over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key property of an algebraic variety is whether it is absolutely irreducible, meaning that it remains irreducible over the algebraic closure of its defining field, and determining absolute irreducibility is important in algebraic geometry and its applications in coding theory, cryptography, and other fields.
  Among the applications of absolute irreducibility are bounding the number of rational points via the Weil conjectures and establishing exceptional APN and permutation properties of functions over finite fields. In this article, we present a new criterion for the absolute irreducibility of hypersurfaces defined by multivariate polynomials over finite fields. Our criterion does not require testing for irreducibility in the ground or extension fields, assuming that the leading form is square-free. We just require multivariate GCD computations and the square-free property. Since almost all polynomials are known to be square-free, our absolute irreducibility criterion is valid for almost all multivariate polynomials.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Interpolation of a Vector Field on a Convex Polyhedral Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a computational method for reconstructing a vector field on a convex polytope $\mathcal{P} \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ of arbitrary dimension from discrete samples. We specifically address the scenario where the vector field is subject to a no-penetration (slip) boundary condition, requiring it to be tangent to the boundary $\partial \mathcal{P}$. Given a degree bound $k$, our algorithm computes a polynomial vector field of degree at most $k$ that fits the observed data in the least-squares sense while exactly satisfying the tangency constraints. Central to our approach is an explicit characterization of the module of polynomial vector fields tangent to $\partial \mathcal{P}$, derived using algebraic concepts from the theory of hyperplane arrangements.</description>

      <title>Triangle equivalences between Gorenstein tiled orders and incidence algebras of posets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that for any $\mathbb{N}$-graded Gorenstein tiled order $A$, the stable category $\underline{\mathrm{CM}}^{\mathbb{Z}}A$ is triangle equivalent to the perfect derived category of the incidence algebra of a finite poset $\mathbb{V}_A^{op}$. Moreover, for a finite poset $P$, we prove that the incidence algebra of $P$ can be realized as the endomorphism algebra of a standard tilting object if and only if $P$ is either empty or has the maximum. We also study the behaviors of the corresponding poset under graded Morita equivalences and coverings of a Gorenstein tiled order. Finally, we classify Gorenstein tiled orders $A$ satisfying $|\mathbb{V}_A^{op}|\leq 3$.</description>

      <title>Perfectoid towers generated from prisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15785v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a unified construction of perfectoid towers from specific prisms which covers all the previous constructions of (p-torsion-free) perfectoid towers. By virtue of the construction, perfectoid towers can be systematically constructed for a large class of rings with Frobenius lift. Especially, any Frobenius lifting of a reduced $\mathbb{F}_p$-algebra has a perfectoid tower.</description>

      <title>Borel-Weil factorization for super Grassmannians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article deals with computing the cohomology of Schur functors applied to tautological bundles on super Grassmannians. We show that in a range of cases, the cohomology is a free module over the cohomology of the structure sheaf and that the space of generators is an irreducible representation of the general linear supergroup that can be constructed via explicit multilinear operations. Our techniques come from commutative algebra: we relate this cohomology calculation to Tor groups of certain algebraic varieties.</description>
