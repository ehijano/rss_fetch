      <title>Equidistribution of Primitive Normal Elements in Finite Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $q=p^k$ be a prime power, let $n\geq2$ be an integer and let $\mathbb{F}_{q^n}$ be a finite field. It is shown that the set of primitive normal elements is a Salem set. Furthermore, it is proved that this set is strongly equidistributed in the finite field. Similar results are proved for the set of quadratic residues and the set of primitive roots modulo a large prime $p\geq 3$.</description>

      <title>A Logarithmic Spiral Formed by a Sequence of Regular Polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09060v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When the sequence of regular polygons with consecutively increasing numbers of sides is joined edge-to-edge in a single direction while minimizing bending, the resulting structure assumes the shape of a logarithmic spiral. This paper proves that this spiral takes the form r=exp(4{\theta}/{\pi}). Specifically, it is derived that the distances between the curve and the centers of the even-sided and odd-sided regular polygons converge to 5/6 and 7/12, respectively, with the centers extending outward along the inner side of the spiral. A similar analysis applied to the sequence of regular polygons with consecutively increasing odd numbers of sides reveals that it forms the same type of spiral, establishing that the distances to the centers converge to 7/24.</description>

      <title>Circular Super patterns and Zigzag constructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce the notion of circular k-superpatterns, defined as permutations that contain all length-k patterns up to rotation equivalence.
  We present a construction of a circular superpattern from a linear (k-1)-superpattern and explicitly derive an upper bound on its length. Motivated by the zigzag framework of Engen and Vatter, we adapt and simplify their score function to the circular setting and analyze its parity properties. For odd k, we propose a candidate zigzag construction for circular superpatterns, supported by computational evidence for small values of k.</description>

      <title>Exact and Asymptotic Counts of MSTD, MDTS, and Balanced Sets in Dicyclic Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the relationship between the sizes of the sum and difference sets of the Dicyclic Group $\mathrm{Dic}_{4n}$. We first determine the exact numbers of MSTD (more sums than differences), MDTS (more differences than sums), and balanced subsets of size two. As a consequence, we show that the numbers of MSTD and balanced subsets of size two are asymptotically equal as $n \to \infty$. For odd $n$, we then obtain exact counts of MSTD, MDTS, and balanced subsets of size three, with the results depending on whether $n$ is divisible by $3$. In this case, we establish that asymptotically the number of MSTD subsets of size three is six times the number of MDTS subsets and also six times the number of balanced subsets. Finally, we establish a lower bound for the number of MSTD, MDTS, and balanced subsets of $\mathrm{Dic}_{4n}$ corresponding to the boundary case of size $2n$.</description>

      <title>New type degenerate Simsek numbers and related aspects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new type degenerate Simsek numbers and their generating function, which are different from degenerate Simsek number studied so far. We establish the explicit formula, recurrence relation and other identities for these numbers. We also derive several interesting expressions and relations between these numbers and certain other special numbers in the literature. In addition, several numerical examples and graphical illustrations are provided to support the theoretical results and to illustrate the behavior of the introduced numbers.</description>
