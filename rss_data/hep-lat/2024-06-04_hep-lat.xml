      <title>Quark orbital angular momentum in the proton from a twist-3 generalized parton distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quark orbital angular momentum in the proton is evaluated via a Lattice QCD calculation of the second Mellin moment of the twist-3 generalized parton distribution $\widetilde{E}_{2T} $ in the forward limit. The connection between this approach to quark orbital angular momentum and approaches previously utilized in Lattice QCD calculations, via generalized transverse momentum-dependent parton distributions and via Ji's sum rule, is reviewed. This connection can be given in terms of Lorentz invariance and equation of motion relations. The calculation of the second Mellin moment of $\widetilde{E}_{2T} $ proceeds via a finite-momentum proton matrix element of a quark bilocal operator with a straight-line gauge connection and separation in both the longitudinal and transverse directions. The dependence on the former component serves to extract the second Mellin moment, whereas the dependence on the latter component provides a transverse momentum cutoff for the matrix element. Furthermore, a derivative of the matrix element with respect to momentum transfer in the forward limit is required, which is obtained using a direct derivative method. The calculation utilizes a clover fermion ensemble at pion mass 317 MeV. The resulting quark orbital angular momentum is consistent with previous evaluations through alternative approaches, albeit with greater statistical uncertainty using a comparable number of samples.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulations of quantum electrodynamics in Coulomb gauge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the quantum computing method has been used to address the sign problem in traditional Monte Carlo lattice gauge theory (LGT) simulations. We propose that the Coulomb gauge (CG) should be used in quantum simulations of LGT. This is because the redundant degrees of freedom can be eliminated in CG. Therefore, the Hamiltonian in CG does not need to be gauge invariance, allowing the gauge field to be discretized naively. We point out that discretized gauge fields and fermion fields should be placed on momentum and position lattices, respectively. Under this scheme, the CG condition and Gauss's law can be conveniently preserved by solving algebraic equations of polarization vectors. We also discuss the procedure for mapping gauge fields to qubits, and then demonstrate the polynomial scaling of qubits and the complexity of time evolution. Finally, we calculate the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the U(1) plaquette operator and the Wilson loop on a classical device to test the performance of our discretization scheme.</description>

      <title>Fermion Mass Generation without Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the generation of fermion mass in a context where interactions break a discrete chiral symmetry. Then, fermion mass is not protected by a symmetry, no symmetry is broken by the generation of mass, and a vanishing mass no longer enhances a symmetry. We elaborate these scenarios for template fermionic and Yukawa theories in three dimensions where mass can be generated either by fluctuations, strong dynamics, or the vacuum expectation value of a scalar field. We find that fluctuation-induced contributions to fermion mass are parametrically suppressed in the number of fermion flavours $N$. The generation of fermion mass then takes the form of a rapid crossover which turns into a second order quantum phase transition for large $N$, much like in settings with fundamental chiral symmetry. We further discuss theories where fermion mass can be generated spontaneously without breaking any symmetry other than scale symmetry. Implications of our findings are discussed.</description>

      <title>Chiral Symmetry Breaking and Pion Decay in a Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pattern of chiral symmetry breaking is exploited to compute vector and axial-vector pion matrix elements in a uniform magnetic field. Our results are model independent, and thereby constitute low-energy theorems that must be obeyed by QCD in external magnetic fields. Chiral perturbation theory and lattice QCD results are compared, for which there is some tension. As an application, the matrix elements are utilized to compute pion decay rates in a magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Tau Data-Based Evaluations of the hadronic vacuum polarization contribution to the muon $g-2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review the tau data-driven computation of Euclidean windows for the hadronic vacuum polarization contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment (a_mu), which agree with the lattice results, making the difference of the $e^+e^-$ data-driven methods with them more intriguing. This conundrum needs to be solved by next year, when the final FNAL a_mu measurement will be published, in order to extract firm conclusions on possible new physics effects.</description>

      <title>Understanding the nature of the $\Delta(1600)$ resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a coupled-channel analysis of the $ J^P = 3/2^+ \Delta $-baryon spectrum, based in the framework of Hamiltonian Effective Field Theory (HEFT). We construct a Hamiltonian which mixes quark model-like single-particle states and two-particle meson-baryon channels, and constrain this via experimentally measured $ \pi N \to \pi N $ scattering observables. In the same vein as L\"{u}scher's approach, we then connect this infinite-volume inspired Hamiltonian with finite-volume lattice QCD results. Drawing on lattice correlation-matrix eigenvectors identifying the $ 1s $ and $ 2s $ states in the finite-volume $ \Delta(3/2^+) $ spectrum, and utilising the HEFT eigenvectors describing the composition of the energy eigenstates, we resolve the structure of these states and their relation to the $ \Delta(1600) $ resonance. We find the dominant contributions to this resonance come from strong rescattering in the $ \pi N $ and $ \pi \Delta $ channels. This contrasts the long-held view of a dominant quark model-like core for the $ \Delta(1600) $. Further discussion of other contemporary lattice results for the $ \Delta $ spectrum and $ \pi N $ scattering states is also presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structure functions of the spin-1 deuteron will be investigated experimentally from the late 2020's at various facilities such as Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, nuclotron-based ion collider facility, and electron-ion colliders. We expect that a new high-energy spin-physics field could be created by these projects. In this paper, the current theoretical status is explained for the structure functions of spin-1 hadrons, especially on parton distribution functions, transverse-momentum dependent parton distributions, and fragmentation functions. Related multiparton distribution functions are also shown.</description>

      <title>$\Delta I = 3/2$ and $\Delta I = 1/2$ channels of $K\to\pi\pi$ decay at the physical point with periodic boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06781v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a lattice calculation of the $K\to\pi\pi$ matrix elements and amplitudes with both the $\Delta I = 3/2$ and 1/2 channels and $\varepsilon'$, the measure of direct $CP$ violation. We use periodic boundary conditions (PBC), where the correct kinematics of $K\to\pi\pi$ can be achieved via an excited two-pion final state. To overcome the difficulty associated with the extraction of excited states, our previous work \cite{Bai:2015nea,RBC:2020kdj} successfully employed G-parity boundary conditions, where pions are forced to have non-zero momentum enabling the $I=0$ two-pion ground state to express the on-shell kinematics of the $K\to\pi\pi$ decay. Here instead we overcome the problem using the variational method which allows us to resolve the two-pion spectrum and matrix elements up to the relevant energy where the decay amplitude is on-shell.
  In this paper we report an exploratory calculation of $K\to\pi\pi$ decay amplitudes and $\varepsilon'$ using PBC on a coarser lattice size of $24^3\times64$ with inverse lattice spacing $a^{-1}=1.023$ GeV and the physical pion and kaon masses. The results are promising enough to motivate us to continue our measurements on finer lattice ensembles in order to improve the precision in the near future.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-scalar meson spectral properties in the chiral crossover region of QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determining the type of excitations that can exist in a thermal medium is key to understanding how hadronic matter behaves at extreme temperatures. In this work we study this question for pseudo-scalar mesons comprised of light-strange and strange-strange quarks, analysing how their low-energy spectral properties are modified as one passes through the high-temperature chiral crossover region between $T=145.6 \, \text{MeV}$ and $172.3 \, \text{MeV}$. We utilise the non-perturbative constraints satisfied by correlation functions at finite temperature in order to extract the low-energy meson spectral function contributions from spatial correlator lattice data in $N_{f}=2+1$ flavour QCD. The robustness of these contributions are tested by comparing their predictions with data for the corresponding temporal correlator at different momentum values. We find that around the pseudo-critical temperature $T_{\text{pc}}$ the data in both the light-strange and strange-strange channels is consistent with the presence of a distinct stable particle-like ground state component, a so-called thermoparticle excitation. As the temperature increases this excitation undergoes collisional broadening, and this is qualitatively the same in both channels. These findings suggest that pseudo-scalar mesons in QCD have a bound-state-like structure at low energies within the chiral crossover region which is still strongly influenced by the vacuum states of the theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06609v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize the relativistic field-theoretic three-particle finite-volume scattering formalism to describe generic $DD\pi$ systems in the charm $C=2$ sector. This includes the isospin-0 channel, in which the recently discovered doubly-charmed tetraquark $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ is expected to manifest as a pole in the $DD \pi \to DD \pi$ scattering amplitude. The formalism presented here can also be applied to lattice QCD settings in which the $D^*$ is bound and, in particular, remains valid below the left-hand cut in $D D^*$ scattering, thus resolving an issue in previous analyses of lattice-determined finite-volume energies.</description>

      <title>Solving Conformal Defects in 3D Conformal Field Theory using Fuzzy Sphere Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Defects in conformal field theory (CFT) are of significant theoretical and experimental importance. The presence of defects theoretically enriches the structure of the CFT, but at the same time, it makes it more challenging to study, especially in dimensions higher than two. Here, we demonstrate that the recently-developed theoretical scheme, \textit{fuzzy (non-commutative) sphere regularization}, provides a powerful lens through which one can dissect the defect of 3D CFTs in a transparent way. As a notable example, we study the magnetic line defect of 3D Ising CFT and clearly demonstrate that it flows to a conformal defect fixed point. We have identified 6 low-lying defect primary operators, including the displacement operator, and accurately extract their scaling dimensions through the state-operator correspondence. Moreover, we also compute one-point bulk correlators and two-point bulk-defect correlators, which show great agreement with predictions of defect conformal symmetry, and from which we extract various bulk-defect operator product expansion coefficients. Our work demonstrates that the fuzzy sphere offers a powerful tool for exploring the rich physics in 3D defect CFTs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hadronic vacuum polarization contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of a lepton is considered as a function of the lepton mass. We show how the analyticity properties of this function allow for its full reconstruction when it is only known in a restricted mass region. Assuming that LQCD could evaluate it in an optimal mass region we show, within the framework of a phenomenological model, how to reconstruct the function elsewhere, in particular at the muon mass value.</description>

      <title>Chiral condensate and the equation of state at nonzero baryon density from the hadron resonance gas model with a repulsive mean field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the QCD equation of state and the chiral condensate using the hadron resonance gas model with repulsive mean-field interactions. We find that the repulsive interactions improve the agreement with the lattice results on the derivatives of the pressure with respect to the baryon chemical potential up to eighth order. From the temperature dependence of the chiral condensate we estimate the crossover temperature as a function of baryon chemical potential, $T_{pc}(\mu_B)$. We find that the chiral crossover line starts to deviate significantly from the chemical freeze-out line already for $\mu_B&gt;400$ MeV. Furthermore, we find that the chiral pseudocritical line can be parametrized as $T_{pc}(\mu_B)/T_{pc}(0)=1-\kappa_2 (\mu_B/T_{pc} (0))^2-\kappa_4 (\mu_B/T_{pc} (0))^4$ with $\kappa_2=0.0150(2)$ and $\kappa_4=3.1(6) \times 10^{-5}$, which are in agreement with lattice QCD results for small values of $\mu_B$. For the first time we find a tiny but non-zero value of $\kappa_4$ in our study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the semileptonic decay of $\Omega_b\to\Omega_c~{\ell}\bar\nu_{\ell}$ in three lepton channels. To this end, we use QCD sum rule method in three point framework to calculate the form factors defining the matrix elements of these transitions. Having calculated the form factors as building blocks, we calculate the decay widths and branching fractions of the exclusive decays in all lepton channels and compare the results with other theoretical predictions. The obtained results for branching ratios and ratio of branching fractions at different leptonic channels may help experimental groups in their search for these weak decays. Comparison of the obtained results with possible future experimental data can be useful to check the order of consistency between the standard model theory predictions and data on the heavy baryon decays.</description>
