      <title>Zero Knowledge Proof for Multiple Sequence Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is a fundamental algorithm in bioinformatics. In a situation when the alignment might need to be protected while revealing the other information such the input sequences and the alignment score, zero knowledge proof can be used. In this paper, a validator checks the consistency between the input sequence and the alignment, and between the alignment and the alignment score. The validator is written in Circom language which will be compile into a circuit. Using a zero knowledge prove system called zkSNARK, a cryptographic proof is generates for the circuit and its input. This proof demonstrates that all inputs are consistent without revealing the actual alignment.</description>

      <title>Enhancing IoT Security: A Novel Feature Engineering Approach for ML-Based Intrusion Detection Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of Internet of Things (IoT) applications in our daily lives has led to a surge in data traffic, posing significant security challenges. IoT applications using cloud and edge computing are at higher risk of cyberattacks because of the expanded attack surface from distributed edge and cloud services, the vulnerability of IoT devices, and challenges in managing security across interconnected systems leading to oversights. This led to the rise of ML-based solutions for intrusion detection systems (IDSs), which have proven effective in enhancing network security and defending against diverse threats. However, ML-based IDS in IoT systems encounters challenges, particularly from noisy, redundant, and irrelevant features in varied IoT datasets, potentially impacting its performance. Therefore, reducing such features becomes crucial to enhance system performance and minimize computational costs. This paper focuses on improving the effectiveness of ML-based IDS at the edge level by introducing a novel method to find a balanced trade-off between cost and accuracy through the creation of informative features in a two-tier edge-user IoT environment. A hybrid Binary Quantum-inspired Artificial Bee Colony and Genetic Programming algorithm is utilized for this purpose. Three IoT intrusion detection datasets, namely NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and BoT-IoT, are used for the evaluation of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Characterising Payload Entropy in Packet Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and timely detection of cyber threats is critical to keeping our online economy and data safe. A key technique in early detection is the classification of unusual patterns of network behaviour, often hidden as low-frequency events within complex time-series packet flows. One of the ways in which such anomalies can be detected is to analyse the information entropy of the payload within individual packets, since changes in entropy can often indicate suspicious activity - such as whether session encryption has been compromised, or whether a plaintext channel has been co-opted as a covert channel. To decide whether activity is anomalous we need to compare real-time entropy values with baseline values, and while the analysis of entropy in packet data is not particularly new, to the best of our knowledge there are no published baselines for payload entropy across common network services. We offer two contributions: 1) We analyse several large packet datasets to establish baseline payload information entropy values for common network services, 2) We describe an efficient method for engineering entropy metrics when performing flow recovery from live or offline packet data, which can be expressed within feature subsets for subsequent analysis and machine learning applications.</description>

      <title>Logistic Map Pseudo Random Number Generator in FPGA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This project develops a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) using the logistic map, implemented in Verilog HDL on an FPGA and processes its output through a Central Limit Theorem (CLT) function to achieve a Gaussian distribution. The system integrates additional FPGA modules for real-time interaction and visualisation, including a clock generator, UART interface, XADC, and a 7-segment display driver. These components facilitate the direct display of PRNG values on the FPGA and the transmission of data to a laptop for histogram analysis, verifying the Gaussian nature of the output. This approach demonstrates the practical application of chaotic systems for generating Gaussian-distributed pseudo-random numbers in digital hardware, highlighting the logistic map's potential in PRNG design.</description>

      <title>Energy Cyber Attacks to Smart Healthcare Devices: A Testbed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) has garnered significant interest in both research and industry due to its profound impact on human life. The rapid expansion of IoT technology has ushered in smart healthcare, smart devices, smart cities, and smart grids. However, the security of IoT devices, particularly in healthcare, has become a major concern, with recent attacks revealing serious vulnerabilities. In IoT networks, where connected devices are susceptible to resource-constraint attacks, such as energy consumption attacks, security is paramount.
  This paper explores the impact of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) and Fake Access Points (F-APs) attacks on WiFi-enabled smart healthcare devices. Specifically, it investigates how these attacks can disrupt service on victim devices and Access Points (APs), focusing on device connectivity and energy consumption during attacks. Key findings include identifying the attack rates of DDoS attacks that disrupt services and quantifying the energy consumption impact of Energy Consumption Distributed Denial of Service (EC-DDoS) and F-APs attacks on smart healthcare devices.
  The study highlights communication protocols, attack rates, payload sizes, and port states of victim devices as critical factors influencing energy consumption. These insights provide a comprehensive understanding of IoT device vulnerabilities in smart healthcare environments and lay the groundwork for future defense strategies.</description>

      <title>Detection of Energy Consumption Cyber Attacks on Smart Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) technology, intelligent systems are increasingly integrating into everyday life and people's homes. However, the proliferation of these technologies raises concerns about the security of smart home devices. These devices often face resource constraints and may connect to unreliable networks, posing risks to the data they handle. Securing IoT technology is crucial due to the sensitive data involved.
  Preventing energy attacks and ensuring the security of IoT infrastructure are key challenges in modern smart homes. Monitoring energy consumption can be an effective approach to detecting abnormal behavior and IoT cyberattacks. Lightweight algorithms are necessary to accommodate the resource limitations of IoT devices.
  This paper presents a lightweight technique for detecting energy consumption attacks on smart home devices by analyzing received packets. The proposed algorithm considers TCP, UDP, and MQTT protocols, as well as device statuses (Idle, active, under attack). It accounts for resource constraints and promptly alerts administrators upon detecting an attack. The proposed approach effectively identifies energy consumption attacks by measuring packet reception rates for different protocols.</description>

      <title>Mitigating and Analysis of Memory Usage Attack in IoE System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Internet of Everything (IoE) is a newly emerging trend, especially in homes. Marketing forces toward smart homes are also accelerating the spread of IoE devices in households. An obvious risk of the rapid adoption of these smart devices is that many lack controls for protecting the privacy and security of end users from attacks designed to disrupt lives and incur financial losses. Today the smart home is a system for managing the basic life support processes of both small systems, e.g., commercial, office premises, apartments, cottages, and largely automated complexes, e.g., commercial and industrial complexes. One of the critical tasks to be solved by the concept of a modern smart home is the problem of preventing the usage of IoE resources. Recently, there has been a rapid increase in attacks on consumer IoE devices.
  Memory corruption vulnerabilities constitute a significant class of vulnerabilities in software security through which attackers can gain control of an entire system. Numerous memory corruption vulnerabilities have been found in IoE firmware already deployed in the consumer market. This paper aims to analyze and explain the resource usage attack and create a low-cost simulation environment to aid in the dynamic analysis of the attack. Further, we perform controlled resource usage attacks while measuring resource consumption on resource-constrained victims' IoE devices, such as CPU and memory utilization. We also build a lightweight algorithm to detect memory usage attacks in the IoE environment. The result shows high efficiency in detecting and mitigating memory usage attacks by detecting when the intruder starts and stops the attack.</description>

      <title>Assessing LLMs in Malicious Code Deobfuscation of Real-world Malware Campaigns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into various pipelines is increasingly widespread, effectively automating many manual tasks and often surpassing human capabilities. Cybersecurity researchers and practitioners have recognised this potential. Thus, they are actively exploring its applications, given the vast volume of heterogeneous data that requires processing to identify anomalies, potential bypasses, attacks, and fraudulent incidents. On top of this, LLMs' advanced capabilities in generating functional code, comprehending code context, and summarising its operations can also be leveraged for reverse engineering and malware deobfuscation. To this end, we delve into the deobfuscation capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs. Beyond merely discussing a hypothetical scenario, we evaluate four LLMs with real-world malicious scripts used in the notorious Emotet malware campaign. Our results indicate that while not absolutely accurate yet, some LLMs can efficiently deobfuscate such payloads. Thus, fine-tuning LLMs for this task can be a viable potential for future AI-powered threat intelligence pipelines in the fight against obfuscated malware.</description>

      <title>PrivComp-KG : Leveraging Knowledge Graph and Large Language Models for Privacy Policy Compliance Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data protection and privacy is becoming increasingly crucial in the digital era. Numerous companies depend on third-party vendors and service providers to carry out critical functions within their operations, encompassing tasks such as data handling and storage. However, this reliance introduces potential vulnerabilities, as these vendors' security measures and practices may not always align with the standards expected by regulatory bodies. Businesses are required, often under the penalty of law, to ensure compliance with the evolving regulatory rules. Interpreting and implementing these regulations pose challenges due to their complexity. Regulatory documents are extensive, demanding significant effort for interpretation, while vendor-drafted privacy policies often lack the detail required for full legal compliance, leading to ambiguity. To ensure a concise interpretation of the regulatory requirements and compliance of organizational privacy policy with said regulations, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM) and Semantic Web based approach for privacy compliance. In this paper, we develop the novel Privacy Policy Compliance Verification Knowledge Graph, PrivComp-KG. It is designed to efficiently store and retrieve comprehensive information concerning privacy policies, regulatory frameworks, and domain-specific knowledge pertaining to the legal landscape of privacy. Using Retrieval Augmented Generation, we identify the relevant sections in a privacy policy with corresponding regulatory rules. This information about individual privacy policies is populated into the PrivComp-KG. Combining this with the domain context and rules, the PrivComp-KG can be queried to check for compliance with privacy policies by each vendor against relevant policy regulations. We demonstrate the relevance of the PrivComp-KG, by verifying compliance of privacy policy documents for various organizations.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Binary Code Translation with Application to Code Similarity Detection and Vulnerability Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary code analysis has immense importance in the research domain of software security. Today, software is very often compiled for various Instruction Set Architectures (ISAs). As a result, cross-architecture binary code analysis has become an emerging problem. Recently, deep learning-based binary analysis has shown promising success. It is widely known that training a deep learning model requires a massive amount of data. However, for some low-resource ISAs, an adequate amount of data is hard to find, preventing deep learning from being widely adopted for binary analysis. To overcome the data scarcity problem and facilitate cross-architecture binary code analysis, we propose to apply the ideas and techniques in Neural Machine Translation (NMT) to binary code analysis. Our insight is that a binary, after disassembly, is represented in some assembly language. Given a binary in a low-resource ISA, we translate it to a binary in a high-resource ISA (e.g., x86). Then we can use a model that has been trained on the high-resource ISA to test the translated binary. We have implemented the model called UNSUPERBINTRANS, and conducted experiments to evaluate its performance. Specifically, we conducted two downstream tasks, including code similarity detection and vulnerability discovery. In both tasks, we achieved high accuracies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On July 5, 2022, the National Institute of Standards and Technology announced four possible post-quantum cryptography standards, three of them are based on lattice theory and the other one is based on Hash function. It is well-known that the security of the lattice cryptography relies on the hardness of the shortest vector problem (SVP) and the closest vector problem (CVP). In fact, the SVP is a sphere packing problem and the CVP is a sphere covering problem. Furthermore, both SVP and CVP are equivalent to arithmetic problems of positive definite quadratic forms. This paper will briefly introduce the post-quantum cryptography and show its connections with sphere packing, sphere covering, and positive definite quadratic forms.</description>

      <title>Espresso: Robust Concept Filtering in Text-to-Image Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models generate high-fidelity images for given textual prompts. They are trained on large datasets scraped from the Internet, potentially containing unacceptable concepts (e.g., copyright infringing or unsafe). Retraining T2I models after filtering out unacceptable concepts in the training data is inefficient and degrades utility. Hence, there is a need for concept removal techniques (CRTs) which are effective in removing unacceptable concepts, utility-preserving on acceptable concepts, and robust against evasion with adversarial prompts. None of the prior filtering and fine-tuning CRTs satisfy all these requirements simultaneously.
  We introduce Espresso, the first robust concept filter based on Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP). It identifies unacceptable concepts by projecting the generated image's embedding onto the vector connecting unacceptable and acceptable concepts in the joint text-image embedding space. This ensures robustness by restricting the adversary to adding noise only along this vector, in the direction of the acceptable concept. Further fine-tuning Espresso to separate embeddings of acceptable and unacceptable concepts, while preserving their pairing with image embeddings, ensures both effectiveness and utility. We evaluate Espresso on eleven concepts to show that it is effective (~5% CLIP accuracy on unacceptable concepts), utility-preserving (~93% normalized CLIP score on acceptable concepts), and robust (~4% CLIP accuracy on adversarial prompts for unacceptable concepts). Finally, we present theoretical bounds for the certified robustness of Espresso against adversarial prompts, and an empirical analysis.</description>

      <title>Enhancing GUI Exploration Coverage of Android Apps with Deep Link-Integrated Monkey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mobile apps are ubiquitous in our daily lives for supporting different tasks such as reading and chatting. Despite the availability of many GUI testing tools, app testers still struggle with low testing code coverage due to tools frequently getting stuck in loops or overlooking activities with concealed entries. This results in a significant amount of testing time being spent on redundant and repetitive exploration of a few GUI pages. To address this, we utilize Android's deep links, which assist in triggering Android intents to lead users to specific pages and introduce a deep link-enhanced exploration method. This approach, integrated into the testing tool Monkey, gives rise to Delm (Deep Link-enhanced Monkey). Delm oversees the dynamic exploration process, guiding the tool out of meaningless testing loops to unexplored GUI pages. We provide a rigorous activity context mock-up approach for triggering existing Android intents to discover more activities with hidden entrances. We conduct experiments to evaluate Delm's effectiveness on activity context mock-up, activity coverage, method coverage, and crash detection. The findings reveal that Delm can mock up more complex activity contexts and significantly outperform state-of-the-art baselines with 27.2\% activity coverage, 21.13\% method coverage, and 23.81\% crash detection.</description>

      <title>Let's Focus: Focused Backdoor Attack against Federated Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Transfer Learning (FTL) is the most general variation of Federated Learning. According to this distributed paradigm, a feature learning pre-step is commonly carried out by only one party, typically the server, on publicly shared data. After that, the Federated Learning phase takes place to train a classifier collaboratively using the learned feature extractor. Each involved client contributes by locally training only the classification layers on a private training set. The peculiarity of an FTL scenario makes it hard to understand whether poisoning attacks can be developed to craft an effective backdoor. State-of-the-art attack strategies assume the possibility of shifting the model attention toward relevant features introduced by a forged trigger injected in the input data by some untrusted clients. Of course, this is not feasible in FTL, as the learned features are fixed once the server performs the pre-training step. Consequently, in this paper, we investigate this intriguing Federated Learning scenario to identify and exploit a vulnerability obtained by combining eXplainable AI (XAI) and dataset distillation. In particular, the proposed attack can be carried out by one of the clients during the Federated Learning phase of FTL by identifying the optimal local for the trigger through XAI and encapsulating compressed information of the backdoor class. Due to its behavior, we refer to our approach as a focused backdoor approach (FB-FTL for short) and test its performance by explicitly referencing an image classification scenario. With an average 80% attack success rate, obtained results show the effectiveness of our attack also against existing defenses for Federated Learning.</description>

      <title>AttackBench: Evaluating Gradient-based Attacks for Adversarial Examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adversarial examples are typically optimized with gradient-based attacks. While novel attacks are continuously proposed, each is shown to outperform its predecessors using different experimental setups, hyperparameter settings, and number of forward and backward calls to the target models. This provides overly-optimistic and even biased evaluations that may unfairly favor one particular attack over the others. In this work, we aim to overcome these limitations by proposing AttackBench, i.e., the first evaluation framework that enables a fair comparison among different attacks. To this end, we first propose a categorization of gradient-based attacks, identifying their main components and differences. We then introduce our framework, which evaluates their effectiveness and efficiency. We measure these characteristics by (i) defining an optimality metric that quantifies how close an attack is to the optimal solution, and (ii) limiting the number of forward and backward queries to the model, such that all attacks are compared within a given maximum query budget. Our extensive experimental analysis compares more than 100 attack implementations with a total of over 800 different configurations against CIFAR-10 and ImageNet models, highlighting that only very few attacks outperform all the competing approaches. Within this analysis, we shed light on several implementation issues that prevent many attacks from finding better solutions or running at all. We release AttackBench as a publicly available benchmark, aiming to continuously update it to include and evaluate novel gradient-based attacks for optimizing adversarial examples.</description>

      <title>An Extensive Survey of Digital Image Steganography: State of the Art</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The need to protect sensitive information privacy duringinformation exchange over the internet/intranet has led towider adoption of cryptography and steganography. The cryptography approaches convert the information into an unreadable format however draws the attention of cryptanalyst owing to the uncommon random nature flow of the bytes when viewing the flowing structured bytes on a computer. While steganography, in contrast, conceals the very existence of covert communication using digital media. Although any digital media (text, image, video, audio) can covey the sensitive information, the media with higher redundant bits are more favorable for embedding the sensitive information without distorting the media. Digital images are majorly used in conveying sensitive information compared to others owing to their higher rate of tolerating distortions, highly available, smaller sizes with high redundant bits. However, the need for maximizing the redundancy bits for the optimum embedding of secret information has been a paramount issue due to the imperceptibility prerequisite which deteriorates with an increase in payload thus, resulting in a tradeoff. This has limited steganography to only applications with lower payload requirements, thus limiting the adoption for wider deployment. This paper critically analyzes the current steganographic techniques, recent trends, and challenges.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Label Information for Stealthy Data Stealing in Vertical Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop DMAVFL, a novel attack strategy that evades current detection mechanisms. The key idea is to integrate a discriminator with auxiliary classifier that takes a full advantage of the label information (which was completely ignored in previous attacks): on one hand, label information helps to better characterize embeddings of samples from distinct classes, yielding an improved reconstruction performance; on the other hand, computing malicious gradients with label information better mimics the honest training, making the malicious gradients indistinguishable from the honest ones, and the attack much more stealthy. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that DMAVFL significantly outperforms existing attacks, and successfully circumvents SOTA defenses for malicious attacks. Additional ablation studies and evaluations on other defenses further underscore the robustness and effectiveness of DMAVFL.</description>

      <title>Transferring Troubles: Cross-Lingual Transferability of Backdoor Attacks in LLMs with Instruction Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The implications of backdoor attacks on English-centric large language models (LLMs) have been widely examined - such attacks can be achieved by embedding malicious behaviors during training and activated under specific conditions that trigger malicious outputs. However, the impact of backdoor attacks on multilingual models remains under-explored. Our research focuses on cross-lingual backdoor attacks against multilingual LLMs, particularly investigating how poisoning the instruction-tuning data in one or two languages can affect the outputs in languages whose instruction-tuning data was not poisoned. Despite its simplicity, our empirical analysis reveals that our method exhibits remarkable efficacy in models like mT5, BLOOM, and GPT-3.5-turbo, with high attack success rates, surpassing 95% in several languages across various scenarios. Alarmingly, our findings also indicate that larger models show increased susceptibility to transferable cross-lingual backdoor attacks, which also applies to LLMs predominantly pre-trained on English data, such as Llama2, Llama3, and Gemma. Moreover, our experiments show that triggers can still work even after paraphrasing, and the backdoor mechanism proves highly effective in cross-lingual response settings across 25 languages, achieving an average attack success rate of 50%. Our study aims to highlight the vulnerabilities and significant security risks present in current multilingual LLMs, underscoring the emergent need for targeted security measures.</description>

      <title>On Training a Neural Network to Explain Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we begin to investigate the possibility of training a deep neural network on the task of binary code understanding. Specifically, the network would take, as input, features derived directly from binaries and output English descriptions of functionality to aid a reverse engineer in investigating the capabilities of a piece of closed-source software, be it malicious or benign. Given recent success in applying large language models (generative AI) to the task of source code summarization, this seems a promising direction. However, in our initial survey of the available datasets, we found nothing of sufficiently high quality and volume to train these complex models. Instead, we build our own dataset derived from a capture of Stack Overflow containing 1.1M entries. A major result of our work is a novel dataset evaluation method using the correlation between two distances on sample pairs: one distance in the embedding space of inputs and the other in the embedding space of outputs. Intuitively, if two samples have inputs close in the input embedding space, their outputs should also be close in the output embedding space. We found this Embedding Distance Correlation (EDC) test to be highly diagnostic, indicating that our collected dataset and several existing open-source datasets are of low quality as the distances are not well correlated. We proceed to explore the general applicability of EDC, applying it to a number of qualitatively known good datasets and a number of synthetically known bad ones and found it to be a reliable indicator of dataset value.</description>

      <title>Succinct arguments for QMA from standard assumptions via compiled nonlocal games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a succinct classical argument system for QMA, the quantum analogue of NP, from generic and standard cryptographic assumptions. Previously, building on the prior work of Mahadev (FOCS '18), Bartusek et al. (CRYPTO '22) also constructed a succinct classical argument system for QMA. However, their construction relied on post-quantumly secure indistinguishability obfuscation, a very strong primitive which is not known from standard cryptographic assumptions. In contrast, the primitives we use (namely, collapsing hash functions and a mild version of quantum homomorphic encryption) are much weaker and are implied by standard assumptions such as LWE. Our protocol is constructed using a general transformation which was designed by Kalai et al. (STOC '23) as a candidate method to compile any quantum nonlocal game into an argument system. Our main technical contribution is to analyze the soundness of this transformation when it is applied to a succinct self-test for Pauli measurements on maximally entangled states, the latter of which is a key component in the proof of MIP*=RE in quantum complexity.</description>

      <title>Tight Differential Privacy Guarantees for the Shuffle Model with $k$-Randomized Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.08858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most differentially private (DP) algorithms assume a central model in which a reliable third party inserts noise to queries made on datasets, or a local model where the users locally perturb their data. However, the central model is vulnerable via a single point of failure, and in the local model, the utility of the data deteriorates significantly. The recently proposed shuffle model is an intermediate framework between the central and the local paradigms where the users send their locally privatized data to a server where messages are shuffled, effacing the link between a privatized message and the corresponding user, giving a better trade-off between privacy and utility than the local model, as its privacy gets amplified without adding more noise. In this paper, we theoretically derive the strictest known bound for DP guarantee for the shuffle models with $k$-Randomized Response local randomizers. There on, we focus on the utility of the shuffle model for histogram queries. Leveraging on the matrix inversion method, which is used to approximate the original distribution from the empirical one produced by the $k$-RR mechanism, we de-noise the histogram produced by the shuffle model to evaluate the total variation distance of the resulting histogram from the true one, which we regard as the measure of utility of the privacy mechanism. We perform experiments on both synthetic and real data to compare the privacy-utility trade-off of the shuffle model with that of the central one privatized by adding the state-of-the-art Gaussian noise to each bin. Although the experimental results stay consistent with the literature that favour the central model, we see that, the difference in statistical utilities between the central and the shuffle models is very small, showing that they are almost comparable under the same level of DP.</description>

      <title>Generic Selfish Mining MDP for DAG Protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Selfish Mining is strategic rule-breaking to maximize rewards in proof-of-work protocols [3] and Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) are the preferred tool for finding optimal strategies in Bitcoin [4, 10] and similar linear chain protocols [12]. Protocols increasingly adopt non-sequential chain structures [11], for which MDP analysis is more involved [2]. To date, researchers have tailored specific attack spaces for each protocol [2, 4, 5, 7, 10, 12]. Assumptions differ, and validating and comparing results is difficult. To overcome this, we propose a generic attack space that supports a wide range of DAG protocols, including Ethereum, Fruitchains, and Parallel Proof-of-Work. Our approach is modular: we specify each protocol as one program, and then derive the Selfish Mining MDPs automatically.</description>

      <title>Secure Information Embedding and Extraction in Forensic 3D Fingerprinting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The prevalence of 3D printing poses a significant risk to public safety, as any individual with internet access and a commodity printer is able to produce untraceable firearms, keys, counterfeit products, etc. To aid government authorities in combating these new security threats, several approaches have been taken to tag 3D-prints with identifying information. Known as fingerprints, this information is written into the object using various bit embedding techniques; examples include varying the height of the molten thermoplastic layers, and depositing metallic powder with different magnetic properties. Yet, the practicality of theses techniques in real-world forensic settings is hindered by the adversarial nature of this problem. That is, the 3D-printing process is out of reach of any law enforcement agencies; it is the adversary who controls all aspects of printing and possesses the printed object. To combat these threats, law enforcement agencies can regulate the manufacturing of 3D printers, on which they may enforce a fingerprinting scheme, and collect adversarially tampered remains (e.g., fragments of a broken 3D-printed firearm) during forensic investigation. Therefore, it is important to devise fingerprinting techniques so that the fingerprint could be extracted even if printing is carried out by the adversary. To this end, we present SIDE (Secure Information Embedding and Extraction), a fingerprinting framework that tackles the adversarial nature of forensic fingerprinting in 3D prints by offering both secure information embedding and secure information extraction.</description>

      <title>Proof-of-Learning with Incentive Security</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09005v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most concurrent blockchain systems rely heavily on the Proof-of-Work (PoW) or Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanisms for decentralized consensus and security assurance. However, the substantial energy expenditure stemming from computationally intensive yet meaningless tasks has raised considerable concerns surrounding traditional PoW approaches, The PoS mechanism, while free of energy consumption, is subject to security and economic issues. Addressing these issues, the paradigm of Proof-of-Useful-Work (PoUW) seeks to employ challenges of practical significance as PoW, thereby imbuing energy consumption with tangible value. While previous efforts in Proof of Learning (PoL) explored the utilization of deep learning model training SGD tasks as PoUW challenges, recent research has revealed its vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks and the theoretical hardness in crafting a byzantine-secure PoL mechanism. In this paper, we introduce the concept of incentive-security that incentivizes rational provers to behave honestly for their best interest, bypassing the existing hardness to design a PoL mechanism with computational efficiency, a provable incentive-security guarantee and controllable difficulty. Particularly, our work is secure against two attacks to the recent work of Jia et al. [2021], and also improves the computational overhead from $\Theta(1)$ to $O(\frac{\log E}{E})$. Furthermore, while most recent research assumes trusted problem providers and verifiers, our design also guarantees frontend incentive-security even when problem providers are untrusted, and verifier incentive-security that bypasses the Verifier's Dilemma. By incorporating ML training into blockchain consensus mechanisms with provable guarantees, our research not only proposes an eco-friendly solution to blockchain systems, but also provides a proposal for a completely decentralized computing power market in the new AI age.</description>

      <title>Shining Light into the Tunnel: Understanding and Classifying Network Traffic of Residential Proxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emerging in recent years, residential proxies (RESIPs) feature multiple unique characteristics when compared with traditional network proxies (e.g., commercial VPNs), particularly, the deployment in residential networks rather than data center networks, the worldwide distribution in tens of thousands of cities and ISPs, and the large scale of millions of exit nodes. All these factors allow RESIP users to effectively masquerade their traffic flows as ones from authentic residential users, which leads to the increasing adoption of RESIP services, especially in malicious online activities. However, regarding the (malicious) usage of RESIPs (i.e., what traffic is relayed by RESIPs), current understanding turns out to be insufficient. Particularly, previous works on RESIP traffic studied only the maliciousness of web traffic destinations and the suspicious patterns of visiting popular websites. Also, a general methodology is missing regarding capturing large-scale RESIP traffic and analyzing RESIP traffic for security risks. Furthermore, considering many RESIP nodes are found to be located in corporate networks and are deployed without proper authorization from device owners or network administrators, it is becoming increasingly necessary to detect and block RESIP traffic flows, which unfortunately is impeded by the scarcity of realistic RESIP traffic datasets and effective detection methodologies.
  To fill in these gaps, multiple novel tools have been designed and implemented in this study, which include a general framework to deploy RESIP nodes and collect RESIP traffic in a distributed manner, a RESIP traffic analyzer to efficiently process RESIP traffic logs and surface out suspicious traffic flows, and multiple machine learning based RESIP traffic classifiers to timely and accurately detect whether a given traffic flow is RESIP traffic or not.</description>

      <title>On TinyML and Cybersecurity: Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure Use Case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As technology advances, the use of Machine Learning (ML) in cybersecurity is becoming increasingly crucial to tackle the growing complexity of cyber threats. While traditional ML models can enhance cybersecurity, their high energy and resource demands limit their applications, leading to the emergence of Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) as a more suitable solution for resource-constrained environments. TinyML is widely applied in areas such as smart homes, healthcare, and industrial automation. TinyML focuses on optimizing ML algorithms for small, low-power devices, enabling intelligent data processing directly on edge devices. This paper provides a comprehensive review of common challenges of TinyML techniques, such as power consumption, limited memory, and computational constraints; it also explores potential solutions to these challenges, such as energy harvesting, computational optimization techniques, and transfer learning for privacy preservation. On the other hand, this paper discusses TinyML's applications in advancing cybersecurity for Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructures (EVCIs) as a representative use case. It presents an experimental case study that enhances cybersecurity in EVCI using TinyML, evaluated against traditional ML in terms of reduced delay and memory usage, with a slight trade-off in accuracy. Additionally, the study includes a practical setup using the ESP32 microcontroller in the PlatformIO environment, which provides a hands-on assessment of TinyML's application in cybersecurity for EVCI.</description>

      <title>Causal Inference with Differentially Private (Clustered) Outcomes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating causal effects from randomized experiments is only feasible if participants agree to reveal their potentially sensitive responses. Of the many ways of ensuring privacy, label differential privacy is a widely used measure of an algorithm's privacy guarantee, which might encourage participants to share responses without running the risk of de-anonymization. Many differentially private mechanisms inject noise into the original data-set to achieve this privacy guarantee, which increases the variance of most statistical estimators and makes the precise measurement of causal effects difficult: there exists a fundamental privacy-variance trade-off to performing causal analyses from differentially private data. With the aim of achieving lower variance for stronger privacy guarantees, we suggest a new differential privacy mechanism, Cluster-DP, which leverages any given cluster structure of the data while still allowing for the estimation of causal effects. We show that, depending on an intuitive measure of cluster quality, we can improve the variance loss while maintaining our privacy guarantees. We compare its performance, theoretically and empirically, to that of its unclustered version and a more extreme uniform-prior version which does not use any of the original response distribution, both of which are special cases of the Cluster-DP algorithm.</description>

      <title>Mysticeti: Reaching the Limits of Latency with Uncertified DAGs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14821v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Mysticeti-C the first DAG-based Byzantine consensus protocol to achieve the lower bounds of latency of 3 message rounds. Since Mysticeti-C is built over DAGs it also achieves high resource efficiency and censorship resistance. Mysticeti-C achieves this latency improvement by avoiding explicit certification of the DAG blocks and by proposing a novel commit rule such that every block can be committed without delays, resulting in optimal latency in the steady state and under crash failures. We further extend Mysticeti-C to Mysticeti-FPC, which incorporates a fast commit path that achieves even lower latency for transferring assets. Unlike prior fast commit path protocols, Mysticeti-FPC minimizes the number of signatures and messages by weaving the fast path transactions into the DAG. This frees up resources, which subsequently result in better performance. We prove the safety and liveness of the protocols in a Byzantine context. We evaluate Mysticeti and compare it with state-of-the-art consensus and fast path protocols to demonstrate its low latency and resource efficiency, as well as its more graceful degradation under crash failures. Mysticeti is the first Byzantine consensus protocol to achieve WAN latency of 0.5s for consensus commit while simultaneously maintaining state-of-the-art throughput of over 100k TPS. Finally, we report on integrating Mysticeti-C as the consensus protocol into a major blockchain, resulting in 4x latency reduction.</description>
