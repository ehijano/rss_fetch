      <title>Strongly Nonlinear Wave Propagation in Elasto-plastic Metamaterials: Low-order Dynamic Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear elastic metamaterials are known to support a variety of dynamic phenomena that enhance our capacity to manipulate elastic waves. Since these properties stem from complex, subwavelength geometry, full-scale dynamic simulations are often prohibitively expensive at scales of interest. Prior studies have therefore utilized low-order effective medium models, such as discrete mass-spring lattices, to capture essential properties in the long-wavelength limit. While models of this type have been successfully implemented for a wide variety of nonlinear elastic systems, they have predominantly considered dynamics depending only on the instantaneous kinematics of the lattice, neglecting history-dependent effects, such as wear and plasticity. To address this limitation, the present study develops a lattice-based modeling framework for nonlinear elastic metamaterials undergoing plastic deformation. Due to the history- and rate-dependent nature of plasticity, the framework generally yields a system of differential-algebraic equations whose computational cost is significantly greater than an elastic system of comparable size. We demonstrate the method using several models inspired by classical lattice dynamics and continuum plasticity theory, and explore means to obtain empirical plasticity models for general geometries.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Radiation Hardness of InAs/GaAs Quantum Dot Lasers for Space Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiconductor lasers have great potential for space laser communication. However, excessive radiation in space can cause laser failure. Quantum dot (QD) lasers are more resistant to radiation compared to quantum well (QW) and bulk lasers due to better carrier confinement and a smaller active region. Therefore, it is crucial to find the most radiation-tolerant QD structures and compare the radiation tolerance of QD and QW structures at different radiation fluences where the QDs can show their advantages in the best way. Proton and 60Co {\gamma}-ray radiation tests were conducted on different InAs/GaAs QD and InGaAs/GaAs QW materials and devices. The results show that the QD samples were more radiation-tolerant than QW samples within a certain fluence range, and more radiation-tolerant QD structures were identified. Dislocations were found near the QWs but not the QDs after 1 x 1011 cm-2 radiation. Defects were created in all samples after 7 x 1013 cm-2 proton radiation. Additionally, 60Co {\gamma}-rays radiation tests ranging from 10 to 12000 Gy were conducted, and all the samples exhibited good tolerance to total radiation dose effects.</description>

      <title>Non-Uniqueness of Metasurfaces for Wave Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a large family of tensorial metasurfaces can be found that perform an identical wave transformation, showing that even when the conditions of reciprocity and passivity are imposed, there still remain many solutions to the design problem. As an example, we explore the case of a metasurface that rotates a single input polarization, showing we can parameterize the set of equivalent reciprocal metasurfaces in terms of a single complex parameter. Through allowing dissipation and gain within the response, the surface can have many different functionalities in the orthogonal polarization, opening up a new route for the design of multiplexed metasurfaces.</description>

      <title>Deterministic photonic entanglement arising from non-Abelian quantum holonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Realizing deterministic, high-fidelity entangling interactions--of the kind that can be utilized for efficient quantum information processing--between photons remains an elusive goal. Here, we address this long-standing issue by devising a protocol for creating and manipulating highly-entangled superpositions of well-controlled states of light by using an on-chip photonic system that has recently been shown to implement three-dimensional, non-Abelian quantum holonomy. Our calculations indicate that a subset of such entangled superpositions are maximally-entangled, volume-law states, and that the underlying entanglement can be distilled and purified for applications in quantum science. Specifically, we envisage that this entangling mechanism could be utilized for realizing two-qubit, universal, entangling quantum gates with linear photonic elements alone. Furthermore, this method should also--at least, in principle--be generalizable to systems of neutral atoms.</description>

      <title>Navigation-grade interferometric air-core antiresonant fibre optic gyroscope with enhanced thermal stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a groundbreaking navigation-grade interferometric air-core fibre optic gyroscope (IFOG) using a quadrupolar-wound coil of four-tube truncated double nested antiresonant nodeless fibre (tDNANF). This state-of-the-art tDNANF simultaneously achieves low loss, low bend loss, single-spatial-mode operation, and exceptional linear polarization purity over a broad wavelength range. Our 469 m tDNANF coil demonstrated a polarization extinction ratio (PER) of ~20 dB when illuminated by an amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) source spanning 1525-1565 nm. Under these conditions, the gyro archives an angular random walk (ARW) of 0.0038 deg h-1/2 and a bias-stability (BS) drift over 8500 s of 0.0014 deg h-1, marking the first instance of navigation-grade performance in air-core FOGs. Additionally, we validated the low thermal sensitivity of air-core FOGs, with reductions of 9.24/10.68/6.82 compared to that of conventional polarization-maintaining solid-core FOGs of the same size across various temperature ranges. These results represent a significant step towards long-standing promise of high-precision inertial navigation applications with superior environmental adaptability.</description>

      <title>Non-linear inhibitory responses enhance performance in collective decision-making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The precise modulation of activity through inhibitory signals ensures that both insect colonies and neural circuits operate efficiently and adaptively, highlighting the fundamental importance of inhibition in biological systems. Modulatory signals are produced in various contexts and are known for subtly shifting the probability of receiver behaviors based on response thresholds. Here we propose a non-linear function to introduce inhibitory responsiveness in collective decision-making inspired by honeybee house-hunting. We show that, compared with usual linear functions, non-linear responses enhance final consensus and reduce deliberation time. This improvement comes at the cost of reduced accuracy in identifying the best option. Nonetheless, for value-based tasks, the benefits of faster consensus and enhanced decision-making might outweigh this drawback.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Interlocking in Granular Jamming Grippers through Hard and Soft Particle Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of particle stiffness on the grasping performance of granular grippers, a class of soft robotic effectors that utilize granular jamming for object manipulation. Through experimental analyses and X-ray imaging, we show that grippers with soft particles exhibit improved wrapping of the object after jamming, in contrast to grippers with rigid particles. This results in significantly increased holding force through the interlocking. The addition of a small proportion of rigid particles into a predominantly soft particle mixture maintains the improved wrapping but also significantly increases the maximum holding force. These results suggest a tunable approach to optimizing the design of granular grippers for improved performance in soft robotics applications.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Interface Printing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Additive manufacturing is an expanding multidisciplinary field encompassing applications including medical devices, aerospace components, microfabrication strategies, and artificial organs. Among additive manufacturing approaches, light-based printing technologies, including two-photon polymerization, projection micro stereolithography, and volumetric printing, have garnered significant attention due to their speed, resolution and/or potential applications for biofabrication. In this study, we introduce dynamic interface printing (DIP), a new 3D printing approach that leverages an acoustically modulated, constrained air-liquid boundary to rapidly generate cm-scale three-dimensional structures within tens of seconds. Distinct from volumetric approaches, this process eliminates the need for intricate feedback systems, specialized chemistry, or complex optics while maintaining rapid printing speeds. We demonstrate the versatility of this technique across a broad array of materials and intricate geometries, including those that would be impossible to print via conventional layer-by-layer methods. In doing so, we demonstrate the rapid fabrication of complex structures in-situ, overprinting, structural parallelisation, and biofabrication utility. Moreover, we showcase that the formation of surface waves at this boundary enables enhanced mass transport, material flexibility, and permits three-dimensional particle patterning. We therefore anticipate that this approach will be invaluable for applications where high resolution, scalable throughput, and biocompatible printing is required.</description>

      <title>A parametrically programmable delay line for microwave photons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04724v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Delay lines that store quantum information are crucial for advancing quantum repeaters and hardware efficient quantum computers. Traditionally, they are realized as extended systems that support wave propagation but provide limited control over the propagating fields. Here, we introduce a parametrically addressed delay line for microwave photons that provides a high level of control over the stored pulses. By parametrically driving a three-wave mixing circuit element that is weakly hybridized with an ensemble of resonators, we engineer a spectral response that simulates that of a physical delay line, while providing fast control over the delay line's properties. We demonstrate this novel degree of control by choosing which photon echo to emit, translating pulses in time, and even swapping two pulses, all with pulse energies on the order of a single photon. We also measure the noise added from our parametric interactions and find it is much less than one photon.</description>

      <title>Unified Framework for Laser-induced Transient Bubble Dynamics within Microchannels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07105v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Oscillatory flow in confined spaces is central to understanding physiological flows and rational design of synthetic periodic-actuation based micromachines. Using theory and experiments on oscillating flows generated through a laser-induced cavitation bubble, we associate the dynamic bubble size (fluid velocity) and bubble lifetime to the laser energy supplied - a control parameter in experiments. Employing different channel cross-section shapes, sizes and lengths, we demonstrate the characteristic scales for velocity, time and energy to depend solely on the channel geometry. Contrary to the generally assumed absence of instability in low Reynolds number flows (&lt;1000), we report a momentary flow distortion that originates due to the boundary layer separation near channel walls during flow deceleration. The emergence of distorted laminar states is characterized using two stages. First the conditions for the onset of instabilities is analyzed using the Reynolds number and Womersley number for oscillating flows. Second the growth and the ability of an instability to prevail is analyzed using the convective time scale of the flow. Our findings inform rational design of microsystems leveraging pulsatile flows via cavitation-powered microactuation.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable collective resonances induced by liquid crystals in dielectric metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17788v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dielectric metasurfaces can show multi-resonant response with high Q-factors in the visible range due to multipole coupling. This work suggests that these collective resonances in all-dielectric metasurfaces can be modified if adjacent to an anisotropic liquid crystal medium, opening a new path toward the dynamic metasurface effects. Using numerical full-wave simulations and the multipole decomposition technique for reflection and transmission coefficients we study the influence of the surrounding anisotropic medium on the resonant response of metasurfaces composed of disk-shaped dielectric nanoparticles. First, we consider tuning and switching the resonances induced by the polarization of the incident beam in metasurfaces placed in a medium with different orientations of LC molecules. Secondly, we study the case when the tuning of resonances is carried out by applying an external voltage that changes the orientation of LC molecules and thereby changes the refractive index of the surrounding medium. The results obtained demonstrate the possibility of directly tuning the resonant response of dielectric metasurfaces in an anisotropic environment, which is important for the development of optical nanodevices with dynamic switching of functional modes in the visible range.</description>
