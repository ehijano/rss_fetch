      <title>Excitation of Looped Bistable Bands for High-Speed Linear Actuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft robotics increasingly relies on smart materials and innovative structures, with bistable tape springs emerging as a promising option. These structures exhibit intriguing dynamic behaviors, such as oscillation, due to their inherent bistability. This paper explores the high-speed linear amplification of motion achieved through the excitation of a looped bistable tape spring. When looped, the tape spring forms two distinct joints, facilitating smooth oscillation. Mounted on a linear guide and driven by a crank mechanism with varying frequency, the system converts input oscillations into amplified linear motion at resonance. This study highlights the potential of bistable tape springs high speed reciprocating linear motion.</description>

      <title>IMAS$^2$: Joint Agent Selection and Information-Theoretic Coordinated Perception In Dec-POMDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of jointly selecting sensing agents and synthesizing decentralized active perception policies for the chosen subset of agents within a Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (Dec-POMDP) framework. Our approach employs a two-layer optimization structure. In the inner layer, we introduce information-theoretic metrics, defined by the mutual information between the unknown trajectories or some hidden property in the environment and the collective partial observations in the multi-agent system, as a unified objective for active perception problems. We employ various optimization methods to obtain optimal sensor policies that maximize mutual information for distinct active perception tasks. In the outer layer, we prove that under certain conditions, the information-theoretic objectives are monotone and submodular with respect to the subset of observations collected from multiple agents. We then exploit this property to design an IMAS$^2$ (Information-theoretic Multi-Agent Selection and Sensing) algorithm for joint sensing agent selection and sensing policy synthesis. However, since the policy search space is infinite, we adapt the classical Nemhauser-Wolsey argument to prove that the proposed IMAS$^2$ algorithm can provide a tight $(1 - 1/e)$-guarantee on the performance. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a multi-agent cooperative perception in a grid-world environment.</description>

      <title>Approximate Model Predictive Control for Microgrid Energy Management via Imitation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient energy management is essential for reliable and sustainable microgrid operation amid increasing renewable integration. This paper proposes an imitation learning-based framework to approximate mixed-integer Economic Model Predictive Control (EMPC) for microgrid energy management. The proposed method trains a neural network to imitate expert EMPC control actions from offline trajectories, enabling fast, real-time decision making without solving optimization problems online. To enhance robustness and generalization, the learning process includes noise injection during training to mitigate distribution shift and explicitly incorporates forecast uncertainty in renewable generation and demand. Simulation results demonstrate that the learned policy achieves economic performance comparable to EMPC while only requiring $10\%$ of the computation time of optimization-based EMPC in practice.</description>

      <title>Safe Output-Feedback Adaptive Optimal Control of Affine Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a safe control synthesis method that integrates state estimation and parameter estimation within an adaptive optimal control (AOC) and control barrier function (CBF)-based control architecture. The developed approach decouples safety objectives from the learning objectives using a CBF-based guarding controller where the CBFs are robustified to account for the lack of full-state measurements. The coupling of this guarding controller with the AOC-based stabilizing control guarantees safety and regulation despite the lack of full state measurement. The paper leverages recent advancements in deep neural network-based adaptive observers to ensure safety in the presence of state estimation errors. Safety and convergence guarantees are provided using a Lyapunov-based analysis, and the effectiveness of the developed controller is demonstrated through simulation under mild excitation conditions.</description>

      <title>SpeechAgent: An End-to-End Mobile Infrastructure for Speech Impairment Assistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech is essential for human communication, yet millions of people face impairments such as dysarthria, stuttering, and aphasia conditions that often lead to social isolation and reduced participation. Despite recent progress in automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech (TTS) technologies, accessible web and mobile infrastructures for users with impaired speech remain limited, hindering the practical adoption of these advances in daily communication. To bridge this gap, we present SpeechAgent, a mobile SpeechAgent designed to facilitate people with speech impairments in everyday communication. The system integrates large language model (LLM)- driven reasoning with advanced speech processing modules, providing adaptive support tailored to diverse impairment types. To ensure real-world practicality, we develop a structured deployment pipeline that enables real-time speech processing on mobile and edge devices, achieving imperceptible latency while maintaining high accuracy and speech quality. Evaluation on real-world impaired speech datasets and edge-device latency profiling confirms that SpeechAgent delivers both effective and user-friendly performance, demonstrating its feasibility for personalized, day-to-day assistive communication.</description>

      <title>Interpolatory Approximations of PMU Data: Dimension Reduction and Pilot Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the reduction of phasor measurement unit (PMU) data through low-rank matrix approximations. To reconstruct a PMU data matrix from fewer measurements, we propose the framework of interpolatory matrix decompositions (IDs). In contrast to methods relying on principal component analysis or singular value decomposition, IDs recover the complete data matrix using only a few of its rows (PMU datastreams) and/or a few of its columns (snapshots in time). This compression enables the real-time monitoring of power transmission systems using a limited number of measurements, thereby minimizing communication bandwidth. The ID perspective gives a rigorous error bound on the quality of the data compression. We propose selecting rows and columns used in an ID via the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM), a greedy algorithm that aims to control the error bound. This bound leads to a computable estimate for the reconstruction error during online operations. A violation of this estimate suggests a change in the system's operating conditions, and thus serves as a tool for fault detection. Numerical tests using synthetic PMU data illustrate DEIM's excellent performance for data compression, and validate the proposed DEIM-based fault-detection method.</description>

      <title>Design Optimization and Global Impact Assessment of Solar-Thermal Direct Air Carbon Capture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dual challenge of decarbonizing the economy and meeting rising global energy demand underscores the need for scalable and cost-effective carbon dioxide removal technologies. Direct air capture (DAC) is among the most promising approaches, but its high energy intensity, particularly the thermal energy required for sorbent regeneration, remains a critical barrier to cost reduction and sustainable deployment. This study explores solar-thermal DAC systems that combine concentrated solar thermal technology with low-cost sand-based thermal energy storage to meet this demand. We analyze the techno-economic performance of such systems in both grid-connected and stand-alone configurations. Results show that solar-thermal DAC can achieve annual capacity factors exceeding 80% and CO2 removal costs as low as 160-200 USD per ton, making it competitive with leading DAC technologies. The proposed system operates most efficiently with short-cycle sorbents that align with solar availability. The stand-alone Solar-DAC systems, which rely solely on solar energy for both electricity and thermal energy, are particularly promising in regions with high solar capacity and sandy terrain, exhibiting minimal ambient sensitivity from temperature and humidity. An optimal 6000 ton/yr modular system design takes &lt;1 km2 land-use requirement and potentially &gt;26 Gt/year DAC capacity is identified for sandy terrain alone globally. In areas with sedimentary basins suitable for CO2 storage, solar-powered DAC offers a lower-cost alternative to geothermal heating, which often faces geological and economic constraints.</description>

      <title>Soft Switching Expert Policies for Controlling Systems with Uncertain Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a simulation-based reinforcement learning algorithm for controlling systems with uncertain and varying system parameters. While simulators are useful for safely learning control policies for physical systems, mitigating the reality gap remains a major challenge. To address the challenge, we propose a two-stage algorithm. In the first stage, multiple control policies are learned for systems with different parameters in a simulator. In the second stage, for a real system, the control policies learned in the first stage are smoothly switched using an online convex optimization algorithm based on observations. Our proposed algorithm is demonstrated through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>From Bundles to Backstepping: Geometric Control Barrier Functions for Safety-Critical Control on Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control barrier functions (CBFs) have a well-established theory in Euclidean spaces, yet still lack general formulations and constructive synthesis tools for systems evolving on manifolds common in robotics and aerospace applications. In this paper, we develop a general theory of geometric CBFs on bundles and, for control-affine systems, recover the standard optimization-based CBF controllers and their smooth analogues. Then, by generalizing kinetic energy-based CBF backstepping to Riemannian manifolds, we provide a constructive CBF synthesis technique for geometric mechanical systems, as well as easily verifiable conditions under which it succeeds. Further, this technique utilizes mechanical structure to avoid computations on higher-order tangent bundles. We demonstrate its application to an underactuated satellite on SO(3).</description>

      <title>Multi-layer Optimized Coordination of Smart Building Resources in Active Power Distribution Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a multi-actor coordination platform for the optimal utilization of smart buildings resources, including roof top PV generation and battery energy storage system (BESS), in active power distribution systems. The proposed multi-actor coordination includes the Smart Building Coordinator (SBC), Micro-Grid Coordinator (MGC) and Distribution System Coordinator (DSC). The coordinators operate independently and only exchange limited information with each other to reach an optimal solution. In the proposed platform, a hierarchical optimization problem is solved to optimally determine the operating point of all distribution system resources. The proposed platform fully preserves the confidentiality of the behind the meter (BTM) data of the buildings since no information about the status of the PV system, BESS, and load of the building is shared with the owner of the power system. The proposed platform has a flexible and scalable architecture where the computational task of coordinating microgrids and smart buildings with distribution grid is performed locally at the MGC and SBC layers, respectively. Numerical simulations show the efficacy of the proposed platform in coordinating the BTM resources with the rest of the distribution system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main goal of this contribution is to explain how to use interlacing techniques for LTI controllers implementation and analyze different struc- tures in this environment. These considerations lead to an important com- putation saving in constrained resource environments. It has been also intro- duced new procedures for obtaining the blocks related to different real and complex controllers poles. The resultant time-varying system is modeled using proper discrete lifting techniques and a new and efficient dual-rate fre- quency response computation allows to determine the characteristics of the control loop with interlaced controller. Examples illustrate the theoretical proposals.</description>

      <title>A Multifunctional Capacitive Sensing Platform for Wireless Vascular and Heart Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multifunctional, antenna-integrated capacitive sensing (MAiCaS) platform for passive, wireless, and real-time cardiovascular monitoring. Unlike conventional systems that require separate sensors and wireless modules, our device unifies sensing, telemetry, and mechanical functionality into a compact and scalable design by exploiting the parasitic capacitance of an inductive antenna as a strain-sensitive element. The sensor is fabricated using a cleanroom-free, single-step UV laser patterning process on a flexible PDMS substrate, reducing manufacturing complexity and enabling high reproducibility. The MAiCaS is suitable for three different applications: as a sensor for epicardial strain measurement, a stent as a sensor, and a vascular graft sensor. We demonstrate MAiCaS's versatility by validating its wireless resonance-based response to strain, pressure, and deformation across unrolled and rolled forms. In vitro experiments demonstrated consistent resonance frequency shifts under physiological conditions, with stable performance on skin, in PBS, human serum, and simulated vascular environments. Repeatability and aging tests confirmed its long-term reliability and elasticity under cyclic loading. Calibration curves revealed high sensitivity across all configurations, with wireless interrogation achieved through S11 parameter measurements and resonance frequency shift as the output metric. The sensitivity of the device was measured to be 2.9 MHz per 1% strain, 0.43 MHz/mmHg, and 309.6kHz/\textmu m for epicardial patch, graft, and stent integrated sensor, respectively. The operation of MAiCaS was evaluated in a human experiment. This monolithic sensor architecture provides a scalable and cost-effective solution for battery-free monitoring of vascular dynamics, with potential for remote diagnostics, post-surgical follow-up, and continuous cardiovascular health management.</description>

      <title>Behavior-Aware Online Prediction of Obstacle Occupancy using Zonotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the motion of surrounding vehicles is key to safe autonomous driving, especially in unstructured environments without prior information. This paper proposes a novel online method to accurately predict the occupancy sets of surrounding vehicles based solely on motion observations. The approach is divided into two stages: first, an Extended Kalman Filter and a Linear Programming (LP) problem are used to estimate a compact zonotopic set of control actions; then, a reachability analysis propagates this set to predict future occupancy. The effectiveness of the method has been validated through simulations in an urban environment, showing accurate and compact predictions without relying on prior assumptions or prior training data.</description>

      <title>Joint Computation Offloading and Resource Management for Cooperative Satellite-Aerial-Marine Internet of Things Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Devices within the marine Internet of Things (MIoT) can connect to low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to facilitate low-latency data transmission and execution, as well as enhanced-capacity data storage. However, without proper traffic handling strategy, it is still difficult to effectively meet the low-latency requirements. In this paper, we consider a cooperative satellite-aerial-MIoT network (CSAMN) for maritime edge computing and maritime data storage to prioritize delay-sensitive (DS) tasks by employing mobile edge computing, while handling delay-tolerant (DT) tasks via the store-carry-forward method. Considering the delay constraints of DS tasks, we formulate a constrained joint optimization problem of maximizing satellite-collected data volume while minimizing system energy consumption by controlling four interdependent variables, including the transmit power of UAVs for DS tasks, the start time of DT tasks, computing resource allocation, and offloading ratio. To solve this non-convex and non-linear problem, we propose a joint computation offloading and resource management (JCORM) algorithm using the Dinkelbach method and linear programming. Our results show that the volume of data collected by the proposed JCORM algorithm can be increased by up to 41.5% compared to baselines. Moreover, JCORM algorithm achieves a dramatic reduction in computational time, from a maximum of 318.21 seconds down to just 0.16 seconds per experiment, making it highly suitable for real-time maritime applications.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Small Gain and Phase Stability Conditions for Grid-Forming Converters: Limitations and Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing share of converter based resources in power systems calls for scalable methods to analyse stability without relying on exhaustive system wide simulations. Decentralized small gain and small-phase criteria have recently been proposed for this purpose, but their applicability to grid forming converters is severely limited by the sectoriality assumption, which is not typically satisfied at low frequencies. This work revisits and extends mixed gain phase conditions by introducing loop shaping transformations that reformulate converter and network models in alternative coordinate frames. The proposed approach resolves intrinsic non sectoriality at low frequencies and reduces conservativeness, thereby improving the applicability of decentralized stability certification. Analytical results are illustrated using an infinite bus system first and then extended to the IEEE 14 bus network, demonstrating the practicality and scalability of the method. These findings provide a pathway toward less conservative and more widely applicable decentralized stability certificates in power grids.</description>

      <title>Safe Decentralized Density Control of Multi-Robot Systems using PDE-Constrained Optimization with State Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a decentralized optimization-based density controller designed to enforce set invariance constraints in multi-robot systems. By designing a decentralized control barrier function, we derived sufficient conditions under which local safety constraints guarantee global safety. We account for localization and motion noise explicitly by modeling robots as spatial probability density functions governed by the Fokker-Planck equation. Compared to traditional centralized approaches, our controller requires less computational and communication power, making it more suitable for deployment in situations where perfect communication and localization are impractical. The controller is validated through simulations and experiments with four quadcopters.</description>

      <title>Sugar Shack 4.0: Implementation of a Cyber-Physical System for Logistic and Sanitary Automation in a Maple Syrup Boiling Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the design and deployment of a process-aware cyber-physical system that automates plant-level logistics, traceability, and sanitation in a centralized maple-syrup boiling center. The system replaces ad-hoc, manual operations with event-driven orchestration on a local server, employing reusable device abstractions and a centralized interlock with priority-based arbitration for shared piping. It implements deterministic routines for delivery, reverse osmosis integration, evaporator feed, and permeate management. The system is sensor rich: inline measurements of flow, temperature, and sugar concentration (degrees Brix) drive routing decisions and trigger systematic post-transfer rinses (cleaning-in-place), ensuring consistent hygiene and complete, immediate traceability up to the evaporator inlet. During the 2025 production season, the system queued 431 operations without incident; executed 908 \enquote{topstock} and \enquote{downstock} balancing cycles; increased usable permeate reserves from 22,712 to approximately 41,640 L through dynamic storage assignment; eliminated mid-season contamination incidents previously observed under manual practice; and reduced administrative effort for billing and reporting from more than 30 hours to roughly 1 hour through automatic documentation. These results demonstrate a practical path to modular, plant-scale automation beyond traditional architectures, and lay the groundwork for packaging reusable elements for similar plants or adjacent industries. This work is part of a larger project involving the first scientifically-documented integration of Industry 4.0 technologies in a maple syrup boiling center.</description>

      <title>Learning Optimal Power Flow with Pointwise Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training learning parameterizations to solve optimal power flow (OPF) with pointwise constraints is proposed. In this novel training approach, a learning parameterization is substituted directly into an OPF problem with constraints required to hold over all problem instances. This is different from existing supervised learning methods in which constraints are required to hold across the average of problem instances. Training with pointwise constraints is undertaken in the dual domain with the use of augmented Lagrangian and dual gradient ascent algorithm. Numerical experiments demonstrate that training with pointwise constraints produces solutions with smaller constraint violations. Experiments further demonstrated that pointwise constraints are most effective at reducing constraint violations in corner cases - defined as those realizations in which constraints are most difficult to satisfy. Gains are most pronounced in power systems with large numbers of buses.</description>

      <title>Bilevel Analysis of Cost and Emissions Externalities from Data Center Load Shifting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data centers are emerging as large, flexible electricity consumers capable of shifting computational workloads across locations in response to economic and environmental signals. While this flexibility has potential for emissions reduction, its impact on power system operations depends critically on how such behavior interacts with network constraints and market signals. We develop a bilevel optimization framework in which a data center minimizes a weighted combination of electricity cost and marginal emissions intensity (LME), while the system operator clears economic dispatch under transmission and generation constraints. Focusing on a stylized three-bus power system, we derive closed-form, piecewise-linear expressions for both the data center and system-wide objectives as functions of the data centers' load shift. These expressions capture threshold-driven regime changes due to congestion and renewable saturation. We identify sufficient conditions under which the data center's decentralized decisions align with or diverge from socially optimal behavior and characterize the resulting externalities. Our results reveal how system topology and generator asymmetry affect incentive alignment and provide insight into when marginal price or emissions signals may fail to guide flexible loads toward socially beneficial outcomes. Our results offer a tractable starting point for analyzing decentralized flexibility under carbon-aware incentives and suggest directions for improving coordination between flexible loads and system operations.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Reasoning Reliability in Artificial Intelligence Models for Energy-System Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence and machine learning are increasingly used for forecasting, optimization, and policy design in the energy sector, yet no standardized framework exists to evaluate whether these systems reason correctly. Current validation practices focus on predictive accuracy or computational efficiency, leaving the logical integrity of analytical conclusions untested. This study introduces the Analytical Reliability Benchmark (ARB), a reproducible framework that quantifies reasoning reliability in large language models applied to energy system analysis. The benchmark integrates five submetrics: accuracy, reasoning reliability, uncertainty discipline, policy consistency, and transparency, and evaluates model performance across deterministic, probabilistic, and epistemic scenarios using open technoeconomic datasets (NREL ATB 2024, DOE H2A/H2New, IEA WEO 2024). Four frontier models (GPT-4/5, Claude 4.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Llama 3 70B) were tested under identical factual and regulatory conditions. Results show that reasoning reliability can be objectively measured. GPT-4/5 and Claude 4.5 Sonnet achieved consistent and policy-compliant reasoning (Analytical Reliability Index greater than 90), Gemini 2.5 Pro demonstrated moderate stability, and Llama 3 70B remained below professional thresholds. Statistical validation confirmed that these differences are significant and reproducible. The ARB establishes the first quantitative method in the energy literature for verifying causal, probabilistic, and policy-driven reasoning in artificial intelligence systems, providing a reference framework for trustworthy and transparent analytical applications in the global energy transition.</description>

      <title>Ultra-Fast Wireless Power Hacking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of electric vehicles (EVs) has driven the development of roadway wireless charging technology, effectively extending EV driving range. However, wireless charging introduces significant cybersecurity challenges. Any receiver within the magnetic field can potentially extract energy, and previous research demonstrated that a hacker could detect the operating frequency and steal substantial power. However, our approach required time to track new frequencies or precise adjustments of inductance and capacitance, which would be less effective against potential rapid transmitter frequency changes or capacitance drift. As a solution, we enhanced the interceptor and enabled it to intrude as well as steal energy within just three cycles of the high-frequency signal. Moreover, it can work without any circuit parameters or look-up tables. The key innovation is synchronizing the receiver current with the phase of the magnetic sensor voltage. Through MATLAB / Simulink simulations, finite-element analysis, and experimental validation, we demonstrated that our improved method can steal over 76% of the power received by a fully resonant receiver under identical conditions. This attack demonstrates that simple frequency-changing power encryption offers limited protection against such threats.</description>

      <title>Modeling to Generate Alternatives for Robustness of Mixed Integer DC Optimal Power Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transmission system operators face a variety of discrete operational decisions, such as switching of branches and/or devices. Incorporating these decisions into optimal power flow (OPF) results in mixed-integer non-linear programming problems (MINLPs), which can't presently be solved at scale in the required time. Various linearizations of the OPF exist, most famously the DC-OPF, which can be leveraged to find integer decisions. However, these linearizations can yield very poor integer solutions in some edge cases, making them challenging to incorporate into control rooms. This paper introduces the use of modeling to generate alternatives (MGA) to find alternative solutions to the linearized problems, reducing the chance of finding no AC feasible solutions. We test this approach using 13 networks where the DC linearization results in infeasible integer decisions, and MGA finds a solution in all cases. The MGA search criteria selected drastically affects the number and quality of solutions found, so network specific search functions may be necessary.</description>

      <title>Balancing Specialization and Centralization: A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Benchmark for Sequential Industrial Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous control of multi-stage industrial processes requires both local specialization and global coordination. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising approach, but its industrial adoption remains limited due to challenges such as reward design, modularity, and action space management. Many academic benchmarks differ markedly from industrial control problems, limiting their transferability to real-world applications. This study introduces an enhanced industry-inspired benchmark environment that combines tasks from two existing benchmarks, SortingEnv and ContainerGym, into a sequential recycling scenario with sorting and pressing operations. We evaluate two control strategies: a modular architecture with specialized agents and a monolithic agent governing the full system, while also analyzing the impact of action masking. Our experiments show that without action masking, agents struggle to learn effective policies, with the modular architecture performing better. When action masking is applied, both architectures improve substantially, and the performance gap narrows considerably. These results highlight the decisive role of action space constraints and suggest that the advantages of specialization diminish as action complexity is reduced. The proposed benchmark thus provides a valuable testbed for exploring practical and robust multi-agent RL solutions in industrial automation, while contributing to the ongoing debate on centralization versus specialization.</description>

      <title>Path-Based Conditions for the Identifiability of Non-additive Nonlinear Networks with Full Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the identifiability of nonlinear networks with node dynamics characterized by functions that are non-additive. We consider the full measurement case (all the nodes are measured) in the path-independent delay scenario where all the excitation signals of a specific node have the same delay in the output of a measured node. Based on the notion of a generic nonlinear matrix associated with the network, we introduce the concept of generic identifiability and characterize the space of functions that satisfies this property. For directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) characterized by analytic functions, we derive a sufficient condition for identifiability based on vertex-disjoint paths from excited nodes to the in-neighbors of each node in the network. Furthermore, when we consider the class of polynomial functions, by using well-known results on algebraic varieties, we prove that the vertex-disjoint path condition is also necessary. Finally, we show that this identifiability condition is not necessary for the additive nonlinear model. Some examples are added to illustrate the results.</description>

Abstract: Hybrid dynamical systems pose significant challenges for effective planning and control, especially when additional constraints such as obstacle avoidance, state boundaries, and actuation limits are present. In this letter, we extend the recently proposed Hybrid iLQR method [1] to handle state and input constraints within an indirect optimization framework, aiming to preserve computational efficiency and ensure dynamic feasibility. Specifically, we incorporate two constraint handling mechanisms into the Hybrid iLQR: Discrete Barrier State and Augmented Lagrangian methods. Comprehensive simulations across various operational situations are conducted to evaluate and compare the performance of these extended methods in terms of convergence and their ability to handle infeasible starting trajectories. Results indicate that while the Discrete Barrier State approach is more computationally efficient, the Augmented Lagrangian method outperforms it in complex and real-world scenarios with infeasible initial trajectories.</description>

      <title>Scalable Distributed Least Squares Algorithm for Linear Algebraic Equations via Periodic Scheduling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel discrete-time distributed algorithm for finding least-squares solutions of linear algebraic equations with a scheduling protocol to further enhance its scalability. Each agent in the network is assumed to know some rows of the coefficient matrix and the corresponding entries in the observation vector. Unlike typical distributed algorithms, our approach considers communication bandwidth limits, allowing agents to transmit only a portion of their ``guessed" solution, independent of its dimension. A cyclic scheduling protocol determines which portion is transmitted at each iteration. Assuming a small fixed step size and a diagonalizable algorithm matrix, we prove that agents' ``guessed" solutions converge exponentially to a least squares solution. For cases where the observation vectors are time-varying, a modified algorithm guarantees practical convergence, with tracking error bounded by the single-step variation in the observation vector. Simulations and comparisons with state-of-the-art algorithms validate our algorithm's feasibility and scalability.</description>

Abstract: The paper derives analytical expressions for the asymptotic average updating direction of the adaptive moment generation (ADAM) algorithm when applied to recursive identification of nonlinear systems. It is proved that the standard hyper-parameter setting results in the same asymptotic average updating direction as a diagonally power normalized stochastic gradient algorithm. With the internal filtering turned off, the asymptotic average updating direction is instead equivalent to that of a sign-sign stochastic gradient algorithm. Global convergence to an invariant set follows, where a subset of parameters contain those that give a correct input-output description of the system. The paper also exploits a nonlinear dynamic model to embed structure in recurrent neural networks. A Monte-Carlo simulation study validates the results.</description>

Abstract: Probability generating functionals (PGFLs) are efficient and powerful tools for tracking independent objects in clutter. It was shown that PGFLs could be used for the elegant derivation of practical multi-object tracking algorithms, e.g., the probability hypothesis density (PHD) filter. However, derivations using PGFLs use the so-called functional derivatives whose definitions usually appear too complicated or heuristic, involving Dirac delta ``functions''. This paper begins by comparing different definitions of functional derivatives and exploring their relationships and implications for practical applications. It then proposes a rigorous definition of the functional derivative, utilizing straightforward yet precise mathematics for clarity. Key properties of the functional derivative are revealed and discussed.</description>

      <title>Prognostic Framework for Robotic Manipulators Operating Under Dynamic Task Severities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robotic manipulators are critical in many applications but are known to degrade over time. This degradation is influenced by the nature of the tasks performed by the robot. Tasks with higher severity, such as handling heavy payloads, can accelerate the degradation process. One way this degradation is reflected is in the position accuracy of the robot's end-effector. In this paper, we present a prognostic modeling framework that predicts a robotic manipulator's Remaining Useful Life (RUL) while accounting for the effects of task severity. Our framework represents the robot's position accuracy as a Brownian motion process with a random drift parameter that is influenced by task severity. The dynamic nature of task severity is modeled using a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC). To evaluate RUL, we discuss two approaches -- (1) a novel closed-form expression for Remaining Lifetime Distribution (RLD), and (2) Monte Carlo simulations, commonly used in prognostics literature. Theoretical results establish the equivalence between these RUL computation approaches. We validate our framework through experiments using two distinct physics-based simulators for planar and spatial robot fleets. Our findings show that robots in both fleets experience shorter RUL when handling a higher proportion of high-severity tasks.</description>

      <title>Equity-aware Design and Timing of Fare-free Transit Zoning under Demand Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the first analytical stochastic model for optimizing the configuration and implementation policies of fare-free transit. The model focuses on a transportation corridor with two transportation modes: automobiles and buses. The corridor is divided into two sections, an inner one with fare-free transit service and an outer one with fare-based transit service. Under the static version of the model, the optimized length and frequency of the fare-free transit zone can be determined by maximizing total social welfare. The findings indicate that implementing fare-free transit can increase transit ridership and reduce automobile use within the fare-free zone while social equity among the demand groups can be enhanced by lengthening the fare-free zone. Notably, the optimal zone length increases when both social welfare and equity are considered jointly, compared to only prioritizing social welfare. The dynamic model, framed within a market entry and exit real options approach, solves the fare policy switching problem, establishing optimal timing policies for activating or terminating fare-free service. The results from dynamic models reveal earlier implementation and extended durations of fare-free transit in the social welfare-aware regime, driven by lower thresholds compared to the social equity-aware regime.</description>

      <title>Towards Machine Learning-based Model Predictive Control for HVAC Control in Multi-Context Buildings at Scale via Ensemble Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The building thermodynamics model, which predicts real-time indoor temperature changes under potential HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) control operations, is crucial for optimizing HVAC control in buildings. While pioneering studies have attempted to develop such models for various building environments, these models often require extensive data collection periods and rely heavily on expert knowledge, making the modeling process inefficient and limiting the reusability of the models. This paper explores a model ensemble perspective that utilizes existing developed models as base models to serve a target building environment, thereby providing accurate predictions while reducing the associated efforts. Given that building data streams are non-stationary and the number of base models may increase, we propose a Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) approach to dynamically select and weight the base models. Our approach employs a two-tiered decision-making process: the high-level focuses on model selection, while the low-level determines the weights of the selected models. We thoroughly evaluate the proposed approach through offline experiments and an on-site case study, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Continuous-time Stochastic Control with Jumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a model-based deep-learning approach to solve finite-horizon continuous-time stochastic control problems with jumps. We iteratively train two neural networks: one to represent the optimal policy and the other to approximate the value function. Leveraging a continuous-time version of the dynamic programming principle, we derive two different training objectives based on the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, ensuring that the networks capture the underlying stochastic dynamics. Empirical evaluations on different problems illustrate the accuracy and scalability of our approach, demonstrating its effectiveness in solving complex, high-dimensional stochastic control tasks.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Optimization of Process Parameters of a Sensor-Based Sorting System using Gaussian Processes as Surrogate Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22766v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sensor-based sorting systems enable the physical separation of a material stream into two fractions. The sorting decision is based on the image data evaluation of the sensors used and is carried out using actuators. Various process parameters must be set depending on the properties of the material stream, the dimensioning of the system, and the required sorting accuracy. However, continuous verification and re-adjustment are necessary due to changing requirements and material stream compositions. In this paper, we introduce an approach for optimizing, recurrently monitoring and adjusting the process parameters of a sensor-based sorting system. Based on Bayesian Optimization, Gaussian process regression models are used as surrogate models to achieve specific requirements for system behavior with the uncertainties contained therein. This method minimizes the number of necessary experiments while simultaneously considering two possible optimization targets based on the requirements for both material output streams. In addition, uncertainties are considered during determining sorting accuracies in the model calculation. We evaluated the method with three example process parameters.</description>
