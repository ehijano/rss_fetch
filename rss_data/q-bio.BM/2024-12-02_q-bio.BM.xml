      <title>A potassium ion channel simulated with a universal neural network potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Potassium ion channels are critical components of biology. They conduct potassium ions across the cell membrane with remarkable speed and selectivity. Understanding how they do this is crucially important for applications in neuroscience, medicine, and materials science. However, many fundamental questions about the mechanism they use remain unresolved, partly because it is extremely difficult to computationally model due to the scale and complexity of the necessary simulations. Here, the selectivity filter (SF) of the KcsA potassium ion channel is simulated using Orb-D3, a recently released universal neural network potential. A previously unreported hydrogen bond between water in the SF and the T75 hydroxyl side group at the entrance to the SF is observed. This hydrogen bond appears to stabilize water in the SF, enabling a soft knock-on transport mechanism where water is co-transported through the SF with a reasonable conductivity (80 $\pm$ 20 pS). Carbonyl backbone flipping is also observed at new sites in the SF. This work demonstrates the potential of universal neural network potentials to provide insights into previously intractable questions about complex systems far outside their training data distribution.</description>

      <title>Neuroplasticity and Psychedelics: a comprehensive examination of classic and non-classic compounds in pre and clinical models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neuroplasticity, the ability of the nervous system to adapt throughout an organism's lifespan, offers potential as both a biomarker and treatment target for neuropsychiatric conditions. Psychedelics, a burgeoning category of drugs, are increasingly prominent in psychiatric research, prompting inquiries into their mechanisms of action. Distinguishing themselves from traditional medications, psychedelics demonstrate rapid and enduring therapeutic effects after a single or few administrations, believed to stem from their neuroplasticity-enhancing properties. This review examines how classic psychedelics (e.g., LSD, psilocybin, N,N-DMT) and non-classic psychedelics (e.g., ketamine, MDMA) influence neuroplasticity. Drawing from preclinical and clinical studies, we explore the molecular, structural, and functional changes triggered by these agents. Animal studies suggest psychedelics induce heightened sensitivity of the nervous system to environmental stimuli (meta-plasticity), re-opening developmental windows for long-term structural changes (hyper-plasticity), with implications for mood and behavior. Translating these findings to humans faces challenges due to limitations in current imaging techniques. Nonetheless, promising new directions for human research are emerging, including the employment of novel positron-emission tomography (PET) radioligands, non-invasive brain stimulation methods, and multimodal approaches. By elucidating the interplay between psychedelics and neuroplasticity, this review informs the development of targeted interventions for neuropsychiatric disorders and advances understanding of psychedelics' therapeutic potential.</description>

      <title>ApisTox: a new benchmark dataset for the classification of small molecules toxicity on honey bees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16196v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The global decline in bee populations poses significant risks to agriculture, biodiversity, and environmental stability. To bridge the gap in existing data, we introduce ApisTox, a comprehensive dataset focusing on the toxicity of pesticides to honey bees (Apis mellifera). This dataset combines and leverages data from existing sources such as ECOTOX and PPDB, providing an extensive, consistent, and curated collection that surpasses the previous datasets. ApisTox incorporates a wide array of data, including toxicity levels for chemicals, details such as time of their publication in literature, and identifiers linking them to external chemical databases. This dataset may serve as an important tool for environmental and agricultural research, but also can support the development of policies and practices aimed at minimizing harm to bee populations. Finally, ApisTox offers a unique resource for benchmarking molecular property prediction methods on agrochemical compounds, facilitating advancements in both environmental science and cheminformatics. This makes it a valuable tool for both academic research and practical applications in bee conservation.</description>

      <title>Open-Source Molecular Processing Pipeline for Generating Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06261v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative models for molecules have shown considerable promise for use in computational chemistry, but remain difficult to use for non-experts. For this reason, we introduce open-source infrastructure for easily building generative molecular models into the widely used DeepChem [Ramsundar et al., 2019] library with the aim of creating a robust and reusable molecular generation pipeline. In particular, we add high quality PyTorch [Paszke et al., 2019] implementations of the Molecular Generative Adversarial Networks (MolGAN) [Cao and Kipf, 2022] and Normalizing Flows [Papamakarios et al., 2021]. Our implementations show strong performance comparable with past work [Kuznetsov and Polykovskiy, 2021, Cao and Kipf, 2022].</description>
