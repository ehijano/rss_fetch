      <title>A Cross-Field Fusion Strategy for Drug-Target Interaction Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction is a critical component of the drug discovery process. In the drug development engineering field, predicting novel drug-target interactions is extremely crucial.However, although existing methods have achieved high accuracy levels in predicting known drugs and drug targets, they fail to utilize global protein information during DTI prediction. This leads to an inability to effectively predict interaction the interactions between novel drugs and their targets. As a result, the cross-field information fusion strategy is employed to acquire local and global protein information. Thus, we propose the siamese drug-target interaction SiamDTI prediction method, which utilizes a double channel network structure for cross-field supervised learning.Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that SiamDTI achieves higher accuracy levels than other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on novel drugs and targets.Additionally, SiamDTI's performance with known drugs and targets is comparable to that of SOTA approachs. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DDDTI-434D.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Protein-Ligand Docking: Are We There Yet?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effects of ligand binding on protein structures and their in vivo functions carry numerous implications for modern biomedical research and biotechnology development efforts such as drug discovery. Although several deep learning (DL) methods and benchmarks designed for protein-ligand docking have recently been introduced, to date no prior works have systematically studied the behavior of docking methods within the practical context of (1) predicted (apo) protein structures, (2) multiple ligands concurrently binding to a given target protein, and (3) having no prior knowledge of binding pockets. To enable a deeper understanding of docking methods' real-world utility, we introduce PoseBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for practical protein-ligand docking. PoseBench enables researchers to rigorously and systematically evaluate DL docking methods for apo-to-holo protein-ligand docking and protein-ligand structure generation using both single and multi-ligand benchmark datasets, the latter of which we introduce for the first time to the DL community. Empirically, using PoseBench, we find that all recent DL docking methods but one fail to generalize to multi-ligand protein targets and also that template-based docking algorithms perform equally well or better for multi-ligand docking as recent single-ligand DL docking methods, suggesting areas of improvement for future work. Code, data, tutorials, and benchmark results are available at https://github.com/BioinfoMachineLearning/PoseBench.</description>

      <title>New Aspects of Analyzing Amyloid Fibrils</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is a summary of mathematical tools we used in research of analyzing the structure of proteins with amyloid form \cite{xi2024Top}. We defined several geometry indicators on the discrete curve namely the hop distance, the discrete curvature and the discrete torsion. Then, we used these indicators to analyze the structure of amyloid fibrils by regarding its peptide chains as discrete curves in $\Rds^3$. We gave examples to show that these indicators give novel insights in the characterization analysis of the structure of amyloid fibrils, for example the discrete torsion can detect the hydrogen bonds interactions between layers of amyloid fibril. {Moreover,} the topological tool performs better than the root mean square deviation (RMSD) in quantifying the difference of the structure of amyloid fibrils, etc.</description>

      <title>Advanced Drug Interaction Event Prediction</title>

Abstract: Predicting drug-drug interaction adverse events, so-called DDI events, is increasingly valuable as it facilitates the study of mechanisms underlying drug use or adverse reactions. Existing models often neglect the distinctive characteristics of individual event classes when integrating multi-source features, which contributes to systematic unfairness when dealing with highly imbalanced event samples. Moreover, the limited capacity of these models to abstract the unique attributes of each event subclass considerably hampers their application in predicting rare drug-drug interaction events with a limited sample size. Reducing dataset bias and abstracting event subclass characteristics are two unresolved challenges. Recently, prompt tuning with frozen pre-trained graph models, namely "pre-train, prompt, fine-tune" strategy, has demonstrated impressive performance in few-shot tasks. Motivated by this, we propose an advanced method as a solution to address these aforementioned challenges. Specifically, our proposed approach entails a hierarchical pre-training task that aims to capture crucial aspects of drug molecular structure and intermolecular interactions while effectively mitigating implicit dataset bias within the node embeddings. Furthermore, we construct a prototypical graph by strategically sampling data from distinct event types and design subgraph prompts utilizing pre-trained node features. Through comprehensive benchmark experiments, we validate the efficacy of our subgraph prompts in accurately representing event classes and achieve exemplary results in both overall and subclass prediction tasks.</description>

      <title>Full-Atom Peptide Design with Geometric Latent Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Peptide design plays a pivotal role in therapeutics, allowing brand new possibility to leverage target binding sites that are previously undruggable. Most existing methods are either inefficient or only concerned with the target-agnostic design of 1D sequences. In this paper, we propose a generative model for full-atom \textbf{Pep}tide design with \textbf{G}eometric \textbf{LA}tent \textbf{D}iffusion (PepGLAD). We first establish a benchmark consisting of both 1D sequences and 3D structures from Protein Data Bank (PDB) and literature for systematic evaluation. We then identify two major challenges of leveraging current diffusion-based models for peptide design: the full-atom geometry and the variable binding geometry. To tackle the first challenge, PepGLAD derives a variational autoencoder that first encodes full-atom residues of variable size into fixed-dimensional latent representations, and then decodes back to the residue space after conducting the diffusion process in the latent space. For the second issue, PepGLAD explores a receptor-specific affine transformation to convert the 3D coordinates into a shared standard space, enabling better generalization ability across different binding shapes. Experimental Results show that our method not only improves diversity and binding affinity significantly in the task of sequence-structure co-design, but also excels at recovering reference structures for binding conformation generation.</description>

      <title>Pre-Training on Large-Scale Generated Docking Conformations with HelixDock to Unlock the Potential of Protein-ligand Structure Prediction Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13913</link>

Abstract: Protein-ligand structure prediction is an essential task in drug discovery, predicting the binding interactions between small molecules (ligands) and target proteins (receptors). Recent advances have incorporated deep learning techniques to improve the accuracy of protein-ligand structure prediction. Nevertheless, the experimental validation of docking conformations remains costly, it raises concerns regarding the generalizability of these deep learning-based methods due to the limited training data. In this work, we show that by pre-training on a large-scale docking conformation generated by traditional physics-based docking tools and then fine-tuning with a limited set of experimentally validated receptor-ligand complexes, we can obtain a protein-ligand structure prediction model with outstanding performance. Specifically, this process involved the generation of 100 million docking conformations for protein-ligand pairings, an endeavor consuming roughly 1 million CPU core days. The proposed model, HelixDock, aims to acquire the physical knowledge encapsulated by the physics-based docking tools during the pre-training phase. HelixDock has been rigorously benchmarked against both physics-based and deep learning-based baselines, demonstrating its exceptional precision and robust transferability in predicting binding confirmation. In addition, our investigation reveals the scaling laws governing pre-trained protein-ligand structure prediction models, indicating a consistent enhancement in performance with increases in model parameters and the volume of pre-training data. Moreover, we applied HelixDock to several drug discovery-related tasks to validate its practical utility. HelixDock demonstrates outstanding capabilities on both cross-docking and structure-based virtual screening benchmarks.</description>
