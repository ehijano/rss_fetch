      <title>Coulomb interacting Bose-Einstein correlations in Fourier space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In high-energy heavy-ion physics experiments, a state of matter is created that existed in the early Universe: the quark-gluon plasma. This strongly interacting matter exists in today's experiments only within a range of a few femtometers and for a duration of a few femtometers per speed of light, making its resolution with optical tools impossible. However, there is a method that allows for a closer look into the structure of the quark-gluon plasma: femtoscopy. Initially used in astronomy, femtoscopy is based on the quantum mechanical indistinguishability of identical particles, which causes them to arrive at detectors in a correlated manner. The measurable correlation is related to the spacetime structure of the particle-emitting source, which in heavy-ion physics is the quark-gluon plasma created in collisions. For free particles, a relatively simple relationship exists between the source and the correlation (essentially a Fourier transform). However, this relationship becomes complex when accurately accounting for the repulsive Coulomb interaction between final-state electrically charged particles. Our paper presents a new method that is more precise than previously used ones, yet less computationally demanding, especially for the exotic source function shapes. Mathematically, the method is interesting because it exactly handles many emerging integrals and limits. Practically, it is ready for use in experimental analyses.</description>

      <title>Branching ratio and information entropy for the p+$^{12}$C reaction in the extended-quantum-molecular-dynamics model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reactions of p+$^{12}$C with triangular 3$\alpha$ structure and spherical structure with incident energies ranging from 5 to 200 MeV/nucleon are simulated by the in the extended-quantum-molecular-dynamics (EQMD) model together with the GEMINI decay process. This paper presents the incident energy dependence of the branching ratios of fragment production and multiplicity, as well as the associated event information entropy. The results indicate that the triangular 3$\alpha$ $^{12}$C has an extra branching ratio for the quasi-elastic reaction compared to the spherical $^{12}$C. This peculiarity of the branching ratios of the triangular 3$\alpha$ $^{12}$C appears as a small dent in the curves of the event information entropy (both the fragment information entropy and the multiplicity information entropy). Therefore, we propose that the event information entropy could be a probe for detecting the $\alpha$-cluster structure.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking ANN extrapolations of the ground-state energies and radii of Li isotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comparison of model-space extrapolation methods for No-Core Shell Model calculations of ground-state energies and root-mean-square radii in Li isotopes. In particular, we benchmark the latest machine learning tools against widely used exponential and infrared extrapolations for energies and crossing point estimates for radii. Our findings demonstrate that machine learning-based approaches provide reliable predictions with robust statistical uncertainties for both observables even in small model spaces. These predictions are compatible with established exponential and IR extrapolations of energies and mark a notable improvement over conventional radius estimates.</description>

      <title>Hoyle-analog state in ${}^{13}$N</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the cluster structure of $\rm {}^{13}N$ using a microscopic $\alpha+\alpha+\alpha+p$ four-body cluster model. The calculated spectra agree well with the observed spectra in the low-lying states. We calculate the reduced width amplitudes and spectroscopic factors to investigate the Hoyle-analog state in $\rm {}^{13}N$. Our calculations show that the $3/2_3^-$ state at $E_x=10.8$ MeV is primarily constituted by $\rm {}^{12}C(0^+_2)+\mathit{p}$ and $\rm {}^{9}B(3/2^-)+\alpha$ components. This finding is generally consistent with the newly observed $3/2^-$ state at $E_x=11.3$ MeV via the $3\alpha + \mathit{p}$ decay channel. Moreover, considering the calculated root-mean-square radius and isoscalar monopole transition strengths, the $3/2_3^-$ state emerges as a candidate for the Hoyle-analog state with the $\rm {}^{12}C(0^+_2)+\mathit{p}$ cluster structure.</description>

      <title>Description of di-hadron saturation signals within a universal nuclear PDF picture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Di-hadron and di-jet correlation measurements in proton-nucleus ($p$+A) and electron--nucleus collisions are widely motivated as sensitive probes of novel, non-linear QCD saturation dynamics in hadrons, which are particularly accessible in the dense nuclear environment at low values of Bjorken-$x$ ($x_\mathrm{A})$. Current measurements at RHIC and the LHC observe a significant suppression in the per-trigger yield at forward rapidities compared to that in proton-proton collisions, nominally consistent with the "mono-jet" production expected in a saturation scenario. However, the width of the azimuthal correlation remains unmodified, in contradiction to the qualitative expectations from this physics picture. I investigate whether the construction of these observables leaves them sensitive to effects from simple nuclear shadowing as captured by, for example, universal nuclear parton distribution function (nPDF) analyses. I find that modern nPDF sets, informed by recent precision measurements sensitive to the shadowing of low-$x_\mathrm{A}$ gluon densities in LHC and other data, can describe all or the majority of the di-hadron/jet suppression effects in $p$+A data at both RHIC and the LHC, while giving a natural explanation for why the azimuthal correlation width is unmodified. Notably, this is achieved via a $(x_\mathrm{A},Q^2)$-differential suppression of overall cross-sections only, without requiring additional physics dynamics which alter the inter-event correlations.</description>

      <title>$A=2,3$ nuclear contact coefficients in the Generalized Contact Formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work focuses on extracting nuclear contact coefficients for \( A = 2 \), \( A = 3 \) and \( A = 4 \) nuclei within the Generalized Contact Formalism framework. We investigate the universality of these coefficients across different nuclear systems and interaction models, using both local (in \( r \)-space) and non-local (in \( k \)-space) chiral potentials. The Hyperspherical Harmonics method is employed to calculate the nuclear wave functions from which we obtain the two-body momentum distributions and the two-body density functions, which are essential for extracting the contact coefficients. The adopted method is a rigorous ab-initio approach that can be applied to virtually any potential.
  We present ratios of contact coefficients across various spin and isospin channels, highlighting their independence from the used nuclear potential. This study extends previous work where only local interaction models were employed. Furthermore, we verify whether the contact coefficient ratio between different nuclei remains consistent even when non-local potentials are considered.
  Future work will extend this analysis to heavier nuclei, such as \( A = 4 \) and \( A = 6 \) nuclei.</description>

      <title>The Fermi function and the neutron's lifetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The traditional Fermi function ansatz for nuclear beta decay describes enhanced perturbative effects in the limit of large nuclear charge $Z$ and/or small electron velocity $\beta$. We define and compute the quantum field theory object that replaces this ansatz for neutron beta decay, where neither of these limits hold. We present a new factorization formula that applies in the limit of small electron mass, analyze the components of this formula through two loop order, and resum perturbative corrections that are enhanced by large logarithms. We apply our results to the neutron lifetime, supplying the first two-loop input to the long-distance corrections. Our result can be summarized as \begin{equation*}
  \tau_n \times |V_{ud}|^2\big[1+3\lambda^2\big]\big[1+\Delta_R\big]
  =
  \frac{5263.284(17)\,{\rm s}}
  {1 + 27.04(7)\times 10^{-3} }~, \end{equation*} with $|V_{ud}|$ the up-down quark mixing parameter, $\tau_n$ the neutron's lifetime, $\lambda$ the ratio of axial to vector charge, and $\Delta_R$ the short-distance matching correction. We find a shift in the long-distance radiative corrections compared to previous work, and discuss implications for extractions of $|V_{ud}|$ and tests of the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>The spatial string tension and its effects on screening correlators in a thermal QCD plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the spatial Wilson line correlator for 2+1 flavor QCD using highly improved staggered quark discretization for fermions and in quenched QCD for a wide range of temperatures, from the chiral crossover temperature $\mathrm{T_{pc}\simeq 156}$ MeV or the deconfinement temperature $\simeq 300$ MeV respectively, up to $2$ GeV. Extracting the spatial string tension for different lattice cut-offs and by performing a continuum extrapolation of this observable, we show that the soft (magnetic) gluons interact non-perturbatively even at temperatures $\gtrsim 1$ GeV. We provide incriminating evidences to demonstrate that dimensionally reduced effective theories can describe these soft quark and gluon quasi-particles for both quenched and $2+1$ flavor QCD, at temperatures $\mathrm{T\gtrsim 5T_{pc}}$. We also show for the first time the imprints of the non-perturbative pseudo-potential in the properties of mesonic screening masses for temperatures ranging from $0.8$-$164$ GeV in the quark-gluon plasma.</description>

      <title>Spectral-statistics properties of the experimental and theoretical light baryon and meson spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compare the statistical fluctuation properties of the baryon and meson experimental mass spectra with those obtained from theoretical models (quark models and lattice QCD). We find that for the experimental spectra the statistical properties are close to those predicted by Random Matrix Theory for chaotic systems, while for the theoretical ones they are in general closer to those predicted for integrable systems and safely incompatible with those of chaotic systems. We stress the importance of the agreement of the fluctuation properties between experiment and theoretical models, as they determine the dynamical regime and the complexity of the real interactions. We emphasize the new statistical method we use, adapted for properly analyzing the fluctuation properties for very short spectral sequences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) will operate a series of high-luminosity high-energy electron+proton ($e+p$) and electron+nucleus ($\textit{e + A}$) collisions to study several fundamental questions in the high energy and nuclear physics field. Heavy flavor hadron and jet production at the EIC plays an important role in exploring both potential modification on the initial-state nuclear parton distribution functions (nPDFs) and final-state parton propagation and hadronization processes under different nuclear medium conditions. The current design of the EIC ePIC detector has good performance of vertex and track reconstruction, particle identification and energy determination in the pseudorapidity region of $-3.5&lt;\eta&lt;3.5$, which will enable a series of high precision heavy flavor hadron and jet measurements. Latest simulation studies of the projected nuclear modification factor $R_{eA}$ of heavy flavor jets and heavy flavor hadron inside jets in $e+p$ and $\textit{e + Au}$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} =$ 28.6 GeV and 63.2 GeV as well as the projected statistical accuracy of inclusive and differential charm baryon over meson ratio measurements in $e+p$ collisions will be presented. The impacts of these proposed EIC measurements on constraining the heavy quark propagation properties in cold nuclear medium and exploring the heavy quark hadronization process will be discussed.</description>

      <title>Baryon construction with $\eta^\prime$ meson field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the low-energy regime, baryons with $N_f \geq 2$ have long been constructed as skyrmions or through bag models, but such constructions for $N_f = 1$ are hindered by the trivial topological structure of the meson field. Recent proposals suggest that one-flavor baryons can instead be interpreted as quantum Hall droplets on the $\eta'$ domain wall, providing a possible link to quark-hadron continuity at high density. Retrospect to the qualitative or semi-qualitative construction of one-flavor baryon on $\eta'$ domain wall, one-flavor baryons can be described as quantum Hall droplets, resemble topological solitons, akin to skyrmions. Using the effective theory on the $\eta'$ domain wall which is conjectured to be the Chern-Simons-Higgs theory, it is discussed that its vortex solution with unit baryon number naturally has spin $N_c/2$ thus can be interpreted as baryon or multi-baryon structure, while particle-vortex duality suggests that quarks carry a fractional topological charge $1/N_c$ and obey fractional statistics. In terms of chiral bag models, confinement can be attributed to the monopoles confined within the bag, and the vector meson fields on the bag surface are essential for ensuring the correct baryon number in the chiral bag framework and thus provide deeper insights into baryons as nontrivial topological structures of the meson field. In this paper, we review the progress in this development with special interests in the $\eta^\prime$ domain wall dynamics. Naive extensions to $N_f\geq 2$ are also concerned.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically estimate the spacetime profile of the electromagnetic fields produced in intermediate-energy heavy-ion collisions $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.4-7.7\;{\rm GeV}$ for a wide range of impact parameters $b=0-9\;{\rm fm}$, using a hadronic cascade model JAM (Jet AA Microscopic transport model). We demonstrate that (1) the produced electromagnetic fields are as strong as $eE, eB = {\mathcal O}((50\;{\rm MeV})^2)$; (2) that the produced fields extend in spacetime about $V_4 = {\mathcal O}((10\;{\rm fm})^4)$; (3) that the magnetic field dominates around the collision point, while the other broad regions of spacetime are dominated by the electric field; and (4) that a topological electromagnetic-field configuration such that ${\bf E}\cdot {\bf B} \neq 0$ is realized.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I consider QCD$_2$ in the $N_c \to \infty$ limit at fixed $g^2N_c$. The derivation starts from equal-time $q\bar q$ bound states in coordinate space and temporal ($A^0=0$) gauge, avoiding the use of quark and gluon propagators. The wave function is given analytically by a $_1F_1$ function with an explicit frame dependence. In the Infinite Momentum Frame the Fourier transformed wave function satisfies the 't Hooft equation, however with contributions also from quarks with negative kinetic energy. This difference with previous analyses of the model may be related to boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Spin-Triplet Pairing in Heavy Nuclei is Stable Against Deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Any experimental evidence of nucleons paired in spin-triplet states will confirm the existence of an exotic phase of nuclear matter. This type of nuclear superfluidity has been hypothesized in heavy nuclei, where the antagonizing spin-orbit effects are damped, and there it oftentimes coexists with traditional spin-singlet pairing, leading to the possibility of mixed-spin pairing. Realistic nuclear deformation, not considered in such studies, could make-or-break these proposals, since its effect on triplet-pairing, and the competition (and coexistence) of the two superfluid phases, was expected to be crucial. We report on a thorough study on the effect of deformation on triplet-, singlet-, and mixed-spin pairing in the relevant region of the nuclear chart. We find that, at low isospin asymmetries, spin-triplet pairing is enhanced by deformation, while below the proton-drip line, the novel superfluid phase survives alongside the usual spin-singlet pairing. These results suggest that spin-triplet superfluidity exists in realistic nuclei and can be probed in the lab.</description>

Abstract: This study investigates the multiplicity information entropy of hadrons, anti-hadrons, baryons, and net-protons in central \(^{197}\)Au+\(^{197}\)Au collisions with impact parameters of 0$-$3 fm, using the ultrarelativistic quantum molecular dynamics model (UrQMD) across various center-of-mass energies (\(\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}\)) from 5.0 to 54.4 GeV. Our simulations employ hydrodynamic modes with different equations of state (EoS) and a default mode without hydrodynamics. The results reveal that the information entropies of baryons and net-protons are sensitive to the selected EoS. In particular, enhancements of the information entropies around \(\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} \sim 30\) GeV, especially with chiral hadron gas and Bag model EoS, indicate a phase transition or critical endpoint behavior. These findings highlight the importance of the EoS in understanding the thermodynamic properties of matter produced in high-energy collisions.</description>

      <title>Measurement of in-medium jet modification using direct photon+jet and $\pi^{0}$+jet correlations in $p+p$ and central Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 200$ GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00156v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The STAR Collaboration presents measurements of the semi-inclusive distribution of charged-particle jets recoiling from energetic direct-photon ($\gamma_{\rm dir}$) and neutral-pion ($\pi^{0}$) triggers in p+p and central Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ GeV over a broad kinematic range, for jet resolution parameters $R$=0.2 and 0.5. Medium-induced jet yield suppression is observed to be larger for $R$=0.2 than for 0.5, reflecting the angular range of jet energy redistribution due to quenching. The predictions of model calculations incorporating jet quenching are not fully consistent with the observations. These results provide new insight into the physical origins of jet quenching.</description>

      <title>Josephson currents in neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the interface between $S$-wave and $P$-wave paired superfluids in neutron stars induces a neutron supercurrent, a charge-neutral analog of the Josephson junction effect in electronic superconductors. The proton supercurrent entrainment by the neutron superfluid generates, in addition to the neutral supercurrent, a charged current across the interface. Beyond this stationary effect, the motion of the neutron vortex lines responding to secular changes in the neutron star's rotation rate induces a time-dependent oscillating Josephson current across this interface when proton flux tubes are dragged along with them. We show that such motion produces radiation from the interface once clusters of proton flux tubes intersect the interface. The power of radiation exceeds by orders of magnitude the Ohmic dissipation of currents in neutron stars. This effect appears to be phenomenologically significant enough to heat the star and alter its cooling rate during the photon cooling era.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Quadrupole Deformation using E$2$ and M$1+$E$2$ Transitions in Heavy Isotopes in the Mass Range of $150&lt;A&lt;250$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09272v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The measurement of a permanent electric dipole moment (EDM) in atoms is crucial for understanding the origins of CP-violation. However, accurate interpretation of the EDM in systems involving deformed isotopes requires the characterization of their deformation. While nuclear deformation is indicated in various structure models, there is substantial mutual disagreement between the theoretical models or between theoretical models and experimental values.
  Nuclear E$2$ transitions allow access to quantify quadrupole deformation, but these transitions are often mixed with M$1$ transitions. Both E$2$ and M$1$ transitions are well characterized by Weisskopf estimates, which rely on a single-particle approximation, but deviate due to collective nuclear deformations. Previously, Weisskopf estimates were only available for the mass range $A&lt;150$, and in this work we have extended the Weisskopf estimates of both E$2$ and M$1$ transition lifetimes to the mass range of $150\le A\le 250$.
  We comprehensively studied the deviation of E$2$ and M$1+$E$2$ transition lifetimes from the newly established Weisskopf estimates in $91$ candidate isotopes, by comparing the transition lifetimes of the candidate isotopes to their nearest even-even counterparts, whose E$2$ transition strengths are very well understood. Estimates of collective nuclear quadrupole deformation in $67$ of these isotopes were thus obtained, either from E$2$ or M$1+$E$2$ transition lifetimes. In $32$ cases they were obtained from both types of transitions independently, and are mutually consistent, as well as following the trends established in theory. We thereby identify the isotopes $^{223,225}$Fr, $^{221,223}$Ra, $^{223,225,227}$Ac and $^{229}$Pa, where EDM measurements are foreseen and information on nuclear deformation is needed, for which no measurement of nuclear quadrupole deformation has been made.</description>
