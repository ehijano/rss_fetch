      <title>Differentiation methods as a systematic uncertainty source in equation discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In differential equation discovery algorithms, numerical differentiation is usually a fixed preliminary step. Current methods improve robustness with data subsampling and sparsity but often ignore the variability from the differentiation method itself. We show that this choice systematically introduces uncertainty, affecting both equation form and parameter estimates. Our study indicates that high-resolution schemes can magnify measurement noise, while heavily regularized methods may mask real physical variations, which leads to method-dependent findings. By evaluating six differentiation techniques on various partial differential equations under diverse noise levels using SINDy and EPDE frameworks, we consistently notice methodological biases in the determined models. This underscores the importance of selecting differentiation methods as a key modeling choice and highlights a path to enhance ensemble-based discovery by diversifying methodologies.</description>

      <title>Parallel Heuristic Exploration for Additive Complexity Reduction in Fast Matrix Multiplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a parallel random-search method for reducing additive complexity in fast matrix multiplication. The approach replaces expensive exact evaluation with fast heuristic scoring, including the new Greedy-Intersections strategy. The method runs many independent common subexpression elimination processes in parallel, exploring the search space through random pair substitutions and diverse selection strategies while sharing promising partial solutions. Tested on 164 ternary-coefficient schemes, the method achieves lower addition counts than the state-of-the-art Greedy-Potential on 103 schemes, matches it on 59, and is outperformed on 2. For most schemes, it gives equal or better results while being much faster, making it practical for algorithm exploration. All software and results are open source.</description>

      <title>Oracle-Based Multistep Strategy for Solving Polynomial Systems Over Finite Fields and Algebraic Cryptanalysis of the Aradi Cipher</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09950v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The multistep solving strategy consists in a divide-and-conquer approach: when a multivariate polynomial system is computationally infeasible to solve directly, one variable is assigned over the elements of the base finite field, and the procedure is recursively applied to the resulting simplified systems. In a previous work by the same authors (among others), this approach proved effective in the algebraic cryptanalysis of the Trivium cipher.
  In this paper, we present a new recursive formulation of the corresponding algorithm based on a Depth-First Search strategy, along with a novel complexity analysis leveraging tree structures. We also introduce the notion of an "oracle function", which is intended to determine whether evaluating a new variable is required to simplify the current polynomial system. This notion allows us to unify all previously proposed variants of the multistep strategy, including the classical hybrid approach, by appropriately selecting the oracle function.
  Finally, we employ the multistep solving strategy in the cryptanalysis of the NSA's recently introduced low-latency block cipher Aradi, achieving a first full-round algebraic attack that exposes structural features in its symbolic model.</description>

      <title>ConceptGuard: Neuro-Symbolic Safety Guardrails via Sparse Interpretable Jailbreak Concepts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models have found success in a variety of applications. However, their safety remains a concern due to the existence of various jailbreaking methods. Despite significant efforts, alignment and safety fine-tuning only provide a certain degree of robustness against jailbreak attacks that covertly mislead LLMs towards the generation of harmful content. This leaves them prone to a range of vulnerabilities, including targeted misuse and accidental user profiling. This work introduces \textbf{ConceptGuard}, a novel framework that leverages Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to identify interpretable concepts within LLM internals associated with different jailbreak themes. By extracting semantically meaningful internal representations, ConceptGuard enables building robust safety guardrails -- offering fully explainable and generalizable defenses without sacrificing model capabilities or requiring further fine-tuning. Leveraging advances in the mechanistic interpretability of LLMs, our approach provides evidence for a shared activation geometry for jailbreak attacks in the representation space, a potential foundation for designing more interpretable and generalizable safeguards against attackers.</description>
