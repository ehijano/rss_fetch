      <title>New divergence measures between persistence diagrams and stability of vectorizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a filtration of simplicial complexes, one usually applies persistent homology and summarizes the results in barcodes. Then, in order to extract statistical information from these barcodes, one needs to compute statistical indicators over the bars of the barcode. An issue with this approach is that usually infinite bars must be deleted or cut to finite ones; however, so far there is no consensus on how to perform this procedure. In this work we propose for the first time a systematic way to analyze barcodes through the use of statistical indicators. Our approach is based on the minimization of a divergence measure that generalizes the standard Wasserstein or bottleneck distance to a new asymmetric distance-like function that we introduce and which is interesting on its own. In particular, we analyze the topology induced by this divergence and the stability of known vectorizations with respect to this topology.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Homotopy Theory via Simplicial Coalgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a commutative ring $R$, a $\pi_1$-$R$-equivalence is a continuous map of spaces inducing an isomorphism on fundamental groups and an $R$-homology equivalence between universal covers. When $R$ is an algebraically closed field, Raptis and Rivera described a full and faithful model for the homotopy theory of spaces up to $\pi_1$-$R$-equivalence by means of simplicial coalgebras considered up to a notion of weak equivalence created by a localized version of the Cobar functor. In this article, we prove a $G$-equivariant analog of this statement using a generalization of a celebrated theorem of Elmendorf. We also prove a more general result about modeling $G$-simplicial sets considered under a linearized version of quasi-categorical equivalence in terms of simplicial coalgebras.</description>

      <title>Applications of the circle product with a right $Com$-module to the theory of commutative ring spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If Com is the reduced commutative operad, the category of Com-algebras in spectra is the category of nounital commutative ring spectra. The theme of this survey is that many important constructions on Com-algebras are given by taking the derived circle product with well chosen right Com-modules. Examples of constructions arising this way include the tensor product of a based space K with such an algebra I, and TQ(I), the Topological Andre-Quillen homology spectrum of I. We then show how filtrations of right Com-modules can be used to filter such constructions. A natural decreasing filtration on right Com-modules, when specialized to the Com-bimodule Com, defines the augmentation ideal tower of I, built out of the extended powers of TQ(I). A natural increasing filtration on right Com-modules, when specialized to the right Com-module used to define TQ(I), defines a filtration on TQ(I) built out of I and the spaces in the Lie cooperad. There are two versions of this in the literature -- by the author and by Behrens and Rezk -- and our setting here makes it easy to prove that these agree. Much of this applies with Com replaced by a more general reduced operad, and we make a few remarks about this.</description>

      <title>Improving Mapper's Robustness by Varying Resolution According to Lens-Space Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an improvement to the Mapper algorithm that removes the assumption of a single resolution scale across semantic space, and improves the robustness of the results under change of parameters. This eases parameter selection, especially for datasets with highly variable local density in the Morse function $f$ used for Mapper. This is achieved by incorporating this density into the choice of cover for Mapper. Furthermore, we prove that for covers with some natural hypotheses, the graph output by Mapper still converges in bottleneck distance to the Reeb graph of the Rips complex of the data, but captures more topological features than when using the usual Mapper cover. Finally, we discuss implementation details, and include the results of computational experiments. We also provide an accompanying reference implementation.</description>

      <title>Dislocations and Fibrations: The Topological Structure of Knotted Smectic Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the topological properties of knotted defects in smectic liquid crystals. Our story begins with screw dislocations, whose radial surface structure can be smoothly accommodated on $S^3$ for fibred knots by using the corresponding knot fibration. To understand how a smectic texture may take on a screw dislocation in the shape of a knot without a fibration, we study first knotted edge defects. Unlike screw defects, knotted edge dislocations force singular points in the system for any non-trivial knot. We provide a lower bound on the number of such point defects required for a given edge dislocation knot and draw an analogy between the point defect structure of knotted edge dislocations and that of focal conic domains. By showing that edge dislocations, too, are sensitive to knot fibredness, we reinterpret the so-called Morse-Novikov points required for non-fibred screw dislocation knots as analogous smectic defects. Our methods are then applied to $+1/2$ and negative-charge disclinations in the smectic phase, furthering the analogy between knotted smectic defects and focal conic domains and uncovering an intricate relationship between point and line defects in smectic liquid crystals. The connection between smectic defects and knot theory not only unravels the uniquely topological knotting of smectic defects but also provides a mathematical and experimental playground for modern questions in knot and Morse-Novikov theory.</description>

      <title>A duality between Lie algebroids and infinitesimal foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are two natural analogues of algebraic foliations in derived algebraic geometry, called partition Lie algebroids and infinitesimal derived foliations, and both make sense in general characteristics. We construct an equivalence between these two notions under some finiteness conditions. Our method is refining the PD Koszul duality in \cite{BM}\cite{BCN} using the (completed) Hodge filtration.</description>

      <title>Operadic Fibrations and Unary Operadic 2-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce unary operadic 2-categories as a framework for operadic Grothendieck construction for categorical $\mathbb{O}$-operads, $\mathbb{O}$ being a unary operadic category. The construction is a fully faithful functor $\int_\mathbb{O}$ which takes categorical $\mathbb{O}$-operads to operadic functors over $\mathbb{O}$, and we characterise its essential image by certain lifting properties. Such operadic functors are called operadic fibration. Our theory is an extension of the discrete (unary) operadic case and, in some sense, of the classical Grothendieck construction of a categorical presheaf. For the terminal unary operadic category $\odot$, a categorical $\odot$-operad is a strict monoidal category $\mathscr{V}$ and its Grothendieck construction $\int_\odot \mathscr{V}$ is connected to the `Para' construction appearing in machine learning. The 2-categorical setting provides a characterisation of $\mathbb{O}$-operads valued in $\mathscr{V}$ as operadic functors $\mathbb{O} \to \int_\odot \mathscr{V}$. Last, we describe a left adjoint to $\int_\odot$.</description>

Abstract: We give a new proof of Dunn's additivity for the little $n$-cubes operads $C_n$, which has the advantage of being considerably shorter than the ones in the literature. At the end we remark on how our proof can be adjusted to work for the tensor product of a finite number of factors.</description>

      <title>The action of the Mapping Class Group on the fundamental group of the complement of a finite subset of a Riemann surface of positive genus</title>

Abstract: Let $T_{g,n}$ be a compact orientable topological surface of genus $g$ with $n$ marked points and let $M(g,n)$ denote its mapping class group. We study the action on the fundamental group of the surface induced by the self-homeomorphisms of the mapping class group by describing completely the case of positive genus. In order to do so, we use a presentation for the mapping class group with generators the Humphries generators and compute their images as elements of the outer automorphism group of the fundamental group, since the action is defined only up to conjugation.</description>

Abstract: We propose a toy model for symmetry-breaking or bubbling, in terms of cobordism of manifolds with circle actions free on a possible boundary. The Swan-Tate cohomology $t_\T E$ of a complex-oriented $E_\infty$ ring-spectrum $E$ is the extension of a Hopf algebra by its dual, which provides an algebraic rigidification of geometric interest. This note reviews the cases $E = H,K$ and $MU$, with special attention to $\lambda$-ring structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tambara functors arise in equivariant homotopy theory as the structure adherent to the homotopy groups of a coherently commutative equivariant ring spectrum. We show that if $k$ is a field-like $C_{p^n}$-Tambara functor, then $k$ is the coinduction of a field-like $C_{p^s}$-Tambara functor $\ell$ such that $\ell(C_{p^s}/e)$ is a field. If this field has characteristic other than $p$, we observe that $\ell$ must be a fixed-point Tambara functor, and if the characteristic is $p$, we determine all possible forms of $\ell$ through an analysis of the behavior of the Frobenius endomorphism and an application of Artin-Schreier theory.</description>

Abstract: We define a new algebra associated to a Legendrian submanifold $\Lambda$ of a contact manifold of the form $\mathbb{R}_{t} \times W$, called the planar diagram algebra and denoted $PDA(\Lambda, \mathcal{P})$. It is a non-commutative, filtered, differential graded algebra whose filtered stable tame isomorphism class is an invariant of $\Lambda$ together with a partition $\mathcal{P}$ of its connected components. When $\Lambda$ is connected, $PDA$ is the Chekanov-Eliashberg algebra. In general, the $PDA$ differential counts holomorphic disks with multiple positive punctures using a combinatorial framework inspired by string topology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.07916v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that virtually torsion-free, residually finite groups that are inner-amenable and non-amenable have the cheap 1-rebuilding property, a notion recently introduced by Ab\'ert, Bergeron, Fr\k{a}czyk and Gaboriau. As a consequence, the first $\ell^2$-Betti number with arbitrary field coefficients and log-torsion in degree 1 vanish for these groups. This extends results previously known for amenable groups to inner-amenable groups. We use a structure theorem of Tucker-Drob for inner-amenable groups showing the existence of a chain of q-normal subgroups.</description>

      <title>Filtration learning in exact multi-parameter persistent homology and classification of time-series data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To analyze the topological properties of the given discrete data, one needs to consider a continuous transform called filtration. Persistent homology serves as a tool to track changes of homology in the filtration. The outcome of the topological analysis of data varies depending on the choice of filtration, making the selection of filtration crucial. Filtration learning is an attempt to find an optimal filtration that minimizes the loss function. Exact Multi-parameter Persistent Homology (EMPH) has been recently proposed, particularly for topological time-series analysis, that utilizes the exact formula of rank invariant instead of calculating it. In this paper, we propose a framework for filtration learning of EMPH. We formulate an optimization problem and propose an algorithm for solving the problem. We then apply the proposed algorithm to several classification problems. Particularly, we derive the exact formula of the gradient of the loss function with respect to the filtration parameters, which makes it possible to directly update the filtration without using automatic differentiation, significantly enhancing the learning process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the Chow ring of a quasi-split geometrically almost simple algebraic group assuming the coefficients to be a field. This extends the classical computation for split groups done by Kac to the non-split quasi-split case. For the proof we introduce and study equivariant conormed Chow rings, which are well adapted to the study of quasi-split groups and their homogeneous varieties.</description>
