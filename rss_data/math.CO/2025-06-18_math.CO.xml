      <title>Factorizations in Geometric Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article investigates atomic decompositions in geometric lattices isomorphic to the partition lattice $\Pi(X)$ of a finite set $X$, a fundamental structure in lattice theory and combinatorics. We explore the role of atomicity in these lattices, building on concepts introduced by D.D. Anderson, D.F. Anderson, and M. Zafrullah within the context of factorization theory in commutative algebra. As part of the study, we first examine the main characteristics of the function $\mathfrak{N}\colon \Pi(X) \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$, which assigns to each partition $\pi$ the number of minimal atomic decompositions of $\pi$. We then consider a distinguished subset of atoms, $\mathcal{R}$, referred to as the set of red atoms, and derive a recursive formula for $\pmb{\pi}(X, j, s, \mathcal{R})$, which enumerates the rank-$j$ partitions expressible as the join of exactly $s$ red atoms.</description>

      <title>Short monochromatic odd cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is easy to see that every $k$-edge-colouring of the complete graph on $2^k+1$ vertices contains a monochromatic odd cycle. In 1973, Erd\H{o}s and Graham asked to estimate the smallest $L(k)$ such that every $k$-edge-colouring of $K_{2^k+1}$ contains a monochromatic odd cycle of length at most $L(k)$. Recently, Gir\~ao and Hunter obtained the first nontrivial upper bound by showing that $L(k)=O(\frac{2^k}{k^{1-o(1)}})$, which improves the trivial bound by a polynomial factor. We obtain an exponential improvement by proving that $L(k)=O(k^{3/2}2^{k/2})$. Our proof combines tools from algebraic combinatorics and approximation theory.</description>

      <title>Some remarks on Folkman graphs for triangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Folkman's theorem asserts the existence of graphs $G$ which are $K_4$-free, but which have the property that every two-coloring of $E(G)$ contains a monochromatic triangle. The quantitative aspects of $f(2,3,4)$, the least $n$ such that there exists an $n$-vertex graph with both properties above, are notoriously difficult; a series of improvements over the span of two decades witnessed the solution to two \$100 Erd\H{o}s problems, and the current record due to Lange, Radziszowski, and Xu now stands at $f(2,3,4) \leq 786$, the proof of which is computer-assisted.
  In this paper, we study Folkman-like properties of a sequence $H_q$ of finite geometric graphs constructed using Hermitian unitals over projective planes which were instrumental in the recent Mattheus-Verstra\"ete breakthrough on off-diagonal Ramsey numbers. We show that for all prime powers $q \geq 4$, there exists a subset $\mathcal{T}_q$ of triangles in $H_q$ such that no four span a $K_4$ in $H_q$, but every two-coloring of $E(H_q)$ induces a monochromatic triangle in $\mathcal{T}_q$. For $q=4$, this gives a graph on $208$ vertices with this "quasi-Folkman" property. Moreover, we show that a certain random alteration of $H_q$ which destroys all of its $K_4$'s will, for large $q$, maintain the Ramsey property with high probability.</description>

      <title>Positive $m$-divisible non-crossing partitions and their Kreweras maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study positive $m$-divisible non-crossing partitions and their positive Kreweras maps. In classical types, we describe their combinatorial realisations as certain non-crossing set partitions. We also realise these positive Kreweras maps as pseudo-rotations on a circle, respectively on an annulus. We enumerate positive $m$-divisible non-crossing partitions in classical types that are invariant under powers of the positive Kreweras maps with respect to several parameters. In order to cope with the exceptional types, we develop a different combinatorial model in general type describing positive $m$-divisible non-crossing partitions that are invariant under powers of the positive Kreweras maps. We finally show that altogether these results establish several cyclic sieving phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we construct a combinatorial quasi-free differential graded model for the Orlik-Solomon algebra of supersolvable matroids, which generalizes in a matroidal setting the cdga of admissible graphs introduced by M. Kontsevich for the braid arrangements. Our construction draws on well-known concepts from matroid theory, including modularity, single-element extensions, and generalized parallel connections. We also show that this model carries a cooperadic structure in a suitably generalized sense. As an application, we use this model to give a new proof that the Orlik-Solomon algebras of supersolvable matroids are Koszul.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian connectivity of some base-cobase graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been wide interest in understanding which properties of base graphs of matroids extend to base-cobase graphs of matroids. A significant result of Naddef and Pulleyblank (1984) shows that the $1$-skeleton of any $(0,1)$-polytope is either a hypercube, or Hamiltonian-connected, i.e. there is a Hamiltonian path connecting any two vertices. In particular, this is true for base graphs of matroids. A natural question raised by Farber, Richter, and Shank (1985) is whether this extends to base-cobase graphs.
  First, we use the polytopal approach to show Hamiltonian connectivity of base-cobase graphs of series-parallel extensions of lattice path matroids. On the other hand, we show that this method extends to only very special classes related to identically self-dual matroids. Second, we show that base-cobase graphs of wheels and whirls are Hamiltonian connected. Last, we show that the regular matroid $R_{10}$ yields a negative answer to the question of Farber, Richter, and Shank.</description>

      <title>Antimagic labelings of a complete graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In $1990$, Hartsfield and Ringel introduced antimagic graphs. Hartsfield and Ringel conjectured that every connected graph (and in particular, a tree) except $K_2$ is antimagic. In $2010$, Hefetz et al.\ raised two questions: Is every orientation of any simple connected undirected graph antimagic? and Given any undirected graph $G$, does there exist an orientation of $G$ which is antimagic? They call such an orientation an {\it antimagic orientation} of $G$. Recently, Bhavale provided an edge labeling for a given graph on $n$ vertices without isolated vertices. In this paper, using the labeling of Bhavale, we prove that a complete graph $K_n$ for $n \geq 3$ is super antimagic as well as totally antimagic total graph. We also prove that there exists an antimagic orientation of $K_n$ for $n \geq 3$.</description>

      <title>Structured and Punctured Nullstellens\"atze</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Nullstellensatz is a theorem providing information on polynomials that vanish on a certain set: David Hilbert's Nullstellensatz (1893) is a cornerstone of algebraic geometry, and Noga Alon's Combinatorial Nullstellensatz (1999) is a powerful tool in the "Polynomial Method", a technique used in combinatorics. Alon's Theorem excludes that a polynomial vanishing on a grid contains a monomial with certain properties. This theorem has been generalized in several directions, two of which we will consider in detail: Terence Tao and Van H. Vu (2006), Uwe Schauz (2008) and Micha\l{} Laso\'n (2010) exclude more monomials, and recently, Bogdan Nica (2023) improved the result for grids with additional symmetries in their side edges. Simeon Ball and Oriol Serra (2009) incorporated the multiplicity of zeros and gave Nullstellens\"atze for punctured grids, which are sets of the form $X \setminus Y$ with both $X,Y$ grids.
  We generalize some of these results; in particular, we provide a common generalization to the results of Schauz and Nica. To this end, we establish that during multivariate polynomial division, certain monomials are unaffected. This also allows us to generalize Pete L. Clark's proof of the nonzero counting theorem by Alon and F\"uredi to punctured grids.</description>

      <title>Posets for Specht ideals of essential real reflection groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Specht ideals are symmetric ideals in the polynomial ring generated by Specht polynomials associated with group representations. These ideals were previously studied for reflection groups of types $A$ and $B$, where their inclusion relations and their varieties reflect rich combinatorial structures. In this paper, we extend this theory to type $D$ and the dihedral groups. Our results complete the combinatorial study of Specht ideals across all infinite families of essential real reflection groups.</description>

      <title>Inverse eigenvalue problem for discrete Schr\"odinger operators of a graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A discrete Schr\"odinger operator of a graph $G$ is a real symmetric matrix whose $i,j$-entry, $i \neq j$, is negative if $\{i,j\}$ is an edge and zero if it is not an edge, while diagonal entries can be any real numbers. The discrete Schr\"odinger operators have been used to study vibration theory and the Colin de Verdi\`ere parameter. The inverse eigenvalue problem for discrete Schr\"odinger operators of a graph aims to characterize the possible spectra among discrete Schr\"odinger operators of a graph. Comparing to the inverse eigenvalue problem of a graph, the answers turn out to be more limited, and several restrictions based on graph structure are given. Using the strong properties, analogous versions of the supergraph lemma, the liberation lemma, and the bifurcation lemma are established. Using these results, the inverse eigenvalue problem for discrete Schr\"odinger operators is resolved for each graph with at most $5$ vertices.</description>

      <title>Is it easy to regularize a hypergraph with easy links?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A partition of a (hyper)graph is $\varepsilon$-homogenous if the edge densities between almost all clusters are either at most $\varepsilon$ or at least $1-\varepsilon$. Suppose a $3$-graph has the property that the link of every vertex has an $\varepsilon$-homogenous partition of size $\text{poly}(1/\varepsilon)$. Does this guarantee that the $3$-graph also has a small homogenous partition? Terry and Wolf proved that such a $3$-graph has an $\varepsilon$-homogenous partition of size given by a wowzer-type function. Terry recently improved this to a double exponential bound, and conjectured that this bound is tight. Our first result in this paper disproves this conjecture by giving an improved (single) exponential bound, which is best possible. We further obtain an analogous result for $k$-graphs of all uniformities $k \geq 3$.
  The above problem is part of a much broader programme which seeks to understand the conditions under which a (hyper)graph has small $\varepsilon$-regular partitions. While this problem is fairly well understood for graphs, the situation is (as always) much more involved already for $3$-graphs. For example, it is natural to ask if one can strengthen our first result by only requiring each link to have $\varepsilon$-regular partitions of size $\text{poly}(1/\varepsilon)$. Our second result shows that surprisingly the answer is `no', namely, a $3$-graph might only have regular partitions of tower-type size, even though the link of every vertex has an $\varepsilon$-regular partition of polynomial size.</description>

Abstract: We present a new tool for data analysis: persistence discrete homology, which is well-suited to analyze filtrations of graphs. In particular, we provide a novel way of representing high-dimensional data as a filtration of graphs using pairwise correlations. We discuss several applications of these tools, e.g., in weather and financial data, comparing them to the standard methods used in the respective fields.</description>

      <title>Efficient space reduction techniques by optimized majority rules for the Kemeny aggregation problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kemeny aggregation problem consists of computing the consensus rankings of an election with respect to the Kemeny-Young voting method. These aggregated rankings are the geometric medians as well as the maximum likelihood estimators in the Mallows model of the rankings in the election under the Kendall-tau distance which counts the number of pairwise disagreements. The problem admits fundamental applications in various domains such as computational social choice, machine learning, operations research, and biology but its computational complexity is unfortunately expensive. In this paper, we establish optimized quantitative extensions of the well-known 3/4-majority rule of Betzler et al. and the Major Order Theorem of Hamel and Milosz for the Kemeny aggregation problem. By taking into account the extra information available in the problem such as the number of candidates and by considering an additional optimization of certain piecewise linear functions in one variable, our results achieve significantly more refined space reduction techniques as illustrated by experimental results on real and synthetic data without increasing the time complexity of the algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A long-standing open problem in representation stability is whether every finitely generated commutative algebra in the category of strict polynomial functors satisfies the noetherian property. In this paper, we resolve this problem negatively over fields of positive characteristic using ideas from invariant theory. Specifically, we consider the algebra $P$ of polarizations of elementary symmetric polynomials inside the ring of all multisymmetric polynomials in $p \times \infty$ variables. We show $P$ is not noetherian based on two key facts: (1) the $p$-th power of every multisymmetric polynomial is in $P$ (our main technical result) and (2) the ring of multisymmetric polynomials is Frobenius split.</description>

      <title>New Bounds and Constructions for Variable Packet-Error Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of variable packet-error coding, which emerges in network communication scenarios where a source transmits information to a destination through multiple disjoint paths. The objective is to design codes with dynamic error-correcting capabilities that adapt to varying numbers of errors. Specifically, we first provide several bounds on the rate--distortion trade-off for general variable packet-error coding schemes. Then, we present two explicit constructions of variable packet-error coding schemes. The first construction uses higher-order MDS codes and provides a coding scheme that achieves a better rate--distortion trade-off compared to known results for general parameter regimes. The second construction is based on a variant of the repetition code and yields a coding scheme with an optimal rate--distortion trade-off, with respect to our bound, for certain parameter regimes.</description>

      <title>The large $N$ factorization does not hold for arbitrary multi-trace observables in random tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider real tensors of order $D$, that is $D$-dimensional arrays of real numbers $T_{a^1a^2 \dots a^D}$, where each index $a^c$ can take $N$ values. The tensor entries $T_{a^1a^2 \dots a^D}$ have no symmetry properties under permutations of the indices. The invariant polynomials built out of the tensor entries are called trace invariants.
  We prove that for a Gaussian random tensor with $D\ge 3$ indices (that is such that the entries $T_{a^1a^2 \dots a^D}$ are independent identically distributed Gaussian random variables) the cumulant, or connected expectation, of a product of trace invariants is not always suppressed in scaling in $N$ with respect to the product of the expectations of the individual invariants. Said otherwise, not all the multi-trace expectations factor at large $N$ in terms of the single-trace ones and the Gaussian scaling is not subadditive on the connected components. This is in stark contrast to the $D=2$ case of random matrices in which the multi-trace expectations always factor at large $N$. The best one can do for $D\ge 3$ is to identify restricted families of invariants for which the large $N$ factorization holds and we check that this indeed happens when restricting to the family of melonic observables, the dominant family in the large $N$ limit.</description>

      <title>A Linear Kernel for Planar Vector Domination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$, an integer $k\geq 0$, and a non-negative integral function $f:V(G) \rightarrow \mathcal{N}$, the Vector Domination problem asks whether a set $S$ of vertices, of cardinality $k$ or less, exists in $G$ so that every vertex $v \in V(G)\setminus S$ has at least $f(v)$ neighbors in $S$. The problem generalizes several domination problems and it has also been shown to generalize Bounded-Degree Vertex Deletion (BDVD). In this paper, the parameterized version of Vector Domination is studied when the input graph is planar. A linear problem kernel is presented. A direct consequence is a kernel bound for BDVD that is linear in the parameter $k$ only. Previously known bounds are functions of both the target degree and the input parameter.</description>

      <title>Modified difference ascent sequences and Fishburn structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ascent sequences and their modified version play a central role in the bijective framework relating several combinatorial structures counted by the Fishburn numbers. Ascent sequences are positive integer sequences defined by imposing a bound on the growth of their entries in terms of the number of ascents contained in the corresponding prefix, while modified ascent sequences are the image of ascent sequences under the so-called hat map. By relaxing the notion of ascent, Dukes and Sagan have recently introduced difference ascent sequences. Here we define modified difference ascent sequences and study their combinatorial properties. Inversion sequences are a superset of the difference ascent sequences and we extend the hat map to this domain. Our extension depends on a parameter which we specialize to obtain a new set of permutations counted by the Fishburn numbers and characterized by a subdiagonality property.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A real matrix is said to be positive if its every entry is positive, and a real square matrix A is algebraically positive if there exists a real polynomial f such that f(A) is a positive matrix. A sign pattern matrix A is said to require a property if all matrices having sign pattern as A have that property. In this paper, we characterize all sign pattern matrices associated with cycle graphs that require algebraic positivity.</description>

Abstract: Recently, Chen, He, Hu and Xie considered the number of non-overlined (resp. overlined) parts of size greater than or equal to the size of the smallest overlined (resp. non-overlined) part in an overpartition. In this article, we will study the remaining four cases. Furthermore, we will investigate the number of non-overlined (resp. overlined) parts of size less than or equal to the size of the largest overlined (resp. non-overlined) part in an overpartition.</description>

      <title>3-path-connectivity of bubble-sort star graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a simple connected graph with vertex set $V(G)$ and edge set $E(G)$. Let $T$ be a subset of $ V(G)$ with cardinality $|T|\geq2$. A path connecting all vertices of $T$ is called a $T$-path of $G$. Two $T$-paths $P_i$ and $P_j$ are said to be internally disjoint if $V(P_i)\cap V(P_j)=T$ and $E(P_i)\cap E(P_j)=\emptyset$. Denote by $\pi_G(T)$ the maximum number of internally disjoint $T$- paths in G. Then for an integer $\ell$ with $\ell\geq2$, the $\ell$-path-connectivity $\pi_\ell(G)$ of $G$ is formulated as $\min\{\pi_G(T)\,|\,T\subseteq V(G)$ and $|T|=\ell\}$. In this paper, we study the $3$-path-connectivity of $n$-dimensional bubble-sort star graph $BS_n$. By deeply analyzing the structure of $BS_n$, we show that $\pi_3(BS_n)=\lfloor\frac{3n}2\rfloor-3$, for any $n\geq3$.</description>

      <title>Unimodality of the number of paths per length on polytopes: Examples, counter-examples, and central limit theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To solve a linear program, the simplex method follows a path in the graph of a polytope, on which a linear function increases. The length of this path is an key measure of the complexity of the simplex method. Numerous previous articles focused on the longest paths, or, following Borgwardt, computed the average length of a path for certain random polytopes. We detail more precisely how this length is distributed, i.e., how many paths of each length there are.
  It was conjectured by De Loera that the number of paths counted according to their length forms a unimodal sequence. We give examples (old and new) for which this holds; but we disprove this conjecture by constructing counterexamples for several classes of polytopes. However, De Loera is "statistically correct": We prove that the length of coherent paths on a random polytope (with vertices chosen uniformly on a sphere) admits a central limit theorem.</description>

Abstract: A hypergroup is called an elementary abelian 2-hypergroup if it is a constrained direct product of the closed subsets of two elements. In this paper, the elementary abelian 2-hypergroups are studied. All closed subsets and all strongly normal closed subsets of the elementary abelian 2-hypergroups are determined. The numbers of all closed subsets and all strongly normal closed subsets of the elementary abelian 2-hypergroups are given. A criterion for the isomorphic closed subsets of the elementary abelian 2-hypergroups is displayed. The automorphism groups of all closed subsets of the elementary abelian 2-hypergroups are presented.</description>

      <title>On the structure of perfectly divisible graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is perfectly divisible if every induced subgraph $H$ of $G$ contains a set $X$ of vertices such that $X$ meets all largest cliques of $H$, and $X$ induces a perfect graph. The chromatic number of a perfectly divisible graph $G$ is bounded by $\omega^2$ where $\omega$ denotes the number of vertices in a largest clique of $G$. A graph $G$ is minimally non-perfectly divisible if $G$ is not perfectly divisible but each of its proper induced subgraph is. A set $C$ of vertices of $G$ is a clique cutset if $C$ induces a clique in $G$, and $G-C$ is disconnected. We prove that a $P_5$-free minimally non-perfectly divisible graph cannot contain a clique cutset. This result allows us to re-establish several theorems on the perfect divisibility of some classes of $P_5$-free graphs. We will show that recognizing perfectly divisible graphs is NP-hard.</description>

Abstract: The 1-2 conjecture posits that for every graph, weights from $\{1,2\}$ can be assigned to its vertices and edges so that adjacent vertices have distinct weighted degrees. This paper demonstrates that any set of two distinct real numbers $\{a,b\}$ can achieve the same goal, thereby confirming the 1-2 conjecture in a broader context.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2108.12927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Taking a representation-theoretic viewpoint, we construct a continuous associahedron motivated by the realization of the generalized associahedron in the physical setting. We show that our associahedron shares important properties with the generalized associahedron of type A. Our continuous associahedron is convex and manifests a cluster theory: the points which correspond to the clusters are on its boundary, and the edges that correspond to mutations are given by intersections of hyperplanes. This requires development of several methods that are continuous analogues of discrete methods. We conclude the paper by showing that there is a sequence of embeddings of type A generalized associahedra into our continuous associahedron.</description>

      <title>No new lower bound for the density of planar Sets avoiding Unit Distances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10076v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recently published article by G. Ambrus et al. a new \emph{upper bound} for the density of an unit avoiding, periodic set is given as $0.2470$, the first upper bound $&lt; 1/4$. A construction of Croft 1967 gave a \emph{lower bound} $\delta_C = 0.22936$ for the density. To this date, no better construction with a higher bound has been given. In the \emph{first versions} of this article I gave a construction of planar sets with a "higher" density than Croft's tortoises. No explicit value for this density was given, it was just shown that Croft's density is a local minima in the density of the constructed 1-parameter family of planar sets. But now I found a servere error. After the correction in this article none of the investigated sets of constant diameter resulted in a new lower bound. I did not withdraw the article, maybe something could be useful for somebody.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new class of numerical methods for solving stochastic differential equations with additive noise on general Riemannian manifolds with high weak order of accuracy. In opposition to the popular approach with projection methods, the proposed methods are intrinsic: they only rely on geometric operations and avoid coordinates and embeddings. We provide a robust and general convergence analysis and an algebraic formalism of exotic planar Butcher series for the computation of order conditions at any high order. To illustrate the methodology, an explicit method of second weak order is introduced, and several numerical experiments confirm the theoretical findings and extend the approach for the sampling of the invariant measure of Riemannian Langevin dynamics.</description>
