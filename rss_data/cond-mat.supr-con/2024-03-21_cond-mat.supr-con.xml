      <title>Hybridization induced triplet superconductivity with $S^z=0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kitaev superconducting chain is a model of spinless fermions with triplet-like superconductivity. It has raised interest since for some values of its parameters it presents a non-trivial topological phase that host Majorana fermions. The physical realization of a Kitaev chain is complicated by the scarcity of triplet superconductivity in real physical systems. Many proposals have been put forward to overcome this difficulty and fabricate artificial triplet superconducting chains. In this work we study a superconducting chain of spinful fermions forming Cooper pairs, in a triplet $S=1$ state, but with $S^z=0$. The motivation is that such pairing can be induced in chains that couple through an antisymmetric hybridization to an s-wave superconducting substrate. We study the nature of edge states and the topological properties of these chains. In the presence of a magnetic field the chain can sustain gapless superconductivity with pairs of Fermi points. The momentum space topology of these Fermi points is non-trivial, in the sense that they can only disappear by annihilating each other. For small magnetic fields, we find well defined degenerate edge modes with finite Zeemann energy. These modes are not symmetry protected and decay abruptly in the bulk as their energy merges with the continuum of excitations.</description>

      <title>Exploring Fermi Surface Nesting and the Nature of Heavy Quasiparticles in the Spin-Triplet Superconductor Candidate CeRh$_2$As$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the electronic structure of a spin-triplet superconductor candidate CeRh$_2$As$_2$ using high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. Notably, Fermi surface nesting hints at connections to magnetic excitation or quadrupole density wave phenomena, elucidating the superconducting mechanisms. Measured band structures reveal primarily localized 4f electrons, with minor itinerant contributions. Additionally, a transition from localized to itinerant behavior and significant c-f hybridization anisotropy underscore the role of f-electrons in shaping electronic properties. These findings deepen our understanding of CeRh$_2$As$_2$'s unconventional superconductivity and magnetism. Further exploration promises advances in superconductivity research.</description>

      <title>On the lineshapes of temperature-dependent transport measurements of superconductors under pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent reports of superconductivity in the vicinity of room temperature have been the subject of discussion by the community. Specifically, features in the resistance-temperature (R-T) relations have raised questions. We show that many of these features can arise from previously unaccounted-for dynamic effects associated with the AC transport techniques often used in high-pressure experiments. These dynamic AC effects can can cause the apparent resistance (Rapparent) to diverge from the DC resistance (RDC), sharpen measured superconducting transitions, and produce other features in the measured R-T response. We also show that utilizing the full output of phase-sensitive transport measurements provides a valuable probe of superconducting samples in difficult to measure systems</description>

      <title>Binding zero modes with fluxons in Josephson junctions of time-reversal invariant topological superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the joint dynamics of the phase bias $\phi$ and the propagating Majorana fermions of the edge modes in Josephson junctions containing 2D time-reversal invariant topological superconductors (TRITOPS). We consider TRITOPS-TRITOPS junctions, as well as junctions between topological and non-topological superconductors (TRITOPS-S). Both types of junctions are described by effective Dirac Hamiltonians with a $\phi$-dependent mass. We analyze the effect of the phase fluctuations in the junction, as well as solitonic solutions of $\phi$ generated by fluxons trapped in the junction. We show that these solitons generate a spatial-dependent mass with a sign change akin to the Jackiw-Rebbi model. This enables the formation of zero-energy fermionic states localized at the fluxon. For the TRITOPS-TRITOPS junction these consist of a Kramers pair of Majorana modes, while for the TRITOPS-S one, there is a single Majorana fermion. The localized bound states hybridize in soliton-antisoliton configurations. Depending on the occupation state, these modes generate an effective attraction or repulsion in the dynamics of the soliton-antisoliton collision.</description>

      <title>Absence of phonon-mediated superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent experimental study announced the emergence of superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure, with the highest observed superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) reaching approximately 80 K beyond 14 GPa. While extensive studies have been devoted to the electronic correlations and potential superconducting pairing mechanisms, there lack investigations into the phonon properties and electron phonon coupling. Using density functional theory in conjunction with Wannier interpolation techniques, we study the phonon properties and electron phonon interactions in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under 29.5 GPa. Our findings reveal that the electron phonon coupling is insufficient to solely explain the observed high superconducting $T_c$ $\sim$ 80 K in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. And the calculated strong Fermi surface nesting may explain the experimental observed charge density wave transition in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Our calculations substantiate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is an unconventional superconductor.</description>

      <title>Pressure-induced enhancement of superconductivity in a non-centrosymmetric compound LaPtGe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a pressure-induced enhancement of the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) in a non-centrosymmetric (NCS) compound, LaPtGe. With pressure, till 3 GPa, we observed a modest enhancement of the Tc with a rate of 0.071 K/GPa. However, above this pressure, the rate showed a ~2.5 times increase, 0.183 K/GPa. We observed a Tc of 3.94 K at 6 GPa, the highest pressure value used in our transport study. Synchrotron high-pressure x-ray powder diffraction (HP-XRPD) measurements do not reveal any structural phase transition in this system in this pressure range. However, it showed an apparent change of slope in the pressure dependence of lattice parameters above and below 3 GPa. Pressure dependence of the unit-cell volume also followed a distinct trend below and above 3 GPa, with the Birch-Murnaghan equation of state fit providing a bulk modulus (B0) value of ~144 and ~162 GPa, respectively, for two pressure regions. Further, the magnetotransport measurement under pressure up to 2.45 GPa reveals the enhancement of the upper critical field (Hc2(0)) from 0.7 T (0 GPa) to 0.92 T (2.45 GPa). In addition, the upward curvature in Hc2(T) becomes stronger with increasing pressure, suggesting a change of the underlying Fermi surface topology with pressure. The signature for the inducible Hc2(T) with pressure, the distinct enhancement of Tc around 3 GPa, and the noticeable change in lattice parameters around 3 GPa suggests the possibility of multi-gap superconductivity in LaPtGe similar to identical structure NCS compound, LaPtSi. The enhancement of Tc by pressure can be correlated with the possible underlying lattice modulation by compression and the change in the density of states at the Fermi level. Also, the bare change in pressure-dependent activation energy U0 up to 2.45 GPa calculated using the Arrhenius relation clearly shows that the shift in Tc does not arise from grain boundaries.</description>

      <title>From Local to Emergent Altermagnetism: Footprints of Free Fermions Band Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets are crystallographic rotational symmetry breaking spin-ordered states, possessing a net zero magnetization despite manifesting Kramers non-degenerate bands. Here, we show that momentum-independent local spin nematic orders in monolayer, Bernal bilayer and rhombohedral trilayer graphene give rise to $p$-wave, $d$-wave and $f$-wave altermagnets, respectively, thereby inheriting the free-fermion topology of linear, bi-quadratic and bi-cubic band touchings that are also described in terms of angular momentum $\ell=1,\; 2$ and $3$ spherical harmonics in the reciprocal space. The same conclusions also hold inside a nematic spin-triplet superconductor, featuring Majorana altermagnets. Altogether, these findings highlight the importance of electronic band structure in identifying such exotic magnetic orders in real materials. We depict the effects of in-plane magnetic fields on altermagnets, and showcase a novel spin-disordered alter-valleymagnet phase.</description>

      <title>Boosting fluxons for ballistic-logic power using an Aharonov-Casher ring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.05021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconducting logic is fast and energy-efficient relative to CMOS, but also fundamental studies are needed to scale up circuits for greater utility. Recently, ballistic shift registers for single-flux quanta (SFQ) bits were shown in simulation to allow high-efficiency superconducting gates. However, these gates are unpowered such that the bits slow after each gate operation and only a short sequence of gates is possible without added power. Here we show that a circuit based on an Aharonov-Casher ring can power these shift registers by boosting the bit velocity to a constant value, despite their unusual bit states constituted by two polarities of SFQ. As a step in its operation, each bit state is forced into a different ring arm and then accelerated. The circuit dynamics depend on various circuit parameters and choices of how to merge the bit-state paths. One design from each merge design choice is proposed to enable scaling up to an array of gates by adding serial biasing in a relatively simple way. We find adequate performance for ballistic logic in terms of boosted velocity, energy efficiency, and parameter margins. We also discuss the circuit's classical barriers; in a different regime this relates to the Aharonov-Casher effect.</description>

      <title>Pressure Driven Fractionalization of Ionic Spins Results in Cupratelike High-$T_c$ Superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Beyond 14GPa of pressure, bi-layered La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ was recently found to develop strong superconductivity above the liquid nitrogen boiling temperature. An immediate essential question is the pressure-induced qualitative change of electronic structure that enables the exciting high-temperature superconductivity. We investigate this timely question via a numerical multi-scale derivation of effective many-body physics. At the atomic scale, we first clarify that the system has a strong charge transfer nature with itinerant carriers residing mainly in the in-plane oxygen between spin-1 Ni$^{2+}$ ions. We then elucidate in eV- and sub-eV-scale the key physical effect of the applied pressure: It induces a cupratelike electronic structure through partially screening the Ni spin from 1 to 1/2. This suggests a high-temperature superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ with microscopic mechanism and ($d$-wave) symmetry similar to that in the cuprates.</description>

      <title>Structural transitions, octahedral rotations, and electronic properties of $A_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ rare-earth nickelates under high pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent observation of superconductivity with $T_c \sim 80$ K in pressurized La3Ni2O7 [Nature 621, 493 (2023)], we explore the structural and electronic properties in A3Ni2O7 bilayer nickelates (A=La-Lu, Y, Sc) as a function of hydrostatic pressure (0-150 GPa) from first principles including a Coulomb repulsion term. At $\sim 20$ GPa, we observe an orthorhombic-to-tetragonal transition in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at variance with recent x-ray diffraction data, which points to so-far unresolved complexities at the onset of superconductivity, e.g., charge doping by variations in the oxygen stoichiometry. We compile a structural phase diagram with particular emphasis on the $b/a$ ratio, octahedral anisotropy, and octahedral rotations. Intriguingly, chemical and external pressure emerge as two distinct and counteracting control parameters. We find unexpected correlations between $T_c$ and the in-plane Ni-O-Ni bond angles for La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Moreover, two novel structural phases with significant $c^+$ octahedral rotations and in-plane bond disproportionations are uncovered for A=Nd-Lu, Y, Sc that exhibit a surprising pressure-driven electronic reconstruction in the Ni $e_g$ manifold. By disentangling the involvement of basal versus apical oxygen states at the Fermi surface, we identify Tb$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ as an interesting candidate for superconductivity at ambient pressure. These results suggest a profound tunability of the structural and electronic phases in this novel materials class and are key for a fundamental understanding of the superconductivity mechanism.</description>

      <title>Absence of a dissipative quantum phase transition in Josephson junctions: Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain the reduced density matrix of a resistively shunted Josephson junction (RSJ), using the stochastic Liouville equation method in imaginary time - an exact numerical scheme based on the Feynman-Vernon influence functional. For all parameters investigated, we find that shunting a junction makes it more superconducting. We find no trace of the Schmid superconducting-insulating quantum phase transition long believed to occur in the RSJ. This work confirms theoretically a similar conclusion drawn in 2020 by Murani et al., based on experimental observations. We reveal that resistors with no UV cutoff always yield a fully localized phase and we explain how previous works predicting an insulating state came to obtain a contrary result.</description>

      <title>Exact hole-induced $SU(N)$ flavor-singlets in certain $U=\infty$ $SU(N)$ Hubbard models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the motion of a single hole induces $SU(N)$ flavor-singlets in the $U=\infty$ $SU(N)$ (Fermi) Hubbard model on a Husimi-like tree graph. The result is also generalized to certain $t$-$J$ models with antiferromagnetic interactions and singlet hopping terms typically neglected in the literature. This is an $SU(N)$ generalization of the "counter-Nagaoka theorem" introduced in [Phys. Rev. B 107, L140401 (2023)]. Our results suggest the existence of antiferromagnetic or resonating-valence-bond (RVB)-like polarons in the $t$-$J$ models on a more realistic non-bipartite lattice. Such antiferromagnetic/RVB polarons may be relevant for a novel strong-coupling mechanism of superconductivity or other exotic fractionalized phases of matter.</description>

      <title>Parafermions with symmetry-protected non-Abelian statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Abelian anyons have garnered extensive attention for obeying exotic non-Abelian statistics and having potential applications to fault-tolerant quantum computing. While the prior research has predominantly focused on non-Abelian statistics without the necessity of symmetry protection, recent progresses have shown that symmetries can play essential roles and bring a notion of the symmetry-protected non-Abelian (SPNA) statistics. In this work, we extend the concept of SPNA statistics to strongly-correlated systems which host parafermion zero modes (PZMs). This study involves a few fundamental results proved here. First, we unveil a generic unitary symmetry mechanism that protects PZMs from local couplings. Then, with this symmetry protection, the PZMs can be categorized into two nontrivial sectors, each maintaining its own parity conservation, even though the whole system cannot be dismantled into separate subsystems due to nonlinear interactions. Finally, by leveraging the parity conservation of each sector and the general properties of the effective braiding Hamiltonian, we prove rigorously that the PZMs intrinsically obey SPNA statistics. To further confirm the results, we derive the braiding matrix at a tri-junction. We also propose a correlated quantum nanowire model that accommodates a pair of PZMs protected by mirror symmetry and satisfying the generic theory. This work shows a broad spectrum of strongly-correlated systems capable of hosting fractional SPNA quasiparticles and enriches our comprehension of fundamental quantum statistics linked to the symmetries that govern the exchange dynamics.</description>
