      <title>Random Utility with Aggregated Alternatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies when discrete choice data involving aggregated alternatives such as categorical data or an outside option can be rationalized by a random utility model (RUM). Aggregation introduces ambiguity in composition: the underlying alternatives may differ across individuals and remain unobserved by the analyst. We characterize the observable implications of RUMs under such ambiguity and show that they are surprisingly weak, implying only monotonicity with respect to adding aggregated alternatives and standard RUM consistency on unaggregated menus. These are insufficient to justify the use of an aggregated RUM. We identify two sufficient conditions that restore full rationalizability: non-overlapping preferences and menu-independent aggregation. Simulations show that violations of these conditions generate estimation bias, highlighting the practical importance of how aggregated alternatives are defined.</description>

      <title>Generative AI and Organizational Structure in the Knowledge Economy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The adoption of GenAI is fundamentally reshaping organizations in the knowledge economy. GenAI can significantly enhance workers' problem-solving abilities and productivity, yet it also presents a major reliability challenge: hallucinations, or errors presented as plausible outputs. This study develops a theoretical model to examine GenAI's impact on organizational structure and the role of human-in-the-loop oversight. Our findings indicate that successful GenAI adoption hinges primarily on maintaining hallucination rates below a critical level. After adoption, as GenAI advances in capability or reliability, organizations optimize their workforce by reducing worker knowledge requirements while preserving operational effectiveness through GenAI augmentation-a phenomenon known as deskilling. Unexpectedly, enhanced capability or reliability of GenAI may actually narrow the span of control, increasing the demand for managers rather than flattening organizational hierarchies. To effectively mitigate hallucination risks, many firms implement human-in-the-loop validation, where managers review GenAI-enhanced outputs before implementation. While the validation increases managerial workload, it can, surprisingly, expand the span of control, reducing the number of managers needed. Furthermore, human-in-the-loop validation influences GenAI adoption differently based on validation costs and hallucination rates, deterring adoption in low-error, high-cost scenarios, while promoting it in high-error, low-cost cases. Finally, productivity improvements from GenAI yield distinctive organizational shifts: as productivity increases, firms tend to employ fewer but more knowledgeable workers, gradually expanding managerial spans of control.</description>

      <title>Constant-Factor Algorithms for Revenue Management with Consecutive Stays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study network revenue management problems motivated by applications such as railway ticket sales and hotel room bookings. Request types that require a resource for consecutive stays sequentially arrive with known arrival probabilities. We investigate two scenarios: the reject-or-accept scenario, where the request can be fulfilled by any available resource, and the choice-based scenario, which generalizes the former by incorporating customer preferences through basic attraction models. We develop constant-factor approximation algorithms: $1-1/e$ for the reject-or-accept scenario and $0.125$ for the choice-based scenario.</description>

      <title>Near-feasible Fair Allocations in Two-sided Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study resource allocation in two-sided markets from a fundamental perspective and introduce a general modeling and algorithmic framework to effectively incorporate the complex and multidimensional aspects of fairness. Our main technical contribution is to show the existence of a range of near-feasible resource allocations parameterized in different model primitives to give flexibility when balancing the different policymaking requirements, allowing policy designers to fix these values according to the specific application. To construct our near-feasible allocations, we start from a fractional resource allocation and perform an iterative rounding procedure to get an integer allocation. We show a simple yet flexible and strong sufficient condition for the target feasibility deviations to guarantee that the rounding procedure succeeds, exhibiting the underlying trade-offs between market capacities, agents' demand, and fairness. To showcase our framework's modeling and algorithmic capabilities, we consider three prominent market design problems: school allocation, stable matching with couples, and political apportionment. In each of them, we obtain strengthened guarantees on the existence of near-feasible allocations capturing the corresponding fairness notions, such as proportionality, envy-freeness, and stability.</description>

      <title>Learning Macroeconomic Policies through Dynamic Stackelberg Mean-Field Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12093v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Macroeconomic outcomes emerge from individuals' decisions, making it essential to model how agents interact with macro policy via consumption, investment, and labor choices. We formulate this as a dynamic Stackelberg game: the government (leader) sets policies, and agents (followers) respond by optimizing their behavior over time. Unlike static models, this dynamic formulation captures temporal dependencies and strategic feedback critical to policy design. However, as the number of agents increases, explicitly simulating all agent-agent and agent-government interactions becomes computationally infeasible. To address this, we propose the Dynamic Stackelberg Mean Field Game (DSMFG) framework, which approximates these complex interactions via agent-population and government-population couplings. This approximation preserves individual-level feedback while ensuring scalability, enabling DSMFG to jointly model three core features of real-world policymaking: dynamic feedback, asymmetry, and large scale. We further introduce Stackelberg Mean Field Reinforcement Learning (SMFRL), a data-driven algorithm that learns the leader's optimal policies while maintaining personalized responses for individual agents. Empirically, we validate our approach in a large-scale simulated economy, where it scales to 1,000 agents (vs. 100 in prior work) and achieves a fourfold increase in GDP over classical economic methods and a nineteenfold improvement over the static 2022 U.S. federal income tax policy.</description>

      <title>Coordinated Shirking in Technology Adoption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies a model of technology adoption: a manager tries to induce a group of workers to exert costly effort to vet a new technology before they choose whether to use it. The manager finds it too costly to simultaneously replace large groups of unproductive workers, so they shirk when coordination is possible. Widely applicable technology expands productive possibilities but also provides an opportunity for coordinated shirking, and can thus lead to widespread production failure. Furthermore, even workers who learn that they are using flawed technology may continue to do so. Applications include mortgage securitization in the financial crisis of 2008, and the adoption of generative artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Split the Yield, Share the Risk: Pricing, Hedging and Fixed rates in DeFi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first formal treatment of \emph{yield tokenization}, a mechanism that decomposes yield-bearing assets into principal and yield components to facilitate risk transfer and price discovery in decentralized finance (DeFi). We propose a model that characterizes yield token dynamics using stochastic differential equations. We derive a no-arbitrage pricing framework for yield tokens, enabling their use in hedging future yield volatility and managing interest rate risk in decentralized lending pools. Taking DeFi lending as our focus, we show how both borrowers and lenders can use yield tokens to achieve optimal hedging outcomes and mitigate exposure to adversarial interest rate manipulation. Furthermore, we design automated market makers (AMMs) that incorporate a menu of bonding curves to aggregate liquidity from participants with heterogeneous risk preferences. This leads to an efficient and incentive-compatible mechanism for trading yield tokens and yield futures. Building on these foundations, we propose a modular \textit{fixed-rate} lending protocol that synthesizes on-chain yield token markets and lending pools, enabling robust interest rate discovery and enhancing capital efficiency. Our work provides the theoretical underpinnings for risk management and fixed-income infrastructure in DeFi, offering practical mechanisms for stable and sustainable yield markets.</description>

      <title>Data Monetization through Strategic Coordination of Privately Informed Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.12223v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider linear-quadratic games of incomplete information with Gaussian uncertainty, in which players' payoffs depend both on a privately observed type and an unknown but common state. A monopolist data platform observes the state, elicits the players' types, and sells information back to them via (possibly correlated) action recommendations. We fully characterize the class of all such implementable Gaussian mechanisms (where the joint distribution of actions and signals is multivariate normal) as well as the player-optimal and revenue-maximizing mechanisms within this class. For games of strategic complements (substitutes), both optimal mechanisms maximally correlate (anticorrelate) the players' actions. When uncertainty over private types is large, the recommendations are deterministic and linear functions of the state and reported types but are not fully revealing. We apply our results to algorithmic pricing recommendations used by platforms such as Amazon and those challenged in U.S. v. RealPage.</description>

      <title>Robust Stackelberg Equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.14990v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a systematic study of the robust Stackelberg equilibrium (RSE), which naturally generalizes the widely adopted solution concept of the strong Stackelberg equilibrium (SSE). The RSE accounts for any possible up-to-$\delta$ suboptimal follower responses in Stackelberg games and is adopted to improve the robustness of the leader's strategy. While a few variants of robust Stackelberg equilibrium have been considered in previous literature, the RSE solution concept we consider is importantly different -- in some sense, it relaxes previously studied robust Stackelberg strategies and is applicable to much broader sources of uncertainties.
  We provide a thorough investigation of several fundamental properties of RSE, including its utility guarantees, algorithmics, and learnability. We first show that the RSE we defined always exists and thus is well-defined. Then we characterize how the leader's utility in RSE changes with the robustness level considered. On the algorithmic side, we show that, in sharp contrast to the tractability of computing an SSE, it is NP-hard to obtain a fully polynomial approximation scheme (FPTAS) for any constant robustness level. Nevertheless, we develop a quasi-polynomial approximation scheme (QPTAS) for RSE. Finally, we examine the learnability of the RSE in a natural learning scenario, where both players' utilities are not known in advance, and provide almost tight sample complexity results on learning the RSE. As a corollary of this result, we also obtain an algorithm for learning SSE, which strictly improves a key result of Bai et al. [2021] in terms of both utility guarantee and computational efficiency.</description>
