      <title>On plus--one generated arrangements of plane conics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the combinatorial properties of conic arrangements in the complex projective plane that possess certain quasi--homogeneous singularities. First, we introduce a new tool that enables us to characterize the property of being plus--one generated within the class of conic arrangements with some naturally chosen quasi--homogeneous singularities. Next, we present a classification result on plus--one generated conic arrangements admitting only nodes and tacnodes as singularities. Building on results regarding conic arrangements with nodes and tacnodes, we present new examples of strong Ziegler pairs of conic-line arrangements -- that is, arrangements having the same strong combinatorics but distinct derivation modules.</description>

      <title>Regularity in Linear Degenerations of Flag Variety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we investigate the regularity properties of linear degenerations of flag varieties. We classify the linear degenerations of (partial) flag varieties that are smooth. Furthermore, we study the singular locus of irreducible degenerations and provide estimates for its dimension. We also introduce a new stratification of the total space of representations. Within each stratum, we identify the loci corresponding to flat and flat irreducible degenerations. As a consequence of our results, we show that irreducible linear degenerations are normal varieties.</description>

      <title>Notes on the cohomology of partial Hessenberg varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hessenberg varieties are a family of subvarieties of full flag varieties. This family contains well-known varieties such as Springer fibers, Peterson varieties, and permutohedral varieties. It was introduced by De Mari-Procesi-Shayman in 1992 and has been actively studied in this decade. In particular, unexpected relations to hyperplane arrangements and the Stanley-Stembridge conjecture in graph theory have been discovered. Hessenberg varieties can be defined in partial flag varieties. In this paper, we study their cohomology by relating them to the cohomology of Hessenberg varieties in the full flag varieties.</description>

      <title>On subanalytic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These notes constitute a survey on the geometric properties of globally subanalytic sets. We start with their definition and some fundamental results such as Gabrielov's Complement Theorem or existence of cell decompositions. We then give the main basic tools of subanalytic geometry, such as Curve Selection Lemma, Lojasiewicz's inequalities, existence of tubular neighborhood, Tamm's theorem (definability of regular points), or existence of regular stratifications (Whitney or Verdier). We then present the developments of Lipschitz geometry obtained by various authors during the four last decades, giving a proof of existence of metric triangulations, introduced by the author of these notes, definable bi-Lipschitz triviality, Lipschitz conic structure, as well as invariance of the link under definable bi-Lipschitz mappings. The last chapter is devoted to geometric integration theory, studying the Hausdorff measure of globally subanalytic sets, integrals of subanalytic functions, as well as the density of subanalytic sets (the Lelong number) and Stokes' formula.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry plays a central role in accelerating symbolic computation involving polynomials. This chapter surveys recent developments and foundational methods that leverage the inherent symmetries of polynomial systems to reduce complexity, improve algorithmic efficiency, and reveal deeper structural insights. The main focus is on symmetry by the permutation of variables.</description>

      <title>Three-loop banana integrals with four unequal masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a system of canonical differential equations satisfied by the three-loop banana integrals with four distinct non-zero masses in $D = 2-2\eps$ dimensions. Together with the initial condition in the small-mass limit, this provides all the ingredients to find analytic results for three-loop banana integrals in terms of iterated integrals to any desired order in the dimensional regulator. To obtain this result, we rely on recent advances in understanding the K3 geometry underlying these integrals and in how to construct rotations to an $\eps$-factorized basis. This rotation typically involves the introduction of objects defined as integrals of (derivatives of) K3 periods and rational functions. We apply and extend a method based on results from twisted cohomology to identify relations among these functions, which allows us to reduce their number considerably. We expect that the methods that we have applied here will prove useful to compute further multiloop multiscale Feynman integrals attached to non-trivial geometries.</description>

      <title>Exact quasi-periodic solutions to the MKdV equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present paper, a hierarchy of the mKdV equation is integrated by the methods of algebraic geometry. The mKdV hierarchy in question arises on coadjoint orbits in the loop algebra of $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$, and employs a family of hyperelliptic curves as spectral curves. A generic form of the finite-gap solution in any genus is obtained in terms of the $\wp$-functions, which generalize the Weierstrass $\wp$-function. Reality conditions for quasi-periodic wave solutions are completely specified. The obtained solutions are illustrated by plots in small genera.</description>

Abstract: It is well known that a non-singular real plane projective curve of degree five with five connected components is separating if and only if its ovals are in non-convex position. In this article, this property is set into a different context and generalised to all real plane separating (M-2)-curves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17689v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a projective variety over a field. In this paper, we will construct a moduli space of very ample line bundles on $X$. In doing so, we develop a generalization of Fitting ideals to complexes of sheaves on $X$. We give other applications of these Fitting ideals such as constructing Brill-Noether spaces for higher dimensional varieties and giving a scheme structure to the locus where the projective dimension of a module jumps up.</description>

      <title>The Stack of Similarity Classes of Triangles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07792v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct the smooth, compact moduli space of similarity classes of labeled, oriented triangles. The space, denoted $\mathfrak D$, is a connected sum of three projective planes, and projects via blowdown to two shape spaces that have appeared in the literature: the well-known (Riemann) sphere (\cite{Kend84}, \cite{Beh}, \cite{Montgomery}, \cite{ES15}), and the less-well-known 2-torus (\cite{BG23}). A natural action by the dihedral group $D_6$ defines the quotient stack $[\mathfrak D/D_6]$ of absolute (unlabeled, unoriented) classes.</description>

      <title>TokenBlowUp: Resolving Representational Singularities in LLM Token Spaces via Monoidal Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work has provided compelling evidence challenging the foundational manifold hypothesis for the token embedding spaces of Large Language Models (LLMs). These findings reveal the presence of geometric singularities around polysemous tokens, which can lead to representational instability. Existing methodologies, which presuppose a smooth data manifold, are ill-equipped to address such intrinsic structural flaws. In this paper, we formalize this problem in the language of scheme theory and propose a rigorous resolution by applying the scheme-theoretic blow-up at each singular point. This procedure replaces a singular point in the ambient affine scheme with its exceptional divisor, which we identify as a canonical geometric space -- a projective space of directions -- that houses the disambiguated semantic meanings of the token. This process of ``representational desingularization'' constructs a new geometric landscape for embeddings. We prove a formal theorem guaranteeing the geometric regularization of this new space, showing that the original pathologies are resolved. Finally, we outline the architectural implications of our framework, arguing for a paradigm shift from static look-ups to dynamic, geometrically-grounded computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.09962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a mixed-characteristic incarnation of fusion, we prove an analog of Nekov\'a\v{r}-Scholl's plectic conjecture for local Shimura varieties. We apply this to obtain results on the plectic conjecture for (global) Shimura varieties after restricting to a decomposition group. Along the way, we prove a $p$-adic uniformization theorem for the basic locus of abelian type Shimura varieties at hyperspecial level, which is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>The smooth Mordell-Weil group and mapping class groups of elliptic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15960v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is a paper in smooth $4$-manifold topology, inspired by the N\'{e}ron-Lang Theorem in number theory. More precisely, we prove that a smooth version $\MW(\pi)$ of Mordell-Weil group of an elliptic fibration $\pi:M\to\Pb^1$ is finitely generated. We compute $\MW(\pi_d)$ explicitly for elliptic fibrations $\pi_d:M_d\to\Pb^1$, where $M_d$ is a simply-connected complex surfaces $M_d$ of arithmetic genus $d\geq 1$ and all fibers of $\pi_d$ are nodal.
  We prove in this case that the fibered structure is unique up topological isotopy. By combining this with a result of Donaldson, we obtain the following remarkable consequence: any diffeomorphism of $M_d$ with $d\geq 3$ is topologically isotopic to a diffeomorphism taking fibers to fibers.</description>

      <title>PLMP -- Point-Line Minimal Problems for Projective SfM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We completely classify all minimal problems for Structure-from-Motion (SfM) where arrangements of points and lines are fully observed by multiple uncalibrated pinhole cameras. We find 291 minimal problems, 73 of which have unique solutions and can thus be solved linearly. Two of the linear problems allow an arbitrary number of views, while all other minimal problems have at most 9 cameras. All minimal problems have at most 7 points and at most 12 lines. We compute the number of solutions of each minimal problem, as this gives a measurement of the problem's intrinsic difficulty, and find that these number are relatively low (e.g., when comparing with minimal problems for calibrated cameras). Finally, by exploring stabilizer subgroups of subarrangements, we develop a geometric and systematic way to 1) factorize minimal problems into smaller problems, 2) identify minimal problems in underconstrained problems, and 3) formally prove non-minimality.</description>
