      <title>Exploring the interplay between small and large scales movements in a neotropical small mammal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We record and analyze the movement patterns of the marsupial {\it Didelphis aurita} at different temporal scales. Animals trajectories are collected at a daily scale by using spool-and-line techniques, and with the help of radio-tracking devices animals traveled distances are estimated at intervals of weeks. Small-scale movements are well described by truncated L\'evy flight, while large-scale movements produce a distribution of distances which is compatible with a Brownian motion. A model of the movement behavior of these animals, based on a truncated L\'evy flight calibrated on the small scale data, converges towards a Brownian behavior after a short time interval of the order of one week. These results show that whether L\'evy flight or Brownian motion behaviors apply, will depend on the scale of aggregation of the animals paths. In this specific case, as the effect of the rude truncation present in the daily data generates a fast convergence towards Brownian behaviors, L\'evy flights become of scarce interest for describing the local dispersion properties of these animals, which result well approximated by a normal diffusion process and not a fast, anomalous one. Interestingly, we are able to describe two movement phases as the consequence of a statistical effect generated by aggregation, without the necessity of introducing ecological constraints or mechanisms operating at different spatio-temporal scales. This result is of general interest, as it can be a key element for describing movement phenomenology at distinct spatio-temporal scales across different taxa and in a variety of systems.</description>

      <title>Anomaly Detection for Automated Data Quality Monitoring in the CMS Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Successful operation of large particle detectors like the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) at the CERN Large Hadron Collider requires rapid, in-depth assessment of data quality. We introduce the ``AutoDQM'' system for Automated Data Quality Monitoring using advanced statistical techniques and unsupervised machine learning. Anomaly detection algorithms based on the beta-binomial probability function, principal component analysis, and neural network autoencoder image evaluation are tested on the full set of proton-proton collision data collected by CMS in 2022. AutoDQM identifies anomalous ``bad'' data affected by significant detector malfunction at a rate 4 -- 6 times higher than ``good'' data, demonstrating its effectiveness as a general data quality monitoring tool.</description>

      <title>Data-driven upper bounds and event attribution for unprecedented heatwaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The last decade has seen numerous record-shattering heatwaves in all corners of the globe. In the aftermath of these devastating events, there is interest in identifying worst-case thresholds or upper bounds that quantify just how hot temperatures can become. Generalized Extreme Value theory provides a data-driven estimate of extreme thresholds; however, upper bounds may be exceeded by future events, which undermines attribution and planning for heatwave impacts. Here, we show how the occurrence and relative probability of observed events that exceed a priori upper bound estimates, so-called "impossible" temperatures, has changed over time. We find that many unprecedented events are actually within data-driven upper bounds, but only when using modern spatial statistical methods. Furthermore, there are clear connections between anthropogenic forcing and the "impossibility" of the most extreme temperatures. Robust understanding of heatwave thresholds provides critical information about future record-breaking events and how their extremity relates to historical measurements.</description>

      <title>DMCpy: A powder and single crystal neutron diffraction software for DMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recently upgraded DMC diffractometer at SINQ, equipped with a state-of-the-art 2D He detector, enables high-resolution neutron diffraction experiments optimized for both powder and single-crystal studies. To address the increased complexity and volume of data produced by this instrument, we developed DMCPy, a Python-based software package tailored specifically for DMC data analysis. DMCPy facilitates seamless data reduction and visualization, supporting conversion to reciprocal space, normalization, and masking of detector artifacts. Its modular architecture integrates tools for analyzing both powder diffraction patterns and single-crystal datasets, including advanced visualization features like 3D reciprocal space mapping and interactive scan inspection. By streamlining workflows and enhancing data interpretation, DMCPy empowers researchers to unlock the full potential of the DMC instrument for probing nuclear and magnetic structures in condensed matter systems.</description>
