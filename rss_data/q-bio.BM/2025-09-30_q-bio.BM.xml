      <title>ABConformer: Physics-inspired Sliding Attention for Antibody-Antigen Interface Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) interfaces is critical for vaccine design, immunodiagnostics, and therapeutic antibody development. However, achieving reliable predictions from sequences alone remains a challenge. In this paper, we present ABCONFORMER, a model based on the Conformer backbone that captures both local and global features of a biosequence. To accurately capture Ab-Ag interactions, we introduced the physics-inspired sliding attention, enabling residue-level contact recovery without relying on three-dimensional structural data. ABConformer can accurately predict paratopes and epitopes given the antibody and antigen sequence, and predict pan-epitopes on the antigen without antibody information. In comparison experiments, ABCONFORMER achieves state-of-the-art performance on a recent SARS-CoV-2 Ab-Ag dataset, and surpasses widely used sequence-based methods for antibody-agnostic epitope prediction. Ablation studies further quantify the contribution of each component, demonstrating that, compared to conventional cross-attention, sliding attention significantly enhances the precision of epitope prediction. To facilitate reproducibility, we will release the code under an open-source license upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>MarS-FM: Generative Modeling of Molecular Dynamics via Markov State Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24779v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular Dynamics (MD) is a powerful computational microscope for probing protein functions. However, the need for fine-grained integration and the long timescales of biomolecular events make MD computationally expensive. To address this, several generative models have been proposed to generate surrogate trajectories at lower cost. Yet, these models typically learn a fixed-lag transition density, causing the training signal to be dominated by frequent but uninformative transitions. We introduce a new class of generative models, MSM Emulators, which instead learn to sample transitions across discrete states defined by an underlying Markov State Model (MSM). We instantiate this class with Markov Space Flow Matching (MarS-FM), whose sampling offers more than two orders of magnitude speedup compared to implicit- or explicit-solvent MD simulations. We benchmark Mars-FM ability to reproduce MD statistics through structural observables such as RMSD, radius of gyration, and secondary structure content. Our evaluation spans protein domains (up to 500 residues) with significant chemical and structural diversity, including unfolding events, and enforces strict sequence dissimilarity between training and test sets to assess generalization. Across all metrics, MarS-FM outperforms existing methods, often by a substantial margin.</description>

      <title>TR2-D2: Tree Search Guided Trajectory-Aware Fine-Tuning for Discrete Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning with stochastic optimal control offers a promising framework for diffusion fine-tuning, where a pre-trained diffusion model is optimized to generate paths that lead to a reward-tilted distribution. While these approaches enable optimization without access to explicit samples from the optimal distribution, they require training on rollouts under the current fine-tuned model, making them susceptible to reinforcing sub-optimal trajectories that yield poor rewards. To overcome this challenge, we introduce TRee Search Guided TRajectory-Aware Fine-Tuning for Discrete Diffusion (TR2-D2), a novel framework that optimizes reward-guided discrete diffusion trajectories with tree search to construct replay buffers for trajectory-aware fine-tuning. These buffers are generated using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and subsequently used to fine-tune a pre-trained discrete diffusion model under a stochastic optimal control objective. We validate our framework on single- and multi-objective fine-tuning of biological sequence diffusion models, highlighting the overall effectiveness of TR2-D2 for reliable reward-guided fine-tuning in discrete sequence generation.</description>

      <title>Token-Level Guided Discrete Diffusion for Membrane Protein Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reparameterized diffusion models (RDMs) have recently matched autoregressive methods in protein generation, motivating their use for challenging tasks such as designing membrane proteins, which possess interleaved soluble and transmembrane (TM) regions. We introduce the Membrane Diffusion Language Model (MemDLM), a fine-tuned RDM-based protein language model that enables controllable membrane protein sequence design. MemDLM-generated sequences recapitulate the TM residue density and structural features of natural membrane proteins, achieving comparable biological plausibility and outperforming state-of-the-art diffusion baselines in motif scaffolding tasks by producing lower perplexity, higher BLOSUM-62 scores, and improved pLDDT confidence. To enhance controllability, we develop Per-Token Guidance (PET), a novel classifier-guided sampling strategy that selectively solubilizes residues while preserving conserved TM domains, yielding sequences with reduced TM density but intact functional cores. Importantly, MemDLM designs validated in TOXCAT beta-lactamase growth assays demonstrate successful TM insertion, distinguishing high-quality generated sequences from poor ones. Together, our framework establishes the first experimentally-validated diffusion-based model for rational membrane protein generation, integrating de novo design, motif scaffolding, and targeted property optimization.</description>

      <title>Flexible MOF Generation with Torsion-Aware Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17914v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with novel chemistries is a longstanding challenge due to their large combinatorial space and complex 3D arrangements of the building blocks. While recent deep generative models have enabled scalable MOF generation, they assume (1) a fixed set of building blocks and (2) known local 3D coordinates of building blocks. However, this limits their ability to (1) design novel MOFs and (2) generate the structure using novel building blocks. We propose a two-stage MOF generation framework that overcomes these limitations by modeling both chemical and geometric degrees of freedom. First, we train an SMILES-based autoregressive model to generate metal and organic building blocks, paired with a cheminformatics toolkit for 3D structure initialization. Second, we introduce a flow matching model that predicts translations, rotations, and torsional angles to assemble the blocks into valid 3D frameworks. Our experiments demonstrate improved reconstruction accuracy, the generation of valid, novel, and unique MOFs, and the ability to create novel building blocks. Our code is available at https://github.com/nayoung10/MOFFlow-2.</description>

      <title>FusionDTI: Fine-grained Binding Discovery with Token-level Fusion for Drug-Target Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01651v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting drug-target interaction (DTI) is critical in the drug discovery process. Despite remarkable advances in recent DTI models through the integration of representations from diverse drug and target encoders, such models often struggle to capture the fine-grained interactions between drugs and protein, i.e. the binding of specific drug atoms (or substructures) and key amino acids of proteins, which is crucial for understanding the binding mechanisms and optimising drug design. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel model, called FusionDTI, which uses a token-level Fusion module to effectively learn fine-grained information for Drug-Target Interaction. In particular, our FusionDTI model uses the SELFIES representation of drugs to mitigate sequence fragment invalidation and incorporates the structure-aware (SA) vocabulary of target proteins to address the limitation of amino acid sequences in structural information, additionally leveraging pre-trained language models extensively trained on large-scale biomedical datasets as encoders to capture the complex information of drugs and targets. Experiments on three well-known benchmark datasets show that our proposed FusionDTI model achieves the best performance in DTI prediction compared with seven existing state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, our case study indicates that FusionDTI could highlight the potential binding sites, enhancing the explainability of the DTI prediction.</description>

      <title>PDFBench: A Benchmark for De novo Protein Design from Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Function-guided protein design is a crucial task with significant applications in drug discovery and enzyme engineering. However, the field lacks a unified and comprehensive evaluation framework. Current models are assessed using inconsistent and limited subsets of metrics, which prevents fair comparison and a clear understanding of the relationships between different evaluation criteria. To address this gap, we introduce PDFBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for function-guided denovo protein design. Our benchmark systematically evaluates eight state-of-the-art models on 16 metrics across two key settings: description-guided design, for which we repurpose the Mol-Instructions dataset, originally lacking quantitative benchmarking, and keyword-guided design, for which we introduce a new test set, SwissTest, created with a strict datetime cutoff to ensure data integrity. By benchmarking across a wide array of metrics and analyzing their correlations, PDFBench enables more reliable model comparisons and provides key insights to guide future research.</description>

      <title>LSMTCR: A Scalable Multi-Architecture Model for Epitope-Specific T Cell Receptor de novo Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07627v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Designing full-length, epitope-specific TCR {\alpha}\b{eta} remains challenging due to vast sequence space, data biases and incomplete modeling of immunogenetic constraints. We present LSMTCR, a scalable multi-architecture framework that separates specificity from constraint learning to enable de novo, epitope-conditioned generation of paired, full-length TCRs. A diffusion-enhanced BERT encoder learns time-conditioned epitope representations; conditional GPT decoders, pretrained on CDR3\b{eta} and transferred to CDR3{\alpha}, generate chain-specific CDR3s under cross-modal conditioning with temperature-controlled diversity; and a gene-aware Transformer assembles complete {\alpha}/\b{eta} sequences by predicting V/J usage to ensure immunogenetic fidelity. Across GLIPH, TEP, MIRA, McPAS and our curated dataset, LSMTCR achieves higher predicted binding than baselines on most datasets, more faithfully recovers positional and length grammars, and delivers superior, temperature-tunable diversity. For {\alpha}-chain generation, transfer learning improves predicted binding, length realism and diversity over representative methods. Full-length assembly from known or de novo CDR3s preserves k-mer spectra, yields low edit distances to references, and, in paired {\alpha}/\b{eta} co-modelling with epitope, attains higher pTM/ipTM than single-chain settings. LSMTCR outputs diverse, gene-contextualized, full-length TCR designs from epitope input alone, enabling high-throughput screening and iterative optimization.</description>
