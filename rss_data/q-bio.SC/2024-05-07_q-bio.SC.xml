      <title>A Decade in a Systematic Review: The Evolution and Impact of Cell Painting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-content image-based assays have fueled significant discoveries in the life sciences in the past decade (2013-2023), including novel insights into disease etiology, mechanism of action, new therapeutics, and toxicology predictions. Here, we systematically review the substantial methodological advancements and applications of Cell Painting. Advancements include improvements in the Cell Painting protocol, assay adaptations for different types of perturbations and applications, and improved methodologies for feature extraction, quality control, and batch effect correction. Moreover, machine learning methods recently surpassed classical approaches in their ability to extract biologically useful information from Cell Painting images. Cell Painting data have been used alone or in combination with other -omics data to decipher the mechanism of action of a compound, its toxicity profile, and many other biological effects. Overall, key methodological advances have expanded the ability of Cell Painting to capture cellular responses to various perturbations. Future advances will likely lie in advancing computational and experimental techniques, developing new publicly available datasets, and integrating them with other high-content data types.</description>

      <title>Coat stiffening explains the consensus pathway of clathrin-mediated endocytosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is the main pathway used by eukaryotic cells to take up extracellular material, but the dominant physical mechanisms driving this process are still elusive. Recently several high-resolution imaging techniques have been used on different cell lines to measure the geometrical properties of clathrin-coated pits over their whole lifetime. Here we first show that all datasets follow the same consensus pathway, which is well described by the recently introduced cooperative curvature model, which predicts a flat-to curved transition at finite area, followed by linear growth and subsequent saturation of curvature. We then apply an energetic model for the composite of plasma membrane and clathrin coat to the consensus pathway to show that the dominant mechanism for invagination is coat stiffening, which results from cooperative interactions between the different clathrin molecules and progressively drives the system towards its intrinsic curvature. Our theory predicts that two length scales determine the time course of invagination, namely the patch size at which the flat-to-curved transition occurs and the final pit radius.</description>
