      <title>Position: Standard Benchmarks Fail -- LLM Agents Present Overlooked Risks for Financial Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current financial LLM agent benchmarks are inadequate. They prioritize task performance while ignoring fundamental safety risks. Threats like hallucinations, temporal misalignment, and adversarial vulnerabilities pose systemic risks in high-stakes financial environments, yet existing evaluation frameworks fail to capture these risks. We take a firm position: traditional benchmarks are insufficient to ensure the reliability of LLM agents in finance. To address this, we analyze existing financial LLM agent benchmarks, finding safety gaps and introducing ten risk-aware evaluation metrics. Through an empirical evaluation of both API-based and open-weight LLM agents, we reveal hidden vulnerabilities that remain undetected by conventional assessments. To move the field forward, we propose the Safety-Aware Evaluation Agent (SAEA), grounded in a three-level evaluation framework that assesses agents at the model level (intrinsic capabilities), workflow level (multi-step process reliability), and system level (integration robustness). Our findings highlight the urgent need to redefine LLM agent evaluation standards by shifting the focus from raw performance to safety, robustness, and real world resilience.</description>

      <title>Financial fraud detection system based on improved random forest and gradient boosting machine (GBM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a financial fraud detection system based on improved Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM). Specifically, the system introduces a novel model architecture called GBM-SSRF (Gradient Boosting Machine with Simplified and Strengthened Random Forest), which cleverly combines the powerful optimization capabilities of the gradient boosting machine (GBM) with improved randomization. The computational efficiency and feature extraction capabilities of the Simplified and Strengthened Random Forest (SSRF) forest significantly improve the performance of financial fraud detection. Although the traditional random forest model has good classification capabilities, it has high computational complexity when faced with large-scale data and has certain limitations in feature selection. As a commonly used ensemble learning method, the GBM model has significant advantages in optimizing performance and handling nonlinear problems. However, GBM takes a long time to train and is prone to overfitting problems when data samples are unbalanced. In response to these limitations, this paper optimizes the random forest based on the structure, reducing the computational complexity and improving the feature selection ability through the structural simplification and enhancement of the random forest. In addition, the optimized random forest is embedded into the GBM framework, and the model can maintain efficiency and stability with the help of GBM's gradient optimization capability. Experiments show that the GBM-SSRF model not only has good performance, but also has good robustness and generalization capabilities, providing an efficient and reliable solution for financial fraud detection.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Trading using Deep Q Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.06037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a subfield of machine learning that has been used in many fields, such as robotics, gaming, and autonomous systems. There has been growing interest in using RL for quantitative trading, where the goal is to make trades that generate profits in financial markets. This paper presents the use of RL for quantitative trading and reports a case study based on an RL-based trading algorithm. The results show that RL can be a useful tool for quantitative trading and can perform better than traditional trading algorithms. The use of reinforcement learning for quantitative trading is a promising area of research that can help develop more sophisticated and efficient trading systems. Future research can explore the use of other reinforcement learning techniques, the use of other data sources, and the testing of the system on a range of asset classes. Together, our work shows the potential in the use of reinforcement learning for quantitative trading and the need for further research and development in this area. By developing the sophistication and efficiency of trading systems, it may be possible to make financial markets more efficient and generate higher returns for investors.</description>
