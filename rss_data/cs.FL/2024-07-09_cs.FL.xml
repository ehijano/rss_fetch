      <title>On the Separability Problem of VASS Reachability Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the regular separability problem of VASS reachability languages is decidable and $\mathbf{F}_{\omega}$-complete. At the heart of our decision procedure are doubly-marked graph transition sequences, a new proof object that tracks a suitable product of the VASS we wish to separate. We give a decomposition algorithm for DMGTS that not only achieves perfectness as known from MGTS, but also a new property called faithfulness. Faithfulness allows us to construct, from a regular separator for the $\mathbb{Z}$-versions of the VASS, a regular separator for the $\mathbb{N}$-versions. Behind faithfulness is the insight that, for separability, it is sufficient to track the counters of one VASS modulo a large number that is determined by the decomposition.</description>

      <title>The reflection complexity of sequences over finite alphabets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In combinatorics on words, the well-studied factor complexity function $\rho_{\bf x}$ of a sequence ${\bf x}$ over a finite alphabet counts, for any nonnegative integer $n$, the number of distinct length-$n$ factors of ${\bf x}$. In this paper, we introduce the \emph{reflection complexity} function $r_{\bf x}$ to enumerate the factors occurring in a sequence ${\bf x}$, up to reversing the order of symbols in a word. We introduce and prove results on $r_{\bf x}$ regarding its growth properties and relationship with other complexity functions. We prove that if ${\bf x}$ is $k$-automatic, then $r_{\bf x}$ is computably $k$-regular, and we use the software {\tt Walnut} to evaluate the reflection complexity of automatic sequences, such as the Thue--Morse sequence. We prove a Morse--Hedlund-type result characterizing eventually periodic sequences in terms of their reflection complexity, and we deduce a characterization of Sturmian sequences. Furthermore, we investigate the reflection complexity of episturmian, $(s+1)$-dimensional billiard, and Rote sequences. There are still many unanswered questions about this measure.</description>
