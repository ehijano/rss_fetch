      <title>Spanning Factorizations in Vertex-Transitive Digraphs of Degree 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate spanning 1-factorizations in vertex-transitive digraphs of arbitrary out-degree d. The guiding question is whether every such digraph admits a spanning 1-factorization that includes, for each vertex v, all d out-edges (v, F1(v)) from v. Equivalently, does there always exist a spanning factorization containing the empty word together with the full set of generators {F1, ..., Fd}?
  This paper addresses the case d = 2. Using the structure of alternating cycles and block systems, we develop a block/phase framework that yields sufficient conditions for including both F1 and F2. We show that certain block obstructions can prevent their simultaneous inclusion, while sharply transitive sets (and hence spanning factorizations) always exist. Our results provide general constraints on feasible block sizes, describe the role of phase distributions, and illustrate the theory with concrete families, including coset digraphs on A5. The necessity of the block criterion remains open, even in degree 2.</description>

      <title>The column number for 3-modular matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An integer-valued matrix $\mathbf{A}$ is $\Delta$-modular if each $\text{rank}(\mathbf{A}) \times \text{rank}(\mathbf{A})$ submatrix has determinant at most $\Delta$ in absolute value. The column number problem is to determine the maximum number of pairwise non-parallel columns of a rank-$r$, $\Delta$-modular matrix. Exact values for the column number are only known for $r \le 2$ or $\Delta \le 2$. We prove that if $r$ is sufficiently large, then the maximum number of pairwise non-parallel columns of a rank-$r$, $3$-modular matrix is $\binom{r+1}{2} + 2(r-1)$. This settles a conjecture by Lee, Paat, Stallknecht, and Xu on the column number in the case $\Delta = 3$. We complement this main result by showing that there are at least three $3$-modular matrices with pairwise non-isomorphic vector matroids that attain this upper bound. More generally, we show that if $r &gt; \Delta$, then the number of $\Delta$-modular matrices with $\binom{r+1}{2} + (\Delta-1)(r-1)$ pairwise non-parallel columns and pairwise non-isomorphic vector matroids is at least exponential in $\sqrt{\Delta}$; previously only one matrix was known due to Lee et al.</description>

      <title>Three-Neighbour Bootstrap Percolation in Thin Three-Dimensional Grids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We improve the status of the problem of determining minimum-sized percolating sets in $a \times b \times c$ grids under the $3$-neighbour process. Using several new constructions, we show that optimal percolating sets exist whenever $\min(a,b,c) \ge 7$. As an important step toward this, we also show that all grids with $\min(a,b,c) \ge 4$ have a percolating set whose size exactly achieves the lower bound $(ab+ac+bc)/3$ whenever this value is an integer.</description>

      <title>Colorful circuits and colorful topes in oriented matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a short proof of a conic version of the colorful Carath\'eodory theorem for oriented matroids. Holmsen's extension of the colorful Carath\'eodory theorem to oriented matroids (Advances in Mathematics, 2016) already encompasses several generalizations of the original result, but not its conic version. Our approach relies on a common generalization of Sperner's lemma and Meshulam's lemma - two closely related results from combinatorial topology that have found a number of applications in discrete geometry and combinatorics. This generalization may be of independent interest.
  Using a similar approach, we also establish the following colorful theorem for topes, whose special geometric case had not been considered before: Given $n$ topes from a uniform oriented matroid with $n$ elements, if they agree on some element, then there is a way to select a distinct element from each tope, together with its sign, so as to form another tope of the oriented matroid. Motivated by this theorem, we further explore other conditions leading to the same conclusion.</description>

      <title>To cover a permutohedron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The permutohedron $P_n$ of order $n$ is a polytope embedded in $\mathbb{R}^n$ whose vertex coordinates are permutations of the first $n$ natural numbers. It is obvious that $P_n$ lies on the hyperplane $H_n$ consisting of points whose coordinates sum up to $n(n+1)/2$. We prove that if the vertices of $P_n$ are contained in the union of $m$ affine hyperplanes different from $H_n$, then $m\geq n$ when $n \geq 3$ is odd, and $m \geq n-1$ when $n \geq 4$ is even. This confirms a recent conjecture of Heged\"us and K\'arolyi. Our proof gives an algebraic criterion for a non-standard permutohedron generated by $n$ distinct real numbers to require at least $n$ non-trivial hyperplanes to cover its vertices.</description>

      <title>Generalized $f$-Eulerian polynomials: zeros and hypergeometric representations with applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore (slightly generalized) $f$-Eulerian polynomials introduced by Stanley and frequently appearing in combinatorics. Notable special cases include the classical Eulerian polynomials, the generating polynomials of order polynomials for certain labeled posets, and the $d$-Narayana polynomials. We establish simple sufficient conditions for the reality (and sign) of their zeros and present implications for total positivity of sequences generated by values of polynomials at integers. We further relate these polynomials to generalized Euler's transformations for the generalized hypergeometric functions with integral parameter differences. Exploiting this and other hypergeometric connections, we provide purely hypergeometric proofs for various known and some new properties of $d$-Narayana polynomials. Another family encompassed by our definition of the generalized $f$-Eulerian polynomials is that of Jacobi-Pi\~neiro type II multiple orthogonal polynomials. Their zero location can thus be analyzed, for both canonical and non-canonical parameter values, without invoking orthogonality. Finally, we present several connection formulas relating $d$-Narayana polynomials to particular Jacobi-Pi\~neiro polynomials.</description>

      <title>Single conflict coloring, adaptable choosability and separation choosability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study relations between three interrelated notions of graph (list) coloring: single conflict coloring, adapted list coloring and choosability with separation (with $1$ overlapping color between lists of adjacent vertices), and their respective invariants single conflict chromatic number $\chi_{\nleftrightarrow}$, adaptable choosability $ch_{ad}$ and separation choosability $ch_{sep}$. We investigate graphs with small values of these invariants, and construct explicit families of graphs $G$ with $\chi_{\nleftrightarrow}(G) = ch_{ad}(G) &gt; ch_{sep}(G)$, as well as where all three invariants are equal. Furthermore, we consider planar graphs and investigate for which triples $(a,b,c)$, there is a planar graph $G$ with $(ch_{sep}(G), ch_{ad}(G), \chi_{\nleftrightarrow}(G)) = (a,b,c)$. Throughout the paper we pose many questions on these graph coloring parameters, and discuss connections to related coloring invariants such as adapted coloring.</description>

      <title>Frozen-corner enumeration of Alternating Sign Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An Alternating Sign Matrix (ASM) is a square matrix with entries in $\{0,1,-1\}$, and such that: $i)$ in each row and columns, nonzero entries alternate in sign; $ii)$ for any given row or column, entries sum up to 1. We define the frozen-square enumeration as the enumeration of $n\times n$ ASMs under the refinement of having, located in a corner, an $s\times s$ square of entries that are all zeroes. We state a conjectural formula for such enumeration, in terms of a Fredholm type determinant of some $s\times s$ matrix whose entries are given explicitely. We provide numerical support in favour of our conjecture. We also illustrate the relevance of the conjectured formula in connection with the limit shape observed in large ASMs, its fluctuations, and the Tracy--Widom distribution.</description>

      <title>Generalizations of the Crossing Lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The crossing number of a graph is the minimum number of crossings over all of its drawings on the plane. The Crossing Lemma, proved more than 40 years ago, is a tight lower bound on the crossing number of a graph in terms of the number of vertices and edges. It is definitely the most important inequality on crossing numbers. We review some generalizations and applications of the Crossing Lemma.</description>

      <title>The lonely runner conjecture holds for eight runners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the lonely runner conjecture holds for eight runners. Our proof relies on a computer verification and on recent results that allow bounding the size of a minimal counterexample. We note that our approach also applies to the known cases with 4, 5, 6, and 7 runners. We expect that minor improvements to our approach could be enough to solve the cases of 9 or 10 runners.</description>

      <title>Structure, Perfect Divisibility and Coloring of ($P_2\cup P_4, C_3$)-Free Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Randerath {\em et al.} [Discrete Math. 251 (2002) 137-153] proved that every $(P_6,C_3)$-free graph $G$ satisfies $\chi(G)\leq4$. Pyatkin [Discrete Math. 313 (2013) 715-720] proved that every $(2P_3,C_3)$-free graph $G$ satisfies $\chi(G)\leq4$. In this paper, we prove that for a connected $(P_2\cup P_4, C_3)$-free graph $G$, either $G$ has two nonadjacent vertices $u,v$ such that $N(u)\subseteq N(v)$, or $G$ is 3-colorable, or $G$ contains Gr\H{o}tzsch graph as an induced subgraph and is an induced subgraph of Clebsch graph. Consequently, we have determined the chromatic number of $(P_2\cup P_4, C_3)$-free graph is 4.
  A graph $G$ is {\em perfectly divisible} if, for each induced subgraph $H$ of $G$, $V(H)$ can be partitioned into $A$ and $B$ such that $H[A]$ is perfect and $\omega(H[B])&lt;\omega(H)$. A {\em bull} is a graph consisting of a triangle with two disjoint pendant edges. Deng and Chang [Graphs Combin. (2025) 41: 63] proved that every ($P_2\cup P_3$, bull)-free graph $G$ with $\omega(G)\geq3$ has a partition $(X,Y)$ such that $G[X]$ is perfect and $G[Y]$ has clique number less than $\omega(G)$ if $G$ admits no homogeneous set; Chen and Wang [arXiv:2507.18506v2] proved that such property is also true for ($P_2\cup P_4$, bull)-free graphs. In this paper, we prove that a ($P_2\cup P_4$, bull)-free graph is perfectly divisible if and only if it contains no Gr\H{o}tzsch graph.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study semigroup algebras associated to lattice polytopes.
  We begin by generalizing and refining work of Hochster, and describe the volume maps of these algebras, that is, their fundamental classes, in terms of Parseval-Rayleigh identities and differential equations, which we prove to be equivalent.
  We use these descriptions to establish strong Lefschetz properties.
  A consequence is the resolution of several conjectures concerning unimodality properties of the h*-polynomial of lattice polytopes.</description>

      <title>On the set of fixed points for NRS($m$)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f(z)$ be a degree $d$ polynomial with zeros $z_i$. For arbitrary $m$ we construct explicit set of fixed points (attractors) of NRS($m$), and prove a factored formula for the Jacobian at these points. We prove that if NRS(2), when applied to $f$ with an arbitrary starting point, converges to a point $(w_0, w_1)$, then $w_0$ is of the form $z_i+z_j$ for some $i \neq j$. As a corollary, we prove a formula expressing the elementary symmetric expansion of the function \[ \prod_{1\leq i &lt; j \leq d} (z - z_i -z_j) \] in the variables $z_i$ in terms of non-intersecting paths on certain directed graphs, using the Lindstr\"om-Gessel-Veinnot Lemma.</description>

      <title>A counterexample to the $S_{10}$- and the $S_{12}$-Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For two graphs $G$ and $H$, a mapping $f\colon E(G) \to E(H)$ is an $H$-coloring of $G$, if it is a proper edge-coloring and for every $v \in V(G)$ there exists a vertex $u \in V(H)$ with $f(\partial_G(v))=\partial_H(u)$. Motivated by the Petersen Coloring Conjecture, Mkrtchyan [A remark on the Petersen coloring conjecture of Jaeger, \emph{Australas. J. Combin.}, 56 (2013), 145-151] and Mkrtchyan together with Hakobyan [$S_{12}$ and $P_{12}$-colorings of cubic graphs, \emph{Ars Math. Contemp.}, 17 (2019), 431-445] made the following two conjectures. (I) Every cubic graph has an $S_{10}$-coloring, where $S_{10}$ is a graph on 10 vertices sometimes also referred to as the Sylvester graph. (II) Every cubic graph with a perfect matching has an $S_{12}$-coloring, where $S_{12}$ is the graph obtained from $S_{10}$ by replacing the central vertex with a triangle. In this note we present a (rather small) counterexample to both conjectures.</description>

      <title>4-uniform Maker-Breaker and Maker-Maker games are PSPACE-complete</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study two positional games where two players take turns picking a previously unpicked vertex of a hypergraph $H$. We say a player fills an edge of $H$ if that player has picked all the vertices of that edge. In the Maker-Maker game, whoever first fills an edge wins, or we get a draw if no edge is filled. In the Maker-Breaker game, the first player aims at filling an edge while the second player aims at preventing the first player from filling an edge. We show that, for both games, deciding whether the first player has a winning strategy is a PSPACE-complete problem even when restricted to 4-uniform hypergraphs. For the Maker-Maker game, this improves on a previous result for hypergraphs of rank 4. For the Maker-Breaker game, this improves on a previous result for 5-uniform hypergraphs, and closes the complexity gap as the problem for hypergraphs of rank 3 is known to be solvable in polynomial time.</description>

Abstract: Given a Bridgeland stability condition on a 2-Calabi--Yau category, we define a simplicial complex that encodes the Harder--Narasimhan filtrations of spherical objects. For 2-Calabi--Yau categories of type A, we relate this complex to the complex of pointed pseudo-triangulations on configurations of points on the plane. Using this connection, we prove that the complex undergoes piecewise-linear wall-crossings as we vary the stability condition, and is piecewise-linearly homeomorphic to a sphere.
  Additionally, we prove that for a generic stability condition on a 2-Calabi--Yau category, a spherical object is determined by the ordered list of its Harder--Narasimhan factors.</description>

      <title>Semi-simple partition algebras as centralizers of representations for rook monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{P}_k(\delta)$, where $k$ is a positive integer and $\delta$ some complex parameter, be the classical partition algebra over the complex numbers. In the case when $\delta=n$, it is well-known that the algebra $\mathcal{P}_k(\delta)$ is the centralizer of the symmetric group $S_n$ acting on the $k$-fold tensor space of the natural representation of $S_n$, for $n\geq 2k$. The algebra $\mathcal{P}_k(\delta)$ is semi-simple for generic values of $\delta$. In this paper, we show that semi-simple partition algebras appear as the centralizer algebras for certain representations of the rook monoids given by an iterative restriction-induction of the trivial representation. Along the way, we also give a decomposition of this iterative representation of the rook monoid into various tensor spaces and show that the corresponding dimensions are given by generalized Bell numbers.</description>

      <title>An improved lower bound for Erd\H{o}s--Szekeres products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1959, Erd\H{o}s and Szekeres posed a series of problems concerning the size of polynomials of the form $$ P_n(z) = \prod_{j=1}^n (1 - z^{s_j}), $$ where $s_1, \dots, s_n$ are positive integers. Of particular interest is the quantity $$ f(n) = \inf_{s_1,\dots,s_n\ge 1} \max_{|z|=1} |P_n(z)|. $$They proved that $\lim_{n\to\infty} f(n)^{1/n} = 1$, and also established the classical lower bound $f(n) \ge \sqrt{2n}$. However, despite extensive effort over more than six decades, no stronger general lower bound had been established.
  In this paper, we obtain the new bound $$ f(n) \ge 2\sqrt{n}. $$This gives the first improvement of the classical lower bound for the Erd\H{o}s--Szekeres problem in the general case since 1959.</description>

      <title>Gremban Expansion for Signed Networks: Algebraic and Combinatorial Foundations for Community-Faction Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article deals with the characterization and detection of community and faction structures in signed networks. We approach the study of these mesoscale structures through the lens of the Gremban expansion. This graph operation lifts a signed graph to a larger unsigned graph, and allows the extension of standard techniques from unsigned to signed graphs. We develop the combinatorial and algebraic properties of the Gremban expansion, with a focus on its inherent involutive symmetry. The main technical result is a bijective correspondence between symmetry-respecting cut-sets in the Gremban expansion, and regular cut-sets and frustration sets in the signed graph (i.e., the combinatorial structures that underlie communities and factions respectively). This result forms the basis for our new approach to community-faction detection in signed networks, which makes use of spectral clustering techniques that naturally respect the required symmetries. We demonstrate how this approach distinguishes the two mesoscale structures, how to generalize the approach to multi-way clustering and discuss connections to network dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Large deviations for probability graphons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a large deviation principle (LDP) for probability graphons, which are symmetric functions from the unit square into the space of probability measures. This notion extends classical graphons and provides a flexible framework for studying the limit behavior of large dense weighted graphs. In particular, our result generalizes the seminal work of Chatterjee and Varadhan (2011), who derived an LDP for Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs via graphon theory. We move beyond their binary (Bernoulli) setting to encompass arbitrary edge-weight distributions. Specifically, we analyze the distribution on probability graphons induced by random weighted graphs in which edges are sampled independently from a common reference probability measure supported on a compact Polish space. We prove that this distribution satisfies an LDP with a good rate function, expressed as an extension of the Kullback-Leibler divergence between probability graphons and the reference measure. This theorem can also be viewed as a Sanov-type result in the graphon setting. Our work provides a rigorous foundation for analyzing rare events in weighted networks and supports statistical inference in structured random graph models under distributional edge uncertainty.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1903.10697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present generalizations of the Newton-Raphson-Simpson method. Specifically, for a positive integer $m$ and the sequence of coefficients of a Taylor series of a function $f(z)$, we define an algorithm we denote by NRS($m$) which is a way to evaluate, in our terminology, a sum of $m$ formal zeros of $f(z)$. We prove that NRS(1) yields the familiar iterations of the Newton-Raphson-Simpson method. We also prove that NRS($m$) is way to evaluate certain $\mathscr{A}$-hypergeometric series defined by Sturmfels. In order to define these algorithms, we make use of combinatorial objects which we call trees with negative vertex degree.</description>

      <title>The infinite information gap between mathematical and physical representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.16272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.16272v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Partial orders have been used to model several experimental setups, going from classical thermodynamics and general relativity to the quantum realm with its resource theories. In order to study such experimental setups, one typically characterizes them via a (numerical) representation, that is, a set of real-valued functions. In the context of resource theory, it is customary to use \textbf{mathematical} representations, i.e. a set of \textbf{measurement outcomes} which characterize the achievable transitions within the experimental setup. However, in line with the minimum energy and maximum entropy principles in classical mechanics and thermodynamics, respectively, one would expect an optimization interpretation for a representation to be called \textbf{physical}. More specifically, a physical representation could consist of a set of competing \textbf{optimization principles} such that a transition happens provided they are all optimized by it. Somewhat surprisingly, we show that this distinction can result in an \textbf{infinite information gap}, with some partial orders having mathematical representations that involve a finite amount of information and requiring infinite information to build a physical representation. We connect this phenomenon with well-known resource-theoretic scenarios like majorization, and develop notions of partial order dimension that run in parallel to the representations that we consider. Our results improve on the classification of preordered spaces in terms of real-valued functions.</description>

Abstract: We explain how to encode an algebraic series by finite data and how to do effective arithmetic on the level of these encodings. The reasoning is based on the Newton-Puiseux algorithm and an effective equality test for algebraic series. Furthermore, we discuss how to derive information about the support of an algebraic series. Based thereon, we show how to identify the polynomial and rational solutions of a polynomial equation.</description>

Abstract: We introduce some generalized topological concepts to deal with union-closed families, and show that one can reduce the proof of Frankl's conjecture to some families of so-called supratopological spaces. We prove some results on the structure of normalized families, presenting a new way of reducing such a family to a smaller one using dual families. Applying our reduction method, we prove a refinement of a conjecture originally proposed by Poonen. Finally, we show that Frankl's Conjecture holds for the class of families obtained from successively applying the reduction process to a power set.</description>

      <title>From order one catalytic decompositions to context-free specifications: the rewiring bijection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20628v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A celebrated result of Bousquet-M\'elou and Jehanne states that the bivariate power series solutions of so-called combinatorial polynomial equations with one catalytic variable, also known as catalytic equations, are algebraic series. We give a purely combinatorial derivation of this result in the case of order one catalytic equations (those involving only one univariate unknown series). In particular our approach provides a tool to produce context-free specifications, or bijections with simple multi-type families of trees, for the derivation trees of combinatorial structures that are directly governed by an order one catalytic decomposition.
  This provides a simple unified framework to deal with various combinatorial interpretation problems that were solved or raised over the last 50 years since the first such catalytic equation was written by W. T. Tutte in the late 60's to enumerate rooted planar maps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06094v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As observed by Joyal, the cohomology groups of the partition posets are naturally identified with the components of the operad encoding Lie algebras. This connection was explained in terms of operadic Koszul duality by Fresse, and later generalized by Vallette to the setting of decorated partitions. In this article, we set up and study a general formalism which produces a priori operadic structures (operads and operadic modules) on the cohomology of families of posets equipped with some natural recursive structure, that we call "operadic poset species". This framework goes beyond decorated partitions and operadic Koszul duality, and contains the metabelian Lie operad and Kontsevich's operad of trees as two simple instances. In forthcoming work, we will apply our results to the hypertree posets and their connections to post-Lie and pre-Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>Ramsey goodness of stars and fans for the Haj\'os graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given two graphs $G_1$ and $G_2$, the Ramsey number $R(G_1,G_2)$ denotes the smallest integer $N$ such that any red-blue coloring of the edges of $K_N$ contains either a red $G_1$ or a blue $G_2$. Let $G_1$ be a graph with chromatic number $\chi$ and chromatic surplus $s$, and let $G_2$ be a connected graph with $n$ vertices. The graph $G_2$ is said to be Ramsey-good for the graph $G_1$ (or simply $G_1$-good) if, for $n \ge s$, \[R(G_1,G_2)=(\chi-1)(n-1)+s.\]
  The $G_1$-good property has been extensively studied for star-like graphs when $G_1$ is a graph with $\chi(G_1)\ge 3$, as seen in works by Burr-Faudree-Rousseau-Schelp (J. Graph Theory, 1983), Li-Rousseau (J. Graph Theory, 1996), Lin-Li-Dong (European J. Combin., 2010), Fox-He-Wigderson (Adv. Combin., 2023), and Liu-Li (J. Graph Theory, 2025), among others. However, all prior results require $G_1$ to have chromatic surplus $1$. In this paper, we extend this investigation to graphs with chromatic surplus 2 by considering the Haj\'os graph $H_a$. For a star $K_{1,n}$, we prove that $K_{1,n}$ is $H_a$-good if and only if $n$ is even. For a fan $F_n$ with $n\ge 111$, we prove that $F_n$ is $H_a$-good.</description>

Abstract: Koutschan, Krattenthaler and Schlosser recently considered a family of binomial determinants. In this work, we give combinatorial interpretations of two subclasses of these determinants in terms of domino tilings and nonintersecting lattice paths, thereby partially answering a question of theirs. Furthermore, the determinant evaluations established by Koutschan, Krattenthaler and Schlosser produce many product formulas for our weighted enumerations of domino tilings and nonintersecting lattice paths. However, there are still two enumerations left corresponding to conjectural formulas made by the three. We hereby prove the two conjectures using the principle of holonomic Ansatz plus the approach of modular reduction for creative telescoping, and hence fill the gap.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a combinatorial study of the power contamination problem, a dynamic variant of power domination modeled on grid graphs. We resolve a conjecture posed by Ainouche and Bouroubi (2021) by proving it is false and instead establish the exact value of the power contamination number on grid graphs. Furthermore, we derive recurrence relations for this number and initiate the enumeration of optimal contamination sets. We prove that the number of optimal solutions for specific grid families corresponds to well-known integer sequences, including those counting ternary words with forbidden subwords and the large Schr\"oder numbers. This work settles the fundamental combinatorial questions of the power contamination problem on grids and reveals its rich connections to classical combinatorics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1303.5865v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a set of similar triangles with parallel sides, along with a set of points in the plane. It turns out that the set $\mathbb{R}_2= \{\pm &lt;x &gt;=\pm (x^2,x,1); x\in\mathbb{R} \}$ describes this set of triangles quite well. The set $\mathbb{R}_2$ is a subset of the ring $\mathbb{R}^3=\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}= \{ (x,y,z) ; x,y,z\in\mathbb{R} \}$ with addition and multiplication defined coordinate-wise.
  The set $\mathbb{R}_2$ is equipped with two operations. Multiplication is inherited from the ring $\mathbb{R}^3$, while addition is a ternary operation that represents homothety and translation of elements in $\mathbb{R}_2$.
  However, the defined addition has its limitations. It turns out that, within this framework, the reduction of terms with different signs is not always possible. This leads to the distinction between an equation that is true in the arithmetic sense and one that is true in the geometric sense.
  A novel form of addition in $\mathbb{R}_2$ leads to intriguing properties of multiplication in $\mathbb{R}_2$, which are examined in a dedicated chapter.
  In the next section we use the construction of adding to describe the dissection of the triangle into 15 triangles of different sides.
  In the final two sections, we consider a set of two kinds of vectors, along with a set of points on the line. The set $\mathbb{R}_1= \{\pm &lt;x &gt;=\pm (x,1); x\in\mathbb{R} \}$ describes this set vectors quite well and it is a one-dimensional reduction of the set $\mathbb{R}_2$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we study gossip networks where a source observing a process sends updates to an underlying graph. Nodes in the graph communicate to their neighbors by randomly sending updates. Our interest is studying the version age of information (vAoI) metric over various classes of networks. It is known that the version age of $K_n$ is logarithmic, and the version age of $\overline{K_n}$ is linear. We study the question `how does the vAoI evolve as we interpolate between $K_n$ and $\overline{K_n}$' by studying Erd\H{o}s-Reyni random graphs, random $d$-regular graphs, and bipartite networks. Our main results are proving the existence of a threshold in $G(n,p)$ from rational to logarithmic average version age, and showing $G(n,d)$ almost surely has logarithmic version age for constant $d$. We also characterize the version age of complete bipartite graphs $K_{L,R}$, when we let $L$ vary from $O(1)$ to $O(n)$.</description>

      <title>Cycles in subexpression graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathfrak{S}(\underline{s},w)$ be the graph whose vertices are all subexpressions with target $w$ of a fixed expression $\underline{s}$ in generators of a Coxeter group and edges are the pairs of subexpressions with Hamming distance 2. We prove that $\mathfrak{S}(\underline{s},w)$ is connected and its cycle space is spanned by cycles of lengths $d+2$, where $d$ ranges over all positive divisors of all finite orders of products of at most two entries of $\underline{s}$.</description>

      <title>Labelled growth rates of $\omega$-categorical structures and applications in choiceless set theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the labelled growth rate of an $\omega$-categorical structure $\mathfrak{A}$, i.e., the number of orbits of $Aut(\mathfrak{A})$ on $n$-tuples of distinct elements, and show that the model-theoretic property of monadic stability yields a gap in the spectrum of allowable labelled growth rates. As a further application, we obtain gap in the spectrum of allowable labelled growth rates in hereditary graph classes, with no a priori assumption of $\omega$-categoricity. We also establish a way to translate results about labelled growth rates of $\omega$-categorical structures into combinatorial statements about sets with weak finiteness properties in the absence of the axiom of choice, and derive several results from this translation.</description>
