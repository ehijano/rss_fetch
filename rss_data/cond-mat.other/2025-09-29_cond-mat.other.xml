      <title>Entanglement signatures of gapless topological phases in a $p$-wave superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the gapless topological phases of a $p$-wave superconductor, probing its rich topologically ordered phases and underlying quantum phenomena. The topological order of the system is characterized by studying its entanglement properties. This study confirms the bulk-boundary correspondence in the entanglement spectrum, even without a full bulk gap. For contractible bipartitions, the entanglement entropy varies non-monotonically with the chemical potential, displaying pronounced peaks at points where the bulk gap closes and reopens, signaling topological quantum phase transitions. This behavior remains robust in the thermodynamic limit. The entanglement entropy grows with system size for non-contractible bipartitions, indicating long-range entanglement in the gapless phase. These findings reveal the subtle interplay between symmetry, entanglement, and topology in gapless systems, and emphasize the role of entanglement-based diagnostics in identifying unconventional topological phases beyond the gapped paradigm.</description>

      <title>Energetics and thermodynamics of bilayer rectangular artificial spin ices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bilayer rectangular artificial spin ices (BRASIs) with distinct aspect ratios, $\gamma$, are considered. Namely, we investigate how the underlying geometry modifies the interaction between two rectangular artificial spin ice layers separated by a height offset, $h$, whenever compared to the square case. Actually, rectangular layers interact by means of a Buckingham-like potential, whereas in the square case, one has an algebraic (van der Walls-like) interaction. In addition, Moir\'e patterns for BRASIs are less definite than for the square bilayer. We also deal with their basic thermodynamics, showing the behavior of the specific heat as a function of temperature and $\gamma$ for a number of height offsets.</description>

      <title>Selective nonthermal melting in phlogopite under ultrafast energy deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phlogopite is a complex magnesium-rich mineral from the dark mica group, KMg$_3$(AlSi$_3$O$_{10}$)(OH)$_2$. Its response to ultrafast excitation of its electronic system is studied using a hybrid model that combines tight-binding molecular dynamics with transport Monte Carlo and the Boltzmann equation. Simulations predict that at the deposited dose of ~0.17 eV/atom (electronic temperature $T_e$~11,000 K), the first hydrogens start to migrate in the otherwise preserved lattice, transiently turning mica into a superionic state. At the dose of ~0.4 eV/atom ($T_e$~13,000 K), Mg atoms start to diffuse like a liquid within stable sublattices of other elements, suggesting a superionic-superionic phase transition. At a dose of approximately 0.5 eV/atom ($T_e$~14,000 K), the entire atomic lattice destabilizes, disordering on picosecond timescale. It is accompanied by the formation of defect energy levels inside the bandgap. At the doses ~0.9 eV/atom ($T_e$~16,000 K), the bandgap completely collapses, turning the material metallic (electronically conducting). At even higher doses, nonthermal acceleration of atoms heats the atomic system at ultrafast timescales; K and O elements are most affected, accelerating within a few tens of femtoseconds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological boundary states exhibit distinctive properties, including unidirectional propagation and noise robustness, which hold significant potential for advancing the performance of quantum science and technology. Here, we demonstrate the implementation of non-Abelian quantum interference and entanglement generation, protected by dual symmetries (time-independent inversion and time-dependent interchain), in coupled Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains. Specifically, in a multi-chain system, we first achieve tunable topological transfer of a single particle, where the destination chain is selected by the braiding sequence. We then extend this to two particles, observing a non-Abelian Hong-Ou-Mandel interference that generates spatially entangled NOON states whose properties are dictated by the braiding order. Our work establishes an alternative pathway for exploring non-Abelian topology applied to quantum science and technology, enabled by the unique protection of time-dependent symmetry.</description>

      <title>Strain-induced Dynamic Spin-Phonon Coupling in Epitaxial RuO2 Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic order parameters in altermagnets can couple to quantized lattice vibration via both piezomagnetic and magnetoelastic effects, leading to the renormalization of phonon dispersion. Here, we demonstrate photo-induced dynamic frequency modulation of THz phonons excited in anisotropically-strained epitaxial RuO2 thin films using ultrafast coherent phonon spectroscopy and time-resolved magneto-optic Kerr effect measurement. A coherent oscillation of a transverse acoustic phonon appears in the sub-THz range with increasing film thickness above 4 nm due to local dislocation arising from the anisotropic strain relaxation, which hosts large non-zero shear strain. Interestingly, this phonon mode exhibits a time-varying mode hardening below ~ 500 K. Furthermore, an optical phonon oscillation emerges in magnetization dynamics of the photo-induced non-equilibrium state, and it becomes significantly softened near the critical temperature, while there is no observable magneto-optic signal in fully-strain-relaxed films. Such notable dynamic frequency modulations in acoustic and optical phonons offer an opportunity to manipulate phonons in the THz range through the spin-phonon coupling controlled by epitaxial design, which can inspire the new class of altermagnetic applications in the ultrafast quantum opto-spintronics.</description>

      <title>Demagnetization-Driven Nanoscale Chirality-Selective Thermal Switch</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral-lattice degrees of freedom can offer novel chirality-selective functionalities for thermotronic applications. Chiral phonons, carrying both heat and angular momentum, can emerge through a breaking of chiral degeneracy in the phonon bands, either via an intrinsic chiral crystal structure or by angular momentum transfer from photons or spins. This chiral controllability of the lattice dynamics enables a design of chiral thermo-devices by integrating ferromagnets with chiral materials. Here, we present a nanoscale chirality-selective thermal switch realized using a simple heterostructure composed of ferromagnetic [Co/Pt] multilayers and insulating chiral $\alpha$-SiO2, where an external magnetic field can control thermal transport properties. Our experimental results based on the magneto-optic thermometry reveal that the thermal conductivity of $\alpha$-SiO2 exhibits a clear dependence on both the magnetization direction of [Co/Pt] multilayers and the structural chirality of $\alpha$-SiO2, which is supported well by the first-principles-based molecular dynamic simulations. The magnetization-dependent thermal on/off ratio amounts to 1.07 at room temperature and increases to about 1.2 as temperature decreases to 50 K, due to a reduction of Umklapp phonon-phonon scattering rate in $\alpha$-SiO2. These findings provide the first experimental demonstration of the nanoscale chirality-selective thermal switch based on the ferromagnetic/chiral material heterostructure, highlighting its potential as a key technology for addressing heat dissipation challenges in nanoscale electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Generation of C-band entangled photon pairs by biexciton-exciton cascade from symmetric InAs/InP quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hereby, we study the generation of pairs of polarization-entangled photons at telecom C-band by biexciton-exciton cascade from non-resonantly excited epitaxial InAs/InP quantum dots (QDs). It is realized without external tuning of the fine structure splitting (FSS), which does not exceed 10 $\mu$eV in as-grown nanostructures, due to their high in-plane symmetry. Excitonic complexes are identified by means of excitation power-dependent and polarization-resolved magneto)microphotoluminescence. Their origin from different carrier configurations confined in the same QD is confirmed by time correlations of emitted photons. Experimental results are supported by 8-band kp calculations, followed by the configuration interaction method to include excitonic effects. This comparison reveals the structure of higher energy states, allowing for the reconstruction of the QD structural parameters. To verify and quantify the entanglement, we perform quantum state tomography and reconstruct the two-photon density matrix. Its diagonalization allows a detailed analysis of the entangled state and reveals an unfavourable interplay between phase accumulation and decoherence, pointing to a clear route for boosting entanglement by using a XX resonant, pulsed excitation scheme and shortening the radiative lifetimes.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional THz spectroscopy in electronic systems: a many-body diagrammatic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The term two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS) usually refers to experimental setups where a coherently generated electric field in a sample is recorded over many runs as a function of two time variables: the delay $\tau$ between two consequent excitation pulses and the time $t$ over which the signal is emitted. While its implementation in the femtosecond time domain for studying vibrational molecular states has been developed for over two decades, its experimental application in the THz domain to interacting electronic systems remains in its infancy. This work provides a general theoretical framework for describing and interpreting 2DCS using a many-body language based on a perturbative diagrammatic expansion, as widely applied in linear spectroscopy. Focusing on centrosymmetric systems, we show that interpreting the 2D maps can be recast into two complementary problems. The first is the evaluation of a third-order response function to the gauge field. In the velocity gauge, this leads to semi-analytical expressions that both reduce computational complexity and assist in assigning spectral features to microscopic processes, as shown using a toy model of electrons undergoing a charge-density wave transition. The second is a careful treatment of multi-wave propagation effects, which, in bulk systems, can obscure the intrinsic nonlinear response, demonstrated here for soft superconducting Josephson plasmons. Our results provide a solid foundation for extending 2DCS to complex interacting systems and offer a flexible method to realistically model nonlinear responses across arbitrary spectral widths.</description>

      <title>Coupling induced emergent topology in a two-leg fermionic ladder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the ground state properties of spinless fermions on a two leg ladder, by allowing the nearest-neighbour hopping dimerization in one leg and uniform hopping in the other. In the non-interacting limit, we find that, at half-filling, the system exhibits robust topological behavior if the inter-leg hopping is allowed. As a result, a topological phase transition occurs as a function of the inter-leg hopping. When the inter-leg interaction is turned on, the topological phase survives, and we obtain an interaction induced topological phase transition as a function of interaction. Moreover, we show that for both the non-interacting and interacting cases, topological nature of the system survives even by altering the dimerization pattern in the dimerized leg, resulting in two topological phases of opposite character. Finally, we reveal that when uniform interactions are included on all the bonds of the ladder, the topological phase transitions to a symmetry-broken charge-density wave (CDW) phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin fluctuations are an important issue for the design and operation of future spintronic devices. Femtosecond noise correlation spectroscopy (FemNoC) was recently applied to detect ultrafast magnetization fluctuations. FemNoC gives direct access to the spontaneous fluctuations of the magnetization in magnetically ordered materials. In FemNoC experiments, the magnetic fluctuations are imprinted on the polarization state of two independent femtosecond probe pulses upon transmission through a magnetic sample. Using a subharmonic demodulation scheme, the cross-correlation of the signals from both pulse trains is calculated. Here, we quantitatively link the FemNoC output signal to an optical polarization rotation, and then in turn to the magnitude of the inherent spin fluctuations. To this end, three different calibration protocols are presented and compared in accuracy. Ultimately, we quantitatively determine both the variance of optical polarization noise in rad$^2$, and that of the ultrafast magnetization fluctuations in (A/m)$^2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Position deformation of a Heisenberg algebra and Hilbert space representation of both maximal length and minimal momentum uncertainties may lead to loss of Hermiticity of some operators that generate this algebra. Consequently, the Hamiltonian operator constructed from these operators are also not Hermitian. In the present paper, with an appropriate positive-definite Dyson map, we establish the Hermiticity of these operators by means of a quasi-similarity transformation. We then construct Hilbert space representations associated with these quasi-Hermitian operators that generate a quasi-Hermitian Heisenberg algebra. With the help of these representations we establish the path integral formulation of any systems in this quasi-Hermitian algebra. Finally, using the path integral of a free particle as an example, we demonstrate that the Euclidean propagator, action, and kinetic energy of this system are constrained by the standard classical mechanics limits.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of Weak Interactions in Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Weak interactions cause small parity-violating energy differences between left- and right-handed chiral systems. Although normally tiny, these effects may be significantly enhanced during collective phenomena such as phase transitions. We propose a theoretical model describing the enhancement of weak interactions in phase transitions. The enhancement factor is proportional to the critical number of atoms, $N_c$, in the nucleus of the new phase. After the nucleus reaches its critical size, it grows until it fills the entire system. Measurement of the ratio of produced left and right chiral structures may provide a way to measure this critical number $N_c$. Experiments where definite spin-chiral structures are formed during a phase transition in crossed electric and magnetic fields, indicate $N_c \sim 10^9 - 10^{10}$. An open question is whether a similar enhancement could operate during cosmological phase transitions - thereby boosting CP-violating effects sufficiently to contribute to the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry (baryogenesis).</description>
