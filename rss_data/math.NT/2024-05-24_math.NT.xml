      <title>Pairing Powers of Pythagorean Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A pair $(a, b)$ of positive integers is a pythagorean pair if $a^2 + b^2$ is a square. A pythagorean pair $(a, b)$ is called a pythapotent pair of degree $h$ if there is another pythagorean pair $(k,l)$, which is not a multiple of $(a,b)$, such that $(a^hk, b^hl)$ is a pythagorean pair. To each pythagorean pair $(a, b)$ we assign an elliptic curve $\Gamma_{a^h ,b^h}$ for $h\ge 3$ with torsion group isomorphic to $\mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z \times \mathbb Z/4\mathbb Z$ such that $\Gamma_{a^h,b^h}$ has positive rank over $\mathbb Q$ if and only if $(a,b)$ is a pythapotent pair of degree $h$. As a side result, we get that if $(a, b)$ is a pythapotent pair of degree $h$, then there exist infinitely many pythagorean pairs $(k,l)$, not multiples of each other, such that $(a^hk,b^hl)$ is a pythagorean pair. In particular, we show that any pythagorean pair is always a pythapotent pair of degree 3. In a previous work, pythapotent pairs of degrees 1 and 2 have been studied.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assume that $H$ is a circulant Hadamard matrix of order $n\geq 4$. We consider an appropriate stochastic matrix $S$ of order $n$ depending on $H$. This allows us to prove that $n = 4$. Thus, there are only $10$ circulant Hadamard matrices.</description>

      <title>Towards a refinement of the Bloch-Kato conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rost and Voevodsky proved the Bloch-Kato conjecture relating Milnor $k$-theory and Galois cohomology. Their result implies that for a field $F$ containing a primitive $p$th root of unity, the Galois cohomology ring of $F$ with $\mathbb{F}_p$ coefficients is generated by elements of degree 1 as an $\mathbb{F}_p$-algebra. Therefore, for a given Galois extension $K/F$ and an element $\alpha$ in $H^*(\text{Gal}(K/F), \mathbb{F}_p)$ there exits a Galois extension $L/F$ containing $K/F$ such that the inflation of $\alpha$ in $H^*(\text{Gal}(L/F), \mathbb{F}_p)$ belongs to an $\mathbb{F}_p$-subalgebra of $H^*(\text{Gal}(L/F), \mathbb{F}_p)$ generated by $1$-dimensional classes. It is interesting to find relatively small explicit Galois extensions $L/F$ with the above property for a given $\alpha$ in $H^*(\text{Gal}(K/F), \mathbb{F}_p)$ as above. In this paper, we provide some answers to this question for cohomology classes in degree two, thus setting the first step toward refining the Bloch-Kato conjecture. We illustrate this refinement by explicitly computing the cohomology rings of superpythagorean and $p$-rigid fields. Additionally, as a byproduct of our work, we characterize elementary abelian $2$-groups as the only finite $p$-groups whose mod-$p$ cohomology ring is generated by degree-one elements. This provides additional motivation for studying refinements of the Bloch-Kato conjecture and exploring the connections between group cohomology and Galois theory.</description>

      <title>The Square-Root Law Does Not Hold in the Presence of Zero Divisors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a finite ring and define the paraboloid $P = \{(x_1, \dots, x_d)\in R^d|x_d = x_1^2 + \dots + x_{d-1}^2\}.$ Suppose that for a sequence of finite rings of size tending to infinity, the Fourier transform of $P$ satisfies a square-root law for some fixed constant $C$. Then all but finitely many of the rings are fields. Most of our argument works in greater generality: let $f$ be a polynomial with integer coefficients in $d-1$ variables, with a fixed order of variable multiplications (so that it defines a function $R^{d-1}\rightarrow R$ even when $R$ is noncommutative), and set $V_f = \{(x_1, \dots, x_d)\in R^d|x_d = f(x_1, \dots, x_{d-1})\}$. If (for a sequence of finite rings of size tending to infinity) we have a square root law for the Fourier transform of $V_f$, then all but finitely many of the rings are fields or matrix rings of small dimension. We also describe how our techniques let us see that certain varieties do not satisfy a square root law even over finite fields.</description>

      <title>La curva de Fargues--Fontaine: Una motivaci\'on al estudio de la teor\'ia de representaciones de Galois $p$-\'adicas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article, written in Spanish, provides a comprehensive review of the Fargues-Fontaine curve, a cornerstone in $p$-adic Hodge theory, and its pivotal role in classifying $p$-adic Galois representations. We synthesize key developments surrounding this curve, emphasizing its connection between advanced concepts in arithmetic geometry and the practical theory of representations. We offer a detailed analysis of the Fontaine period rings ($B_{cris}, B_{st}, B_{dR}$), exploring their crucial algebraic and arithmetic properties and their contribution to the curve's construction and definition. Furthermore, we delve into the theory of admissible $p$-adic Galois representations, discussing how the curve, once defined, integrates with Harder-Narasimhan theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend known methods to establish upper bounds on the least character non-residues contingent on different zero-free regions within the critical strip, in particular on bounded rectangles within the critical strip along the $\sigma=1$ line at arbitrary heights. This relates to earlier conditional results on least character non-residues, and recent results of Granville and Soundararajan on character sums.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assume that Y is a random variable whose moment generating function exists in a neighborhood of the origin. We study the probabilistic degenerate r-Stirling numbers of the second kind associated with Y and the probabilistic degenerate r-Bell polynomials associated with Y. They are respectively probabilistic extensions of the degenerate r-Stirling numbers of the second and the degenerate r-Bell polynomials which are studied earlier. The aim of this paper is to obtain their properties, explicit expressions and related identities by means of generating functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the reduction properties of low genus curves whose Jacobian has complex multiplication. In the elliptic curve case, we classify the possible Kodaira types of reduction that can occur. Moreover, we investigate the possible Namikawa Ueno types that can occur for genus $2$ curves whose Jacobian has complex multiplication which is defined over the base field. We also produce bounds on the torsion subgroup of abelian varieties with complex multiplication defined over local fields.</description>

      <title>Recovering short generators via negative moments of Dirichlet $L$-functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2016, Cramer, Ducas, Peikert and, Regev proposed an efficient algorithm for recovering short generators of principal ideals in $q$-th cyclotomic fields with $q$ being a prime power. In this paper, we improve their analysis of the dual basis of the log-cyclotomic-unit lattice under the Generalised Riemann Hypothesis and in the case that $q$ is a prime number by the negative square moment of Dirichlet $L$-functions at $s=1$. As an implication, we obtain a better lower bound on the success probability for the algorithm in this special case. In order to prove our main result, we also give an analysis of the behaviour of negative $2k$-th moments of Dirichlet $L$-functions at $s=1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain new complexity bounds for computing a triangular integral basis of a number field or a function field. We reach for function fields a softly linear cost with respect to the size of the output when the residual characteristic is zero or big enough. Analogous results are obtained for integral basis of fractional ideals, key ingredients towards fast computation of Riemann-Roch spaces. The proof is based on the recent fast OM algorithm of the authors and on the MaxMin algorithm of Stainsby, together with optimal truncation bounds and a precise complexity analysis.</description>

      <title>Cyclic Cubic Points on Higher Genus Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distribution of degree $d$ points on curves is well understood, especially for low degrees. We refine this study to include information on the Galois group in the simplest interesting case: $d = 3$. For curves of genus at least 5, we show cubic points with Galois group $C_3$ arise from well-structured morphisms, along with providing computable tests for the existence of such morphisms. We prove the same for curves of lower genus under some geometric or arithmetic assumptions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the weight 6, depth 3, multiple polylogarithm $ \mathrm{Li}_{4,1,1}((xyz)^{-1}, x, y) $, or rather its more natural `divergent' incarnation $ \mathrm{Li}_{3;1,1,1}(x,y,z) $, satisfies the 6-fold anharmonic symmetries of the dilogarithm $ \mathrm{Li}_2 $, $ \lambda \mapsto 1-\lambda $ and $ \lambda \mapsto \lambda^{-1} $, in each of $x$, $y$ and $z$ independently, modulo terms of depth $ \leq2 $. This establishes the `higher Zagier' part of the weight 6, depth 3, reduction conjectured by Matveiakin and Rudenko. Together with their proof of the `higher Gangl' part of the weight 6, depth 3, reduction (which is formulated modulo the `higher Zagier' part), we establish Goncharov's Depth Conjecture in the case of weight 6, depth 3.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Independence of Special Points on Shimura Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a correspondence $V$ between a connected Shimura variety $S$, a commutative connected algebraic group $T$, and $n \in \N$, we prove that the $V$-images of any $n$ special points on $S$ outside a proper Zariski closed subset are algebraically independent. Our result unifies previous unlikely intersection results on multiplicative independence and linear independence. We prove multiplicative independence of differences of singular moduli, generalizing previous results by Pila-Tsimerman, and Aslanlyan-Eterovi\'c-Fowler. We also give an application to abelian varieties by proving that the special points of $S$ whose $V$-images lie in a finite-rank subgroup of $T$ are contained in a finite union of proper special subvarieties of $S$, only dependent on the rank of the subgroup. In this way, our result is a generalization of the works of Pila-Tsimerman and Buium-Poonen.</description>

      <title>The bias conjecture for elliptic curves over finite fields and Hurwitz class numbers in arithmetic progressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a version of the bias conjecture for second moments in the setting of elliptic curves over finite fields whose trace of Frobenius lies in an arbitrary fixed arithmetic progression. Contrary to the classical setting of reductions of one-parameter families over the rationals, where it is conjectured by Steven J. Miller that the bias is always negative, we prove that in our setting the bias is positive for a positive density of arithmetic progressions and negative for a positive density of arithmetic progressions. Along the way, we obtain explicit formulas for moments of traces of Frobenius of elliptic curves over finite fields in arithmetic progressions and related moments of Hurwitz class numbers in arithmetic progressions, the distribution of which are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Counterexamples to the $p(t)$-adic Littlewood Conjecture Over Small Finite Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2004, de Mathan and Teuli\'e stated the $p$-adic Littlewood Conjecture ($p$-$LC$) in analogy with the classical Littlewood Conjecture. Given a field $\mathbb{K}$ and an irreducible polynomial $p(t)$ with coefficients in $\mathbb{K}$, $p$-$LC$ admits a natural analogue over function fields, abbreviated to $p(t)$-$LC$ (and to $t$-$LC$ when $p(t)=t$).
  In this paper, an explicit counterexample to $p(t)$-$LC$ is found over fields of characteristic 5. Furthermore, it is conjectured that this Laurent series disproves $p(t)$-$LC$ over all fields of characteristic $p\equiv 1 \mod 4$. This fills a gap left by a breakthrough paper from Adiceam, Nesharim and Lunnon (2022) in which they conjecture $t$-$LC$ does not hold over all complementary fields of characteristic $p\equiv 3\mod 4$ and proving this in the case $p=3$. Supported by computational evidence, this provides a complete picture on how $p(t)$-$LC$ is expected to behave over all fields with characteristic not equal to 2. Furthermore, the counterexample to $t$-$LC$ over fields of characteristic 3 found by Adiceam, Nesharim and Lunnon is proven to also hold over fields of characteristic 7 and 11, which provides further evidence to the aforementioned conjecture.
  Following previous work in this area, these results are achieved by building upon combinatorial arguments and are computer assisted. A new feature of the present work is the development of an efficient algorithm (implemented in Python) that combines the theory of automatic sequences with Diophantine approximation over function fields. This algorithm is expected to be useful for further research around Littlewood-type conjectures over function fields.</description>

      <title>Sums of four polygonal numbers: precise formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we give unified formulas for the numbers of representations of positive integers as sums of four generalized $m$-gonal numbers, and as restricted sums of four squares under a linear condition, respectively. These formulas are given as $\mathbb{Z}$-linear combinations of Hurwitz class numbers. As applications, we prove several Zhi-Wei Sun's conjectures. As by-products, we obtain formulas for expressing the Fourier coefficients of $\vartheta(\tau,z)^4$, $\eta(\tau)^{12}$, $\eta(\tau)^4$ and $\eta(\tau)^8\eta(2\tau)^8$ in terms of the Hurwitz class numbers, respectively. The proof is based on the theory of Jacobi forms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assuming the generalized Lindel\"{o}f hypothesis (GLH), a weak generalized Ramanujan conjecture and a Rankin--Selberg type partial sum estimate, we show that the sum of coefficients of a general $L$-function in short intervals of appropriate length has a Gaussian limiting distribution. The novelty lies in the degree aspect under GLH. In particular, this generalizes Hughes--Rudnick's result on lattice point counts in thin annuli.</description>

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to present elliptic curves defined over function fields of even characteristic having arbitrarily large Mordell-Weil rank. More precisely, we study elliptic curves arising as quartic twist of a supersingular elliptic curve defined over $\mathbb{F}_2$ using the function field of a maximal curve $C$ that admits an order 4 automorphism. For such elliptic curves we provide a rank formula for its Mordell-Weil group in terms of the genera of $C$ and of another curve covered by $C$.</description>

      <title>Block decompositions for $p$-adic classical groups and their inner forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For an inner form $\mathrm{G}$ of a general linear group or classical group over a non-archimedean local field of odd residue characteristic, we decompose the category of smooth representations on $\mathbb{Z}[\mu_{p^{\infty}},1/p]$-modules by endo-parameter. We prove that parabolic induction preserves these decompositions, and hence that it preserves endo-parameters. Moreover, we show that the decomposition by endo-parameter is the $\overline{\mathbb{Z}}[1/p]$-block decomposition; and, for $\mathrm{R}$ an integral domain, introduce a graph whose connected components parameterize the $\mathrm{R}$-blocks, in particular including the cases $\mathrm{R}=\overline{\mathbb{Z}}_{\ell}$ and $\mathrm{R}=\overline{\mathbb{F}}_\ell$ for $\ell\neq p$. From our description, we deduce that the $\overline{\mathbb{Z}_\ell}$-blocks and $\overline{\mathbb{F}_\ell}$-blocks of $\mathrm{G}$ are in natural bijection, as had long been expected. Our methods also apply to the trivial endo-parameter (i.e., the depth zero subcategory) of any connected reductive $p$-adic group, providing an alternative approach to results of Dat and Lanard in depth zero. Finally, under a technical assumption (known for inner forms of general linear groups) we reduce the $\mathrm{R}$-block decomposition of $\mathrm{G}$ to depth zero.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An expression is any mathematical formula that contains certain formal variables and operations to be executed in a specified order. In computer science, it is usually convenient to represent each expression in the form of an expression tree. Here, we consider only arithmetic expressions, i.e., those that contain only the four standard arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, alongside additive inversion. We first provide certain theoretical results concerning the equivalence of such expressions and then disclose a $\Theta(n^2)$ algorithm that computes the number of inequivalent arithmetic expressions on $n$ distinct variables.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathbf{K}$ be an algebraically closed field of arbitrary characteristic, complete with respect to a non-archimedean absolute value $|\,|$. We establish a Second Main Theorem type estimate for analytic map $f\colon \mathbf{K}\rightarrow\mathbb{P}^n(\mathbf{K})$ and a family of $n$ hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{P}^n(\mathbf{K})$ intersecting transversally and not all being hyperplanes. This implements the previous work of Levin where the case of all hypersurfaces having degree greater than one was studied.</description>

Abstract: These are expanded notes from a talk at the RIMS Workshop, Algebraic Number Theory and Related Topics, December 13th, 2023. We discussed Elmanto-Morrow's motivic complex, the procdh sheafification of the classical motivic complex, and their comparison. The procdh topology and the comparison is joint work with Shuji Saito. The comparison was obtained through joint discussion with Morrow, and its proof relies heavily on the main results of [EM23].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2104.10243v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we extend the result of Conrey [5, Theorem 2] to shorter intervals for higher-order derivatives of the zeta function. That is we study the mean value of the product of two finite order derivatives of the zeta function multiplied by a mollifier in short intervals. In this process, we obtain better mollifier length in some short intervals compared to the length of mollifier implied by Conrey's result. These finer studies allow us to refine the error term of some classical results of Levinson and Montgomery [13], Ki and Lee [11] on zero density estimates of $\zeta^{(k)}$.
  Further, we showed that almost all non-trivial zeros of Matsumoto-Tanigawa's $\eta_k$-function cluster near the critical line.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2105.01023v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the Brauer-Siegel theorem to new families of number fields, both in the classical setting of asymptotically bad families and in the more general framework due to Tsfasman and Vl\u{a}du\c{t} of asymptotically exact families. We introduce a notion of Galois complexity for extensions of number fields, and show that the generalized Brauer-Siegel theorem, as conjectured by Tsfasman and Vl\u{a}du\c{t}, holds for families in which the complexity does not grow too fast. This allows to unify and extend all previously known results. The crucial step in our work is the proof of a new version -- stated in terms of our Galois complexity -- of a fundamental principle due to Stark descending exceptional zeroes of zeta functions down to quadratic number fields. Among the hitherto unknown cases we are able to treat are the families of number fields contained in the solvable Galois closure of a given number field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.16291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the growth of the local $L^2$-norms of the unitary Eisenstein series for reductive groups over number fields, in terms of their parameters. We derive a \emph{poly-logarithmic} bound on an average, for a large class of reductive groups. The method is based on Arthur's development of the spectral side of the trace formula, and ideas of Finis, Lapid, and M\"uller. As applications of our method, we prove the optimal lifting property for $\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{Z}/q\mathbb{Z})$ for square-free $q$, as well as the Sarnak--Xue counting property for the principal congruence subgroup of $\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{Z})$ of square-free level. This makes the recent results of Assing--Blomer unconditional.</description>

Abstract: The inverse Galois problem asks whether any finite group can be realised as the Galois group of a Galois extension of the rationals. This problem and its refinements have stimulated a large amount of research in number theory and algebraic geometry in the past century, ranging from Noether's problem (letting X denote the quotient of the affine space by a finite group acting linearly, when is X rational?) to the rigidity method (if X is not rational, does it at least contain interesting rational curves?) and to the arithmetic of unirational varieties (if all else fails, does X at least contain interesting rational points?). The goal of the present notes, which formed the basis for three lectures given at the Park City Mathematics Institute in August 2022, is to provide an introduction to these topics.</description>

This improves on a previous lower bound of $\gg x \log\log x$ of Hall and Tenenbaum, and can be compared to the recent upper bound of $x (\log\log x)^{11/4}$ of the second and third authors.</description>

      <title>$\infty$-Categorical Generalized Langlands Program I: Mixed-Parity Modules and Sheaves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10019v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mixed-parity module emerges for instance when a de Rham Galois representation is being tensored with a square root of cyclotomic character, which produces half odd integers as the corresponding Hodge-Tate weights. We build the whole foundation on the $p$-adic Hodge theory in this setting over small $v$-stacks after Scholze and we also consider certain moduli $v$-stack which parametrizes families of mixed-parity Hodge modules. Examples of the small $v$-stacks in our mind are rigid analytic spaces over $p$-adic fields and moduli $v$-stack of vector bundles over Fargues-Fontaine curves. The preparation implemented at this level will be expected to provide further essential foundationalization for generalized Langlands program after Langlands, Drinfeld, Fargues-Scholze. One side of the generalized Langlands correspondence in the geometric setting is the perverse motivic derived $\infty$-category over $\mathrm{Moduli}_G$ related to smooth representations of reductive groups, while the other side of the generalized Langlands correspondence in the geometric setting is the corresponding derived $\infty$-category over the stack of mixed-parity $L$-parametrizations (i.e. from two-fold covering of the Weil group into $\ell$-adic groups) related to the representations of Weil group in our setting into Langlands dual groups. Although after Scholze and Fargues-Scholze our generalized Langlands program can go along $\ell$-adic cohomologicalization to immediately achieve various solid derived $\infty$-categories $\mathrm{DerCat}_\text{\'et}(\mathrm{Moduli}_G,\square)$, $\mathrm{DerCat}_\mathrm{lisse, \blacksquare}(\mathrm{Moduli}_G,\square)$, $\mathrm{DerCat}_{\blacksquare}(\mathrm{Moduli}_G,\square)$ and so on with well-established formalism regarding 6-functors, we already provide certain $p$-adic cohomologicalization of the story over $\mathrm{Moduli}_G$.</description>

      <title>Partition functions for non-commutative harmonic oscillators and related divergent series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The heat kernel (or propagator) of the quantum harmonic oscillator (qHO) is given by the Mehler formula, and the partition function is obtained by taking its trace. In general, the spectral zeta function of the given system is obtained by the Mellin transform of its partition function. In the case of non-commutative harmonic oscillators (NCHO), however, the heat kernel and partition functions are still unknown, although meromorphic continuation of the corresponding spectral zeta function and special values at positive integer points have been studied. On the other hand, explicit formulas for the heat kernel and partition function have been obtained for the quantum Rabi model (QRM), which is the simplest and most fundamental model for light and matter interaction in addition to having the NCHO as a covering model. In this paper, we propose a notion of the quasi-partition function for a quantum interaction model if the corresponding spectral zeta function can be meromorphically continued to the whole complex plane. The quasi-partition function for qHO and QRM actually gives the partition function. Assuming that this holds for the NCHO (currently a conjecture), we can find various interesting properties for the spectrum of the NCHO. Moreover, although we cannot expect any functional equation of the spectral zeta function for the quantum interaction models, we try to seek if there is some relation between the special values at positive and negative points. Attempting to seek this, we encounter certain divergent series expressing formally the Hurwitz zeta function by calculating integrals of the partition functions. We then give two interpretations of these divergent series by the Borel summation and $p$-adically convergent series defined by the $p$-adic Hurwitz zeta function.</description>

      <title>The Density of Borromean Primes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17957v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study an asymptotic distribution of sets of primes satisfying certain "linking conditions" in arithmetic topology, namely, conditions given by the Legendre and R\'edei symbols among sets of primes. As our Main Theorem, we prove an asymptotic density formula for Borromean primes among all primes. For the proof, we use the effective Chebotarev density formula under the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis and explicit computations of discriminants of the number fields involved in R\'edei's extension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We build a one-to-one correspondence between $3$-dimensional (generic) crystabelline representations of the absolute Galois group of $\mathbb{Q}_p$ and certain locally analytic representations of $\mathrm{GL}_3(\mathbb{Q}_p)$. We show that the correspondence can be realized in subspaces of $p$-adic automorphic representations.</description>

      <title>On Chen's theorem, Goldbach's conjecture and almost prime twins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05727v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $N$ denote a sufficiently large even integer, we define $D_{1,2}(N)$ as the same as those in previous articles about Chen's theorem. In this paper, we show that $D_{1,2}(N) \geqslant 1.733 \frac{C(N) N}{(\log N)^2}$, improving previous record of Wu about $93\%$. We also get similar results on twin prime problem and additive representations of integers. An important step in the proof is the application of the theorems of Lichtman.</description>

      <title>On the set of points represented by harmonic subseries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We help Alice play a certain "convergence game" against Bob and win the prize, which is a constructive solution to a problem by Erd\H{o}s and Graham, posed in their 1980 book on open questions in combinatorial number theory. Namely, after several reductions using peculiar arithmetic identities, the game outcome shows that the set of points \[ \Big(\sum_{n\in A}\frac{1}{n}, \sum_{n\in A}\frac{1}{n+1}, \sum_{n\in A}\frac{1}{n+2}\Big), \] obtained as $A$ ranges over infinite sets of positive integers, has a non-empty interior. This generalizes a two-dimensional result by Erd\H{o}s and Straus.</description>

      <title>A conjecture of Zhi-Wei Sun on matrices concerning multiplicative subgroups of finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08552v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent work of Zhi-Wei Sun on determinants involving the Legendre symbol, in this paper, we study some matrices concerning subgroups of finite fields.
  For example, let $q\equiv 3\pmod 4$ be an odd prime power and let $\phi$ be the unique quadratic multiplicative character of the finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$. If set $\{s_1,\cdots,s_{(q-1)/2}\}=\{x^2:\ x\in\mathbb{F}_q\setminus\{0\}\}$, then we prove that
  $$\det\left[t+\phi(s_i+s_j)+\phi(s_i-s_j)\right]_{1\le i,j\le (q-1)/2}=\left(\frac{q-1}{2}t-1\right)q^{\frac{q-3}{4}}.$$
  This confirms a conjecture of Zhi-Wei Sun.</description>

      <title>A generalization of Croot-Lev-Pach's Lemma and a new upper bound for the size of difference sets in polynomial rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05308</link>
      <description>arXiv:1803.05308v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Croot, Lev and Pach used a new polynomial technique to give a new exponential upper bound for the size of three-term progression-free subsets in the groups $(\mathbb Z _4)^n$.
  The main tool in proving their striking result is a simple lemma about polynomials, which gives interesting new bounds for the size of subsets of the vector space $({\mathbb Z _p})^n$.
  Our main result is a generalization of this lemma. In the proof we combined Tao's slice rank bounding method with Gr\"obner basis technique.
  As an application, we improve Green's results and present new upper bounds for the size of difference sets in polynomial rings. We give a new, more concrete upper bound for the size of arithmetic progression-free subsets in $({\mathbb Z _p})^n$.</description>

      <title>Equidistribution of expanding degenerate manifolds in the space of lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.13952v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the space of unimodular lattices in a Euclidean space, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for equidistribution of expanding translates of any real-analytic submanifold under a diagonal flow. This extends the earlier result of Shah in the case of non-degenerate submanifolds.
  We apply the above dynamical result to show that if the affine span of a real-analytic submanifold in a Euclidean space satisfies certain Diophantine and arithmetic conditions, then almost every point on the manifold is not Dirichlet-improvable.</description>

      <title>On nonemptiness of Newton strata in the $B_\mathrm{dR}^+$-Grassmannian for $\mathrm{GL}_n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.08374v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Newton stratification in the $B_\mathrm{dR}^+$-Grassmannian for $\mathrm{GL}_n$ associated to an arbitrary (possibly nonbasic) element of $B(\mathrm{GL}_n)$. Our main result classifies all nonempty Newton strata in an arbitrary minuscule Schubert cell. For a large class of elements in $B(\mathrm{GL}_n)$, our classification is given by some explicit conditions in terms of Newton polygons. For the proof, we proceed by induction on n using a previous result of the author that classifies all extensions of two given vector bundles on the Fargues-Fontaine curve.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give two extensions of the recent theorem of the first author that the odd distance graph has unbounded chromatic number. The first is that for any non-constant polynomial $f$ with integer coefficients and positive leading coefficient, every finite colouring of the plane contains a monochromatic pair of distinct points whose distance is equal to $f(n)$ for some integer $n$. The second is that for every finite colouring of the plane, there is a monochromatic pair of points whose distance is a prime number.</description>

      <title>Odometers, Backward continued fractions and counting rationals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been more than twenty years since Moshe Newman, based on work by Neil Calkin and Herbert Wilf, introduced an explicit bijection between the rational and natural numbers. Interestingly, this bijection is dynamic in nature. Indeed, Newman's map has the property that the orbit of zero provides the required bijection. Claudio Bonanno and Stefano Isola, using continued fractions expansions, described the dynamics of its first return time map T. They proved that it is topologically conjugated to the dyadic odometer. In this article, we prove that the correct numerical system needed to analyze this map is the backward continued fractions. Indeed, this approach has the advantage that it provides explicitly the action of T on the expansion. As a by-product, we naturally obtain an explicit formula for Minkowski's question mark function in terms of backward continued fractions. The whole point of Newman was to provide an explicit bijection, our approach shares the same taste for the explicit.</description>

      <title>K-theory and localizing invariants of large categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce and study the so-called continuous $K$-theory for a certain class of "large" stable $\infty$-categories, more precisely, for dualizable presentable categories. For compactly generated categories, the continuous $K$-theory is simply the usual (non-connective) $K$-theory of the full subcategory of compact objects. More generally, we show that any localizing invariant of small stable $\infty$-categories can be uniquely extended to a localizing invariant of dualizable categories.
  We compute the continuous $K$-theory for categories of sheaves on locally compact Hausdorff spaces. Using the special case for sheaves on the real line, we give an alternative proof of the theorem of Kasprowski and Winges \cite{KW19} on the commutation of $K$-theory with infinite products for small stable $\infty$-categories.
  We also study the general theory of dualizable categories. In particular, we give an "explicit" proof of Ramzi's theorem \cite{Ram} on the $\omega_1$-presentability of the category of dualizable categories. Among other things, we prove that dualizability is equivalent to "flatness" in the category of presentable stable categories.</description>
