      <title>Information theory for data-driven model reduction in physics and biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06608v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model reduction is the construction of simple yet predictive descriptions of the dynamics of many-body systems in terms of a few relevant variables. A prerequisite to model reduction is the identification of these relevant variables, a task for which no general method exists. Here, we develop a systematic approach based on the information bottleneck to identify the relevant variables, defined as those most predictive of the future. We elucidate analytically the relation between these relevant variables and the eigenfunctions of the transfer operator describing the dynamics. Further, we show that in the limit of high compression, the relevant variables are directly determined by the slowest-decaying eigenfunctions. Our information-based approach indicates when to optimally stop increasing the complexity of the reduced model. Furthermore, it provides a firm foundation to construct interpretable deep learning tools that perform model reduction. We illustrate how these tools work in practice by considering uncurated videos of atmospheric flows from which our algorithms automatically extract the dominant slow collective variables, as well as experimental videos of cyanobacteria colonies in which we discover an emergent synchronization order parameter.</description>

      <title>Phase-space analysis of a two-section InP laser as an all-optical spiking neuron: dependency on control and design parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using a rate-equation model we numerically evaluate the carrier concentration and photon number in an integrated two-section semiconductor laser, and analyse its dynamics in three-dimensional phase space. The simulation comprises compact model descriptions extracted from a commercially-available generic InP technology platform, allowing us to model an applied reverse-bias voltage to the saturable absorber. We use the model to study the influence of the injected gain current, reverse-bias voltage, and cavity mirror reflectivity on the excitable operation state, which is the operation mode desired for the laser to act as an all-optical integrated neuron. We show in phase-space that our model is capable of demonstrating four different operation modes, i.e. cw, self-pulsating and an on-set and excitable mode under optical pulse injection. In addition, we show that lowering the reflectivity of one of the cavity mirrors greatly enhances the control parameter space for excitable operation, enabling more relaxed operation parameter control and lower power consumption of an integrated two-section laser neuron.</description>

      <title>Theory of Optomechanical Locking in Driven-Dissipative Coupled Polariton Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08420v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ubiquitous phenomenon of synchronization is inherently characteristic of dynamical dissipative non-linear systems. In particular, synchronization has been theoretically and experimentally demonstrated for exciton-polariton condensates with time-independent coupling. Unlike that case, we theoretically investigate the effects of a fixed mechanical harmonic driving, i.e., a coherent phonon population, that induces time modulation in the coupling of two coupled condensates. Our model applies both to electrically generated modulation, through coherent bulk acoustic waves, and to self-induced optomechanical vibrations. We consider linear as well as quadratic phonon-displacement-induced modulations of the polariton coupling. Peculiar asynchronously locked phases are found and analyzed in the context of synchronization and Josephson-type oscillations phenomena that appear in the non-driven case. Notably, Arnold tongues corresponding to the asynchronously locked phases emerge at condensate detunings that correspond to integer numbers of the mechanical frequency and also to rational fractions of it. Unlocked quasiperiodic and chaotic regimes can also be reached. In particular, the phonon-induced fractional locking frequencies arrange in a Farey sequence that produces a devil's staircase of the steady-state dressed detuning between the condensates. Importantly, both polariton-polariton and reservoir-polariton interactions facilitate the realization of coherent phonon-induced asynchronously locked phases. The relation to recent experiments on optomechanically driven condensates in arrays of polariton traps is discussed.</description>
