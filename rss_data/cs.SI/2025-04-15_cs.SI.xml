      <title>Quantifying the Spread of Online Incivility in Brazilian Politics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incivility refers to behaviors that violate collective norms and disrupt cooperation within the political process. Although large-scale online data and automated techniques have enabled the quantitative analysis of uncivil discourse, prior research has predominantly focused on impoliteness or toxicity, often overlooking other behaviors that undermine democratic values. To address this gap, we propose a multidimensional conceptual framework encompassing Impoliteness, Physical Harm and Violent Political Rhetoric, Hate Speech and Stereotyping, and Threats to Democratic Institutions and Values. Using this framework, we measure the spread of online political incivility in Brazil using approximately 5 million tweets posted by 2,307 political influencers during the 2022 Brazilian general election. Through statistical modeling and network analysis, we examine the dynamics of uncivil posts at different election stages, identify key disseminators and audiences, and explore the mechanisms driving the spread of uncivil information online. Our findings indicate that impoliteness is more likely to surge during election campaigns. In contrast, the other dimensions of incivility are often triggered by specific violent events. Moreover, we find that left-aligned individual influencers are the primary disseminators of online incivility in the Brazilian Twitter/X sphere and that they disseminate not only direct incivility but also indirect incivility when discussing or opposing incivility expressed by others. They relay those content from politicians, media agents, and individuals to reach broader audiences, revealing a diffusion pattern mixing the direct and two-step flows of communication theory. This study offers new insights into the multidimensional nature of incivility in Brazilian politics and provides a conceptual framework that can be extended to other political contexts.</description>

      <title>Cross-Partisan Interactions on Twitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many social media studies argue that social media creates echo chambers where some users only interact with peers of the same political orientation. However, recent studies suggest that a substantial amount of Cross-Partisan Interactions (CPIs) do exist - even within echo chambers, but they may be toxic. There is no consensus about how such interactions occur and when they lead to healthy or toxic dialogue. In this paper, we study a comprehensive Twitter dataset that consists of 3 million tweets from 2020 related to the U.S. context to understand the dynamics behind CPIs. We investigate factors that are more associated with such interactions, including how users engage in CPIs, which topics are more contentious, and what are the stances associated with healthy interactions. We find that CPIs are significantly influenced by the nature of the topics being discussed, with politically charged events acting as strong catalysts. The political discourse and pre-established political views sway how users participate in CPIs, but the direction in which users go is nuanced. While Democrats engage in cross-partisan interactions slightly more frequently, these interactions often involve more negative and nonconstructive stances compared to their intra-party interactions. In contrast, Republicans tend to maintain a more consistent tone across interactions. Although users are more likely to engage in CPIs with popular accounts in general, this is less common among Republicans who often engage in CPIs with accounts with a low number of followers for personal matters. Our study has implications beyond Twitter as identifying topics with low toxicity and high CPI can help highlight potential opportunities for reducing polarization while topics with high toxicity and low CPI may action targeted interventions when moderating harm.</description>

      <title>FROG: Effective Friend Recommendation in Online Games via Modality-aware User Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the convenience of mobile devices, the online games have become an important part for user entertainments in reality, creating a demand for friend recommendation in online games. However, none of existing approaches can effectively incorporate the multi-modal user features (\emph{e.g.}, images and texts) with the structural information in the friendship graph, due to the following limitations: (1) some of them ignore the high-order structural proximity between users, (2) some fail to learn the pairwise relevance between users at modality-specific level, and (3) some cannot capture both the local and global user preferences on different modalities. By addressing these issues, in this paper, we propose an end-to-end model \textsc{FROG} that better models the user preferences on potential friends. Comprehensive experiments on both offline evaluation and online deployment at \kw{Tencent} have demonstrated the superiority of \textsc{FROG} over existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Identification of Community Structures in Networks Employing a Modified Divisive Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In numerous networks, it is vital to identify communities consisting of closely joined groups of individuals. Such communities often reveal the role of the networks or primary properties of the individuals. In this perspective, Newman and Girvan proposed a modularity score (Q) for quantifying the power of community structure and measuring the appropriateness of a division. The Q function has newly become a significant standard. In this paper, the strengths of the Q score and another technique known as the divisive algorithm are combined to enhance the efficiently of the identification of communities from a network. To achieve that goal, we have developed a new algorithm. The simulation results indicated that our algorithm achieved a division with a slightly higher Q score against some conventional methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we have shown that the distributions of ksi satisfy an exponential law for real networks while the distributions of ksi for random networks are bell-shaped and closer to the normal distribution. The ksi distributions for Barabasi-Albert and Watts-Strogatz networks are similar to the ksi distributions for random networks (bell-shaped) for most parameters, but when these parameters become small enough, the Barabasi-Albert and Watts-Strogatz networks become more realistic with respect to the ksi distributions.</description>

      <title>Data Cooperatives: Democratic Models for Ethical Data Stewardship</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data cooperatives offer a new model for fair data governance, enabling individuals to collectively control, manage, and benefit from their information while adhering to cooperative principles such as democratic member control, economic participation, and community concern. This paper reviews data cooperatives, distinguishing them from models like data trusts, data commons, and data unions, and defines them based on member ownership, democratic governance, and data sovereignty. It explores applications in sectors like healthcare, agriculture, and construction. Despite their potential, data cooperatives face challenges in coordination, scalability, and member engagement, requiring innovative governance strategies, robust technical systems, and mechanisms to align member interests with cooperative goals. The paper concludes by advocating for data cooperatives as a sustainable, democratic, and ethical model for the future data economy.</description>

      <title>Characterizing LLM-driven Social Network: The Chirper.ai Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate the ability to simulate human decision-making processes, enabling their use as agents in modeling sophisticated social networks, both offline and online. Recent research has explored collective behavioral patterns and structural characteristics of LLM agents within simulated networks. However, empirical comparisons between LLM-driven and human-driven online social networks remain scarce, limiting our understanding of how LLM agents differ from human users. This paper presents a large-scale analysis of Chirper.ai, an X/Twitter-like social network entirely populated by LLM agents, comprising over 65,000 agents and 7.7 million AI-generated posts. For comparison, we collect a parallel dataset from Mastodon, a human-driven decentralized social network, with over 117,000 users and 16 million posts. We examine key differences between LLM agents and humans in posting behaviors, abusive content, and social network structures. Our findings provide critical insights into the evolving landscape of online social network analysis in the AI era, offering a comprehensive profile of LLM agents in social simulations.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Distributed Link Predictions Among Peers in Online Classrooms Using Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social interactions among classroom peers, represented as social learning networks (SLNs), play a crucial role in enhancing learning outcomes. While SLN analysis has recently garnered attention, most existing approaches rely on centralized training, where data is aggregated and processed on a local/cloud server with direct access to raw data. However, in real-world educational settings, such direct access across multiple classrooms is often restricted due to privacy concerns. Furthermore, training models on isolated classroom data prevents the identification of common interaction patterns that exist across multiple classrooms, thereby limiting model performance. To address these challenges, we propose one of the first frameworks that integrates Federated Learning (FL), a distributed and collaborative machine learning (ML) paradigm, with SLNs derived from students' interactions in multiple classrooms' online forums to predict future link formations (i.e., interactions) among students. By leveraging FL, our approach enables collaborative model training across multiple classrooms while preserving data privacy, as it eliminates the need for raw data centralization. Recognizing that each classroom may exhibit unique student interaction dynamics, we further employ model personalization techniques to adapt the FL model to individual classroom characteristics. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in capturing both shared and classroom-specific representations of student interactions in SLNs. Additionally, we utilize explainable AI (XAI) techniques to interpret model predictions, identifying key factors that influence link formation across different classrooms. These insights unveil the drivers of social learning interactions within a privacy-preserving, collaborative, and distributed ML framework -- an aspect that has not been explored before.</description>

      <title>Feature Distribution on Graph Topology Mediates the Effect of Graph Convolution: Homophily Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04621v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How would randomly shuffling feature vectors among nodes from the same class affect graph neural networks (GNNs)? The feature shuffle, intuitively, perturbs the dependence between graph topology and features (A-X dependence) for GNNs to learn from. Surprisingly, we observe a consistent and significant improvement in GNN performance following the feature shuffle. Having overlooked the impact of A-X dependence on GNNs, the prior literature does not provide a satisfactory understanding of the phenomenon. Thus, we raise two research questions. First, how should A-X dependence be measured, while controlling for potential confounds? Second, how does A-X dependence affect GNNs? In response, we (i) propose a principled measure for A-X dependence, (ii) design a random graph model that controls A-X dependence, (iii) establish a theory on how A-X dependence relates to graph convolution, and (iv) present empirical analysis on real-world graphs that align with the theory. We conclude that A-X dependence mediates the effect of graph convolution, such that smaller dependence improves GNN-based node classification.</description>

      <title>FairACE: Achieving Degree Fairness in Graph Neural Networks via Contrastive and Adversarial Group-Balanced Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fairness has been a significant challenge in graph neural networks (GNNs) since degree biases often result in un-equal prediction performance among nodes with varying degrees. Existing GNN models focus on prediction accuracy, frequently overlooking fairness across different degree groups. To addressthis issue, we propose a novel GNN framework, namely Fairness- Aware Asymmetric Contrastive Ensemble (FairACE), which inte-grates asymmetric contrastive learning with adversarial training to improve degree fairness. FairACE captures one-hop local neighborhood information and two-hop monophily similarity to create fairer node representations and employs a degree fairness regulator to balance performance between high-degree and low-degree nodes. During model training, a novel group-balanced fairness loss is proposed to minimize classification disparities across degree groups. In addition, we also propose a novel fairness metric, the Accuracy Distribution Gap (ADG), which can quantitatively assess and ensure equitable performance across different degree-based node groups. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that FairACE significantly improves degree fairness metrics while maintaining competitive accuracy in comparison to the state-of-the-art GNN models.</description>

      <title>Linguistic Comparison of AI- and Human-Written Responses to Online Mental Health Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ubiquity and widespread use of digital and online technologies have transformed mental health support, with online mental health communities (OMHCs) providing safe spaces for peer support. More recently, generative AI and large language models (LLMs) have introduced new possibilities for scalable, around-the-clock mental health assistance that could potentially augment and supplement the capabilities of OMHCs. Although genAI shows promise in delivering immediate and personalized responses, their effectiveness in replicating the nuanced, experience-based support of human peers remains an open question. In this study, we harnessed 24,114 posts and 138,758 online community (OC) responses from 55 OMHCs on Reddit. We prompted several state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4-Turbo, Llama-3, and Mistral-7B) with these posts, and compared their (AI) responses to human-written (OC) responses based on a variety of linguistic measures across psycholinguistics and lexico-semantics. Our findings revealed that AI responses are more verbose, readable, and analytically structured, but lack linguistic diversity and personal narratives inherent in human-human interactions. Through a qualitative examination, we found validation as well as complementary insights into the nature of AI responses, such as its neutrality of stance and the absence of seeking back-and-forth clarifications. We discuss the ethical and practical implications of integrating generative AI into OMHCs, advocating for frameworks that balance AI's scalability and timeliness with the irreplaceable authenticity, social interactiveness, and expertise of human connections that form the ethos of online support communities.</description>

      <title>Federated Prototype Graph Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, Federated Graph Learning (FGL) has gained significant attention for its distributed training capabilities in graph-based machine intelligence applications, mitigating data silos while offering a new perspective for privacy-preserve large-scale graph learning. However, multi-level FGL heterogeneity presents various client-server collaboration challenges: (1) Model-level: The variation in clients for expected performance and scalability necessitates the deployment of heterogeneous models. Unfortunately, most FGL methods rigidly demand identical client models due to the direct model weight aggregation on the server. (2) Data-level: The intricate nature of graphs, marked by the entanglement of node profiles and topology, poses an optimization dilemma. This implies that models obtained by federated training struggle to achieve superior performance. (3) Communication-level: Some FGL methods attempt to increase message sharing among clients or between clients and the server to improve training, which inevitably leads to high communication costs. In this paper, we propose FedPG as a general prototype-guided optimization method for the above multi-level FGL heterogeneity. Specifically, on the client side, we integrate multi-level topology-aware prototypes to capture local graph semantics. Subsequently, on the server side, leveraging the uploaded prototypes, we employ topology-guided contrastive learning and personalized technology to tailor global prototypes for each client, broadcasting them to improve local training. Experiments demonstrate that FedPG outperforms SOTA baselines by an average of 3.57\% in accuracy while reducing communication costs by 168x.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Independence Breeds Disruption but Limits Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recombinant growth theory highlights the pivotal role of cumulative knowledge in driving innovation. Although interconnected knowledge facilitates smoother dissemination, its connection to scientific disruption remains poorly understood. Here, we quantify knowledge dependence based on the degree to which references within a given paper's bibliography cite one another. Analyzing 53.8 million papers spanning six decades, we observe that papers built on independent knowledge have decreased over time. However, propensity score matching and regression analyses reveal that such papers are associated with greater scientific disruption, as those who cite them are less likely to cite their references. Moreover, a team's preference for independent knowledge amplifies its disruptive potential, regardless of team size, geographic distance, or collaboration freshness. Despite the disruptive nature, papers built on independent knowledge receive fewer citations and delayed recognition. Taken together, these findings fill a critical gap in our fundamental understanding of scientific innovation, revealing a universal law in peer recognition: Knowledge independence breeds disruption at the cost of impact.</description>

      <title>Towards Unbiased Federated Graph Learning: Label and Topology Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Graph Learning (FGL) enables privacy-preserving, distributed training of graph neural networks without sharing raw data. Among its approaches, subgraph-FL has become the dominant paradigm, with most work focused on improving overall node classification accuracy. However, these methods often overlook fairness due to the complexity of node features, labels, and graph structures. In particular, they perform poorly on nodes with disadvantaged properties, such as being in the minority class within subgraphs or having heterophilous connections (neighbors with dissimilar labels or misleading features). This reveals a critical issue: high accuracy can mask degraded performance on structurally or semantically marginalized nodes. To address this, we advocate for two fairness goals: (1) improving representation of minority class nodes for class-wise fairness and (2) mitigating topological bias from heterophilous connections for topology-aware fairness. We propose FairFGL, a novel framework that enhances fairness through fine-grained graph mining and collaborative learning. On the client side, the History-Preserving Module prevents overfitting to dominant local classes, while the Majority Alignment Module refines representations of heterophilous majority-class nodes. The Gradient Modification Module transfers minority-class knowledge from structurally favorable clients to improve fairness. On the server side, FairFGL uploads only the most influenced subset of parameters to reduce communication costs and better reflect local distributions. A cluster-based aggregation strategy reconciles conflicting updates and curbs global majority dominance . Extensive evaluations on eight benchmarks show FairFGL significantly improves minority-group performance , achieving up to a 22.62 percent Macro-F1 gain while enhancing convergence over state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>BotArtist: Generic approach for bot detection in Twitter via semi-automatic machine learning pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00037</link>

Abstract: Twitter, as one of the most popular social networks, provides a platform for communication and online discourse. Unfortunately, it has also become a target for bots and fake accounts, resulting in the spread of false information and manipulation. This paper introduces a semi-automatic machine learning pipeline (SAMLP) designed to address the challenges associated with machine learning model development. Through this pipeline, we develop a comprehensive bot detection model named BotArtist, based on user profile features. SAMLP leverages nine distinct publicly available datasets to train the BotArtist model. To assess BotArtist's performance against current state-of-the-art solutions, we evaluate 35 existing Twitter bot detection methods, each utilizing a diverse range of features. Our comparative evaluation of BotArtist and these existing methods, conducted across nine public datasets under standardized conditions, reveals that the proposed model outperforms existing solutions by almost 10% in terms of F1-score, achieving an average score of 83.19% and 68.5% over specific and general approaches, respectively. As a result of this research, we provide one of the largest labeled Twitter bot datasets. The dataset contains extracted features combined with BotArtist predictions for 10,929,533 Twitter user profiles, collected via Twitter API during the 2022 Russo-Ukrainian War over a 16-month period. This dataset was created based on [Shevtsov et al., 2022a] where the original authors share anonymized tweets discussing the Russo-Ukrainian war, totaling 127,275,386 tweets. The combination of the existing textual dataset and the provided labeled bot and human profiles will enable future development of more advanced bot detection large language models in the post-Twitter API era.</description>

      <title>Measuring changes in polarisation using Singular Value Decomposition of network graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18191v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we present new methods of measuring polarisation in social networks. We use Random Dot Product Graphs to embed social networks in metric spaces. Singular Value Decomposition of this social network then provider an embedded dimensionality which corresponds to the number of uncorrelated dimensions in the network. A decrease in the optimal dimensionality for the embedding of the network graph means that the dimensions in the network are becoming more correlated, and therefore the network is becoming more polarised.
  We demonstrate this method by analysing social networks such as communication interactions among New Zealand Twitter users discussing climate change issues and international social media discussions of the COP conferences. In both cases, the decreasing embedded dimensionality indicates that these networks have become more polarised over time. We also use networks generated by stochastic block models to explore how an increase of the isolation between distinct communities, or the increase of the predominance of one community over the other, in the social networks decrease the embedded dimensionality and are therefore identifiable as polarisation processes.</description>

      <title>On the Preservation of Input/Output Directed Graph Informativeness under Crossover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10369v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is a broad class of networks which connect inputs to outputs. We provide a strong theoretical foundation for crossover across this class and connect it to informativeness, a measure of the connectedness of inputs to outputs. We define Input/Output Directed Graphs (or IOD Graphs) as graphs with nodes $N$ and directed edges $E$, where $N$ contains (a) a set of "input nodes" $I \subset N$, where each $i \in I$ has no incoming edges and any number of outgoing edges, and (b) a set of "output nodes" $O \subset N$, where each $o \in O$ has no outgoing edges and any number of incoming edges, and $I\cap O = \emptyset$. We define informativeness, which involves the connections via directed paths from the input nodes to the output nodes: A partially informative IOD Graph has at least one path from an input to an output, a very informative IOD Graph has a path from every input to some output, and a fully informative IOD Graph has a path from every input to every output.
  A perceptron is an example of an IOD Graph. If it has non-zero weights and any number of layers, it is fully informative. As links are removed (assigned zero weight), the perceptron might become very, partially, or not informative.
  We define a crossover operation on IOD Graphs in which we find subgraphs with matching sets of forward and backward directed links to "swap." With this operation, IOD Graphs can be subject to evolutionary computation methods. We show that fully informative parents may yield a non-informative child. We also show that under conditions of contiguousness and the no dangling nodes condition, crossover compatible, partially informative parents yield partially informative children, and very informative input parents with partially informative output parents yield very informative children. However, even under these conditions, full informativeness may not be retained.</description>

      <title>A Graph-Based Model for Vehicle-Centric Data Sharing Ecosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of technologies has prompted a paradigm shift in the automotive industry, with an increasing focus on connected services and autonomous driving capabilities. This transformation allows vehicles to collect and share vast amounts of vehicle-specific and personal data. While these technological advancements offer enhanced user experiences, they also raise privacy concerns. To understand the ecosystem of data collection and sharing in modern vehicles, we adopted the ontology 101 methodology to incorporate information extracted from different sources, including analysis of privacy policies using GPT-4, a small-scale systematic literature review, and an existing ontology, to develop a high-level conceptual graph-based model, aiming to get insights into how modern vehicles handle data exchange among different parties. This serves as a foundational model with the flexibility and scalability to further expand for modelling and analysing data sharing practices across diverse contexts. Two realistic examples were developed to demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of discovering insights into privacy regarding vehicle-related data sharing. We also recommend several future research directions, such as exploring advanced ontology languages for reasoning tasks, supporting topological analysis for discovering data privacy risks/concerns, and developing useful tools for comparative analysis, to strengthen the understanding of the vehicle-centric data sharing ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Finding Near-Optimal Maximum Set of Disjoint $k$-Cliques in Real-World Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A $k$-clique is a dense graph, consisting of $k$ fully-connected nodes, that finds numerous applications, such as community detection and network analysis. In this paper, we study a new problem, that finds a maximum set of disjoint $k$-cliques in a given large real-world graph with a user-defined fixed number $k$, which can contribute to a good performance of teaming collaborative events in online games. However, this problem is NP-hard when $k \geq 3$, making it difficult to solve. To address that, we propose an efficient lightweight method that avoids significant overheads and achieves a $k$-approximation to the optimal, which is equipped with several optimization techniques, including the ordering method, degree estimation in the clique graph, and a lightweight implementation. Besides, to handle dynamic graphs that are widely seen in real-world social networks, we devise an efficient indexing method with careful swapping operations, leading to the efficient maintenance of a near-optimal result with frequent updates in the graph. In various experiments on several large graphs, our proposed approaches significantly outperform the competitors by up to 2 orders of magnitude in running time and 13.3\% in the number of computed disjoint $k$-cliques, which demonstrates the superiority of the proposed approaches in terms of efficiency and effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Oscillatory and Excitable Dynamics in an Opinion Model with Group Opinions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In traditional models of opinion dynamics, each agent in a network has an opinion and changes in opinions arise from pairwise (i.e., dyadic) interactions between agents. However, in many situations, groups of individuals possess a collective opinion that can differ from the opinions of its constituent individuals. In this paper, we study the effects of group opinions on opinion dynamics. We formulate a hypergraph model in which both individual agents and groups of 3 agents have opinions, and we examine how opinions evolve through both dyadic interactions and group memberships. In some parameter regimes, we find that the presence of group opinions can lead to oscillatory and excitable opinion dynamics. In the oscillatory regime, the mean opinion of the agents in a network has self-sustained oscillations. In the excitable regime, finite-size effects create large but short-lived opinion swings (as in social fads). We develop a mean-field approximation of our model and obtain good agreement with direct numerical simulations. We also show -- both numerically and via our mean-field description -- that oscillatory dynamics occur only when the number of dyadic and polyadic interactions per agent are not completely correlated. Our results illustrate how polyadic structures, such as groups of agents, can have important effects on collective opinion dynamics.</description>

      <title>Words and Action: Modeling Linguistic Leadership in #BlackLivesMatter Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this project, we describe a method of modeling semantic leadership across a set of communities associated with the #BlackLivesMatter movement, which has been informed by qualitative research on the structure of social media and Black Twitter in particular. We describe our bespoke approaches to time-binning, community clustering, and connecting communities over time, as well as our adaptation of state-of-the-art approaches to semantic change detection and semantic leadership induction. We find substantial evidence of the leadership role of BLM activists and progressives, as well as Black celebrities. We also find evidence of the sustained engagement of the conservative community with this discourse, suggesting an alternative explanation for how we arrived at the present moment, in which "anti-woke" and "anti-CRT" bills are being enacted nationwide.</description>

      <title>Navigating the Rabbit Hole: Emergent Biases in LLM-Generated Attack Narratives Targeting Mental Health Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06160v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to demonstrate imbalanced biases against certain groups. However, the study of unprovoked targeted attacks by LLMs towards at-risk populations remains underexplored. Our paper presents three novel contributions: (1) the explicit evaluation of LLM-generated attacks on highly vulnerable mental health groups; (2) a network-based framework to study the propagation of relative biases; and (3) an assessment of the relative degree of stigmatization that emerges from these attacks. Our analysis of a recently released large-scale bias audit dataset reveals that mental health entities occupy central positions within attack narrative networks, as revealed by a significantly higher mean centrality of closeness (p-value = 4.06e-10) and dense clustering (Gini coefficient = 0.7). Drawing from sociological foundations of stigmatization theory, our stigmatization analysis indicates increased labeling components for mental health disorder-related targets relative to initial targets in generation chains. Taken together, these insights shed light on the structural predilections of large language models to heighten harmful discourse and highlight the need for suitable approaches for mitigation.</description>
