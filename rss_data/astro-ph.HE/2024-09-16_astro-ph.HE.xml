      <title>Gamma-ray burst spectral-luminosity correlations in the synchrotron scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For over two decades, gamma-ray burst (GRB) prompt emission spectra were modelled with smoothly-broken power laws (Band function), and a positive and tight correlation between the spectral rest-frame peak energy $E_p$ and the total isotropic-equivalent luminosity $L_{iso}$ was found, constituting the so-called Yonetoku relation. However, more recent studies show that many prompt emission spectra are well described by the synchrotron radiation model, hence significantly deviating from the Band function. In this work, we test the impact of a more suited spectral model such as an idealized synchrotron spectrum from non-thermal electrons on the Yonetoku relation and its connection with physical parameters. We select GRBs with measured redshift observed by Fermi/GBM together with high energy observations (&gt;30 MeV), and perform spectral analysis dividing them in two samples: the single-bin sample, using the light curve peak spectrum of each GRB, and the multiple-bins sample, where we explore the whole duration of 13 bright bursts with time-resolved spectral analysis. We observed that the $E_p$ of synchrotron spectra in fast-cooling regime ($\nu_m/\nu_c\gg1$) is generally larger than the one provided by the Band function. For this reason, we do not find any $E_p-L_{iso}$ correlation in our samples except for the GRBs in an intermediate-cooling regime ($1&lt;\nu_m/\nu_c&lt;3$), namely where peak and break energies are very close. We instead find in both our samples a new tight correlation between the rest-frame cooling frequency $\nu_{c,z}$ and $L_{iso}$: $\nu_{c,z} \propto L_{iso}^{(0.53 \pm 0.06)}$. These results suggest that, assuming that prompt emission spectra are produced by synchrotron radiation, the physical relation is between $\nu_{c,z}$ and $L_{iso}$. The fit of the Band function to an intrinsic synchrotron spectrum returns peak energy values $E_{p,z}^{Band} \sim \nu_{c,z}$.</description>

      <title>The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: Systematic Transient Search of Single Observation Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct a systematic search for astrophysical transients using data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). The data were taken from 2017 to 2022 in three frequency bands spanning 77 GHz to 277 GHz. In this paper we present a pipeline for transient detection using single observation maps where each pixel of a map contains one observation with an integration time of approximately four minutes. We find 34 transient events at 27 unique locations. All but two of the transients are associated with Galactic stars and exhibit a wide range of properties. We also detect an event coincident with the classical nova, YZ Ret and one event consistent with a flaring active galactic nucleus. We notably do not detect any reverse shock emission from gamma ray bursts, a non-detection which is in tension with current models.</description>

      <title>The Puzzling Superorbital Period Variation of the Low-mass X-ray Binary 4U 1820-30</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Because of the previously observed stability of the 171-day period, the superorbital modulation of the low-mass X-ray binary 4U 1820-30 was considered a consequence of a third star orbiting around the binary. This study aims to further verify this triple model by testing the stability of superorbital period using the light curves collected by X-ray sky monitoring/scanning telescopes from 1987 to 2023. Both power spectral and phase analysis results indicate a significant change in the superorbital period from 171 days to 167 days over this 36-year span. The evolution of the superorbital phase suggests that the superorbital period may have experienced an abrupt change between late 2000 and early 2023 or changed gradually with a period derivative of $\dot P_{sup}=(-3.58 \pm 0.72) \times 10^{-4}$ day/day. We conclude that the superorbital period of 4U 1820-30 was not as stable as anticipated by the triple model, which strongly challenges this hypothesis. Instead, we propose an irradiation-induced mass transfer instability scenario to explain the superorbital modulation of 4U 1820-30.</description>

      <title>Robust Constraints on the Physics of the MeV Emission Line in GRB 221009A from Optical Depth Arguments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The brightest-of-all-time gamma-ray burst (GRB), GRB 221009A, is the first GRB observed to have emission line (up to 37 MeV) in its prompt emission spectra. It is naturally explained as \pair annihilation line that was Doppler boosted in the relativistic jet of the GRB. In this work, we repeatedly apply the simple optical depth argument to different physical processes necessary to produce an observable \pair annihilation line. This approach results in robust constraints on the physics of the line: We conclude that in GRB 221009A, the \pair pairs were produced at a radius greater than $4.3\times 10^{15}$\,cm from the central engine, and annihilated in a region between $1.4\times 10^{16}$\,cm and $4.3\times 10^{16}$\,cm. From these constraints, we established a self-consistent picture of \pair production, cooling, and annihilation. We also derived a criterion for pair production in the GRB prompt emission: $E_{\rm{iso}} \gtrsim3.3\times 10^{53} E_{\rm{peak},100} (1+z) R^2_{\rm{prod},16}~\text{erg}$. Using this criterion, we find tens of candidate GRBs that could have produced \pair in prompt emissions to annihilate. GRB 221009A is with the highest likelihood according to this criterion. We also predict the presence of a thermal radiation, with a time-evolving black body temperature, sweeping through soft X-ray during the prompt emission phase.</description>

      <title>Kinetic simulations of the cosmic ray pressure anisotropy instability: cosmic ray scattering rate in the saturated state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic ray (CR) feedback plays a vital role in shaping the formation and evolution of galaxies through their interaction with magnetohydrodynamic waves. In the CR self-confinement scenario, the waves are generated by the CR gyro-resonant instabilities via CR streaming or CR pressure anisotropy, and saturate by balancing wave damping. The resulting effective particle scattering rate by the waves, {\nu}eff, critically sets the coupling between the CRs and background gas, but the efficiency of CR feedback is yet poorly constrained. We employ 1D kinetic simulations under the Magnetohydrodynamic-Particle-In-Cell (MHD-PIC) framework with the adaptive {\delta}f method to quantify {\nu}eff for the saturated state of the CR pressure anisotropy instability (CRPAI) with ion-neutral friction. We drive CR pressure anisotropy by expanding/compressing box, mimicking background evolution of magnetic field strength, and the CR pressure anisotropy eventually reaches a quasi-steady state by balancing quasi-linear diffusion. At the saturated state, we measure {\nu}eff and the CR pressure anisotropy level, establishing a calibrated scaling relation with environmental parameters. The scaling relation is consistent with quasi-linear theory and can be incorporated to CR fluid models, in either the single-fluid or p-by-p treatments. Our results serve as a basis towards accurately calibrating the subgrid physics in macroscopic studies of CR feedback and transport.</description>

      <title>Evolution and the quasistationary state of collective fast neutrino flavor conversion in three dimensions without axisymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate in this work the evolution of the collective fast neutrino flavor conversion (FFC) in a three dimensional (3D) cubic box with periodic boundary condition for three different neutrino angular distributions that are axially asymmetric. We find that the system evolves toward a quasistationary state where the angular distribution of the spatially averaged neutrino electron-minus-muon lepton number (ELN) does not contain any crossings. In the quasistationary state, near flavor equilibration is achieved in one angular domain enclosed by the initial ELN angular crossing contour, similar to the conclusion derived based on simplified one dimensional (1D) system with axially symmetric neutrino angular distributions. We have also performed additional simulations in coordinates where the initial first ELN angular moment has only one nonvanishing spatial component by using the original axially asymmetric ELN angular distributions as well as the corresponding axisymmetric ELN distributions, and find interesting similarity between these two sets. Finally, we propose three different analytical prescriptions generalized from earlier 1D models to 3D models, and evaluate their performances in predicting the post-FFC moments. Our findings suggest that further development of effective classical transport model in multidimensions to capture the effect of FFC is promising.</description>

      <title>Large Eddy Simulations of Magnetized Mergers of Black Holes and Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The LIGO-Virgo-Kagra collaboration has observed gravitational waves consistent with the mergers of a black hole and a neutron star, namely GW200105 and GW200115, providing evidence for such cataclysmic events. Although no electromagnetic counterpart was reported for either of these two events, under certain conditions black hole--neutron star mergers are expected to form a significant accretion disk and to produce both a short gamma ray burst and a kilonova, much as observed in the binary neutron star merger GW170817. Here, we extend our publicly available code $\texttt{MHDuet}$ to study numerically the merger of a magnetized neutron star with a black hole. $\texttt{MHDuet}$ employs Large Eddy Simulation (LES) techniques to help capture the magnetic field amplification resulting from turbulence and other sub-grid scale dynamics in the post-merger stage. In particular, we simulate a merger with parameters favorable to producing an accretion disk, focusing on the formation and dynamics of the turbulent disk and the resulting magnetic field amplification. Following the tidal disruption and during the formation of the accretion disk, the magnetic field undergoes significant amplification driven by the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, reaching strengths of more than $10^{14}\,\rm{G}$ from a realistic initial strength of $10^{11}\,\rm{G}$ in short timescales of approximately $20\,\rm{ms}$. Despite employing LES techniques with a finest resolution of $120\,\text{m}$ that is among the highest in black hole-neutron star mergers, it is still insufficient to demonstrate convergence of the magnetic field growth. Although the effects of the LES are here rather modest, we expect them to be more significant at higher resolution, as observed in binary neutron star merger simulations.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric muons measured with the KM3NeT detectors in comparison with updated numeric predictions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11946v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The measurement of the flux of muons produced in cosmic ray air showers is essential for the study of primary cosmic rays. Such measurements are important in extensive air shower detectors to assess the energy spectrum and the chemical composition of the cosmic ray flux, complementary to the information provided by fluorescence detectors. Detailed simulations of the cosmic ray air showers are carried out, using codes such as CORSIKA, to estimate the muon flux at sea level. These simulations are based on the choice of hadronic interaction models, for which improvements have been implemented in the post-LHC era. In this work, a deficit in simulations that use state-of-the-art QCD models with respect to the measurement deep underwater with the KM3NeT neutrino detectors is reported. The KM3NeT/ARCA and KM3NeT/ORCA neutrino telescopes are sensitive to TeV muons originating mostly from primary cosmic rays with energies around 10 TeV. The predictions of state-of-the-art QCD models show that the deficit with respect to the data is constant in zenith angle; no dependency on the water overburden is observed. The observed deficit at a depth of several kilometres is compatible with the deficit seen in the comparison of the simulations and measurements at sea level.</description>

      <title>Diversity in hydrogen-rich envelope mass of type II supernovae (I): $V$-band light curve modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of Type II supernovae (SNe II) originating from progenitors with effective temperatures ($T_{\rm eff}$) and luminosities closely resembling red supergiants (RSGs) observed in pre-SN images and in the Galaxy. Using $\texttt{MESA}$, we compute a large grid of massive stars with $T_{\rm eff}$ ranging from 3200 K to 3800 K at their RSG phases, with hydrogen envelopes artificially stripped to varying extents (3 to 10\,$M_{\odot}$). The light curves of SNe IIP resulting from the explosions of these Galactic-RSG-like progenitors are modeled using $\texttt{STELLA}$. Our survey of the light curves reveals that partial stripping of the hydrogen envelope creates diversity in the magnitude and duration of SNe IIP light curves, without affecting the position of the RSG progenitor on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (HRD). For these Galactic-RSG-like progenitor models, we establish an indicator based on the light-curve properties to estimate the hydrogen envelope mass. Additionally, we discuss the effects of material mixing and $^{56}$Ni heating. Applying our model grid to a large sample of approximately 100 observed SNe IIP reveals a considerably broader range of hydrogen-rich envelope masses than predicted by standard stellar wind models. This finding suggests that, if SNe IIP are explosions of Galactic-like RSGs, to explain the diversity in the observed light curves, a significant fraction of them must have experienced substantial mass loss beyond the standard mass-loss prescription prior to their explosions. This finding highlights the uncertainties involved in massive star evolution and the pre-SN mass-loss mechanism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08416v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review the theory behind the formation of primordial black hole binaries and their merger rates. We consider the binary formation in the early and late Universe, emphasising the former as it gives the dominant contribution of the present primordial black hole merger rate. The binaries formed in the early Universe are highly eccentric so their interactions with other primordial black holes can significantly increase their coalescence times and thereby suppress the merger rate. We discuss in detail how the suppression of the merger rate arising from such interactions can be estimated and how such interactions lead to the formation of another, much harder, binary population that contributes to the present merger rate if more than 10% of dark matter consists of primordial black holes with a relatively narrow mass distribution. When the primordial abundance is below 1%, encounters between primordial black holes are unlikely and their effect on the merger rate becomes negligible.</description>

      <title>Supernova-Neutrino-Boosted Dark Matter from All Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been recently proposed that the boosted dark matter (BDM) by supernova neutrinos (SN$\nu$) from SN1987a or from the next Galactic supernova (SN) can serve as a novel component to probe nonvanishing interaction between dark matter (DM) and the standard model leptons [Y.-H. Lin et al., Phys. Rev. Lett 130, 111002 (2023) and Y.-H. Lin et al., Phys. Rev. D 108, 083013 (2023)]. In this Letter, we extend this concept and evaluate the present-day diffuse flux of SN$\nu$ BDM originated from all galaxies at higher redshifts. We show that by considering this diffuse BDM (DBDM) component, the best sensitivity on the product of the energy-independent DM-$\nu$ and DM-electron cross sections, $\sqrt{\sigma_{\chi\nu}\sigma_{\chi e}}\simeq \mathcal{O}(10^{-37})$ cm$^2$ for sub-MeV DM, can be obtained with large-size neutrino experiments such as Super-Kamiokande or Hyper-Kamiokande, surpassing the estimated SN$\nu$ BDM bound from SN1987a. We also examine the impact due to the presence of DM spikes around the supermassive black holes in galaxies on SN$\nu$ BDM and DBDM. Our results suggest that both the DBDM and the SN$\nu$ BDM probes are robust to the uncertain properties of DM spikes, unless the next Galactic SN happens to occur at a location extremely close to or right behind the Galactic Center along the SN line of sight.</description>

      <title>Feedback-regulated Seed Black Hole Growth in Star-Forming Molecular Clouds and Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The detection of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in high-redshift luminous quasars may require a phase of rapid accretion, and as a precondition, substantial gas influx toward seed black holes (BHs) from kilo-parsec or parsec scales. Our previous research demonstrated the plausibility of such gas supply for BH seeds within star-forming giant molecular clouds (GMCs) with high surface density ($\sim 10^4\,{\rm {\rm M_\odot}\, pc}^{-2}$), facilitating ``hyper-Eddington'' accretion via efficient feeding by dense clumps which are driven by turbulence and stellar feedback. This article investigates the impacts of feedback from accreting BHs on this process, including radiation, mechanical jets, and highly relativistic cosmic rays. We run a suite of numerical simulations to explore diverse parameter spaces of BH feedback, including the sub-grid accretion model, feedback energy efficiency, mass loading factor, and initial metallicity. Utilizing radiative feedback models inferred from the slim disk, we find that hyper-Eddington accretion is still achievable, yielding BH bolometric luminosities as high as $10^{41}$ -- $10^{44}\,\rm erg/s$, depending on the GMC properties and specific feedback model assumed. We find the maximum possible mass growth of seed BHs ($\Delta M_{\rm BH}^{\rm max}$) is regulated by the momentum deposition rate from BH feedback, $\dot{p}_{\rm feedback}/(\dot{M}_{\rm BH} c)$, which leads to an analytic scaling that agrees well with simulations. This scenario predicts the rapid formation of $\sim 10^4\,\rm M_\odot$ intermediate-massive BHs (IMBHs) from stellar-mass BHs within $\sim \rm Myr$. Furthermore, we examine the impacts of sub-grid accretion models and how BH feedback may influence star formation within these cloud complexes.</description>

      <title>Solar chameleons: Novel channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the flux of chameleons (light scalar particles which could play a role in the dark energy phenomenon) produced in the interior of the Sun. Our novel analysis incorporates various important details and new processes that have previously been overlooked, including the impact of the bulk magnetic field profile, as well as Primakoff production of chameleons in the electric fields of electrons and ions. In this paper we consider only the contributions of transverse photons. The production of chameleons from longitudinal electromagnetic excitations will be presented in a dedicated follow-up work. Demanding that the total flux of chameleons does not exceed 3% of the solar luminosity leads to the stringent upper limit on the chameleon-photon conformal coupling $\beta_\gamma \lesssim 10^{10}$, assuming that the height of the chameleon potential is set to the dark energy scale $\Lambda = 2.4$ meV, and independently of other couplings to matter. Although this bound is tighter than current upper limits on $\beta_{\gamma}$ from the CAST helioscope, these limits will have to be reassessed in terms of the updated solar chameleon flux we have computed. We argue that solar chameleons, potentially detectable in next-generation helioscopes such as IAXO, can be used to probe a region of chameleon parameter space that has yet to be covered.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Ionization in the Central Molecular Zone by sub-GeV Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the anomalous ionization rate observed in the Central Molecular Zone can be attributed to MeV dark matter annihilations into $e^+e^-$ pairs for galactic dark matter profiles with slopes $\gamma&gt;1$. The low annihilation cross-sections required avoid cosmological constraints and imply no detectable inverse Compton, bremsstrahlung or synchrotron emissions in radio, X and gamma rays. The possible connection to the source of the unexplained 511 keV line emission in the Galactic Center suggests that both observations could be correlated and have a common origin.</description>
