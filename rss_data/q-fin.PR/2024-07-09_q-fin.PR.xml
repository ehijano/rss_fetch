      <title>Volatility modeling in a Markovian environment: Two Ornstein-Uhlenbeck-related approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce generalizations of the COGARCH model of Kl\"uppelberg et al. from 2004 and the volatility and price model of Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard from 2001 to a Markov-switching environment. These generalizations allow for exogeneous jumps of the volatility at times of a regime switch. Both models are studied within the framework of Markov-modulated generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes which allows to derive conditions for stationarity, formulas for moments, as well as the autocovariance structure of volatility and price process. It turns out that both models inherit various properties of the original models and therefore are able to capture basic stylized facts of financial time-series such as uncorrelated log-returns, correlated squared log-returns and non-existence of higher moments in the COGARCH case.</description>

      <title>Pricing of geometric Asian options in the Volterra-Heston model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15828v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Geometric Asian options are a type of options where the payoff depends on the geometric mean of the underlying asset over a certain period of time. This paper is concerned with the pricing of such options for the class of Volterra-Heston models, covering the rough Heston model. We are able to derive semi-closed formulas for the prices of geometric Asian options with fixed and floating strikes for this class of stochastic volatility models. These formulas require the explicit calculation of the conditional joint Fourier transform of the logarithm of the stock price and the logarithm of the geometric mean of the stock price over time. Linking our problem to the theory of affine Volterra processes, we find a representation of this Fourier transform as a suitably constructed stochastic exponential, which depends on the solution of a Riccati-Volterra equation. Finally we provide a numerical study for our results in the rough Heston model.</description>
