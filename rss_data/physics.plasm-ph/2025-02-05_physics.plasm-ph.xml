      <title>General kinetic ion induced electron emission model for metallic walls applied to biased Z-pinch electrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A generalized kinetic ion induced electron emission (IIEE) model is developed to obtain the emitted electron energy spectrum for a distribution of ion impacts on a metallic surface. This framework is implemented as a boundary condition for the continuum kinetic Boltzmann equation. The IIEE model is used to study how emissions affect sheath formation near biased Z-pinch electrodes. 1X-1V (one spatial and one velocity dimension) Boltzmann-Poisson simulations are performed for a proton-electron plasma doubly bounded by two biased copper electrodes with and without IIEE at bias potentials from 0 kV to 9 kV. The ions are accelerated to higher energies by the sheath potentials at the electrodes inducing electron emission. The secondary electron yield (SEY), defined as the ratio of the flux of emitted electrons to impacting ions, increases with bias potential at both electrodes, but more significantly at the cathode. Despite the SEY crossing 1 at 7 kV, a classical sheath, rather than a space-charge limited or inverse sheath, forms for all cases. The emitted electrons present as a beam that is accelerated by the sheath potential into the domain resulting in increased electron temperatures due to collisions. For bias potentials greater than 2 kV, the potential difference at the cathode is sufficiently strong for emissive heating to increase the plasma potential compared to emissionless simulations. The emitted electrons increase the current in the domain from 130 kA to 199 kA closely matching the experimental value of 200 kA.</description>

      <title>Computing the generalized plasma dispersion function for non-Maxwellian plasmas, with applications to Thomson scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kinetic plasma studies often require computing integrals of the velocity distribution over a complex-valued pole. The standard method is to solve the integral in the complex plane using the Plemelj theorem, resulting in the standard plasma dispersion function for Maxwellian plasmas. For non-Maxwellian plasmas, the Plemelj theorem does not generalize to an analytic form, and computational methods must be used. In this paper, a new computational method is developed to accurately integrate a non-Maxwellian velocity distribution over an arbitrary set of complex valued poles. This method works by keeping the integration contour on the real line, and applying a trapezoid rule-like integration scheme over all discretized intervals. In intervals containing a pole, the velocity distribution is linearly interpolated, and the analytic result for the integral over a linear function is used. The integration scheme is validated by comparing its results to the analytic plasma dispersion function for Maxwellian distributions. We then show the utility of this method by computing the Thomson scattering spectra for several non-Maxwellian distributions: the kappa, super Gaussian, and toroidal distributions. Thomson scattering is a valuable plasma diagnostic tool for both laboratory and space plasmas, but the technique relies on fitting measured wave spectra to a forward model, which typically assumes Maxwellian plasmas. Therefore, this integration method can expand the capabilities of Thomson scatter diagnostics to regimes where the plasma is non-Maxwellian, including high energy density plasmas, frictionally heated plasmas in the ionosphere, and plasmas with a substantial suprathermal electron tail.</description>

      <title>Ponderomotive barriers in rotating mirror devices using static fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particularly for aneutronic fusion schemes, it is advantageous to manipulate the fuel species differently from one another, as well as expel ash promptly. The ponderomotive effect can be used to selectively manipulate particles. It is commonly a result of particle-wave interactions and has a complex dependence on the particle charge and mass, enabling species-selectivity. If the plasma is rotating, e.g. due to $\mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{B}$ motion, the ponderomotive effect can be generated using static (i.e., time-independent) perturbations to the electric and magnetic fields, which can be significantly cheaper to produce than time-dependent waves. This feature can be particularly useful in rotating mirror machines where mirror confinement can be enhanced by rotation, both through centrifugal confinement and additionally through a ponderomotive interaction with a static azimuthal perturbation. Some static perturbations generate a ponderomotive barrier, other perturbations can generate either a repulsive barrier or an attractive ponderomotive well which can be used to attract particles of a certain species while repelling another. The viability of each of these effects depends on the specifics of the rotation profile and temperature, and the resultant dispersion relation in the rotating plasma.</description>

      <title>Granulation and Convectional Driving on Stellar Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface convection is important for the presence of magnetic activity at stars. So far, this convection is thought to be a result of heating from below, where convection cells rise and break up. New models reveal that surface convection is instead strongly driven by cooling from above. We compare two simulations of surface convection, one with a significant heating from below and one without. We obtain surface convection in both cases, and they show similar granulation patterns. The deep convection driven by heating from below is still evolving and asymptotically approaches a steady-state solution. We find that convection from below is not needed at all to form typical photospheric granulation. This indicates the possibility of a surface dynamo acting on stars without a convecting envelope. Even stars without a convecting envelope could therefore exhibit stronger magnetic and coronal activity than expected so far.</description>

      <title>Generalized Fluid Models of the Braginskii Type. Part 2. The Boltzmann Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00467v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In our previous paper (Hunana et al. 2022) we have employed the Landau collisional operator together with the moment method of Grad and considered various generalizations of the Braginskii model, such as a multi-fluid formulation of the 21- and 22-moment models valid for general masses and temperatures, where all of the considered moments are described by their evolution equations (with fully non-linear left-hand-sides). Here we consider the same models, however, we employ the Boltzmann operator and calculate the collisional contributions via expressing them through the Chapman-Cowling collisional integrals. These ``integrals'' just represent a useful mathematical technique/notation introduced roughly 100 years ago, which (in the usual semi-linear approximation) allows one to postpone specifying the particular collisional process and finish all of the calculations with the Boltzmann operator. We thus consider multi-fluid 21- and 22-moment models which are valid for a large class of elastic collisional processes describable by the Boltzmann operator. Reduction into the 13-moment approximation recovers the models of Schunk and Burgers. We only focus on the particular cases of hard spheres, Coulomb collisions, purely repulsive inverse power force $|K|/r^\nu$ and attractive force $-|K|/r^\nu$ with repulsive rigid core (or potential $V(r)=\delta(r)- |c|/r^n$, so that the particles bounce from each other when they meet), but other cases can be found in the literature. In the Appendix, we introduce the Boltzmann operator in a way suitable for newcomers and we discuss a surprisingly simple recipe how to calculate the collisional contributions with analytic software.</description>

      <title>FEQIS: A free-boundary equilibrium solver for integrated modeling of tokamak plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13630v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new axisymmetric equilibrium solver has been written, called FEQIS (Flexible EQuIlibrium Solver), which purpose is to be used inside integrated modeling of tokamak plasmas. The FEQIS code solves the Grad-Shafranov equation and the "circuit" equations for the external coils and passive conducting structures that are toroidally connected. The code has been specifically equipped with flexibility in choice of circuit connections, and a stripped-down numerical scheme for the solution of the Grad-Shafranov equation through a structure of multi-level simplifications which can be tested against the required accuracy.</description>

      <title>Local Reduced-Order Modeling for Electrostatic Plasmas by Physics-Informed Solution Manifold Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18493v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite advancements in high-performance computing and modern numerical algorithms, computational cost remains prohibitive for multi-query kinetic plasma simulations. In this work, we develop data-driven reduced-order models (ROMs) for collisionless electrostatic plasma dynamics, based on the kinetic Vlasov-Poisson equation. Our ROM approach projects the equation onto a linear subspace defined by the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) modes. We introduce an efficient tensorial method to update the nonlinear term using a precomputed third-order tensor. We capture multiscale behavior with a minimal number of POD modes by decomposing the solution manifold into multiple time windows and creating temporally local ROMs. We consider two strategies for decomposition: one based on the physical time and the other based on the electric field energy. Applied to the 1D1V Vlasov-Poisson simulations, that is, prescribed E-field, Landau damping, and two-stream instability, we demonstrate that our ROMs accurately capture the total energy of the system both for parametric and time extrapolation cases. The temporally local ROMs are more efficient and accurate than the single ROM. In addition, in the two-stream instability case, we show that the energy-windowing reduced-order model (EW-ROM) is more efficient and accurate than the time-windowing reduced-order model (TW-ROM). With the tensorial approach, EW-ROM solves the equation approximately 90 times faster than Eulerian simulations while maintaining a maximum relative error of 7.5% for the training data and 11% for the testing data.</description>

      <title>Does the magneto-thermal instability survive whistler-suppression of thermal conductivity in galaxy clusters?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hot and dilute intracluster medium (ICM) plays a central role in many key processes that shape galaxy clusters.Nevertheless, the nature of plasma turbulence and particle transport in the ICM remain poorly understood, and quantifying the effect of kinetic plasma instabilities on the macroscopic dynamics represents an outstanding problem. Here we focus on the impact of whistler-wave suppression of the heat flux on the magnetothermal instability (MTI), which is expected to drive significant turbulent motions in the periphery of galaxy clusters. We perform small-scale Boussinesq simulations with a sub-grid closure for the thermal diffusivity in the regime of whistler-wave suppression. Our model is characterized by a single parameter that quantifies the collisionality of the ICM on the astrophysical scales of interest that we tune to explore a range appropriate for the periphery of galaxy clusters. We find that the MTI is qualitatively unchanged for weak whistler suppression. Conversely, with strong suppression the magnetic dynamo is interrupted and MTI turbulence dies out. In the astrophysically relevant limit, however, the MTI is likely to be supplemented by additional sources of turbulence. Investigating this scenario, we show that the inclusion of external forcing has a beneficial impact and revives even MTI simulations with strong whistler suppression. As a result, the plasma remains buoyantly unstable, with important consequences for turbulent mixing in the ICM.</description>

      <title>Fast radio bursts as precursor radio emission from monster shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been proposed recently that the breaking of MHD waves in the inner magnetosphere of strongly magnetized neutron stars can power different types of high-energy transients. Motivated by these considerations, we study the steepening and dissipation of a strongly magnetized fast magnetosonic wave propagating in a declining background magnetic field, by means of particle-in-cell simulations that encompass MHD scales. Our analysis confirms the formation of a monster shock as $B^2-E^2 \to 0$, that dissipates about half of the fast magnetosonic wave energy. It also reveals, for the first time, the generation of a high-frequency precursor wave by a synchrotron maser instability at the monster shock front, carrying a fraction of $\sim 10^{-3}$ of the total energy dissipated at the shock. The spectrum of the precursor wave exhibits several sharp harmonic peaks, with frequencies in the GHz band under conditions anticipated in magnetars. Such signals may appear as fast radio bursts.</description>
