      <title>Generative design and validation of therapeutic peptides for glioblastoma based on a potential target ATP5A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Glioblastoma (GBM) remains the most aggressive tumor, urgently requiring novel therapeutic strategies. Here, we present a dry-to-wet framework combining generative modeling and experimental validation to optimize peptides targeting ATP5A, a potential peptide-binding protein for GBM. Our framework introduces the first lead-conditioned generative model, which focuses exploration on geometrically relevant regions around lead peptides and mitigates the combinatorial complexity of de novo methods. Specifically, we propose POTFlow, a \underline{P}rior and \underline{O}ptimal \underline{T}ransport-based \underline{Flow}-matching model for peptide optimization. POTFlow employs secondary structure information (e.g., helix, sheet, loop) as geometric constraints, which are further refined by optimal transport to produce shorter flow paths. With this design, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with five popular approaches. When applied to GBM, our method generates peptides that selectively inhibit cell viability and significantly prolong survival in a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model. As the first lead peptide-conditioned flow matching model, POTFlow holds strong potential as a generalizable framework for therapeutic peptide design.</description>

      <title>CONFIDE: Hallucination Assessment for Reliable Biomolecular Structure Prediction and Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable evaluation of protein structure predictions remains challenging, as metrics like pLDDT capture energetic stability but often miss subtle errors such as atomic clashes or conformational traps reflecting topological frustration within the protein folding energy landscape. We present CODE (Chain of Diffusion Embeddings), a self evaluating metric empirically found to quantify topological frustration directly from the latent diffusion embeddings of the AlphaFold3 series of structure predictors in a fully unsupervised manner. Integrating this with pLDDT, we propose CONFIDE, a unified evaluation framework that combines energetic and topological perspectives to improve the reliability of AlphaFold3 and related models. CODE strongly correlates with protein folding rates driven by topological frustration, achieving a correlation of 0.82 compared to pLDDT's 0.33 (a relative improvement of 148\%). CONFIDE significantly enhances the reliability of quality evaluation in molecular glue structure prediction benchmarks, achieving a Spearman correlation of 0.73 with RMSD, compared to pLDDT's correlation of 0.42, a relative improvement of 73.8\%. Beyond quality assessment, our approach applies to diverse drug design tasks, including all-atom binder design, enzymatic active site mapping, mutation induced binding affinity prediction, nucleic acid aptamer screening, and flexible protein modeling. By combining data driven embeddings with theoretical insight, CODE and CONFIDE outperform existing metrics across a wide range of biomolecular systems, offering robust and versatile tools to refine structure predictions, advance structural biology, and accelerate drug discovery.</description>

      <title>Few-shot Protein Fitness Prediction via In-context Learning and Test-time Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately predicting protein fitness with minimal experimental data is a persistent challenge in protein engineering. We introduce PRIMO (PRotein In-context Mutation Oracle), a transformer-based framework that leverages in-context learning and test-time training to adapt rapidly to new proteins and assays without large task-specific datasets. By encoding sequence information, auxiliary zero-shot predictions, and sparse experimental labels from many assays as a unified token set in a pre-training masked-language modeling paradigm, PRIMO learns to prioritize promising variants through a preference-based loss function. Across diverse protein families and properties-including both substitution and indel mutations-PRIMO outperforms zero-shot and fully supervised baselines. This work underscores the power of combining large-scale pre-training with efficient test-time adaptation to tackle challenging protein design tasks where data collection is expensive and label availability is limited.</description>

      <title>Pharmacophore-based design by learning on voxel grids</title>

Abstract: Ligand-based drug discovery (LBDD) relies on making use of known binders to a protein target to find structurally diverse molecules similarly likely to bind. This process typically involves a brute force search of the known binder (query) against a molecular library using some metric of molecular similarity. One popular approach overlays the pharmacophore-shape profile of the known binder to 3D conformations enumerated for each of the library molecules, computes overlaps, and picks a set of diverse library molecules with high overlaps. While this virtual screening workflow has had considerable success in hit diversification, scaffold hopping, and patent busting, it scales poorly with library sizes and restricts candidate generation to existing library compounds. Leveraging recent advances in voxel-based generative modelling, we propose a pharmacophore-based generative model and workflows that address the scaling and fecundity issues of conventional pharmacophore-based virtual screening. We introduce \emph{VoxCap}, a voxel captioning method for generating SMILES strings from voxelised molecular representations. We propose two workflows as practical use cases as well as benchmarks for pharmacophore-based generation: \emph{de-novo} design, in which we aim to generate new molecules with high pharmacophore-shape similarities to query molecules, and fast search, which aims to combine generative design with a cheap 2D substructure similarity search for efficient hit identification. Our results show that VoxCap significantly outperforms previous methods in generating diverse \textit{de-novo} hits. When combined with our fast search workflow, VoxCap reduces computational time by orders of magnitude while returning hits for all query molecules, enabling the search of large libraries that are intractable to search by brute force.</description>

      <title>MoRSAIK: Sequence Motif Reactor Simulation, Analysis and Inference Kit in Python</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Origins of life research investigates how life could emerge from prebiotic chemistry only. One possible explanation provides the RNA world hypothesis. It states that life could emerge from RNA strands only, storing and transferring biological information, as well as catalyzing reactions as ribozymes. Before this state could have emerged, however, the prebiotic world was probably a purely chemical pool of short RNA strands with random sequences and without biological function performing hybridization and dehybridization, as well as ligation and cleavage. In this context relevant questions are what are the conditions that allow longer RNA strands to be built and how can information carrying in RNA sequence emerge?
  In order to investigate such RNA reactors, efficient simulations are needed because the space of possible RNA sequences increases exponentially with the length of the strands, as well as the number of reactions between two strands. In addition, simulations have to be compared to experimental data for validation and parameter calibration. Here, we present the MoRSAIK python package for sequence motif (or k-mer) reactor simulation, analysis and inference. It enables users to simulate RNA sequence motif dynamics in the mean field approximation as well as to infer the reaction parameters from data with Bayesian methods and to analyze results by computing observables and plotting. MoRSAIK simulates an RNA reactor by following the reactions and the concentrations of all strands inside up to a certain length (of four nucleotides by default). Longer strands are followed indirectly, by tracking the concentrations of their containing sequence motifs of that maximum length.</description>

      <title>Training Dynamics of Learning 3D-Rotational Equivariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While data augmentation is widely used to train symmetry-agnostic models, it remains unclear how quickly and effectively they learn to respect symmetries. We investigate this by deriving a principled measure of equivariance error that, for convex losses, calculates the percent of total loss attributable to imperfections in learned symmetry. We focus our empirical investigation to 3D-rotation equivariance on high-dimensional molecular tasks (flow matching, force field prediction, denoising voxels) and find that models reduce equivariance error quickly to $\leq$2\% held-out loss within 1k-10k training steps, a result robust to model and dataset size. This happens because learning 3D-rotational equivariance is an easier learning task, with a smoother and better-conditioned loss landscape, than the main prediction task. For 3D rotations, the loss penalty for non-equivariant models is small throughout training, so they may achieve lower test loss than equivariant models per GPU-hour unless the equivariant ``efficiency gap'' is narrowed. We also experimentally and theoretically investigate the relationships between relative equivariance error, learning gradients, and model parameters.</description>

      <title>Modulation of DNA rheology by a transcription factor that forms aging microgels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proteins and nucleic acids form non-Newtonian liquids with complex rheological properties that contribute to their function in vivo. Here we investigate the rheology of the transcription factor NANOG, a key protein in sustaining embryonic stem cell self-renewal. We discover that at high concentrations NANOG forms macroscopic aging gels through its intrinsically disordered tryptophan-rich domain. By combining molecular dynamics simulations, mass photometry and Cryo-EM, we also discover that NANOG forms self-limiting micelle-like clusters which expose their DNA-binding domains. In dense solutions of DNA, NANOG micelle-like structures stabilize intermolecular entanglements and crosslinks, forming microgel-like structures. Our findings suggest that NANOG may contribute to regulate gene expression in a unconventional way: by restricting and stabilizing genome dynamics at key transcriptional sites through the formation of an aging microgel-like structure, potentially enabling mechanical memory in the gene network.</description>

      <title>Consistent Synthetic Sequences Unlock Structural Diversity in Fully Atomistic De Novo Protein Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-quality training datasets are crucial for the development of effective protein design models, but existing synthetic datasets often include unfavorable sequence-structure pairs, impairing generative model performance. We leverage ProteinMPNN, whose sequences are experimentally favorable as well as amenable to folding, together with structure prediction models to align high-quality synthetic structures with recoverable synthetic sequences. In that way, we create a new dataset designed specifically for training expressive, fully atomistic protein generators. By retraining La-Proteina, which models discrete residue type and side chain structure in a continuous latent space, on this dataset, we achieve new state-of-the-art results, with improvements of +54% in structural diversity and +27% in co-designability. To validate the broad utility of our approach, we further introduce Proteina Atomistica, a unified flow-based framework that jointly learns the distribution of protein backbone structure, discrete sequences, and atomistic side chains without latent variables. We again find that training on our new sequence-structure data dramatically boosts benchmark performance, improving \method's structural diversity by +73% and co-designability by +5%. Our work highlights the critical importance of aligned sequence-structure data for training high-performance de novo protein design models. All data will be publicly released.</description>
