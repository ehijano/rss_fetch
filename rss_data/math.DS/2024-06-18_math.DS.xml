      <title>Nonlinear Stability of Relative Equilibria in Planar $N$-Vortex Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a sufficient condition for nonlinear stability of relative equilibria in the planar $N$-vortex problem. This result builds on our previous work on the Hamiltonian formulation of its relative dynamics as a Lie--Poisson system. The relative dynamics recasts the stability of relative equilibria of the $N$-vortex problem as that of the corresponding fixed points in the relative dynamics. We analyze the stability of such fixed points by exploiting the Hamiltonian formulation as well as invariants and constraints that naturally arise in the relative dynamics. The stability condition is essentially an Energy--Casimir method, except that we also incorporate the constraints in an effective manner. We apply the method to two types of relative equilibria: (i) three identical vortices at the vertices of an equilateral triangle along with another one at its center and (ii) four identical vortices at the vertices of a square with another one its center, where the circulation of the vortex at the center is arbitrary in both cases. We show that they are stable/unstable depending on the circulation of the vortex at the center.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove that the topological pressure of dynamic systems with normally hyperbolic trapping is negative. In particular, this applies to the null geodesic flow in Kerr and Kerr-de Sitter spacetimes
  This builds connection between results for trapped sets with low regularity in hyperbolic dynamic systems conditioning on negativity of the topological pressure and unconditional results in the setting of normally hyperbolic trapping.</description>

      <title>$C^1$-robust homoclinic tangencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is twofold. First, motivated by the nearly-affine blender system found in [LT24], we introduce standard blenders and their variations, and prove their fundamental properties on the generation of $C^1$-robust tangencies. Next, as an application, we show that unfolding a homoclinic tangency to a hyperbolic periodic point can produce uncountably many $C^1$-robust homoclinic tangencies, provided that either this point is involved in a coindex-1 heterodimensional cycle, or the central dynamics near it are not essentially two-dimensional.</description>

      <title>The small boundary property in products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a continuous action $G\curvearrowright X$ of a countable group on a compact metrizable space we show that the following are equivalent: (i) the action $G\curvearrowright X$ has the small boundary property and no finite orbits, (ii) for every continuous action $H\curvearrowright Y$ of a countable group on a compact metrizable space, the product action $G\times H\curvearrowright X\times Y$ has the small boundary property. In particular, (ii) is automatic when $G$ is infinite and the action $G\curvearrowright X$ is minimal and has the small boundary property. The argument relies on a small boundary version of the Urysohn lemma.</description>

      <title>Stretched-exponential mixing for surface semiflows and Anosov flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a surface semiflow that is a suspension of a \( C^{1+\alpha} \) expanding Markov interval map, we prove that, under the assumptions that the roof function is Lipschitz continuous and not cohomologous to a locally constant function, the semiflow exhibits stretched-exponential mixing with respect to the SRB measure. This result extends to hyperbolic skew-product semiflows and hyperbolic attractors. Specifically, codimension-one topologically mixing Anosov flows with Lipschitz continuous stable foliations demonstrate stretched-exponential mixing with respect to their SRB measures.</description>

      <title>Medvedev degrees of subshifts on groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Medvedev degree of a subshift is a dynamical invariant of computable origin that can be used to compare the complexity of subshifts that contain only uncomputable configurations. We develop theory to describe how these degrees can be transferred from one group to another through algebraic and geometric relations, such as quotients, subgroups, translation-like actions and quasi-isometries.
  We use the aforementioned tools to study the possible values taken by this invariant on subshifts of finite type on some finitely generated groups. We obtain a full classification for some classes, such as virtually polycyclic groups and branch groups with decidable word problem. We also show that all groups which are quasi-isometric to the hyperbolic plane admit SFTs with nonzero Medvedev degree. Furthermore, we provide a classification of the degrees of sofic subshifts for several classes of groups.</description>

      <title>Lower box dimension of infinitely generated self-conformal sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Lambda$ be the limit set of an infinite conformal iterated function system and let $F$ denote the set of fixed points of the maps. We prove that the box dimension of $\Lambda$ exists if and only if \[
  \overline{\dim}_{\mathrm B} F\leq \max \{\dim_{\mathrm H} \Lambda, \underline{\dim}_{\mathrm B} F\}. \] In particular, this provides the first examples of sets of continued fraction expansions with restricted digits for which the box dimension does not exist.
  More generally, we establish an explicit asymptotic formula for the covering numbers $N_r(\Lambda)$ in terms of $\dim_{\mathrm H}\Lambda$ and the covering function $r\mapsto N_r(F)$, where $N_r(\cdot)$ denotes the least number of open balls of radius $r$ required to cover a given set. Such finer scaling information is necessary: in general, the lower box dimension $\underline{\dim}_{\mathrm B} \Lambda$ is not a function of the Hausdorff dimension of $\Lambda$ and the upper and lower box dimensions of $F$, and we prove sharp bounds for $\underline{\dim}_{\mathrm B} \Lambda$ in terms of these three quantities.</description>

      <title>A non-autonomous framework for climate change and extreme weather events increase in a stochastic energy balance model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a three-timescale framework for modelling climate change and introduce a space-heterogeneous one-dimensional energy balance model. This model, addressing temperature fluctuations from rising carbon dioxide levels and the super-greenhouse effect in tropical regions, fits within the setting of stochastic reaction-diffusion equations. Our results show how both mean and variance of temperature increase, without the system going through a bifurcation point. This study aims to advance the conceptual understanding of the extreme weather events frequency increase due to climate change.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the design space of diffusion-based generative models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most existing theoretical investigations of the accuracy of diffusion models, albeit significant, assume the score function has been approximated to a certain accuracy, and then use this a priori bound to control the error of generation. This article instead provides a first quantitative understanding of the whole generation process, i.e., both training and sampling. More precisely, it conducts a non-asymptotic convergence analysis of denoising score matching under gradient descent. In addition, a refined sampling error analysis for variance exploding models is also provided. The combination of these two results yields a full error analysis, which elucidates (again, but this time theoretically) how to design the training and sampling processes for effective generation. For instance, our theory implies a preference toward noise distribution and loss weighting that qualitatively agree with the ones used in [Karras et al. 2022]. It also provides some perspectives on why the time and variance schedule used in [Karras et al. 2022] could be better tuned than the pioneering version in [Song et al. 2020].</description>

We find that each of this kind of indexed links can be obtained by applying a finite steps of operations on a special indexed link, which consists of all of the singular Seifert fibers and some regular Seifert fibers with some precisely described conditions.</description>

      <title>Local spectral estimates and quantitative weak mixing for substitution $\mathbb{Z}$-actions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper investigates H\"older and log-H\"older regularity of spectral measures for weakly mixing substitutions and the related question of quantitative weak mixing. It is assumed that the substitution is primitive, aperiodic, and its substitution matrix is irreducible over the rationals. In the case when there are no eigenvalues of the substitution matrix on the unit circle, our main theorem says that a weakly mixing substitution $\mathbb{Z}$-action has uniformly log-H\"older regular spectral measures, and hence admits power-logarithmic bounds for the rate of weak mixing. In the more delicate Salem substitution case, our second main result says that H\"older regularity holds for algebraic spectral parameters, but the H\"older exponent cannot be chosen uniformly.</description>

      <title>Integrable deformations of Rikitake systems, Lie bialgebras and bi-Hamiltonian structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrable deformations of a class of Rikitake dynamical systems are constructed by deforming their underlying Lie-Poisson Hamiltonian structures, which are considered linearizations of Poisson--Lie structures on certain (dual) Lie groups. By taking into account that there exists a one-to one correspondence between Poisson--Lie groups and Lie bialgebra structures, a number of deformed Poisson coalgebras can be obtained, which allow the construction of integrable deformations of coupled Rikitake systems. Moreover, the integrals of the motion for these coupled systems can be explicitly obtained by means of the deformed coproduct map. The same procedure can be also applied when the initial system is bi-Hamiltonian with respect to two different Lie-Poisson algebras. In this case, to preserve a bi-Hamiltonian structure under deformation, a common Lie bialgebra structure for the two Lie-Poisson structures has to be found. Coupled dynamical systems arising from this bi-Hamiltonian deformation scheme are also presented, and the use of collective `cluster variables', turns out to be enlightening in order to analyse their dynamical behaviour. As a general feature, the approach here presented provides a novel connection between Lie bialgebras and integrable dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal and Linear Regressions and Pencils of Confocal Quadrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.01679v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper enhances and develops bridges between statistics, mechanics, and geometry. For a given system of points in $\mathbb R^k$ representing a sample of full rank, we construct an explicit pencil of confocal quadrics with the following properties: (i) All the hyperplanes for which the hyperplanar moments of inertia for the given system of points are equal, are tangent to the same quadrics from the pencil of quadrics. As an application, we develop regularization procedures for the orthogonal least square method, analogues of lasso and ridge methods from linear regression. (ii) For any given point $P$ among all the hyperplanes that contain it, the best fit is the tangent hyperplane to the quadric from the confocal pencil corresponding to the maximal Jacobi coordinate of the point $P$; the worst fit among the hyperplanes containing $P$ is the tangent hyperplane to the ellipsoid from the confocal pencil that contains $P$. The confocal pencil of quadrics provides a universal tool to solve the restricted principal component analysis restricted at any given point. Both results (i) and (ii) can be seen as generalizations of the classical result of Pearson on orthogonal regression. They have natural and important applications in the statistics of the errors-in-variables models (EIV). For the classical linear regressions we provide a geometric characterization of hyperplanes of least squares in a given direction among all hyperplanes which contain a given point. The obtained results have applications in restricted regressions, both ordinary and orthogonal ones. For the latter, a new formula for test statistic is derived. The developed methods and results are illustrated in natural statistics examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Under mild assumptions, we investigate the structure of loss landscape of two-layer neural networks near global minima, determine the set of parameters which recovers the target function, and characterize the gradient flows around it. With novel techniques, our work uncovers some simple aspects of the complicated loss landscape and reveals how model, target function, samples and initialization affect the training dynamics differently. These results concludes that two-layer neural networks can be recovered locally at overparameterization.</description>

      <title>Growth in products of matrices: fastest, average, and generic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00610v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problems that we consider in this paper are as follows. Let A and B be 2x2 matrices (over reals). Let w(A, B) be a word of length n. After evaluating w(A, B) as a product of matrices, we get a 2x2 matrix, call it W. What is the largest (by the absolute value) possible entry of W, over all w(A, B) of length n, as a function of n? What is the expected absolute value of the largest (by the absolute value) entry in a random product of n matrices, where each matrix is A or B with probability 0.5? What is the Lyapunov exponent for a random matrix product like that? We give partial answer to the first of these questions and an essentially complete answer to the second question. For the third question (the most difficult of the three), we offer a very simple method to produce an upper bound on the Lyapunov exponent in the case where all entries of the matrices A and B are nonnegative.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the canonical action of every hyperbolic group on its Gromov boundary has the shadowing (aka pseudo-orbit tracing) property. In particular, this recovers the results of Mann et al. that such actions are topologically stable.</description>
