      <title>Seasonal Variability of Snow Cover and Impact on Albedo and Thermal Properties in the Antarctic Marginal Ice Zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Snow cover plays a critical yet often underrepresented role in shaping the thermodynamic behavior of Antarctic sea ice. In this study, we investigate the seasonal variability of snow distribution and its impact on surface albedo and energy fluxes across the marginal ice zone (MIZ), using a unique dataset from five shipborne expeditions conducted between 2019 and 2024. High-resolution visible and infrared imagery, combined with field observations and meteorological data, reveal that even modest snow fractions substantially increase surface reflectivity and suppress conductive heat transfer. Our results demonstrate that simplified binary assumptions-such as assigning dry snow in winter and bare ice in summer-systematically misrepresent surface conditions, introducing significant biases in modelled radiative and turbulent fluxes. By explicitly resolving fractional snow cover, we show that surface albedo and energy exchange respond nonlinearly to snow-ice composition, with implications for sea ice growth, melt, and climate feedbacks. These findings advocate for a revision of current model parameterizations, emphasizing the need for multi-component surface schemes that reflect the observed heterogeneity of the Antarctic MIZ.</description>

      <title>Estado del clima en Jalisco: temporada de lluvias y comportamiento extremo de la temperatura en 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article analyzes the characteristics of the rainy season and extreme temperatures recorded in the state of Jalisco, Mexico, during 2024. Using ERA5 and CHIRPS reanalysis data and observations from thirteen meteorological stations, patterns of precipitation and temperature anomalies were identified. The results show a late start and early end of the rainy season, with positive anomalies in the central and southern regions, and significant deficits in the coastal strip. Furthermore, 2024 stood out as the warmest year on record, with an average anomaly of 2.3 C in May to October period, surpassing the record set in 2023. This warming is likely attributed to the combination of anthropogenic climate change and an El Nino event, altering local atmospheric patterns and affecting rainfall distribution. The findings highlight Jalisco climate vulnerability, especially in the agricultural sector, which depends on stable weather patterns. This study underscores the need to strengthen monitoring networks, implement predictive models, and design adaptation strategies to mitigate impacts in key sectors such as agriculture and water resources.</description>

      <title>Modernizing CNN-based Weather Forecast Model towards Higher Computational Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, AI-based weather forecast models have achieved impressive advances. These models have reached accuracy levels comparable to traditional NWP systems, marking a significant milestone in data-driven weather prediction. However, they mostly leverage Transformer-based architectures, which often leads to high training complexity and resource demands due to the massive parameter sizes. In this study, we introduce a modernized CNN-based model for global weather forecasting that delivers competitive accuracy while significantly reducing computational requirements. To present a systematic modernization roadmap, we highlight key architectural enhancements across multiple design scales from an earlier CNN-based approach. KAI-a incorporates a scale-invariant architecture and InceptionNeXt-based blocks within a geophysically-aware design, tailored to the structure of Earth system data. Trained on the ERA5 daily dataset with 67 atmospheric variables, the model contains about 7 million parameters and completes training in just 12 hours on a single NVIDIA L40s GPU. Our evaluation shows that KAI-a matches the performance of state-of-the-art models in medium-range weather forecasting, while offering a significantly lightweight design. Furthermore, case studies on the 2018 European heatwave and the East Asian summer monsoon demonstrate KAI-a's robust skill in capturing extreme events, reinforcing its practical utility.</description>

      <title>MARFA: an Effective Line-by-line Tool For Calculating Molecular Absorption in Planetary Atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03418v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present MARFA (Molecular atmospheric Absorption with Rapid and Flexible Analysis) -- an open-source line-by-line tool for calculating absorption coefficients and cross-sections in planetary atmospheres, particularly under conditions of uncertain spectroscopic data and missing continuum functions. With incorporated eleven-grid interpolation technique MARFA shows good performance in computation of far-wing contributions for large line cut-offs. The tool supports flexible parameterization, including line shape functions, wing corrections, user-defined atmospheric profiles, thus, facilitating rapid sensitivity studies for sparse datasets. Spectra are calculated at a high-resolution of about $5*10E-4$ cm$^{-1}$, optimized for infrared and visible spectral regions where HITRAN-formatted line data is available, yet adaptable to other datasets with available line parameters. Output is represented either in a form of binary lookup tables files, directly compatible with radiative transfer codes or in a human-readable format for data analysis and distribution. The MARFA tool is provided in two ways: through a web application accessible at marfa.app for onboarding and educational usage, and as an open-source code available in a public repository for advanced utilization, development and contributions.</description>

      <title>Improving sub-seasonal wind-speed forecasts in Europe with a non-linear model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19077v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sub-seasonal wind speed forecasts provide valuable guidance for wind power system planning and operations, yet the forecast skills of surface winds decrease sharply after two weeks. However, large-scale variables exhibit greater predictability on this time scale. This study explores the potential of leveraging non-linear relationships between 500 hPa geopotential height (Z500) and surface wind speed to improve sub-seasonal wind speed forecast skills in Europe. Our proposed framework uses a Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) or a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to regress surface wind speed from Z500. Evaluations on ERA5 reanalysis indicate that the CNN performs better due to its non-linearity. Applying these models to sub-seasonal forecasts from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, various verification metrics demonstrate the advantages of non-linearity. Yet, this is partly explained by the fact that these statistical models are under-dispersive since they explain only a fraction of the target variable variance. Introducing stochastic perturbations to represent the stochasticity of the unexplained part from the signal helps compensate for this issue. Results show that the perturbed CNN performs better than the perturbed MLR only in the first weeks, while the perturbed MLR's performance converges towards that of the perturbed CNN after two weeks. The study finds that introducing stochastic perturbations can address the issue of insufficient spread in these statistical models, with improvements from the non-linearity varying with the lead time of the forecasts.</description>
