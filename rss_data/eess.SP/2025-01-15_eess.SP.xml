      <title>Unconventional Array Design in the Autocorrelation Domain -- Isophoric 1D Thinning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The synthesis of thinned isophoric arrays (TIAs) radiating mask-constrained patterns is addressed. By leveraging on the recently-introduced formulation of the design of antenna arrays in the autocorrelation-domain (AD), the TIA synthesis is recast as the matching of a target autocorrelation function derived from the user-defined guidelines and objectives. By exploiting the autocorrelation invariance of cyclic binary sequences, the AD solution space is significantly reduced and it is efficiently sampled by means of a discrete hybrid optimization approach. Two possible implementations of the AD-based TIA formulation are discussed and assessed in a set of representative numerical examples concerned with both ideal and real radiators, which are full-wave modeled to account for the mutual coupling effects. Comparisons with traditional pattern-domain (PD) synthesis methods are also considered to point out the features and the advantages of AD-based approaches.</description>

      <title>Open-source End-to-End Digital Beamforming System Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital beamforming forms the foundation for massive MIMO in 6G wireless communications. At their core, digital beamforming architectures provide key benefits such as faster beam search, interference nulling via zero-force beamforming, higher spectral capacity, and more increased flexibility. However, they generally tradeoff power consumption due to the large number of ADCs in such systems. This paper introduces an open-source MATLAB-based behavioral hardware model of a general digital beamforming system. More specifically, it models an end-to-end uplink between an arbitrary number of user elements (UEs) and an arbitrarily large base station (BS) with and without a strong interferer. This paper also presents and validates an equation-based model for the effects of interference on thermal and quantization noise. The behavioral model presented in this paper aims to deepen understanding of such digital beamforming systems to enable system designers to make optimizations. The results presented in this paper primarily center on implementations with low-resolution ADCs and, thus, focus on the effects of system parameters, including interferer strength, on quantization noise.</description>

      <title>A Doubly-Dispersive MIMO Channel Model Parametrized with Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Introduced with the advent of statistical wireless channel models for high mobility communications and having a profound role in communication-centric (CC) integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), the doubly-dispersive (DD) channel structure has long been heralded as a useful tool enabling the capture of the most important fading effects undergone by an arbitrary time-domain transmit signal propagating through some medium. However, the incorporation of this model into multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system setups, relying on the recent paradigm-shifting transceiver architecture based on stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM), in an environment with reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) remains an open problem due to the many intricate details that have to be accounted for. In this paper, we fill this gap by introducing a novel DD MIMO channel model that incorporates an arbitrary number of RISs in the ambient, as well as SIMs equipping both the transmitter and receiver. We then discuss how the proposed metasurfaces-parametrized DD (MPDD) channel model can be seamlessly applied to waveforms that are known to perform well in DD environments, namely, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS), and affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM), with each having their own inherent advantages and disadvantages. An illustrative application of the programmable functionality of the proposed model is finally presented to showcase its potential for boosting the performance of the aforementioned waveforms. Our numerical results indicate that the design of waveforms suitable to mitigating the effects of DD channels is significantly impacted by the emerging SIM technology.</description>

      <title>Atomic Norm Soft Thresholding for Sparse Time-frequency Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-frequency (TF) representation of non-stationary signals typically requires the effective concentration of energy distribution along the instantaneous frequency (IF) ridge, which exhibits intrinsic sparsity. Inspired by the sparse optimization over continuum via atomic norm, a novel atomic norm soft thresholding for sparse TF representation (AST-STF) method is proposed, which ensures accurate TF localization under the strong duality. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the performance of the proposed method surpasses that of conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Waveform Modeling for Wideband Optical Fiber Channel Transmission: Challenges and Potential Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast and accurate optical fiber communication simulation system are crucial for optimizing optical networks, developing digital signal processing algorithms, and performing end-to-end (E2E) optimization. Deep learning (DL) has emerged as a valuable tool to reduce the complexity of traditional waveform simulation methods, such as split-step Fourier method (SSFM). DL-based schemes have achieved high accuracy and low complexity fiber channel waveform modeling as its strong nonlinear fitting ability and high efficiency in parallel computation. However, DL-based schemes are mainly utilized in single-channel and few-channel wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) systems. The applicability of DL-based schemes in wideband WDM systems remains uncertain due to the lack of comparison under consistent standards and scenarios. In this paper, we propose a DSP-assisted accuracy evaluation method to evaluate the performance for DL-based schemes, from the aspects of waveform and quality of transmission (QoT) errors. We compare the performance of five various DL-based schemes and valid the effectiveness of DSP-assisted method in WDM systems. Results suggest that feature decoupled distributed (FDD) achieves the better accuracy, especially in large-channel and high-rate scenarios. Furthermore, we find that the accuracy of FDD still exhibit significant degradation with the number of WDM channels and transmission rates exceeds 15 and 100 GBaud, indicating challenges for wideband applications. We further analyze the reasons of performance degradation from the perspective of increased linearity and nonlinearity and discuss potential solutions including further decoupling scheme designs and improvement in DL models. Despite DL-based schemes remain challenges in wideband WDM systems, they have strong potential for high-accuracy and low-complexity optical fiber channel waveform modeling.</description>

      <title>Target Detection in OFDM-ISAC Systems: A Multipath Exploitation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the potential of multipath exploitation for enhancing target detection in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. The study aims to improve target detection performance by harnessing the diversity gain in the delay-Doppler domain. We propose a weighted generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) detector that effectively leverages the multipath propagation between the base station (BS) and the target. To further enhance detection accuracy, a joint optimization framework is developed for subcarrier power allocation at the transmitter and weight coefficients of the GLRT detector. The objective is to maximize the probability of target detection while satisfying constraints on total transmit power and the communication receiver's signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). An iterative algorithm based on the majorization-minimization (MM) method is employed to address the resulting non-convex optimization problem. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm and confirm the benefits of multipath exploitation for target detection in OFDM-ISAC systems under multipath-rich environments.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Split Covariance Intersection: Correlated Components and Optimality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear fusion is a cornerstone of estimation theory. Implementing optimal linear fusion requires knowledge of the covariance of the vector of errors associated with all the estimators. In distributed or cooperative systems, the cross-covariance terms cannot be computed, and to avoid underestimating the estimation error, conservative fusions must be performed. A conservative fusion provides a fused estimator with a covariance bound that is guaranteed to be larger than the true, but computationally intractable, covariance of the error. Previous research by Reinhardt \textit{et al.} proved that, if no additional assumption is made about the errors of the estimators, the minimal bound for fusing two estimators is given by a fusion called Covariance Intersection (CI). In distributed systems, the estimation errors contain independent and correlated terms induced by the measurement noises and the process noise. In this case, CI is no longer the optimal method. Split Covariance Intersection (SCI) has been developed to take advantage of the uncorrelated components. This paper extends SCI to also take advantage of the correlated components. Then, it is proved that the new fusion provides the optimal conservative fusion bounds for two estimators, generalizing the optimality of CI to a wider class of fusion schemes. The benefits of this extension are demonstrated in simulations.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Learning with Approximate Finite-Time Consensus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of algorithms for decentralized optimization is affected by both the optimization error and the consensus error, the latter of which arises from the variation between agents' local models. Classically, algorithms employ averaging and gradient-tracking mechanisms with constant combination matrices to drive the collection of agents to consensus. Recent works have demonstrated that using sequences of combination matrices that achieve finite-time consensus (FTC) can result in improved communication efficiency or iteration complexity for decentralized optimization. Notably, these studies apply to highly structured networks, where exact finite-time consensus sequences are known exactly and in closed form. In this work we investigate the impact of utilizing approximate FTC matrices in decentralized learning algorithms, and quantify the impact of the approximation error on convergence rate and steady-state performance. Approximate FTC matrices can be inferred for general graphs and do not rely on a particular graph structure or prior knowledge, making the proposed scheme applicable to a broad range of decentralized learning settings.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Sparse Bayesian Learning Methods with Application to Massive MIMO Channel Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of sparse channel estimation in massive multiple-input multiple-output systems. In this context, we propose an enhanced version of the sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) framework, referred to as enhanced SBL (E-SBL), which is based on a reparameterization of the original SBL model. Specifically, we introduce a scale vector that brings extra flexibility to the model, which is estimated along with the other unknowns. Moreover, we introduce a variant of E-SBL, referred to as modified E-SBL (M-E-SBL), which is based on a computationally more efficient parameter estimation. We compare the proposed E-SBL and M-E-SBL with the baseline SBL and with a method based on variational message passing (VMP) in terms of computational complexity and performance. Numerical results show that the proposed E-SBL and M-E-SBL outperform the baseline SBL and VMP in terms of mean squared error of the channel estimation in all the considered scenarios. Furthermore, we show that M-E-SBL produces results comparable with E-SBL with considerably cheaper computations.</description>

      <title>Movable Antenna Enhanced DF and AF Relaying Systems: Performance Analysis and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) has been deemed as a promising technology to flexibly reconfigure wireless channels by adjusting the antenna positions in a given local region. In this paper, we investigate the application of the MA technology in both decode-and-forward (DF) and amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying systems, where a relay is equipped with multiple MAs to assist in the data transmission between two single-antenna nodes. For the DF relaying system, our objective is to maximize the achievable rate at the destination by jointly optimizing the positions of the MAs in two stages for receiving signals from the source and transmitting signals to the destination, respectively. To drive essential insights, we first derive a closed-form upper bound on the maximum achievable rate of the DF relaying system. Then, a low-complexity algorithm based on projected gradient ascent (PGA) and alternating optimization (AO) is proposed to solve the antenna position optimization problem. For the AF relaying system, our objective is to maximize the achievable rate by jointly optimizing the two-stage MA positions as well as the AF beamforming matrix at the relay, which results in a more challenging optimization problem due to the intricate coupling variables. To tackle this challenge, we first reveal the hidden separability among the antenna position optimization in the two stages and the beamforming optimization. Based on such separability, we derive a closed-form upper bound on the maximum achievable rate of the AF relaying system and propose a low-complexity algorithm to obtain a high-quality suboptimal solution to the considered problem. Simulation results validate the efficacy of our theoretical analysis and demonstrate the superiority of the MA-enhanced relaying systems to the conventional relaying systems with fixed-position antennas (FPAs) and other benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Decision Transformers for RIS-Assisted Systems with Diffusion Model-Based Channel Acquisition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have been recognized as a revolutionary technology for future wireless networks. However, RIS-assisted communications have to continuously tune phase-shifts relying on accurate channel state information (CSI) that is generally difficult to obtain due to the large number of RIS channels. The joint design of CSI acquisition and subsection RIS phase-shifts remains a significant challenge in dynamic environments. In this paper, we propose a diffusion-enhanced decision Transformer (DEDT) framework consisting of a diffusion model (DM) designed for efficient CSI acquisition and a decision Transformer (DT) utilized for phase-shift optimizations. Specifically, we first propose a novel DM mechanism, i.e., conditional imputation based on denoising diffusion probabilistic model, for rapidly acquiring real-time full CSI by exploiting the spatial correlations inherent in wireless channels. Then, we optimize beamforming schemes based on the DT architecture, which pre-trains on historical environments to establish a robust policy model. Next, we incorporate a fine-tuning mechanism to ensure rapid beamforming adaptation to new environments, eliminating the retraining process that is imperative in conventional reinforcement learning (RL) methods. Simulation results demonstrate that DEDT can enhance efficiency and adaptability of RIS-aided communications with fluctuating channel conditions compared to state-of-the-art RL methods.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Delay-Doppler Division Multiplexing Modulation with Hierarchical Mode-Based Index Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The orthogonal time frequency space with index modulation (OTFS-IM) offers flexible tradeoffs between spectral efficiency (SE) and bit error rate (BER) in doubly selective fading channels. While OTFS-IM schemes demonstrated such potential, a persistent challenge lies in the detection complexity. To address this problem, we propose the hierarchical mode-based index modulation (HMIM). HMIM introduces a novel approach to modulate information bits by IM patterns, significantly simplifying the complexity of maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation with Gaussian noise. Further, we incorporate HMIM with the recently proposed orthogonal delay-Doppler division multiplexing (ODDM) modulation, namely ODDM-HMIM, to exploit the full diversity of the delay-Doppler (DD) channel. The BER performance of ODDM-HMIM is analyzed considering a maximum likelihood (ML) detector. Our numerical results reveal that, with the same SE, HMIM can outperform conventional IM in terms of both BER and computational complexity. In addition, we propose a successive interference cancellation-based minimum mean square error (SIC-MMSE) detector for ODDM-HMIM, which enables low-complexity detection with large frame sizes.</description>

      <title>EEG-ReMinD: Enhancing Neurodegenerative EEG Decoding through Self-Supervised State Reconstruction-Primed Riemannian Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of EEG decoding algorithms confronts challenges such as data sparsity, subject variability, and the need for precise annotations, all of which are vital for advancing brain-computer interfaces and enhancing the diagnosis of diseases. To address these issues, we propose a novel two-stage approach named Self-Supervised State Reconstruction-Primed Riemannian Dynamics (EEG-ReMinD) , which mitigates reliance on supervised learning and integrates inherent geometric features. This approach efficiently handles EEG data corruptions and reduces the dependency on labels. EEG-ReMinD utilizes self-supervised and geometric learning techniques, along with an attention mechanism, to analyze the temporal dynamics of EEG features within the framework of Riemannian geometry, referred to as Riemannian dynamics. Comparative analyses on both intact and corrupted datasets from two different neurodegenerative disorders underscore the enhanced performance of EEG-ReMinD.</description>

      <title>Mobility Management in Integrated Sensing and Communications Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of the integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks is considerably affected by the mobility of the transceiver nodes, user equipment devices (UEs) and the passive objects that are sensed. For instance, the sensing efficiency is considerably affected by the presence or absence of a line-of-sight connection between the sensing transceivers and the object; a condition that may change quickly due to mobility. Moreover, the mobility of the UEs and objects may result in dynamically varying communication-to-sensing and sensing-to communication interference, deteriorating the network performance. In such cases, there may be a need to handover the sensing process to neighbor nodes. In this article, we develop the concept of mobility management in ISAC networks. Here, depending on the mobility of objects and/or the transceiver nodes, the data traffic, the sensing or communication coverage area of the transceivers, and the network interference, the transmission and/or the reception of the sensing signals may be handed over to neighbor nodes. Also, the ISAC configuration and modality - that is, using monostatic or bistatic sensing - are updated accordingly, such that the sensed objects can be continuously sensed with low overhead. We show that mobility management reduces the sensing interruption and boosts the communication and sensing efficiency of ISAC networks.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Accurate Full-Waveform Inversion with Total Variation Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a computationally efficient algorithm to address the Full-Waveform Inversion (FWI) problem with a Total Variation (TV) constraint, designed to accurately reconstruct subsurface properties from seismic data. FWI, as an ill-posed inverse problem, requires effective regularizations or constraints to ensure accurate and stable solutions. Among these, the TV constraint is widely known as a powerful prior for modeling the piecewise smooth structure of subsurface properties. However, solving the optimization problem is challenging because of the nonlinear observation process combined with the non-smoothness of the TV constraint. Conventional methods rely on inner loops and/or approximations, which lead to high computational cost and/or inappropriate solutions. To address these limitations, we develop a novel algorithm based on a primal-dual splitting method, achieving computational efficiency by eliminating inner loops and ensuring high accuracy by avoiding approximations. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through experiments using the SEG/EAGE Salt and Overthrust Models. The source code will be available at https://www.mdi.c.titech.ac.jp/publications/fwiwtv.</description>

      <title>Universal Training of Neural Networks to Achieve Bayes Optimal Classification Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work invokes the notion of $f$-divergence to introduce a novel upper bound on the Bayes error rate of a general classification task. We show that the proposed bound can be computed by sampling from the output of a parameterized model. Using this practical interpretation, we introduce the Bayes optimal learning threshold (BOLT) loss whose minimization enforces a classification model to achieve the Bayes error rate. We validate the proposed loss for image and text classification tasks, considering MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and IMDb datasets. Numerical experiments demonstrate that models trained with BOLT achieve performance on par with or exceeding that of cross-entropy, particularly on challenging datasets. This highlights the potential of BOLT in improving generalization.</description>

      <title>Transforming Indoor Localization: Advanced Transformer Architecture for NLOS Dominated Wireless Environments with Distributed Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Indoor localization in challenging non-line-of-sight (NLOS) environments often leads to mediocre accuracy with traditional approaches. Deep learning (DL) has been applied to tackle these challenges; however, many DL approaches overlook computational complexity, especially for floating-point operations (FLOPs), making them unsuitable for resource-limited devices. Transformer-based models have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) tasks, motivating their use in wireless applications. However, their use in indoor localization remains nascent, and directly applying Transformers for indoor localization can be both computationally intensive and exhibit limitations in accuracy. To address these challenges, in this work, we introduce a novel tokenization approach, referred to as Sensor Snapshot Tokenization (SST), which preserves variable-specific representations of power delay profile (PDP) and enhances attention mechanisms by effectively capturing multi-variate correlation. Complementing this, we propose a lightweight Swish-Gated Linear Unit-based Transformer (L-SwiGLU Transformer) model, designed to reduce computational complexity without compromising localization accuracy. Together, these contributions mitigate the computational burden and dependency on large datasets, making Transformer models more efficient and suitable for resource-constrained scenarios. The proposed tokenization method enables the Vanilla Transformer to achieve a 90th percentile positioning error of 0.388 m in a highly NLOS indoor factory, surpassing conventional tokenization methods. The L-SwiGLU ViT further reduces the error to 0.355 m, achieving an 8.51% improvement. Additionally, the proposed model outperforms a 14.1 times larger model with a 46.13% improvement, underscoring its computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Spiking Neural Network Accelerator Architecture for Differential-Time Representation using Learned Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have garnered attention over recent years due to their increased energy efficiency and advantages in terms of operational complexity compared to traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Two important questions when implementing SNNs are how to best encode existing data into spike trains and how to efficiently process these spike trains in hardware. This paper addresses both of these problems by incorporating the encoding into the learning process, thus allowing the network to learn the spike encoding alongside the weights. Furthermore, this paper proposes a hardware architecture based on a recently introduced differential-time representation for spike trains allowing decoupling of spike time and processing time. Together these contributions lead to a feedforward SNN using only Leaky-Integrate and Fire (LIF) neurons that surpasses 99% accuracy on the MNIST dataset while still being implementable on medium-sized FPGAs with inference times of less than 295us.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wireless communications rely on path loss modeling, which is most effective when it includes the physical details of the propagation environment. Acquiring this data has historically been challenging, but geographic information system data is becoming increasingly available with higher resolution and accuracy. Access to such details enables propagation models to more accurately predict coverage and minimize interference in wireless deployments. Machine learning-based modeling can significantly support this effort, with feature-based approaches allowing for accurate, efficient, and scalable propagation modeling. Building on previous work, we introduce an extended set of features that improves prediction accuracy while, most importantly, maintaining model generalization across a broad range of environments.</description>

Abstract: This paper explores a novel integrated localization and communication (ILAC) system using the affine Fourier transform multicarrier (AFT-MC) waveform. Specifically, we consider a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) AFT-MC system with ILAC and derive a continuous delay and Doppler shift channel matrix model. Based on the derived signal model, we develop a two-step algorithm with low complexity for estimating channel parameters. Furthermore, we derive the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of location estimation as the fundamental limit of localization. Finally, we provide some insights about the AFT-MC parameters by explaining the impact of the parameters on localization performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the AFT-MC waveform is able to provide significant localization performance improvement compared to orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) while achieving the CRLB of location estimation.</description>

      <title>VBIM-Net: Variational Born Iterative Network for Inverse Scattering Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, studies have shown the potential of integrating field-type iterative methods with deep learning (DL) techniques in solving inverse scattering problems (ISPs). In this article, we propose a novel Variational Born Iterative Network, namely, VBIM-Net, to solve the full-wave ISPs with significantly improved structural rationality and inversion quality. The proposed VBIM-Net emulates the alternating updates of the total electric field and the contrast in the variational Born iterative method (VBIM) by multiple layers of subnetworks. We embed the analytical calculation of the contrast variation into each subnetwork, converting the scattered field residual into an approximate contrast variation and then enhancing it by a U-Net, thus avoiding the requirement of matched measurement dimension and grid resolution as in existing approaches. The total field and contrast of each layer's output is supervised in the loss function of VBIM-Net, imposing soft physical constraints on the variables in the subnetworks, which benefits the model's performance.In addition, we design a training scheme with extra noise to enhance the model's stability. Extensive numerical results on synthetic and experimental data both verify the inversion quality, generalization ability, and robustness of the proposed VBIM-Net. This work may provide some new inspiration for the design of efficient field-type DL schemes.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Bayesian State Estimation with Compressed Measurement of Model-free Process using Semi-supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The research topic is: data-driven Bayesian state estimation with compressed measurement (BSCM) of model-free process, say for a (causal) tracking application. The dimension of the temporal measurement vector is lower than the dimension of the temporal state vector to be estimated. Hence the state estimation problem is an underdetermined inverse problem. The underlying dynamical model of the states is assumed to be unknown and hence, we use the terminology 'model-free process'. In absence of the dynamical model, we can not employ traditional model-driven methods like Kalman Filter (KF) and Particle Filter (PF), and instead require data-driven methods. We first experimentally show that two existing unsupervised learning-based data-driven methods fail to address the BSCM problem for model-free process; they are - data-driven nonlinear state estimation (DANSE) method and deep Markov model (DMM) method. The unsupervised learning uses unlabelled data comprised of only noisy, linear measurements. While DANSE provides a good predictive / forecasting performance to model the temporal measurement data as time-series, its unsupervised learning lacks a regularization for state estimation. We then investigate the use of a semi-supervised learning approach, and develop a semi-supervised learning-based DANSE method, referred to as SemiDANSE. In SemiDANSE, we use a limited amount of labelled data along-with a large amount of unlabelled data, and that helps to bring the desired regularization for addressing the BSCM problem. The labelled data means pairwise measurement-and-state data. Using three chaotic dynamical systems (or processes) with nonlinear dynamical models as benchmark, we show that the data-driven SemiDANSE provides competitive performance for BSCM against a hybrid method called KalmanNet and two model-driven methods -- an extended KF (EKF) and an unscented KF (UKF).</description>

      <title>Diffraction Aided Wireless Positioning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wireless positioning in Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) scenarios presents significant challenges due to multipath effects that lead to biased measurements and reduced positioning accuracy. This paper revisits electromagnetic field theory related to diffraction and in the context of wireless positioning and proposes a novel positioning technique that greatly improves accuracy in NLoS environments dominated by diffraction. The method is applied to a critical public safety use case: precisely locating at-risk individuals within buildings, with a particular focus on improving 3D positioning and z-axis accuracy. By leveraging the Geometrical Theory of Diffraction (GTD), the approach introduces an innovative NLoS path length model and a new NLOS positioning technique. Using Fisher information analysis, we establish the conditions required for 3D positioning and derive lower bounds on positioning performance for both 3D and z-axis estimates for the proposed NLOS positioning technique. Additionally, we propose an algorithmic implementation of the proposed NLoS positioning method using non-linear least squares estimation, which we term D-NLS. The positioning performance of our proposed NLOs positioning technique is validated using an extensive ray-tracing simulation. The numerical results highlight the superiority of our approach in outdoor-to-indoor environments, which directly estimates NLoS path lengths and delivers significant performance enhancements over existing methods for both 3D and z-axis positioning scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Physical Layer Security Framework for IRS-Assisted Integrated Sensing and Semantic Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a physical layer security (PLS) framework for an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted integrated sensing and semantic communication (ISASC) system, where a multi-antenna dual-functional semantic base station (BS) serves multiple semantic communication users (SCUs) and monitors a potentially malicious sensing target (MST) in the presence of an eavesdropper (EVE). Both MST and EVE attempt to wiretap information from the signals transmitted to the SCUs. The deployment of the IRS not only enhances PLS by directing a strong beam towards the SCUs, but also improves the localization information for the target without disclosing information about the SCUs. To further strengthen PLS, we employ joint artificial noise (AN) and dedicated sensing signal (DSS), in addition to wiretap coding. To evaluate sensing accuracy, we derive the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for estimating the direction of arrival (DoA), and to assess the PLS level of the ISASC system, we determine a closed-form expression for the semantic secrecy rate (SSR). To achieve an optimal trade-off between these two competing objectives, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP) for the joint design of the BS's beamforming (BF) vectors and the IRS's phase shift vector. To tackle this MOOP problem, the $\epsilon$-constraint method is employed, followed by an alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithm that leverages the classical successive convex approximation (SCA) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) techniques. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms the baseline schemes, achieving a superior trade-off between SSR and CRB. Specifically, our proposed approach improves the sensing accuracy by 5 dB compared to the commonly adopted maximal ratio transmission (MRT) approach.</description>

      <title>Generative Semantic Communications with Foundation Models: Perception-Error Analysis and Semantic-Aware Power Allocation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative foundation models can revolutionize the design of semantic communication (SemCom) systems allowing high fidelity exchange of semantic information at ultra low rates. In this work, a generative SemCom framework with pretrained foundation models is proposed, where both uncoded forward-with-error and coded discard-with-error schemes are developed for the semantic decoder. To characterize the impact of transmission reliability on the perceptual quality of the regenerated signal, their mathematical relationship is analyzed from a rate-distortion-perception perspective, which is proved to be non-decreasing. The semantic values are defined to measure the semantic information of multimodal semantic features accordingly. We also investigate semantic-aware power allocation problems aiming at power consumption minimization for ultra low rate and high fidelity SemComs. To solve these problems, two semantic-aware power allocation methods are proposed by leveraging the non-decreasing property of the perception-error relationship. Numerically, perception-error functions and semantic values of semantic data streams under both schemes for image tasks are obtained based on the Kodak dataset. Simulation results show that our proposed semanticaware method significantly outperforms conventional approaches, particularly in the channel-coded case (up to 90% power saving).</description>

Abstract: This paper deals with the state prediction of nonlinear stochastic dynamic systems. The emphasis is laid on a solution to the integral Chapman-Kolmogorov equation by a deterministic-integration-rule-based point-mass method. A novel concept of reliable data-augmented, i.e., mathematics- and data-informed, integration rule is developed to enhance the point-mass state predictor, where the trained neural network (representing data contribution) is used for the selection of the best integration rule from a set of available rules (representing mathematics contribution). The proposed approach combining the best properties of the standard mathematics-informed and novel data-informed rules is thoroughly discussed.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Integration Based Estimator: Robust Design and Stone Soup Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with state estimation of nonlinear stochastic dynamic models. In particular, the stochastic integration rule, which provides asymptotically unbiased estimates of the moments of nonlinearly transformed Gaussian random variables, is reviewed together with the recently introduced stochastic integration filter (SIF). Using SIF, the respective multi-step prediction and smoothing algorithms are developed in full and efficient square-root form. The stochastic-integration-rule-based algorithms are implemented in Python (within the Stone Soup framework) and in MATLAB and are numerically evaluated and compared with the well-known unscented and extended Kalman filters using the Stone Soup defined tracking scenario.</description>

      <title>A Measurement-Based Spatially Consistent Channel Model for Distributed MIMO in Industrial Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Future wireless communication systems are envisioned to support ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC), which will enable new applications such as compute offloading, wireless real-time control, and reliable monitoring. Distributed multiple-input multiple-output (D-MIMO) is one of the most promising technologies for delivering URLLC. This paper classifies obstruction and derives a channel model from a D-MIMO measurement campaign carried out at a carrier frequency of 3.75 GHz with a bandwidth of 35 MHz using twelve distributed fully coherent dipole antennas in an industrial environment. Channel characteristics are investigated, including statistical measures such as small-scale fading, large-scale fading, delay spread, and transition rates between line-of-sight and obstructed line-of-sight conditions for the different antenna elements, laying the foundations for an accurate channel model for D-MIMO systems in industrial environments. Furthermore, correlations of large-scale fading between antennas, spatial correlation, and tail distributions are included to enable proper evaluations of reliability and rare events. Based on the results, a channel model for D-MIMO in industrial environments is presented together with a recipe for its implementation.</description>

      <title>CoVRage: Millimeter-Wave Beamforming for Mobile Interactive Virtual Reality</title>

Abstract: Contemporary Virtual Reality (VR) setups often include an external source delivering content to a Head-Mounted Display (HMD). "Cutting the wire" in such setups and going truly wireless will require a wireless network capable of delivering enormous amounts of video data at an extremely low latency. The massive bandwidth of higher frequencies, such as the millimeter-wave (mmWave) band, can meet these requirements. Due to high attenuation and path loss in the mmWave frequencies, beamforming is essential. In wireless VR, where the antenna is integrated into the HMD, any head rotation also changes the antenna's orientation. As such, beamforming must adapt, in real-time, to the user's head rotations. An HMD's built-in sensors providing accurate orientation estimates may facilitate such rapid beamforming. In this work, we present coVRage, a receive-side beamforming solution tailored for VR HMDs. Using built-in orientation prediction present on modern HMDs, the algorithm estimates how the Angle of Arrival (AoA) at the HMD will change in the near future, and covers this AoA trajectory with a dynamically shaped oblong beam, synthesized using sub-arrays. We show that this solution can cover these trajectories with consistently high gain, even in light of temporally or spatially inaccurate orientational data.</description>

      <title>Joint Beamforming Optimization and Mode Selection for RDARS-Aided MIMO Systems</title>

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has emerged as a cost-effective solution for green communications in 6G. However, its further extensive use has been greatly limited due to its fully passive characteristics. Considering the appealing distribution gains of distributed antenna systems (DAS), a flexible reconfigurable architecture called reconfigurable distributed antenna and reflecting surface (RDARS) is proposed. RDARS encompasses DAS and RIS as two special cases and maintains the advantages of distributed antennas while reducing the hardware cost by replacing some active antennas with low-cost passive reflecting surfaces. In this paper, we present a RDARS-aided uplink multi-user communication system and investigate the system transmission reliability with the newly proposed architecture. Specifically, in addition to the distribution gain and the reflection gain provided by the connection and reflection modes, respectively, we also consider the dynamic mode switching of each element which introduces an additional degree of freedom (DoF) and thus results in a selection gain. As such, we aim to minimize the total sum mean-square-error (MSE) of all data streams by jointly optimizing the receive beamforming matrix, the reflection phase shifts and the channel-aware placement of elements in the connection mode. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed architecture compared to the conventional fully passive RIS or DAS. Furthermore, some insights about the practical implementation of RDARS are provided.</description>

Abstract: The pursuit of higher data rates and efficient spectrum utilization in modern communication technologies necessitates novel solutions. In order to provide insights into improving spectral efficiency and reducing latency, this study investigates the maximum channel coding rate (MCCR) of finite block length (FBL) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) channels. By optimizing power allocation, we derive the system's MCCR expression. Simulation results are compared with the existing literature to reveal the benefits of FTN in FBL transmission.</description>

      <title>Information Rates of Successive Interference Cancellation for Optical Fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Joint detection and decoding (JDD) achieves rates based on information theory but is too complex to implement for many channels with memory or nonlinearities. Successive interference cancellation (SIC) at the receiver, combined with multistage encoding at the transmitter, is a method that lets one use coded modulation for memoryless channels to approach JDD rates. A SIC-based receiver is presented to compensate for inter-channel interference in long-haul optical fiber links. Simulations for 1000 km of standard single-mode fiber with ideal distributed Raman amplification, single-polarization transmission, and circularly symmetric complex Gaussian (CSCG) modulation show that SIC attains the achievable information rates (AIRs) of JDD using surrogate channel models with correlated phase and additive noise (CPAN). Moreover, the AIRs of ring constellations are compared to those of CSCG modulation. Simulations show that 32 rings, 16 SIC-stages, and Gaussian message passing on the factor graph of the CPAN surrogate model achieve the JDD rates of CSCG modulation. The computational complexity scales in proportion to the number of SIC-stages, where one stage has complexity similar to separate detection and decoding.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Based Residual Useful Lifetime Prediction for Assets with Uncertain Failure Modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Industrial prognostics focuses on utilizing degradation signals to forecast and continually update the residual useful life of complex engineering systems. However, existing prognostic models for systems with multiple failure modes face several challenges in real-world applications, including overlapping degradation signals from multiple components, the presence of unlabeled historical data, and the similarity of signals across different failure modes. To tackle these issues, this research introduces two prognostic models that integrate the mixture (log)-location-scale distribution with deep learning. This integration facilitates the modeling of overlapping degradation signals, eliminates the need for explicit failure mode identification, and utilizes deep learning to capture complex nonlinear relationships between degradation signals and residual useful lifetimes. Numerical studies validate the superior performance of these proposed models compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Multi-Gigabit Interactive Extended Reality over Millimeter-Wave: An End-to-End System Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15570v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Achieving high-quality wireless interactive Extended Reality (XR) will require multi-gigabit throughput at extremely low latency. The Millimeter-Wave (mmWave) frequency bands, between 24 and 300GHz, can achieve such extreme performance. However, maintaining a consistently high Quality of Experience with highly mobile users is challenging, as mmWave communications are inherently directional. In this work, we present and evaluate an end-to-end approach to such a mmWave-based mobile XR system. We perform a highly realistic simulation of the system, incorporating accurate XR data traffic, detailed mmWave propagation models and actual user motion. We evaluate the impact of the beamforming strategy and frequency on the overall performance. In addition, we provide the first system-level evaluation of the CoVRage algorithm, a proactive and spatially aware user-side beamforming approach designed specifically for highly mobile XR environments.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Robustness and Security in ISAC Network Design: Leveraging Transmissive Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface with RSMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel transmissive reconfigurable intelligent surface transceiver-enhanced robust and secure integrated sensing and communication network. A time-division sensing communication mechanism is designed for the scenario, which enables communication and sensing to share wireless resources. To address the interference management problem and hinder eavesdropping, we implement rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA), where the common stream is designed as a useful signal and an artificial noise, while taking into account the imperfect channel state information and modeling the channel for the illegal users in a fine-grained manner as well as giving an upper bound on the error. We introduce the secrecy outage probability and construct an optimization problem with secrecy sum-rate as the objective functions to optimize the common stream beamforming matrix, the private stream beamforming matrix and the timeslot duration variable. Due to the coupling of the optimization variables and the infinity of the error set, the proposed problem is a nonconvex optimization problem that cannot be solved directly. In order to address the above challenges, the block coordinate descent-based second-order cone programming algorithm is used to decouple the optimization variables and solving the problem. Specifically, the problem is decoupled into two subproblems concerning the common stream beamforming matrix, the private stream beamforming matrix, and the timeslot duration variable, which are solved by alternating optimization until convergence is reached. To solve the problem, S-procedure, Bernstein's inequality and successive convex approximation are employed to deal with the objective function and non-convex constraints. Numerical simulation results verify the superiority of the proposed scheme in improving the secrecy energy efficiency and the Cram\'{e}r-Rao boundary.</description>

      <title>Radar Signal Recognition through Self-Supervised Learning and Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03461v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automatic radar signal recognition (RSR) plays a pivotal role in electronic warfare (EW), as accurately classifying radar signals is critical for informing decision-making processes. Recent advances in deep learning have shown significant potential in improving RSR performance in domains with ample annotated data. However, these methods fall short in EW scenarios where annotated RF data are scarce or impractical to obtain. To address these challenges, we introduce a self-supervised learning (SSL) method which utilises masked signal modelling and RF domain adaption to enhance RSR performance in environments with limited RF samples and labels. Specifically, we investigate pre-training masked autoencoders (MAE) on baseband in-phase and quadrature (I/Q) signals from various RF domains and subsequently transfer the learned representation to the radar domain, where annotated data are limited. Empirical results show that our lightweight self-supervised ResNet model with domain adaptation achieves up to a 17.5% improvement in 1-shot classification accuracy when pre-trained on in-domain signals (i.e., radar signals) and up to a 16.31% improvement when pre-trained on out-of-domain signals (i.e., comm signals), compared to its baseline without SSL. We also provide reference results for several MAE designs and pre-training strategies, establishing a new benchmark for few-shot radar signal classification.</description>

      <title>Multiple testing in multi-stream sequential change detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-stream sequential change detection involves simultaneously monitoring many streams of data and trying to detect when their distributions change, if at all. Here, we theoretically study multiple testing issues that arise from detecting changes in many streams. We point out that any algorithm with finite average run length (ARL) must have a trivial worst-case false detection rate (FDR), family-wise error rate (FWER), and per-family error rate (PFER); thus, any attempt to control these Type I error metrics is fundamentally in conflict with the desire for a finite ARL (which is typically necessary in order to have a small detection delay). One of our contributions is to define a new class of metrics which can be controlled, called error over patience (EOP). We propose algorithms that combine the recent e-detector framework (which generalizes the Shiryaev-Roberts and CUSUM methods) with the recent e-Benjamini-Hochberg procedure and e-Bonferroni procedures. We prove that these algorithms control the EOP at any desired level under very general dependence structures on the data within and across the streams. In fact, we prove a more general error control that holds uniformly over all stopping times and provides a smooth trade-off between the conflicting metrics. Additionally, if finiteness of the ARL is forfeited, we show that our algorithms control the Type I error.</description>

      <title>Movable Antenna Enhanced Integrated Sensing and Communication Via Antenna Position Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system aided by the movable-antenna (MA) array, which can improve the communication and sensing performance via flexible antenna movement over conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) array. First, we consider the downlink multiuser communication, where each user is randomly distributed within a given three-dimensional zone with local movement. To reduce the overhead of frequent antenna movement, the antenna position vector (APV) is designed based on users' statistical channel state information (CSI), so that the antennas only need to be moved in a large timescale. Then, for target sensing, the Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs) of the estimation mean square error for different spatial angles of arrival (AoAs) are derived as functions of MAs' positions. Based on the above, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the expected minimum achievable rate among all communication users, with given constraints on the maximum acceptable CRB thresholds for target sensing. An alternating optimization algorithm is proposed to iteratively optimize one of the horizontal and vertical APVs of the MA array with the other being fixed. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed MA arrays can significantly enlarge the trade-off region between communication and sensing performance compared to conventional FPA arrays with different inter-antenna spacing. It is also revealed that the steering vectors of the designed MA arrays exhibit low correlation in the angular domain, thus effectively reducing channel correlation among communication users to enhance their achievable rates, while alleviating ambiguity in target angle estimation to achieve improved sensing accuracy.</description>
