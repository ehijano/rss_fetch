      <title>Fokker-Planck approach for thermal fluctuations in antiferromagnetic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a Fokker-Planck approach to describe the dynamics of staggered magnetization and thermal fluctuations in a two-dimensional antiferromagnetic system with uniaxial anisotropy. Beginning with a classical model for the antiferromagnetic system, we incorporate a Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation augmented by Langevin fields to account for thermal fluctuations, and we derive the Fokker-Planck equation governing the probability distribution function of the spin configuration. Employing the mean-field approximation, we derive the equations of motion for the spin polarization and the two-time spin-spin correlation functions. The methodology is applied to the study of spin-wave dynamics and to the formulation of a phenomenological model for resistance fluctuations in two-dimensional antiferromagnetic semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Photon correlation Fourier spectroscopy of a B center in hBN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The potential of solid-state quantum emitters for applications critically depends on several key figures of merit. One of the most important is the quantum coherence of the emitted single photons, which can be compromised by fast dephasing and spectral diffusion. In hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), blue-emitting color centers (or B centers) are seen as favorable in this regard, in the light of prior studies mainly based on resonant excitation. Yet, their coherence properties in the more accessible regime of non-resonant excitation (or photoluminescence) has not been extensively characterized. Here, we investigate the coherence and spectral diffusion of the photoluminescence from a B center in the continuous wave regime using photon correlation Fourier spectroscopy. We determine that the emission lineshape consists in a homogeneous contribution, whose linewidth increases with the laser power, and which is broadened by spectral diffusion at a timescale of 10 to 100 microseconds. At low power and short time, the emission line is only a factor ~2 above the Fourier limit, while at long times, the inhomogeneous linewidth increases up to more than a gigahertz. Our work deepens the understanding of decoherence processes of this preeminent family of quantum emitters in hBN.</description>

      <title>Engineering interaction potentials for stabilizing quantum quasicrystal phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the necessary features of the pair interaction for the stabilization of self-assembled quantum quasicrystals in two-dimensional bosonic systems. Unlike the classical scenario, our results show that two-dimensional octagonal, decagonal, and dodecagonal aperiodic phases require a distinct number of properly tuned characteristic length scales for their stabilization. By using a mean field spectral variational approach and Gross-Pitaevskii numerical calculations, we determine that the dodecagonal quasicrystal structure requires at least two characteristic length scales for its stabilization, while the decagonal and octagonal patterns need at least three and four length scales, respectively. The family of pair interaction potentials considered, albeit simple, is well justified in terms of a novel experimental platform based on laser-painted interactions in a cavity QED setup. Finally, we perform a structural characterization of the quasicrystal patterns obtained and show that these phases coexist with a finite superfluid fraction, forming what can be called a super quasicrystal phase.</description>

      <title>Energy density and stress fields in quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08432v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There has been an enduring interest and controversy about whether or not one can define physically meaningful energy density and stress fields, $e(\bf{r})$ and $\sigma_{\alpha \beta}(\bf{r})$, since the two forms of the kinetic energy, $\frac{1}{2}|\nabla \Psi|^2$ and $-\frac{1}{2}\Psi\nabla^2 \Psi$, lead to different densities, and analogous issues arise for interactions. This paper considers the ground state of a system of many interacting particles in an external potential, and presents a resolution in steps. 1) For the kinetic energy all effects of exchange and correlation are shown to be unique functions of position $\bf{r}$; all issues of non-uniqueness involve only the density $n(\bf{r})$ and are equivalent to an effective single-particle problem with wavefunction $s(\bf{r}) = \sqrt{n(\bf{r})/N}$. 2) Interactions can be considered as potentials acting on particles or interaction fields, e.g., the Maxwell form in terms of electric fields. In each case, there is a mean field part that is a function of the density and a part due to correlation that is uniquely defined. 3) The final results follow from the nature of energy and stress. Because the energy determines the ground state itself through the variational principle, the kinetic energy must involve $-\frac{1}{2}s\nabla^2 s$ and interactions in terms of potentials. This leads to density functional theory interpreted as energy density $e(\bf{r})$ equilibrated to minimize fluctuations with the same chemical potential at all points $\bf{r}$. However, stress is related to forces, and the only acceptable expressions for the stress field involve the combination $\frac{1}{2}[s\nabla^2 s - |\nabla s|^2]$, and Coulomb interactions in terms of electric fields. Together these results lead to well-defined formulations of energy density and stress fields that are physically motivated and based on a clear set of arguments.</description>

      <title>Giant Response and Harmonic Generation in N\'eel-Torque Antiferromagnetic Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22974v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the resonant and higher order magnetic responses of a collinear antiferromagnet induced by N\'eel spin-orbit torques (NSOTs). By deriving the dynamical susceptibilities up to the third harmonic, we find remarkable NSOT-induced amplifications of the linear and nonlinear magnetic dynamics by orders of magnitude compared to conventional spin-orbit torques, enabling highly-efficient frequency conversion in the terahertz frequency range. From the effective dynamics, we uncover the strong coupling between the N\'eel vector and the driving field of NSOTs, providing a physical explanation of the gigantic responses at all orders. We then propose a multilayer antiferromagnetic nano-device leveraging the gigantic harmonic generation to achieve unprecedented frequency amplifiers and converters. Our work uncovers a previously overlooked role of the NSOTs in nonlinear dynamics.</description>

      <title>Euler-Heisenberg action for fermions coupled to gauge and axial vectors: Hessian diagonalization, sector classification, and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02118v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the closed-form one-loop Euler--Heisenberg effective actions for Dirac fermions coupled simultaneously to classical electromagnetic vector and massive pseudo-vector backgrounds within a controlled quasi-static approximation. Through complete diagonalization of the functional Hessian, we systematically delineate the parameter space into distinct sectors characterized by stability properties and spectral structure. We identify subspaces that encompass and extend results from previous studies into a broader class, admitting propagating axial fields as physically viable regimes; strikingly, we note a sector presenting chirality-asymmetric instability. This addresses long-standing questions regarding the well-defined nature, diagonalizability, and stability of the model. From the effective action, we derive novel nonperturbative pair-production rates for simultaneously propagating electromagnetic and axial vector backgrounds; remarkably, we find pronounced vacuum stabilization compared to previous results. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this framework allows for a unified derivation of the chiral anomaly structures in the general case and show that the electromagnetic coupling induces instanton-like configurations for the axial field, even when it is not a fundamental gauge field. As a proof-of-concept, we analyze a cosmological toy model of baryogenesis driven by an axial vector, providing numerical estimates that support the viability of this hypothesis. Additionally, we outline qualitative predictions for Weyl/Dirac semi-metals and briefly discuss potential applications in related phenomena, such as the Strong-CP problem.</description>
