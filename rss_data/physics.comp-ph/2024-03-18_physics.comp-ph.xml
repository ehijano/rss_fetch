      <title>Solving deep-learning density functional theory via variational autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, machine learning models, chiefly deep neural networks, have revealed suited to learn accurate energy-density functionals from data. However, problematic instabilities have been shown to occur in the search of ground-state density profiles via energy minimization. Indeed, any small noise can lead astray from realistic profiles, causing the failure of the learned functional and, hence, strong violations of the variational property. In this article, we employ variational autoencoders to build a compressed, flexible, and regular representation of the ground-state density profiles of various quantum models. Performing energy minimization in this compressed space allows us to avoid both numerical instabilities and variational biases due to excessive constraints. Our tests are performed on one-dimensional single-particle models from the literature in the field and, notably, on a three-dimensional disordered potential. In all cases, the ground-state energies are estimated with errors below the chemical accuracy and the density profiles are accurately reproduced without numerical artifacts.</description>

      <title>Topology optimization of blazed gratings under conical incidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A topology optimization method is presented and applied to a blazed diffraction grating in reflection under conical incidence. This type of gratings is meant to disperse the incident light on one particular diffraction order and this property is fundamental in spectroscopy. Conventionally, a blazed metallic grating is made of a sawtooth profile designed to work with the +/-1st diffraction order in reflection. In this paper, we question this intuitive triangular pattern and look for optimal opto-geometric characteristics using topology optimization based on Finite Element modelling of Maxwell's equations. In practical contexts, the grating geometry is mono-periodic but it is enlightened by a 3D plane wave with a wavevector outside of the plane of invariance. Consequently, this study deals with the resolution of a direct and inverse problem using the Finite Element Method in this intermediate state between 2D and 3D: the so-called conical incidence. A multi-wavelength objective is used in order to obtain a broadband blazed effect. Finally, several numerical experiments are detailed. The results show that it is possible to reach a 98% diffraction efficiency on the -1st diffraction order if the optimization is performed on a single wavelength, and that the reflection integrated over the [400,1500]nm wavelength range can be 29% higher in absolute, 56% in relative, than that of the sawtooth blazed grating when using a multi-wavelength optimization criterion (from 52% to 81%).</description>

      <title>Model free collision aggregation for the computation of escape distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by a heat radiative transport equation, we consider a particle undergoing collisions in a space-time domain and propose a method to sample its escape time, space and direction from the domain. The first step of the procedure is an estimation of how many elementary collisions is safe to take before chances of exiting the domain are too high; then these collisions are aggregated into a single movement. The method does not use any model nor any particular regime of parameters. We give theoretical results both under the normal approximation and without it and test the method on some benchmarks from the literature. The results confirm the theoretical predictions and show that the proposal is an efficient method to sample the escape distribution of the particle.</description>

      <title>The Role of Interfacial Morphology in Cu2O/TiO2 and Band Bending: Insights from Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photocatalysis, a promising solution for environmental challenges, relies on the generation and utilization of photogenerated charge carriers within photocatalysts. However, recombination of these carriers often limits efficiency. Heterostructures, especially Cu2O/TiO2, have emerged as effective solutions to enhance charge separation. This study systematically explores the effect of interfacial morphologies on the band bending within Cu2O/TiO2 anatase heterostructures, employing density functional theory (DFT). Through this study, eight distinct interfaces are identified and analyzed, revealing a consistent staggered-type band alignment. Despite variations in band edge positions, a systematic charge transfer from Cu2O to TiO2 is observed across all interfaces. The proposed band bending configurations would suggest enhanced charge separation and photocatalytic activity under ultraviolet illumination due to a Z-scheme configuration. This theoretical investigation provides valuable insights into the interplay between interfacial morphology, band bending, and charge transfer, for advancing the understanding of fundamental electronic mechanisms in heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Synthesizing impurity clustering in the edge plasma of tokamaks using neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the behavior of impurities in edge plasma of tokamaks using high-resolution numerical simulations based on Hasegawa--Wakatani equations. Specifically, it focuses on the behavior of inertial particles, which has not been extensively studied in the field of plasma physics. Our simulations utilize one-way coupling of a large number of inertial point particles, which model plasma impurities. We observe that with Stokes number ($St$) which characterizes the inertia of particles being much less than one, such light impurities closely track the fluid flow without pronounced clustering. For intermediate $St$ values, distinct clustering appears, with larger Stokes values, {\it i.e.} heavy impurities even generating more substantial clusters. When $St$ is significantly large, very heavy impurities tend to detach from the flow and maintain their trajectory, resulting in fewer observable clusters and corresponding to random motion. A core component of this work involves machine learning techniques. Applying three different neural networks - Autoencoder, U-Net, and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) - to synthesize preferential concentration fields of impurities, we use vorticity as input and predict impurity number density fields. GAN outperforms the two others by aligning closely with direct numerical simulation data in terms of probability density functions of the particle distribution and energy spectra. This machine learning technique holds the potential to reduce computational costs by eliminating the need to track millions of particles modeling impurities in simulations.</description>

      <title>MADAS -- A Python framework for assessing similarity in materials-science data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computational materials science produces large quantities of data, both in terms of high-throughput calculations and individual studies. Extracting knowledge from this large and heterogeneous pool of data is challenging due to the wide variety of computational methods and approximations, resulting in significant veracity in the sheer amount of available data. Here, we present MADAS, a Python framework for computing similarity relations between material properties. It can be used to automate the download of data from various sources, compute descriptors and similarities between materials, analyze the relationship between materials through their properties, and can incorporate a variety of existing machine learning methods. We explain the design of the package and demonstrate its power with representative examples.</description>

      <title>Neural Networks as Effective Surrogate Models of Radio-Frequency Quadrupole Particle Accelerator Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.11451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radio-Frequency Quadrupoles (RFQs) are multi-purpose linear particle accelerators that simultaneously bunch and accelerate charged particle beams. They are ubiquitous in accelerator physics, especially as injectors to higher-energy machines, owing to their impressive efficiency. The design and optimization of these devices can be lengthy due to the need to repeatedly perform high-fidelity simulations. Several recent papers have demonstrated that machine learning can be used to build surrogate models (fast-executing replacements of computationally costly beam simulations) for order-of-magnitude computing time speedups. However, while these pilot studies are encouraging, there is room to improve their predictive accuracy. Particularly, beam summary statistics such as emittances (an important figure of merit in particle accelerator physics) have historically been challenging to predict. For the first time, we present a surrogate model trained on 200,000 samples that yields &lt;6% mean average percent error for the predictions of all relevant beam output parameters, solving the problem of poor emittance predictions by identifying and including hidden variables which were not accounted for previously. These surrogate models were made possible by using the Julia language and GPU computing; we briefly discuss both. We demonstrate the utility of surrogate modeling by performing a multi-objective optimization using our best model as a callback in the objective function to select an optimal RFQ design. We consider trade-offs in RFQ performance for various choices of Pareto-optimal design variables: common issues for any multi-objective optimization scheme. Lastly, we make recommendations for input data preparation, selection, and neural network architectures that pave the way for future development of production-capable surrogate models for RFQs and other particle accelerators.</description>

      <title>Accelerating fourth-generation machine learning potentials by quasi-linear scaling particle mesh charge equilibration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning potentials (MLP) have revolutionized the field of atomistic simulations by describing the atomic interactions with the accuracy of electronic structure methods at a small fraction of the costs. Most current MLPs construct the energy of a system as a sum of atomic energies, which depend on information about the atomic environments provided in form of predefined or learnable feature vectors. If, in addition, non-local phenomena like long-range charge transfer are important, fourth-generation MLPs need to be used, which include a charge equilibration (Qeq) step to take the global structure of the system into account. This Qeq can significantly increase the computational cost and thus can become the computational bottleneck for large systems. In this paper we present a highly efficient formulation of Qeq that does not require the explicit computation of the Coulomb matrix elements resulting in a quasi-linearly scaling method. Moreover, our approach also allows for the efficient calculation of energy derivatives, which explicitly consider the global structure-dependence of the atomic charges as obtained from Qeq. Due to its generality, the method is not restricted to MLPs but can also be applied within a variety of other force fields.</description>

      <title>An unstructured finite-volume level set / front tracking method for two-phase flows with large density-ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.01595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.01595v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the unstructured LEvel set / froNT tracking (LENT) method for handling two-phase flows with strongly different densities (high-density ratios) by providing the theoretical basis for the numerical consistency between the mass and momentum conservation in the collocated Finite Volume discretization of the single-field two-phase Navier-Stokes equations. Our analysis provides the theoretical basis for the mass conservation equation introduced by Ghods and Herrmann [3] and used in [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. We use a mass flux that is consistent with mass conservation in the implicit Finite Volume discretization of the two-phase momentum convection term, and solve the single-field Navier-Stokes equations with our SAAMPLE segregated solution algorithm [2]. The proposed $\rho$LENT method recovers exact numerical stability for the two-phase momentum advection of a spherical droplet with density ratios ranging in $[1, 10^4]$. Numerical stability is demonstrated for in terms of the relative $L_\infty$ velocity error norm, for density-ratios in the range of $[1, 10^4]$, dynamic viscosity-ratios in the range of $[1, 10^4]$ and very strong surface tension forces, for challenging mercury/air and water/air fluid pairings. In addition, the solver performs well in cases characterized by strong interaction between two phases, i.e., oscillating droplets and rising bubbles. The proposed $\rho$LENT method is applicable to any other two-phase flow simulation method that discretizes the single-field two-phase Navier-Stokes Equations using the collocated unstructured Finite Volume Method but does not solve an advection equation for the phase indicator using a flux-based approach, by adding the proposed geometrical approximation of the mass flux and the auxiliary mass conservation equation to the solution algorithm.</description>

      <title>Equivariant graph neural network interatomic potential for Green-Kubo thermal conductivity in phase change materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermal conductivity is a fundamental material property that plays an essential role in technology, but its accurate evaluation presents a challenge for theory. In this work, we demonstrate the application of $E(3)$-equivariant neutral network interatomic potentials within Green-Kubo formalism to determine the lattice thermal conductivity in amorphous and crystalline materials. We apply this method to study the thermal conductivity of germanium telluride (GeTe) as a prototypical phase change material. A single deep learning interatomic potential is able to describe the phase transitions between the amorphous, rhombohedral and cubic phases, with critical temperatures in good agreement with experiments. Furthermore, this approach accurately captures the pronounced anharmonicity that is present in GeTe, enabling precise calculations of the thermal conductivity. In contrast, the Boltzmann transport equation including only three-phonon processes tends to overestimate the thermal conductivity by approximately a factor of 2 in the crystalline phases.</description>

      <title>Challenges of variational quantum optimization with measurement shot noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00044v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum enhanced optimization of classical cost functions is a central theme of quantum computing due to its high potential value in science and technology. The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) are popular variational approaches that are considered the most viable solutions in the noisy-intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) era. Here, we study the scaling of the quantum resources, defined as the required number of circuit repetitions, to reach a fixed success probability as the problem size increases, focusing on the role played by measurement shot noise, which is unavoidable in realistic implementations. Simple and reproducible problem instances are addressed, namely, the ferromagnetic and disordered Ising chains. Our results show that: (i) VQE with the standard heuristic ansatz scales comparably to direct brute-force search when energy-based optimizers are employed. The performance improves at most quadratically using a gradient-based optimizer. (ii) When the parameters are optimized from random guesses, also the scaling of QAOA implies problematically long absolute runtimes for large problem sizes. (iii) QAOA becomes practical when supplemented with a physically-inspired initialization of the parameters. Our results suggest that hybrid quantum-classical algorithms should possibly avoid a brute force classical outer loop, but focus on smart parameters initialization.</description>

Abstract: Ultrathin bismuth exhibits rich physics including strong spin-orbit coupling, ferroelectricity, nontrivial topology, and light-induced structural dynamics. We use \textit{ab initio} calculations to show that light can induce structural transitions to four transient phases in bismuth monolayers. These light-induced phases exhibit nontrivial topological character, which we illustrate using the recently introduced concept of spin bands and spin-resolved Wilson loops. Specifically, we find that the topology changes via the closing of the electron and spin band gaps during photo-induced structural phase transitions, leading to distinct edge states. Our study provides strategies to tailor electronic and spin topology via ultrafast control of photo-excited carriers and associated structural dynamics.</description>

      <title>Lattice Boltzmann simulation of deformable fluid-filled bodies: progress and perspectives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid development of studies involving droplet microfluidics, drug delivery, cell detection, and microparticle synthesis, among others, many scientists have invested significant efforts to model the flow of these fluid-filled bodies. Motivated by the intricate coupling between hydrodynamics and the interactions of fluid-filled bodies, several methods have been developed. The objective of this review is to present a compact foundation of the methods used in the literature in the context of lattice Boltzmann methods. For hydrodynamics, we focus on the lattice-Boltzmann method due to its specific ability to treat time and spatial-dependent boundary conditions and to incorporate new physical models in a computationally efficient way. We split the existing methods into two groups with regard to the interfacial boundary: fluid-structure and fluid-fluid methods. The fluid-structure methods are characterised by the coupling between fluid dynamics and mechanics of the flowing body, often used in applications involving membranes and similar flexible solid boundaries. We further divide fluid-structure-based methods into two subcategories, those which treat the fluid-structure boundary as a continuum medium and those that treat it as a discrete collection of individual springs and particles. Next, we discuss the fluid-fluid methods, particularly useful for the simulations of fluid-fluid interfaces. We focus on models for immiscible droplets and their interaction in a suspending fluid and describe benchmark tests to validate the models for fluid-filled bodies.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel method for identifying transients suitable for both strong signal-dominated and background-dominated objects. By employing the unsupervised machine learning algorithm known as expectation maximization, we achieve computing time reductions of over $10^4$ on a single CPU compared to conventional brute-force methods. Furthermore, this approach can be readily extended to analyze multiple flares. We illustrate the algorithm's application by fitting the IceCube neutrino flare of TXS 0506+056.</description>

Abstract: Refractory high-entropy alloys are under consideration for applications where materials are subjected to high temperatures and levels of radiation, such as in the fusion power sector. However, at present, their scope is limited because they are highly brittle at room temperature. One suggested route to mitigate this issue is by alloying with Ti. In this theoretical study, using a computationally efficient linear-response theory based on density functional theory calculations of the electronic structure of the disordered alloys, we study the nature of atomic short-range order in these multi-component materials, as well as assessing their overall phase stability. Our analysis enables direct inference of phase transitions in addition to the extraction of an atomistic, pairwise model of the internal energy of an alloy suitable for study via, e.g. Monte Carlo simulations. Once Ti is added into either the NbMoTaW or VNbMoTaW system, we find that there is competition between chemical phase ordering and segregation. These results shed light on observed chemical inhomogeneity in experimental samples, as well as providing fundamental insight into the physics of these complex systems.</description>
