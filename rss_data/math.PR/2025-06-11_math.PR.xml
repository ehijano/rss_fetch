      <title>Stochastic dissipative systems in Banach spaces driven by L\'evy noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we are interested in the well-posedness of stochastic reaction diffusion equations like \begin{equation} \begin{cases} dX(t)(\xi)=\big(\Delta_\xi X(t)(\xi)-p(X(t)(\xi))\big)dt+RdW(t)+dL(t) , \quad t\in [0,T];\\ X(0)=x\in L^2(\mathcal{O}) \end{cases} \end{equation} where $\mathcal{O}$ is a bounded open domain of $\mathbb{R}^d$ with regular boundary, $d\in\mathbb{N}$, $p:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ is a polynomial of odd degree with positive leading coefficient, $R$ is a linear bounded operator on $L^2(\mathcal{O})$, $\{W(t)\}_{t\geq 0}$ is a $L^2(\mathcal{O})$-cylindrical Wiener process, $\{L(t)\}_{t\geq 0}$ is a pure-jump L\'evy process on $L^2(\mathcal{O})$. We complement the equation with suitable boundary conditions on $\partial \mathcal{O}.$ Some papers in literature analize existence and uniqueness of mild solutions for every $x\in L^p(\mathcal{O})$, for some suitable $p\geq 2$. The results of this paper allow to study reaction diffusion equations also on the space of continuous function $C(\overline{O})$. This seems to be new in the L\'evy case (it is already done in the Wiener case).\\ We also discuss and review the previous cited works with the aim of unifying the different frameworks. We underline that when $R=0$ for every $x\in C(\overline{O})$ (or $x\in L^p(\mathcal{O})$) the mild solution to the equation has a c\`adl\`ag modifications in $C(\overline{O})$ (or $\in L^p(\mathcal{O})$), even if $\{L(t)\}_{t \geq 0}$ is not a L\'evy process taking values in $C(\overline{O})$ (or $\in L^p(\mathcal{O})$). This phenomenon for the linear problem (i.e., $F\equiv 0$ in the SPDE) has been investigated in other papers.</description>

      <title>The stochastic heat inclusion with fractional time driven by time-space Brownian and L\'evy white noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a time-fractional stochastic heat inclusion driven by additive time-space Brownian and L\'evy white noise. The fractional time derivative is interpreted as the Caputo derivative of order $\alpha \in (0,2).$ We show the following: \\ a) If a solution exists, then it is a fixed point of a specific set-valued map.\\ b) Conversely, any fixed point of this map is a solution of the heat inclusion.\\ c) Finally, we show that there is at least one fixed point of this map, thereby proving that there is at least one solution of the time-fractional stochastic heat inclusion.
  A solution $Y(t,x)$ is called \emph{mild} if $\E[Y^2(t,x)] &lt; \infty$ for all $t,x$. We show that the solution is mild if\\ $\alpha=1$ \&amp; $d=1,$ \ or \ $\alpha \geq 1$ \&amp; $d\in \{1,2\}$.
  On the other hand, if $\alpha &lt; 1$ we show that the solution is not mild for any space dimension $d$.</description>

      <title>The Law of Large Numbers and CLT for Non-stationary Markov Jump Processes Exhibiting Time-of-Day Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a general law of large numbers and central limit theorem for finite state Markov jump processes with non-stationary transition rates. Such models commonly arise in service operations and manufacturing applications in which time-of-day, day-of-week, and secular effects are of first order importance in predicting system behavior. Our theorems allow for non-stationary reward environments that continuously accumulate reward, while including contributions from non-stationary lump-sum rewards of random size that are collected at jump times of the underlying process, jump times of a Poisson process modulated by the underlying process, or scheduled deterministic times. As part of our development, we also obtain a new central limit theorem for the special case in which the jump process and reward structure is periodic (as may occur over a weekly time interval), as well as for jump process models with resetting.</description>

      <title>Large Deviations for Markovian Graphon Processes and Associated Dynamical Systems on Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider temporal models of rapidly changing Markovian networks modulated by time-evolving spatially dependent kernels that define rates for edge formation and dissolution. Alternatively, these can be viewed as Markovian networks with $O(1)$ jump rates viewed over a long time horizon. In the regimes we consider, the window averages of graphon valued processes over suitable time intervals are natural state descriptors for the system. Under appropriate conditions on the jump-rate kernels, we establish laws of large numbers and large deviation principles(LDP) for the graphon processes averaged over a suitable time window, both in the weak topology and with respect to the cut norm in the associated graphon space. Although the problem setting and analysis are more involved than for the well-studied static random network model, the variational problem associated with the rate function admits an explicit solution, yielding an equally tractable, though different, expression for the rate function, similar to the static case. Using these results, we then establish the LDP for node-valent dynamical systems driven by the underlying evolving network.</description>

      <title>Markovian multivariate Hawkes population processes: Efficient evaluation of moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide probabilistic and computational results on Markovian multivariate Hawkes processes and induced population processes. By applying the Markov property, we characterize in closed form a joint transform, bijective to the probability distribution, of the population process and its underlying intensity process. We demonstrate a method that exploits the transform to obtain analytic expressions for transient and stationary multivariate moments of any order, as well as auto- and cross-covariances. We reveal a nested sequence of block matrices that yields the moments in explicit form and brings important computational advantages. We also establish the asymptotic behavior of the intensity of the multivariate Hawkes process in its nearly unstable regime, under a specific parameterization. In extensive numerical experiments, we analyze the computational complexity, accuracy and efficiency of the established results.</description>

      <title>First to reach $n$ game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a game with two players, consisting of a number of rounds, where the first player to win $n$ rounds becomes the overall winner. Who wins each individual round is governed by a certain urn having two types of balls (type 1 and type 2). At each round, we randomly pick a ball from the urn, and its type determines which of the two players wins. We study the game under three regimes. In the first and the third regimes, a ball is taken without replacement, whilst in the second regime, it is returned to the urn with one more ball of the same colour. We study the properties of the random variables equal to the properly defined overall net profits of the players, and the results are drastically different in all three regimes.</description>

      <title>On Limiting Probability Distributions of Higher Order Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The limiting (or stationary) probability distribution is one of the key characteristics of a Markov chain since it shows its long-term behavior. In this paper, for a higher order Markov chain, we establish a sufficient condition for the existence of its limiting probability distribution. This condition is built upon the regularity of its transition tensor. Our results extend the corresponding conclusions for first order chains. Besides, they complement the existing results concerning higher order chains that rely on approximation schemes or two-phase power iterations.</description>

      <title>Critical points of random polynomials and finite free cumulants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A result of Hoskins and Steinerberger [Int. Math. Res. Not., (13):9784-9809, 2022] states that repeatedly differentiating a random polynomials with independent and identically distributed mean zero and variance one roots will result, after an appropriate rescaling, in a Hermite polynomial. We use the theory of finite free probability to extend this result in two natural directions: (1) We prove central limit theorems for the fluctuations around these deterministic limits for the polynomials and their roots. (2) We consider a generalized version of the Hoskins and Steinerberger result by removing the finite second moment assumption from the roots. In this case the Hermite polynomials are replaced by a random Appell sequence conveniently described through finite free probability and an infinitely divisible distribution. We use finite free cumulants to provide compact proofs of our main results with little prerequisite knowledge of free probability required.</description>

      <title>Invertible Complex Measures on Euclidean Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1971 Taylor characterised all complex measures on $\mathbb{R}$ that are invertible with respect to convolution as those which can be written in the form $\delta_\gamma \ast \sigma^{\ast m} \ast \exp(\nu)$ for some $\gamma\in \mathbb{R}$, some complex measure $\nu$, some $m\in \mathbb{Z}$ and a given fixed invertible finite signed measure $\sigma$ (which has characteristic function $\mathbb{R} \ni z \mapsto (1+i z)/(1-i z)$). We extend Taylor's result to complex measures on $\mathbb{R}^n$. Somewhat surprisingly, the structure of invertible complex measures on $\mathbb{R}^n$ is not much more complicated than that of complex measures on $\mathbb{R}$, in the sense that they can be represented as $\delta_\gamma \ast \sigma_1^{\ast m_1} \ast \ldots \ast \sigma_p^{\ast m_p} \ast \exp(\nu)$ for some $\gamma \in \mathbb{R}^n$, some complex measure $\nu$ and $m_1,\ldots, m_p\in \mathbb{Z}$, where the $\sigma_i$ correspond to $\sigma$ in the one-dimensional case and actually live on $1$-dimensional subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^n$. Our proof relies on a general result of Taylor for invertible complex measures on locally compact abelian groups. To apply Taylor's result, we extend some existing results for $\mathbb{C}$-valued functions to functions with values in a semisimple commutative unital Banach algebra with connected Gelfand space. The study of invertible complex measures on $\mathbb{R}^n$ has some impact on the theory of quasi-infinitely divisible probability distributions on $\mathbb{R}^n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic behaviour of the Implied Volatility in the Bachelier setting, extending the framework introduced by Benaim and Friz for the Black-Scholes setting. Exploiting the theory of regular variation, we derive explicit expressions for the Bachelier Implied Volatility in the wings of the smile, linking these to the tail behaviour of the underlying's returns' distribution. Furthermore, we establish a direct connection between the analyticity strip of the returns' characteristic function and the asymptotic formula for the Implied Volatility smile at extreme moneyness.</description>

      <title>The Kirkwood closure point process: A solution of the Kirkwood-Salsburg equations for negative activities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kirkwood superposition is a well-known tool in statistical physics to approximate the $n$-point correlation functions for $n\geq 3$ in terms of the density $\rho $ and the radial distribution function $g$ of the underlying system. However, it is unclear whether these approximations are themselves the correlation functions of some point process. If they are, this process is called the Kirkwood closure process. For the case that $g$ is the negative exponential of some nonnegative and regular pair potential $u$ existence of the the Kirkwood closure process was proved by Ambartzumian and Sukiasian. This result was generalized to the case that $u$ is a locally stable and regular pair potential by Kuna, Lebowitz and Speer, provided that $\rho$ is sufficiently small. In this work, it is shown that it suffices for $u$ to be stable and regular to ensure the existence of the Kirkwood closure process. Furthermore, for locally stable $u$ it is proved that the Kirkwood closure process is Gibbs and that the kernel of the GNZ-equation satisfies a Kirkwood-Salsburg type equation.</description>

      <title>Private Evolution Converges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Private Evolution (PE) is a promising training-free method for differentially private (DP) synthetic data generation. While it achieves strong performance in some domains (e.g., images and text), its behavior in others (e.g., tabular data) is less consistent. To date, the only theoretical analysis of the convergence of PE depends on unrealistic assumptions about both the algorithm's behavior and the structure of the sensitive dataset. In this work, we develop a new theoretical framework to explain PE's practical behavior and identify sufficient conditions for its convergence. For $d$-dimensional sensitive datasets with $n$ data points from a bounded domain, we prove that PE produces an $(\epsilon, \delta)$-DP synthetic dataset with expected 1-Wasserstein distance of order $\tilde{O}(d(n\epsilon)^{-1/d})$ from the original, establishing worst-case convergence of the algorithm as $n \to \infty$. Our analysis extends to general Banach spaces as well. We also connect PE to the Private Signed Measure Mechanism, a method for DP synthetic data generation that has thus far not seen much practical adoption. We demonstrate the practical relevance of our theoretical findings in simulations.</description>

      <title>Multiversion of the Hausdorff--Young inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a family of jointly Gaussian random vectors $\xi_j \in \mathbb{R}^{k_j}$, each standard normal but possibly correlated, and investigate when\[ \mathbb{E}\, F\!\Bigl(B\bigl(|T_{z_1} f_1(\xi_1)|,\dots,|T_{z_n} f_n(\xi_n)|\bigr)\Bigr) \;\;\le\;\; F\!\Bigl(\,\mathbb{E}\,B\bigl(|f_1(\xi_1)|,\dots,|f_n(\xi_n)|\bigr)\Bigr) \] holds, where $T_{z}$ is either a Mehler transform $(z \in \mathbb{C})$ or a noise operator $(z \in \mathbb{R})$. This framework unifies and extends real and complex hypercontractivity to multi-function settings, yielding multiversions of the sharp Hausdorff--Young inequality, the log-Sobolev inequality, and a noisy Gaussian--Jensen inequality. Applications include a new covariance-based characterization of the Brascamp--Lieb inequality in the presence of noise.</description>

      <title>Transforming the Erd\H{o}s-Kac theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transforming the Erd\H{o}s-Kac theorem provides more flexibility in how the theorem can be utilized as an interval estimate for the prime omega function, which counts the number of distinct prime divisors. Here, we consider a direct transformation by the delta method. Then, we demonstrate that the square-root and three-quarters power asymptotically achieve variance stabilization and an optimal width, respectively. Furthermore, by adjusting the denominator of the theorem, we derive the score interval estimate. To make these interval estimates reliable for small positive integers, we examine performances of various interval estimates for the prime omega function using fuzzy coverage probabilities. The results indicate that the score interval estimate performs well even for small positive integers after training the mean and standard deviation using the prime omega function. Moreover, the Poisson interval estimate is relatively reliable with or without training. Additional theoretical results on the Erd\H{o}s-Pomerance theorem are also provided.</description>

      <title>Compositional Reasoning for Parametric Probabilistic Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish an assume-guarantee (AG) framework for compositional reasoning about multi-objective queries in parametric probabilistic automata (pPA) - an extension to probabilistic automata (PA), where transition probabilities are functions over a finite set of parameters. We lift an existing framework for PA to the pPA setting, incorporating asymmetric, circular, and interleaving proof rules. Our approach enables the verification of a broad spectrum of multi-objective queries for pPA, encompassing probabilistic properties and (parametric) expected total rewards. Additionally, we introduce a rule for reasoning about monotonicity in composed pPAs.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein and Convex Gaussian Approximations for Non-stationary Time Series of Diverging Dimensionality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In high-dimensional time series analysis, Gaussian approximation (GA) schemes under various distance measures or on various collections of subsets of the Euclidean space play a fundamental role in a wide range of statistical inference problems. To date, most GA results for high-dimensional time series are established on hyper-rectangles and their equivalence. In this paper, by considering the 2-Wasserstein distance and the collection of all convex sets, we establish a general GA theory for a broad class of high-dimensional non-stationary (HDNS) time series, extending the scope of problems that can be addressed in HDNS time series analysis. For HDNS time series of sufficiently weak dependence and light tail, the GA rates established in this paper are either nearly optimal with respect to the dimensionality and time series length, or they are nearly identical to the corresponding best-known GA rates established for independent data. A multiplier bootstrap procedure is utilized and theoretically justified to implement our GA theory. We demonstrate by two previously undiscussed time series applications the use of the GA theory and the bootstrap procedure as unified tools for a wide range of statistical inference problems in HDNS time series analysis.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic error distribution for stochastic Runge--Kutta methods of strong order one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work gives the asymptotic error distribution of the stochastic Runge--Kutta (SRK) method of strong order $1$ applied to Stratonovich-type stochastic differential equations. For dealing with the implicitness introduced in the diffusion term, we provide a framework to derive the asymptotic error distribution of diffusion-implicit or fully implicit numerical methods, which enables us to construct a fully explicit numerical method sharing the same asymptotic error distribution as the SRK method. Further, we show for the multiplicative noise that the limit distribution $U(T)$ satisfies $\mathbf E|U(T)|^2\le e^{L_1T}(1+\eta_1)T^3$ for some $\eta_1$ only depending on the coefficients of the SRK method. Thus, we infer that $\eta_1$ is the key parameter reflecting the growth rate of the mean-square error of the SRK method. Especially, among the SRK methods of strong order $1$, those of weak order $2$ ($\eta_1=0$) share the unified asymptotic error distribution and have the smallest mean-square errors after a long time. This property is also found for the case of additive noise. It seems that we are the first to give the asymptotic error distribution of fully implicit numerical methods for SDEs.</description>

Abstract: We completely classify the atomic summands in a graph product $(M,\varphi) = *_{v \in \mathcal{G}} (M_v,\varphi_v)$ of von Neumann algebras with faithful normal states. Each type I factor summand $(N,\psi)$ is a tensor product of type I factor summands $(N_v,\psi_v)$ in the individual algebras. The existence of such a summand and its weight in the direct sum can be determined from the $(N_v,\psi_v)$'s using explicit polynomials associated to the graph.</description>

Abstract: We study the limit in low intensity of Poisson--Voronoi tessellations in hyperbolic spaces $ \mathbb{H}_{d}$ for $d \geq 2$. In contrast to the Euclidean setting, a limiting nontrivial ideal tessellation $ \mathcal{V}_{d}$ appears as the intensity tends to $0$. The tessellation $ \mathcal{V}_{d}$ is a natural, isometry-invariant decomposition of $ \mathbb{H}_{d}$ into countably many unbounded polytopes, each with a unique end. We study its basic properties, in particular, the geometric features of its cells.</description>

Abstract: We give theorems about asymptotic normality of general additive functionals on patricia tries in an i.i.d. setting, derived from results on tries by Janson (2022). These theorems are applied to show asymptotic normality of the distribution of random fringe trees in patricia tries. Formulas for asymptotic mean and variance are given. The proportion of fringe trees with $k$ keys is asymptotically, ignoring oscillations, given by $(1-\rho(k))/(H+J)k(k-1)$ with the source entropy $H$, an entropy-like constant $J$, that is $H$ in the binary case, and an exponentially decreasing function $\rho(k)$. Another application gives asymptotic normality of the independence number.</description>

      <title>On antiferromagnetic regimes in the Ashkin-Teller model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06266v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Ashkin-Teller model can be represented by a pair $(\tau,\tau')$ of Ising spin configurations with coupling constants $J$ and $J'$ for each, and $U$ for their product. We study this representation on the integer lattice $\mathbb{Z}^d$ for $d\geq 2$. We confirm the presence of a partial antiferromagnetic phase in the isotropic case ($J=J'$) when $-U&gt;0$ is sufficiently large and $J=J'&gt;0$ is sufficiently small, by means of a graphical representation. In this phase, $\tau$ is disordered, admitting exponential decay of correlations, while the product $\tau\tau'$ is antiferromagnetically ordered, which is to say that correlations are bounded away from zero but alternate in sign. No correlation inequalities are available in this part of the phase diagram. In the planar case $d=2$, we construct a coupling with the six-vertex model and show, in analogy to the first result, that the corresponding height function is localised, although with antiferromagnetically ordered heights on one class of vertices of the graph.
  We then return to $d\geq 2$ and consider a part of the phase diagram where $U&lt;0$ but where correlation inequalities still apply. Using the OSSS inequality, we proceed to establish a subcritical sharpness statement along suitable curves covering this part, circumventing the difficulty of the lack of general monotonicity properties in the parameters. We then address the isotropic case and provide indications of monotonicity.</description>

      <title>Small maximal clusters are very unlikely in critical random graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12451v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a probabilistic methodology, based on random walk estimates, to obtain exponential upper bounds for the probability of observing unusually small maximal components in two classical (near-)critical random graph models. More specifically, we analyse the near-critical Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi model $\mathbb{G}(n,p)$ and the random graph $\mathbb{G}(n,d,p)$ obtained by performing near-critical $p$-bond percolation on a simple random $d$-regular graph and show that, for each one of these models, the probability that the size of a largest component is smaller than $n^{2/3}/A$ is at most of order $\exp(-A^{3/2})$. The exponent $3/2$ is known to be optimal for the near-critical $\mathbb{G}(n,p)$ random graph, whereas for the near-critical $\mathbb{G}(n,d,p)$ model the best known upper bound for the above probability was of order $A^{-3/5}$. As a secondary result we show, by means of an optimized version of the martingale method of Nachmias and Peres, that the above probability of observing an unusually small maximal component is at most of order $\exp(-A^{3/5})$ in other two critical models, namely a random intersection graph and the quantum random graph; this stretched-exponential bounds also improve upon the known (polynomial) bounds available for these other two critical models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effect of curvature on the Parabolic Anderson model by posing it over a Cartan-Hadamard manifold. We first construct a family of noises white in time and colored in space parameterized by a regularity parameter $\alpha$, which we use to explore regularity requirements for well-posedness. Then, we show that conditions on the heat kernel imply an exponential in time upper bound for the moments of the solution, and a lower bound for sectional curvature imply a corresponding lower bound. These results hold if the noise is strong enough, where the needed strength of the noise is affected by sectional curvature.</description>

Abstract: Let A be an n*n symmetric random matrix with independent, non-constant subgaussian entries (not necessarily identically distributed). In this paper, we introduce a distance theorem. Building on this theorem, we analyze the eigenvalues of A to derive probability inequalities for the eigenvalue gaps of A. Moreover, we determine the probability for the smallest singular value of a submatrix of A. This enables us to obtain the probability of delocalization of the eigenvectors of A.</description>

      <title>On the localization length of finite-volume random block Schr\"odinger operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a general class of random block Schr\"odinger operators (RBSOs) in dimensions 1 and 2, which naturally extend the Anderson model by replacing the random potential with a random block potential. Specifically, we focus on two RBSOs -- the block Anderson and Wegner orbital models -- defined on the $d$-dimensional torus $(\mathbb Z/L\mathbb Z)^d$. They take the form $H=V + \lambda \Psi$, where $V$ is a block potential with i.i.d. $W^d\times W^d$ Gaussian diagonal blocks, $\Psi$ describes interactions between neighboring blocks, and $\lambda&gt;0$ is a coupling parameter. We normalize the blocks of $\Psi$ so that each block has a Hilbert-Schmidt norm of the same order as the blocks of $V$. Assuming $W\ge L^\delta$ for a small constant $\delta&gt;0$ and $\lambda\gg W^{-d/2}$, we establish the following results. In dimension $d=2$, we prove delocalization and quantum unique ergodicity for bulk eigenvectors. Combined with the localization result from arXiv:1608.02922, which holds under the condition $\lambda\ll W^{-d/2}$, this provides a rigorous proof of the Anderson localization-delocalization transition as $\lambda$ crosses the critical threshold $W^{-d/2}$. In dimension $d=1$, we show that the localization length of bulk eigenvectors is at least of order $(W\lambda)^2$, which is believed to be the correct scaling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the convergence of semilinear parabolic stochastic evolution equations, posed on a sequence of Banach spaces approximating a limiting space and driven by additive white noise projected onto the former spaces. Under appropriate uniformity and convergence conditions on the linear operators, nonlinear drifts and initial data, we establish convergence of the associated mild solution processes when lifted to a common state space. Our framework is applied to the case where the limiting problem is a stochastic partial differential equation whose linear part is a generalized Whittle-Mat\'ern operator on a manifold $\mathcal{M}$, discretized by a sequence of graphs constructed from a (random) point cloud. In this setting we obtain various discrete-to-continuum convergence results for solutions lifted to $L^q(\mathcal{M})$ for $q \in [2,\infty]$, one of which recovers the $L^\infty$-convergence of a finite-difference discretization of certain (fractional) stochastic Allen-Cahn equations.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of rotationally invariant polynomial root sets under iterated differentiations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We associate to an $N$-sample of a given rotationally invariant probability measure $\mu_0$ with compact support in the complex plane, a polynomial $P_N$ with roots given by the sample. Then, for $t \in (0,1)$, we consider the empirical measure $\mu_t^{N}$ associated to the root set of the $\lfloor t N\rfloor$-th derivative of $P_N$. A question posed by O'Rourke and Steinerberger [21], reformulated as a conjecture by Hoskins and Kabluchko [10], and recently reaffirmed by Campbell, O'Rourke and Renfrew [5], states that under suitable conditions of regularity on $\mu_0$, for an i.i.d. sample, $\mu_t^{N}$ converges to a rotationally invariant probability measure $\mu_t$ when $N$ tends to infinity, and that $(1-t)\mu_t$ has a radial density $x \mapsto \psi(x,t)$ satisfying the following partial differential equation:
  \begin{equation} \label{PDErotational}
  \frac{ \partial \psi(x,t) }{\partial t} = \frac{ \partial}{\partial x} \left( \frac{ \psi(x,t) }{ \frac{1}{x} \int_0^x \psi(y,t) dy } \right).
  \end{equation} In [10], this equation is reformulated as an equation on the distribution function $\Psi_t$ of the radial part of $(1-t) \mu_t$: \begin{equation} \label{equationPsixtabstract} \frac{\partial \Psi_t (x)}{\partial t} = x \frac{\frac{\partial \Psi_t (x)}{\partial x} } {\Psi_t(x)} - 1. \end{equation} Restricting our study to a specific family of $N$-samplings, we are able to prove a variant of the conjecture above. We also emphasize the important differences between the two-dimensional setting and the one-dimensional setting, illustrated in our Theorem 2.1.</description>

      <title>Spectral Estimators for Multi-Index Models: Precise Asymptotics and Optimal Weak Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-index models provide a popular framework to investigate the learnability of functions with low-dimensional structure and, also due to their connections with neural networks, they have been object of recent intensive study. In this paper, we focus on recovering the subspace spanned by the signals via spectral estimators -- a family of methods routinely used in practice, often as a warm-start for iterative algorithms. Our main technical contribution is a precise asymptotic characterization of the performance of spectral methods, when sample size and input dimension grow proportionally and the dimension $p$ of the space to recover is fixed. Specifically, we locate the top-$p$ eigenvalues of the spectral matrix and establish the overlaps between the corresponding eigenvectors (which give the spectral estimators) and a basis of the signal subspace. Our analysis unveils a phase transition phenomenon in which, as the sample complexity grows, eigenvalues escape from the bulk of the spectrum and, when that happens, eigenvectors recover directions of the desired subspace. The precise characterization we put forward enables the optimization of the data preprocessing, thus allowing to identify the spectral estimator that requires the minimal sample size for weak recovery.</description>
