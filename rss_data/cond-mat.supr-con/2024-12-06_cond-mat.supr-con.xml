      <title>Magnetic impurities in a strongly coupled superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit certain aspects of a problem concerning the influence of carrier scattering induced by magnetic impurities in metals on their superconducting properties. Superconductivity is assumed to be driven by strong electron-phonon interaction. We use the self-consistent solution of the Nagaoka equations for the scattering matrix together with the Migdal-Eliashberg theory of superconductivity to compute the energy of the in-gap bound states, superconducting critical temperature and tunneling density of states for a wide range of values of the Kondo temperature and impurity concentrations. It is found that similar to the case of the weak coupling (BCS) superconductors there is only one pair of the bound states inside the gap as well as re-entrant superconductivity for the case of antiferromagnetic exchange coupling between the conduction electrons and magnetic impurities. In agreement with the earlier studies we find that the gapless superconductivity can be realized which in the case of antiferromagnetic exchange requires much smaller impurity concentration. Surprisingly, in contrast with the weakly coupled superconductors we find that superconducting transition exhibits two critical temperatures for the ferromagnetic exchange coupling.</description>

      <title>Non-BCS behavior of the pairing susceptibility near the onset of superconductivity in a quantum-critical metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the dynamical pairing susceptibility $\chi_{pp} (\omega_m)$ at $T=0$ in a quantum-critical metal, where superconductivity emerges out of a non-Fermi liquid ground state once the pairing interaction exceeds a certain threshold. We obtain $\chi_{pp} (\omega_m)$ as the ratio of the fully dressed dynamical pairing vertex $\Phi (\omega_m)$ and the bare $\Phi_0 (\omega_m)$ (both infinitesimally small). For superconductivity out of a Fermi liquid, the pairing susceptibility is positive above $T_c$, diverges at $T_c$, and becomes negative below it. For superconductivity out of a non-Fermi liquid, the behavior of $\chi_{pp} (\omega_m)$ is different in two aspects: (i) it diverges at the onset of pairing at $T=0$ only for a certain subclass of bare $\Phi_0 (\omega_m)$ and remains non-singular for other $\Phi_0 (\omega_m)$, and (ii) below the instability, it becomes a non-unique function of a continuous parameter $\phi$ for an arbitrary $\Phi_0 (\omega_m)$. The susceptibility is negative in some range of $\phi$ and diverges at the boundary of this range. We argue that this behavior of the susceptibility reflects a multi-critical nature of a superconducting transition in a quantum-critical metal when immediately below the instability an infinite number of superconducting states emerges simultaneously with different amplitudes of the order parameter down to an infinitesimally small one.</description>

      <title>Strange metal from spin fluctuations in a cuprate superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strange metals challenge our understanding of charge transport in metals. Here, we investigate how the strange metal phase of La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ is impacted by a field-induced glassy antiferromagnetic state. Using magnetic fields above 80 T, we discover a strong enhancement of the normal state magnetoresistance when entering the spin glass phase. We demonstrate that the spin glass causes insulating-like upturns in the resistivity inside the pseudogap phase, which resolves the origin of the ''metal-insulator'' crossover. In addition the strange metal phase appears at low temperatures over an extended range of magnetic fields where magnetic moments fluctuate, and disappears when these moments freeze out. We conclude that the transport properties of the strange metal phase are controlled by magnetic fluctuations persisting at the lowest temperatures.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Critical Current Density in CaKFe$_4$As$_4$ with La-doping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single crystals of (Ca$_{1-x}$La$_x$)KFe$_4$As$_4$ (0 &lt;= x &lt;=0.16) have been grown by using the self-flux method, and the evolution of physical properties including the critical current density (Jc) with La-doping has been investigated. Tc decreases monotonically with increasing x, while Jc at the same temperature and magnetic field increases initially and reach its maximum at x = 0.082. The increase in Jc is more obvious at low temperatures and high fields. At T = 5 K and H = 40 kOe, Jc reaches 0.34 MA/cm$^2$, which is ~4 times larger than that for pure crystals. It is also found that anomalous temperature dependence of Jc in CaKFe$_4$As$_4$ is wiped away as the La content is increased. However, Jc shows non-monotonic field dependence (peak effect) at high fields in crystals with large x. In addition, we found that despite weak anisotropy of H$_{c2}$, there is extremely large anisotropy of Jc up to ~15, which is most likely caused by novel planar defects in the crystal, similar to CaKFe$_4$As$_4$. Jc characteristics in (Ca$_{1-x}$La$_x$)KFe$_4$As$_4$ with disorder outside FeAs planes is compared with that in CaK(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_4$As$_4$ with disorder within FeAs planes.</description>

      <title>Transport Signatures of Radial Rashba Spin-Orbit Coupling at Ferromagnet/Superconductor Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) emerging at the interfaces of superconducting magnetic tunnel junctions is at the heart of multiple unprecedented physical phenomena, covering triplet proximity effects induced by unconventional (spin-flip) Andreev reflections, giant transport magnetoansiotropies, sizable tunneling anomalous Hall effects, and electrically controlled current-reversing $ 0 $--$ \pi $(-like) transitions in Josephson contacts. Recent first-principles calculations proposed that the Rashba spin-orbit fields in twisted graphene/transition-metal dichalcogenide and van-der-Waals multilayers can -- owing to broken mirror symmetries -- exhibit an unconventional radial component (with spin parallel to the electron's momentum), which can be quantified by the Rashba angle $ \theta_\mathrm{R} $. We theoretically explore the ramifications of radial Rashba SOC at the interfaces of vertical ferromagnet/superconductor tunnel junctions with a focus on the magnetoanisotropies of the tunneling and tunneling-anomalous-Hall-effect conductances. Our results demonstrate that $ \theta_\mathrm{R} $ can be experimentally extracted from respective magnetization-angle shifts, providing a practical way to probe the radial Rashba SOC induced by twisted multilayers that are placed as tunneling barrier between ferromagnetic and superconducting electrodes.</description>

      <title>Magnetically-controlled Vortex Dynamics in a Ferromagnetic Superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferromagnetic superconductors are exceptionally rare because the strong ferromagnetic exchange field usually destroys singlet superconductivity. EuFe$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$, an iron-based superconductor with a maximum critical temperature of $\sim$25 K, is a unique material that exhibits full coexistence with ferromagnetic order below $T_\mathrm{FM} \approx 19$ K. The interplay between the two leads to a narrowing of ferromagnetic domains at higher temperatures and the spontaneous nucleation of vortices/antivortices at lower temperatures. Here we demonstrate how the underlying magnetic structure directly controls the superconducting vortex dynamics in applied magnetic fields. Just below $T_\mathrm{FM}$ we observe a pronounced temperature-dependent peak in both the coercivity and the creep activation energy, the latter becoming rapidly suppressed in large applied magnetic fields. We attribute this behaviour to the formation of vortex polarons arising from the unique interaction between free vortices and magnetic stripe domains. We present a theoretical description of the properties of vortex polarons that explains our main observations, showing how they lead to vortex trapping and an attractive vortex-vortex interaction at short distances. In stark contrast, strong magnetic irreversibility at low temperatures is linked to a critical current governed by giant flux creep over an activation barrier for vortex-antivortex annihilation near domain walls. Our work reveals unexplored new routes for the magnetic enhancement of vortex pinning with particularly important applications in high-current conductors for operation at high magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>In-situ Investigation of the Phase Formation and Superconductivity in V$_3$Si Thin Films at High Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vanadium silicide (V$_3$Si) is a promising superconductor for integration with silicon-based electronics, however the interfacial growth kinetics have a strong influence on the resulting superconducting properties and are not yet fully understood. In this study, we have used neutron reflectometry to reveal the phase transformation during thin film growth driven by different annealing strategies. We examined the silicide formation when a thin layer of vanadium undergoes reactive diffusion with a silicon dioxide film on silicon at temperatures from 650-800 {\deg}C. To further investigate the time evolution of different phases under various annealing temperatures, a chemical model was developed and subsequent simulations were performed. The results of this model were validated using X-ray diffraction and cross-sectional TEM analysis. Correlations were observed between the structure and superconducting properties. Over-annealing films leads to complete depletion of the SiO$_2$ barrier layer, forming diffuse interfaces and driving the formation of undesirable silicon-rich silicides. Avoiding this by controlling time and temperature, allows higher quality superconducting films to be achieved. The $T_c$ of the films was found to be 13 K, and the annealing conditions influenced the critical fields and the paramagnetic Meissner effect near $T_c$. For optimally-annealed films, superconducting order parameters were calculated. Ginzberg-Landau theory was applied to explain flux penetration.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure of Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates: strain to mimic the effects pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Signatures of superconductivity under pressure have recently been reported in the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates with general chemical formula La$_{n+1}$Ni$_n$O$_{3n+1}$ ($n=$ number of perovskite layers along the $c$-axis). The emergence of superconductivity is always concomitant with a structural transition in which the octahedral tilts are suppressed causing an increase in the out-of-plane $d_{z^2}$ orbital overlap. Here, using first-principles calculations, we explore biaxial strain (both compressive and tensile) as a means to mimic the electronic structure characteristics of RP nickelates (up to $n=5$) under hydrostatic pressure. Our findings highlight that strain allows to decouple the structural and electronic structure effects obtained under hydrostatic pressure, with tensile strain reproducing the known electronic structure characteristics of the pressurized bilayer and trilayer compounds. Overall, strain represents a promising way to tune the electronic structure of RP nickelates and could be an alternative route to achieve superconductivity in this family of materials.</description>

      <title>Self-correcting GKP qubit in a superconducting circuit with an oscillating voltage bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a simple circuit architecture for a dissipatively error corrected Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) qubit. The device consists of a electromagnetic resonator with impedance $h/2e^2\approx 12.91\,{\rm k}\Omega$ connected to a Josephson junction with a voltage bias oscillating at twice the resonator frequency. For large drive amplitudes, the circuit is effectively described by the GKP stabilizer Hamiltonian, whose low-energy subspace forms the code space for a qubit protected against phase-space local noise. The GKP states in the codespace can be dissipatively stabilized and error corrected by coupling the resonator to a bath through a bandpass filter; a resulting side-band cooling effect stabilizes the system in the GKP code space, dissipatively correcting it against both bit and phase flip errors. Simulations show that this dissipative error correction can enhance coherence time by factor $\sim 1000$ with NbN-based junctions, for operating temperatures in the $\sim 100\,{\rm mK}$ range. The scheme can be used to stabilize both square- and hexagonal-lattice GKP codes. Finally, a Josephson current based readout scheme, and dissipatively corrected single-qubit Clifford gates are proposed.</description>

      <title>Nonuniform Parafermion Chains: Low-Energy Physics and Finite-Size Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nonuniform $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetric Kitaev chain, comprising alternating topological and normal regions, hosts localized states known as edge-zero modes (EZMs) at its interfaces. These EZMs can pair to form qubits that are resilient to quantum decoherence, a feature expected to extend to higher symmetric chains, i.e., parafermion chains. However, finite-size effects may impact this ideal picture. Diagnosing these effects requires first a thorough understanding of the low-energy physics where EZMs may emerge. Previous studies have largely focused on uniform chains, with nonuniform cases inferred from these results. While recent work [Narozhny, Sci. Rep. 7, 1447 (2017)] provides an insightful analytical solution for a nonuniform $\mathbb{Z}_2$ chain with two topological regions separated by a normal one, its complexity limits its applicability to chains with more regions or higher symmetries. Here, we present a new approach based on decimating the highest-energy terms, facilitating the scalable analysis of $\mathbb{Z}_n$ chains with any number of regions. We provide analytical results for both $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and$\mathbb{Z}_3$ chains, supported by numerical findings, and identify the critical lengths necessary to preserve well-separated EZMs.</description>

      <title>Superconducting Proximity Effect in Two-Dimensional Hole Gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Technology involving hybrid superconductor-semiconductor materials is a promising avenue for engineering quantum devices for information storage, manipulation, and transmission. Proximity-induced superconducting correlations are an essential part of such devices. While the proximity effect in the conduction band of common semiconductors is well understood, its manifestation in confined hole gases, realized for instance in germanium, is an active area of research. Lower-dimensional hole-based systems, particularly in germanium, are emerging as an attractive platform for a variety of solid-state quantum devices, due to their combination of efficient spin and charge control and long coherence times. The recent experimental realization of the proximity effect in germanium thus calls for a theoretical description that is tailored to hole gases. In this work, we propose a simple model to describe proximity-induced superconductivity in two-dimensional hole gases, incorporating both the heavy-hole (HH) and light-hole (LH) bands. We start from the Luttinger-Kohn model, introduce three parameters that characterize hopping across the superconductor-semiconductor interface, and derive explicit intraband and interband effective pairing terms for the HH and LH bands. Unlike previous approaches, our theory provides a quantitative relationship between induced pairings and interface properties. Restricting our general model to an experimentally relevant case where only the HH band crosses the chemical potential, we predict the coexistence of $s$-wave and $d$-wave singlet pairings, along with triplet-type pairings, and modified Zeeman and Rashba spin-orbit couplings. Our model thus presents a starting point for theoretical modeling of quantum devices based on proximitized hole gases, fueling further progress in quantum technology.</description>

      <title>Spinon Singlet in Quantum Colored String: Origin of $d$-Wave Pairing in a Partially-Filled Stripe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although both experimental observations and numerical simulations have reached a consensus that the stripe phase is intertwined with superconductivity in cuprates, the microscopic mechanism behind $d$-wave pairing in the presence of stripes remains unclear. Using the effective theory of quantum colored strings, we derive the wavefunction in Fock space. Our results show that two spinons with opposite chiralities tend to pair into a spinon singlet, which in turn facilitates the formation of negative pair-pair correlations between distant $x$-bonds and $y$-bonds, a hallmark of the $d$-wave pairing pattern. The same pair-pair correlation pattern is observed across various models, as confirmed by large-scale density matrix renormalization group calculations. Based on these results, we conclude that the spinon singlet is the origin of $d$-wave superconductivity in a fluctuating, partially-filled stripe, and this mechanism may also extend to multi-stripe configurations.</description>

      <title>Exotic d-wave Cooper Pair Bose Metal in two dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13405v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of non-Fermi liquids sheds light on unconventional phenomena in condensed matter systems that lie beyond the scope of Landau Fermi liquid theory. One intriguing example is the Bose metal, characterized by an uncondensed bosonic ground state. However, constructing a Bose metal phase in two dimensions (2D) remains a significant challenge.} Utilizing constraint path quantum Monte Carlo and functional renormalization group methods on a fermionic system with spin anisotropy in a 2D lattice, we reveal the emergence of a Cooper pair Bose metal (CPBM) phase in a highly anisotropic regime ($\alpha &lt; 0.30$) with wide range of filling, as proposed in [A. E. Feiguin and M. P. A. Fisher, Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 025303 (2009)]. Our findings exhibit a visible nonzero momentum Bose surface in the Cooper-pair distribution function, accompanied by a distinct signal of $d_{xy}$ correlation between pairs. Our results highlight that spin-dependent anisotropy in the Fermi surface leads to versatile pairing forms. Platforms such as ultracold atoms in optical lattices and recently proposed altermagnets hold promise for realizing this intriguing phase.</description>

      <title>Inherently dissipative normal currents during thermodynamic changes of state in superconductors: Joule heating vs. magnetocaloric cooling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08677v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the Meissner phase of a superconductor below its critical temperature, an external constant magnetic field is shielded by circulating persistent supercurrents with zero resistance that are formed by Cooper pairs. However, a thermodynamic change of state within this phase at any finite temperature and at finite speed, such as a cooling or a heating, inevitably generates normal currents of thermally excited unpaired charge carriers. These currents are induced by the time-dependent variations in the local magnetic-flux density associated with the imposed change of state. They may not only lead to certain deviations of the magnetic-field distribution from textbook Meissner profiles, but also cause dissipative Joule heating, which appears to be at odds with the expected reversibility in a truly thermodynamic superconducting state. We show that these normal currents also produce a magnetocaloric cooling, which in total instantaneously and precisely compensates for the dissipated heat, thus ensuring overall energy conservation and reversibility in terms of energy. However, the time-dependent Joule heating and magnetocaloric cooling processes are spatially distinct and therefore result in small temperature inhomogeneities that only fade away towards thermodynamic equilibrium after the thermodynamic change of state has halted.</description>

      <title>Extraction and Simulation of the Impact of Flux Trapping in Moats of AC-Biased Shift Registers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Moats in superconducting ground planes are used to trap magnetic flux away from sensitive parts of superconductor integrated circuits. We simulate the effect of magnetic flux trapped in moats on the operating margins of ac-biased SFQ shift registers (ShReg) with two ground planes for various congruent moat geometries, moat sizes, locations in the ShReg cells, number and polarity of the trapped of fluxons. Using inductance extractor InductEx, we extract mutual couplings between the moats and the ShReg inductors and include them in the refined netlist. Then, we use JoSim to simulate the circuit operation and find the threshold ac clock amplitude above which the register starts to operate correctly. The relative change in this threshold is used to characterize the influence of flux trapping on the circuit operation. Monte-Carlo simulations are used to investigate the effect of the circuit parameter variations on the statistics of the threshold, using the standard deviation of the Josephson junction critical current and of the circuit inductance extracted from the fabrication process control monitors. The obtained distributions are compared with the independently measured distributions of the threshold amplitude for the individual cells of ac-biased shift registers with 108,500 Josephson junctions. The results show that flux trapping in properly designed moats have a very small effect on the operation margins of the large-scale shift registers whereas the main contribution to the cell-to-cell variation of the threshold comes from the variation of the junctions' critical currents.</description>

      <title>First-Principles Study of High-Temperature Superconductivity in X2MH6 Compounds under 20 GPa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Research on high-temperature superconductors has primarily focused on hydrogen-rich compounds, however, the need for extreme pressures limits their practical applications. The X2MH6-type structure Mg2IrH6 stands out because it exhibits superconductivity at 160 K under ambient pressure. This study investigates methods to increase the superconducting transition temperature of this structure via atomic substitution and low-pressure treatment and assess the mechanical, thermodynamic, and dynamic stability of structures obtained by substituting Mg and Ir atoms in Mg2IrH6 with elements from the same groups using first-principles calculations. The findings identify 11 stable ternary compounds, 10 of which exhibit superconducting transition temperatures, with three compounds, Mg2CoH6, Mg2RhH6, and Mg2IrH6, exceeding 100 K, classifying them as high-temperature superconductors. Their superconducting figure of merit S values are 2.71, 3.35, and 3.83, respectively, suggesting strong practical application potential. The analysis results indicate that mid-frequency hydrogen phonons significantly enhance superconducting properties via electron-phonon coupling. The band structure study highlights the importance of van Hove singularities near the Fermi level. In addition, electron localization function and Fermi surface topology analyses reveal that the Fermi surface shape and density of states are crucial for increasing superconducting transition temperatures.</description>

      <title>Uniaxial strain tuning of charge modulation and singularity in a kagome superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tunable quantum materials hold great potential for applications. Of special interest are materials in which small lattice strain induces giant electronic responses. The kagome compounds AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, Cs) provide a testbed for such singular electronic states. In this study, through angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we provide comprehensive spectroscopic measurements of the giant responses induced by compressive and tensile strains on the charge-density-wave (CDW) order parameter and high-order van Hove singularity (HO-VHS) in CsV3Sb5. We observe a tripling of the CDW gap magnitudes with ~1% strain, accompanied by the changes of both energy and mass of the saddle-point fermions. Our results reveal an anticorrelation between the unconventional CDW order parameter and the mass of a HO-VHS, and highlight the role of the latter in the superconducting pairing. The giant electronic responses uncover a rich strain tunability of the versatile kagome system in studying quantum interplays under lattice perturbations.</description>

      <title>Crossed Andreev reflection revealed by self-consistent Keldysh-Usadel formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Crossed Andreev reflection (CAR) is a process that creates entanglement between spatially separated electrons and holes. Such entangled pairs have potential applications in quantum information processing, and it is therefore relevant to determine how the probability for CAR can be increased. CAR competes with another non-local process called elastic cotunneling (EC), which does not create entanglement. In conventional normal metal/superconductor/normal metal heterostructures, earlier theoretical work predicted that EC dominates over CAR. Nevertheless, we show numerically that when the Keldysh-Usadel equations are solved self-consistently in the superconductor, CAR can dominate over EC. Self-consistency is necessary both for the conversion from a quasiparticle current to a supercurrent and to describe the spatial variation of the order parameter correctly. A requirement for the CAR probability to surpass the EC probability is that the inverse proximity effect is small. Otherwise, the subvoltage density of states becomes large and EC is strengthened by quasiparticles flowing through the superconductor. Therefore, CAR becomes dominant in the non-local transport with increasing interface resistance and length of the superconducting region. Our results show that even the simplest possible experimental setup with easily accessible normal metals and superconductors can provide dominant CAR by designing the experimental parameters correctly. We also find that spin-splitting in the superconductor increases the subvoltage density of states, and thus always favors EC over CAR. Finally, we tune the chemical potential in the leads such that transport is governed by electrons of one spin type. This can increase the CAR probability at finite values of the spin-splitting compared to using a spin-degenerate voltage bias, and provides a way to control the spin of the conduction electrons electrically.</description>
