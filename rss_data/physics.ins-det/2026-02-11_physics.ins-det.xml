      <title>A 4D-STEM Tomographic Framework Assisted by Object Tracking for Nanoparticle Structure Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional electron diffraction (3D ED) has emerged as a powerful method for solving the structures of sub-micron-sized particles down to nanoparticles. However, it faces technical challenges when applied to beam-sensitive samples or conglomerated and agglomerated nanoparticles. This study presents a novel approach that combines 4D-STEM tomography with object tracking and segmentation algorithms to overcome these limitations and achieve single-crystalline 3D ED datasets from nanopowder samples. The method and data quality are assessed on brookite TiO2 nanorods and beam-sensitive CsPbBr3 nanoparticles. To finely sample the reciprocal-space, the data acquisition was automated to acquire hundreds of 4D-STEM scans using a slightly convergent beam and at fine tilt steps. The proposed method provides enhanced signal-to-noise ratio, low illumination time for reducing beam damage, and the ability to analyze multiple particles from a single tomographic dataset. The procedure is optimized to be feasible using commercially available desktops and detectors. This extends the method applicability in the community to the systems and samples that were previously inaccessible for conventional 3D ED methods, particularly breaking the technical challenges for the data acquisition.</description>

      <title>Conceptual Design of a Novel Highly Granular Crystal Electromagnetic Calorimeter for Future Higgs Factories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation high-energy electron-positron colliders, operating as Higgs factories, require an unprecedented jet energy resolution for precision measurements of Higgs and Z/W bosons. To address this challenge, a conceptual design is presented for a novel high-granularity crystal electromagnetic calorimeter that combines the superior intrinsic energy resolution of a homogeneous calorimeter with the fine segmentation required for particle-flow reconstruction. The crystal electromagnetic calorimeter design is based on orthogonally arranged long scintillating crystal bars read out by silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) at both ends. Key design specifications were established through comprehensive simulation studies. Critical technical considerations, including crystal choices, photosensors, electronics, mechanical support, and radiation damage, are discussed. A dedicated digitisation framework was developed to realistically model effects from the crystal, SiPMs, and readout electronics. The performance of a single calorimeter module was evaluated using simulated electron showers. Simulation results for a single module demonstrate an excellent electromagnetic energy resolution of $1.12\%/\sqrt{E(\mathrm{GeV})}\oplus0.24\%$ and an energy linearity within $\pm0.5\%$ for electrons from 3 GeV to 100 GeV. The performance significantly exceeds the design requirement of $\leq 3\%/\sqrt{E(\mathrm{GeV})}\oplus1\%$. The results establish the feasibility of the proposed high-granularity crystal calorimeter concept and point to a promising pathway toward the precision calorimetry required for future high-energy electron-positron collider experiments.</description>

      <title>Predicting Neutron Attenuation from Bulk Density and Moisture for Soil Carbon Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) enables rapid, non-destructive in situ measurements of soil elemental composition over large soil volumes. Standard INS yields bulk elemental concentrations, but spatially resolved measurements require techniques such as Associated Particle Imaging (API), which pairs neutron detection with coincident alpha detection to reconstruct the location of the neutron interaction. One of the unique advantages of API is its capability to measure all major soil components simultaneously, allowing for the estimation of both bulk density and water content directly from the measured neutron-induced gamma-ray spectra. Accurate interpretation of bulk INS-API data depends on correcting for both gamma-ray and neutron attenuation in soil. Although gamma attenuation can be calculated from known mass attenuation coefficient data and density, neutron attenuation is more complex, depending on neutron energy, soil composition, bulk density, and hydrogen content from water and organic matter. We use Monte Carlo simulations of soils with varied compositions, bulk densities, and water contents to model neutron attenuation and develop a simple predictive model requiring only dry bulk density and volumetric water content. We validate this model experimentally using an INS-API system with controlled soil columns, finding agreement within 10 percent at 30 cm depth. This approach enables practical, field-ready correction of INS-API measurements for neutron attenuation, laying the groundwork for a self-consistent measurement framework that can address the elemental composition of soil carbon assessments.</description>

      <title>Optimising Microwave Cavities for nonzero Helicity with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a machine-learning-driven inverse design framework for systematically engineering three-dimensional microwave cavity resonators that support modes with nonzero electromagnetic helicity. In contrast to heuristic approaches to cavity design, helicity maximisation is formulated as a boundary-shape optimisation problem, enabling systematic exploration of complex boundary-shape parameter spaces and the identification of high-helicity designs that are difficult to predict using heuristic design rules alone. We applied this framework to several cavity families composed of smooth, edge-free components, including globally twisted cavities with control-point-defined cross-sections realised in both linear and ring configurations, cavities defined by the intersection of orthogonal prisms, sphere-subtracted cylindrical cavities, and parametrised surface resonators. Two gradient-free optimisation strategies, a genetic algorithm and Bayesian optimisation, were independently employed to explore compact sets of design parameters for these geometries and to optimise a scaled-helicity figure of merit for the dominant helical mode, evaluated via finite-element eigenmode analysis. Robustness to manufacturing tolerances was quantified by applying Gaussian geometric perturbations to the optimised cavities and evaluating statistical robustness metrics that penalise sensitivity to geometric variation.</description>

      <title>Probing Internal Dynamics of Spatiotemporal Optical Vortex Strings: Spatiotemporal Attraction and Filament Stretching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vortex dynamics are intriguing and challenging across multiple physics fields. In optics, customized spatiotemporally structured optical fields, especially spatiotemporal optical vortices (STOV), offer the potential to tailor light via coupled space-time degrees of freedom. However, the interaction mechanisms between multiple transverse orbital angular momentum singularities within a single wave packet remain elusive. This study explores the intrinsic dynamics of a STOV with three phase singularities, observing a pronounced vortex singularity oscillation phenomena by tuning the temporal dispersion. We show that these phenomena originate from the counterintuitive spatiotemporal attractive effect between vortices, which is closely related to the singularity distance. Furthermore, the stretching into filaments and annihilation behaviors is observed by introducing antivortex in the center of the wavepacket. Experimentally, we propose a Full Interferometric Retrieval of Spatiotemporal Tomography (FIRST) method that enables the complete, single-shot capture of wave packets, with excellent agreement between theoretical predictions and experimental results. To the best of our knowledge, the dynamics of transverse spatiotemporal singularities within a single wave packet are reported here for the first time. These findings confirm the existence of interesting interactions between STOV singularities, deepen our understanding of photonics and open a new direction for investigating the complex dynamics of vortex singularities in the spatiotemporal domain.</description>

      <title>Binary Classification of Light and Dark Time Traces of a Transition Edge Sensor Using Convolutional Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Any Light Particle Search II (ALPS II) is a light shining through a wall experiment probing the existence of axions and axion-like particles using a 1064 nm laser source. While ALPS II is already taking data using a heterodyne based detection scheme, cryogenic transition edge sensor (TES) based single-photon detectors are planned to expand the detection system for cross-checking the potential signals, for which a sensitivity on the order of $10^{-24}$ W is required. In order to reach this goal, we have investigated the use of convolutional neural networks (CNN) as binary classifiers to distinguish the experimentally measured 1064 nm photon triggered (light) pulses from background (dark) pulses. Despite extensive hyperparameter optimization, the CNN based binary classifier did not outperform our previously optimized cut-based analysis in terms of detection significance. This suggests that the used approach is not generally suitable for background suppression and improving the energy resolution of the TES. We partly attribute this to the training confusion induced by near-1064 nm black-body photon triggers in the background, which we identified as the limiting background source as concluded in our previous works. However, we argue that the problem ultimately lies in the binary classification based approach and believe that regression models would be better suitable for addressing the energy resolution. Unsupervised machine learning models, in particular neural network based autoencoders, should also be considered potential candidates for the suppression of noise in time traces. While the presented results and associated conclusions are obtained for TES designed to be used in the ALPS II experiment, they should hold equivalently well for any device whose output signal can be considered as a univariate time trace.</description>

      <title>Performance Optimization and Characterization of 7-pad Resistive PICOSEC Micromegas Detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive characterization of resistive PICOSEC Micromegas detector prototypes, tested under identical conditions, constant drift gap, field configurations, and photocathode at the CERN SPS H4 beam line. This work provides a proof of concept for the use of resistive layer technology in gaseous timing detectors, demonstrating that robustness can be improved without compromising the excellent timing performance of PICOSEC Micromegas. Different resistive architectures and values were explored to optimize stability and ensure reliable long-term operation in challenging experimental environments. The prototype with a 10M{\Omega} resistive layer achieved the best overall performance, with a timing resolution of 22.900 {\pm} 0.002 ps and a spatial resolution of 1.190 {\pm} 0.003 mm, while charge sharing across multiple pads enabled combined timing resolutions below 28 ps. A lower-resistivity (200k{\Omega}) configuration exhibited enhanced charge spread, leading to minor systematic offsets in reconstructed pad centers, yet maintained robust timing and spatial performance. Capacitive charge-sharing architectures improved spatial resolution in some regions but suffered from signal attenuation and nonuniform charge distributions, resulting in slightly degraded timing (33.300 {\pm} 0.002 ps) and complex localization patterns. Mechanical precision, particularly readout planarity and photocathode alignment, was identified as critical for uniform detector response. These studies benchmark the potential of resistive layers for gaseous timing detectors and provide a foundation for scalable designs with optimized timing and spatial resolution across diverse experimental applications.</description>

      <title>Neutron spectrum measurement in the Yemi underground laboratory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the measurement of neutron energy spectra at the newly established Yemi Underground Laboratory (Yemilab) in the Republic of Korea, designed to host dark matter and rare-event search experiments. A high-sensitivity neutron spectrometer was employed, consisting of ten cylindrical {}^{3}He proportional counters, eight of which were embedded in cylindrical high-density polyethylene moderators of various sizes. To quantify and mitigate contributions from internal \alpha-backgrounds, each detector underwent a dedicated background measurement using a cadmium-shielded box. These backgrounds, primarily originating from trace amounts of U and Th in the stainless-steel housings, were characterized and subtracted during data analysis. Neutron measurements were carried out at three locations within the Yemilab between March to October 2023. After waveform-based event selection and correction for \alphasym-backgrounds, neutron count rates were estimated and corresponding energy spectra were reconstructed using the unfolding method. The total neutron fluence rates were measured ranged from (3.24 $\pm$ 0.11) to (4.01 $\pm$ 0.10) $\times~10^{-5}~ {cm}^{-2}~{s}^{-1}$, with thermal and fast neutron components (1 - 10 MeV) ranging from (1.32 $\pm$ 0.05) to (1.51 $\pm$ 0.05) $\times 10^{-5}~{cm}^{-2}~{s}^{-1}$ and (0.27 $\pm$ 0.03) to (0.34 $\pm$ 0.10) $\times~10^{-5}~{cm}^{-2}~{s}^{-1}$, respectively.</description>
