      <title>Deep Learning in Long-Short Stock Portfolio Allocation: An Empirical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides an empirical study exploring the application of deep learning algorithms -- Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Transformer -- in constructing long-short stock portfolios. Two datasets comprising randomly selected stocks from the S\&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ indices, each spanning a decade of daily data, are utilized. The models predict daily stock returns based on historical features such as past returns, Relative Strength Index (RSI), trading volume, and volatility. Portfolios are dynamically adjusted by longing stocks with positive predicted returns and shorting those with negative predictions, with asset weights optimized using Mean-Variance Optimization. Performance is evaluated over a two-year testing period, focusing on return, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown metrics. The results demonstrate the efficacy of deep learning models in enhancing long-short stock portfolio performance.</description>

      <title>A Random Forest approach to detect and identify Unlawful Insider Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to The Exchange Act, 1934 unlawful insider trading is the abuse of access to privileged corporate information. While a blurred line between "routine" the "opportunistic" insider trading exists, detection of strategies that insiders mold to maneuver fair market prices to their advantage is an uphill battle for hand-engineered approaches. In the context of detailed high-dimensional financial and trade data that are structurally built by multiple covariates, in this study, we explore, implement and provide detailed comparison to the existing study (Deng et al. (2019)) and independently implement automated end-to-end state-of-art methods by integrating principal component analysis to the random forest (PCA-RF) followed by a standalone random forest (RF) with 320 and 3984 randomly selected, semi-manually labeled and normalized transactions from multiple industry. The settings successfully uncover latent structures and detect unlawful insider trading. Among the multiple scenarios, our best-performing model accurately classified 96.43 percent of transactions. Among all transactions the models find 95.47 lawful as lawful and $98.00$ unlawful as unlawful percent. Besides, the model makes very few mistakes in classifying lawful as unlawful by missing only 2.00 percent. In addition to the classification task, model generated Gini Impurity based features ranking, our analysis show ownership and governance related features based on permutation values play important roles. In summary, a simple yet powerful automated end-to-end method relieves labor-intensive activities to redirect resources to enhance rule-making and tracking the uncaptured unlawful insider trading transactions. We emphasize that developed financial and trading features are capable of uncovering fraudulent behaviors.</description>

      <title>Advance Detection Of Bull And Bear Phases In Cryptocurrency Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cryptocurrencies are highly volatile financial instruments with more and more new retail investors joining the scene with each passing day. Bitcoin has always proved to determine in which way the rest of the cryptocurrency market is headed towards. As of today Bitcoin has a market dominance of close to 50 percent. Bull and bear phases in cryptocurrencies are determined based on the performance of Bitcoin over the 50 Day and 200 Day Moving Averages. The aim of this paper is to foretell the performance of bitcoin in the near future by employing predictive algorithms. This predicted data will then be used to calculate the 50 Day and 200 Day Moving Averages and subsequently plotted to establish the potential bull and bear phases.</description>

      <title>Can ChatGPT Overcome Behavioral Biases in the Financial Sector? Classify-and-Rethink: Multi-Step Zero-Shot Reasoning in the Gold Investment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success recently, displaying exceptional capabilities in creating understandable and organized text. These LLMs have been utilized in diverse fields, such as clinical research, where domain-specific models like Med-Palm have achieved human-level performance. Recently, researchers have employed advanced prompt engineering to enhance the general reasoning ability of LLMs. Despite the remarkable success of zero-shot Chain-of-Thoughts (CoT) in solving general reasoning tasks, the potential of these methods still remains paid limited attention in the financial reasoning task.To address this issue, we explore multiple prompt strategies and incorporated semantic news information to improve LLMs' performance on financial reasoning tasks.To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore this important issue by applying ChatGPT to the gold investment.In this work, our aim is to investigate the financial reasoning capabilities of LLMs and their capacity to generate logical and persuasive investment opinions. We will use ChatGPT, one of the most powerful LLMs recently, and prompt engineering to achieve this goal. Our research will focus on understanding the ability of LLMs in sophisticated analysis and reasoning within the context of investment decision-making. Our study finds that ChatGPT with CoT prompt can provide more explainable predictions and overcome behavioral biases, which is crucial in finance-related tasks and can achieve higher investment returns.</description>

      <title>A Full-History Network Dataset for BTC Asset Decentralization Profiling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since its advent in 2009, Bitcoin (BTC) has garnered increasing attention from both academia and industry. However, due to the massive transaction volume, no systematic study has quantitatively measured the asset decentralization degree specifically from a network perspective.
  In this paper, by conducting a thorough analysis of the BTC transaction network, we first address the significant gap in the availability of full-history BTC graph and network property dataset, which spans over 15 years from the genesis block (1st March, 2009) to the 845651-th block (29, May 2024). We then present the first systematic investigation to profile BTC's asset decentralization and design several decentralization degrees for quantification. Through extensive experiments, we emphasize the significant role of network properties and our network-based decentralization degree in enhancing Bitcoin analysis. Our findings demonstrate the importance of our comprehensive dataset and analysis in advancing research on Bitcoin's transaction dynamics and decentralization, providing valuable insights into the network's structure and its implications.</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning Approach to Predict the Fall [of Price] of Cryptocurrency Long Before its Actual Fall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In modern times, the cryptocurrency market is one of the world's most rapidly rising financial markets. The cryptocurrency market is regarded to be more volatile and illiquid than traditional markets such as equities, foreign exchange, and commodities. The risk of this market creates an uncertain condition among the investors. The purpose of this research is to predict the magnitude of the risk factor of the cryptocurrency market. Risk factor is also called volatility. Our approach will assist people who invest in the cryptocurrency market by overcoming the problems and difficulties they experience. Our approach starts with calculating the risk factor of the cryptocurrency market from the existing parameters. In twenty elements of the cryptocurrency market, the risk factor has been predicted using different machine learning algorithms such as CNN, LSTM, BiLSTM, and GRU. All of the models have been applied to the calculated risk factor parameter. A new model has been developed to predict better than the existing models. Our proposed model gives the highest RMSE value of 1.3229 and the lowest RMSE value of 0.0089. Following our model, it will be easier for investors to trade in complicated and challenging financial assets like bitcoin, Ethereum, dogecoin, etc. Where the other existing models, the highest RMSE was 14.5092, and the lower was 0.02769. So, the proposed model performs much better than models with proper generalization. Using our approach, it will be easier for investors to trade in complicated and challenging financial assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin.</description>

      <title>High resolution microprice estimates from limit orderbook data using hyperdimensional vector Tsetlin Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an error-correcting model for the microprice, a high-frequency estimator of future prices given higher order information of imbalances in the orderbook. The model takes into account a current microprice estimate given the spread and best bid to ask imbalance, and adjusts the microprice based on recent dynamics of higher price rank imbalances. We introduce a computationally fast estimator using a recently proposed hyperdimensional vector Tsetlin machine framework and demonstrate empirically that this estimator can provide a robust estimate of future prices in the orderbook.</description>

      <title>Wavelet Analysis of Cryptocurrencies -- Non-Linear Dynamics in High Frequency Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we perform some analysis for the probability distributions in the space of frequency and time variables. However, in the domain of high frequencies, it behaves in such a way as the highly non-linear dynamics. The wavelet analysis is a powerful tool to perform such analysis in order to search for the characteristics of frequency variations over time for the prices of major cryptocurrencies. In fact, the wavelet analysis is found to be quite useful as it examine the validity of the efficient market hypothesis in the weak form, especially for the presence of the cyclical persistence at different frequencies. If we could find some cyclical persistence at different frequencies, that means that there exist some intrinsic causal relationship for some given investment horizons defined by some chosen sampling scales. This is one of the characteristic results of the wavelet analysis in the time-frequency domains.</description>
