      <title>Higher-Order Reverse Isoperimetric Inequalities for Log-concave Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Rogers-Shephard and Zhang's projection inequalities are two reverse, affine isoperimetric inequalities relating the volumes of a convex body and its difference body and polar projection body, respectively. Following a classical work by Schneider, both inequalities have been extended to the so-called higher-order setting. In this work, we establish the higher-order analogues for these inequalities in the setting of log-concave functions. In particular, this extends the Zhang's inequality for absolutely continuous log-concave functions. We introduce an iterated sup-convolution to tackle the Rogers-Shephard inequality.</description>

      <title>Cassini sets in taxicab geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given two points $p$ and $q$ in the plane and a nonnegative number $r$, the Cassini oval is the set of points $x$ that satisfy $d(x, p) d(x, q) = r^2$. In this paper, we study this set using the taxicab metric. We find that these sets have characteristics that are qualitatively similar to their Euclidean counterparts while also reflecting the underlying taxicab structure. We provide a geometric description of these sets and provide a characterization in terms of intersections and unions of a restricted family of such sets analogous to that found recently for taxicab Apollonian sets.</description>

      <title>A boundary for hyperbolic digraphs and semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on a notion by Gray and Kambites of hyperbolicity in the setting of semimetric spaces like digraphs or semigroups, we will construct (under a small additional geometric assumption) a boundary based on quasi-geodesic rays and anti-rays that is preserved by quasi-isometries and, in the case of locally finite digraphs and right cancellative semigroups, refines their ends. Among other results, we show that it is possible to equip the space, if it is finitely based, together with its boundary with a pseudo-semimetric.</description>

      <title>Additive kinematic formulas for convex functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a functional version of the additive kinematic formula as an application of the Hadwiger theorem on convex functions together with a Kubota-type formula for mixed Monge-Amp\`ere measures. As an application, we give a new explanation for the equivalence of the representations of functional intrinsic volumes as singular Hessian valuations and as integrals with respect to mixed Monge-Amp\`ere measures. In addition, we obtain a new integral geometric formula for mixed area measures of convex bodies, where integration on $\operatorname{SO}(n-1)\times \operatorname{O}(1)$ is considered.</description>

      <title>The metric Menger problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a generalization of the well-known disjoint paths problem which we call the metric Menger problem, denoted MM(r,k), where one is given two subsets of a graph and must decide whether they can be connected by $k$ paths of pairwise distance at least $r$. We prove that this problem is NP-complete for every $r\geq 3$ and $k\geq 2$ by giving a reduction from 3SAT. This resolves a conjecture recently stated by Georgakopoulos and Papasoglu. On the other hand, we show that the problem is in XP when parameterised by treewidth and maximum degree by observing that it is `locally checkable'. In the case $r\leq 3$, we prove that it suffices to parameterise by treewidth. We also state some open questions relating to this work.</description>

      <title>On the Dirichlet-to-Neumann Map for the $p$-Laplacian on a Metric Measure Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we construct a Dirichlet-to-Neumann map, from a Besov space of functions, to the dual of this class. The Besov spaces are of functions on the boundary of a bounded, locally compact uniform domain equipped with a doubling measure supporting a $p$-Poincar\'e inequality so that this boundary is also equipped with a Radon measure that has a codimensional relationship with the measure on the domain. We construct this map via the following recipe. We show first that solutions to Dirichlet problem for the $p$-Laplacian on the domain with prescribed boundary data in the Besov space induce an operator that lives in the dual of the Besov space. Conversely, we show that there is a solution, in the homogeneous Newton-Sobolev space, to the Neumann problem for the $p$-Laplacian with the Neumann boundary data given by a continuous linear functional belonging to the dual of the Besov space. We also obtain bounds on its operator norm in terms of the norms of trace and extension operators that relate Newton-Sobolev functions on the domain to Besov functions on the boundary.</description>

      <title>Isoperimetric Inequalities on Slabs with applications to Cubes and Gaussian Slabs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study isoperimetric inequalities on "slabs", namely weighted Riemannian manifolds obtained as the product of the uniform measure on a finite length interval with a codimension-one base. As our two main applications, we consider the case when the base is the flat torus $\mathbb{R}^2 / 2 \mathbb{Z}^2$ and the standard Gaussian measure in $\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$.
  The isoperimetric conjecture on the three-dimensional cube predicts that minimizers are enclosed by spheres about a corner, cylinders about an edge and coordinate planes. Our analysis confirms the isoperimetric conjecture on the three-dimensional cube with side lengths $(\beta,1,1)$ in a new range of relatives volumes $\bar v \in [0,1/2]$. In particular, we confirm the conjecture for the standard cube ($\beta=1$) for all $\bar v \leq 0.120582$, when $\beta \leq 0.919431$ for the entire range where spheres are conjectured to be minimizing, and also for all $\bar v \in [0,1/2] \setminus (\frac{1}{\pi} - \frac{\beta}{4},\frac{1}{\pi} + \frac{\beta}{4})$. When $\beta \leq 0.919431$ we reduce the validity of the full conjecture to establishing that the half-plane $\{ x \in [0,\beta] \times [0,1]^2 \; ; \; x_3 \leq \frac{1}{\pi} \}$ is an isoperimetric minimizer. We also show that the analogous conjecture on a high-dimensional cube $[0,1]^n$ is false for $n \geq 10$.
  In the case of a slab with a Gaussian base of width $T&gt;0$, we identify a phase transition when $T = \sqrt{2 \pi}$ and when $T = \pi$. In particular, while products of half-planes with $[0,T]$ are always minimizing when $T \leq \sqrt{2 \pi}$, when $T &gt; \pi$ they are never minimizing, being beaten by Gaussian unduloids. In the range $T \in (\sqrt{2 \pi},\pi]$, a potential trichotomy occurs.</description>

      <title>Quasi-isometry invariance of hyperbolicity in semimetric spaces, digraphs and semigroups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.13049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gray and Kambites introduced a notion of hyperbolicity in the setting of semimetric spaces like digraphs or semigroups. We will prove that under a small additional geometric assumption their notion of hyperbolicity is preserved by quasi-isometries. Applied to semigroups, this will partially solve a problem of Gray and Kambites.</description>

      <title>Pointwise Assouad dimension for measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.15301v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a pointwise variant of the Assouad dimension for measures on metric spaces, and study its properties in relation to the global Assouad dimension. We show that, in general, the value of the pointwise Assouad dimension differs from the global counterpart, but in many classical cases, it exhibits similar exact dimensionality properties as the classical local dimension, namely it equals the global Assouad dimension at almost every point. We also compute the Assouad dimension of invariant measures with place dependent probabilities supported on strongly separated self-conformal sets.</description>

Abstract: We show that the Bergman metric of the ball quotients $\mathbb{B}^2/\Gamma$, where $\Gamma$ is a finite and fixed point free group, is K\"ahler-Einstein if and only if $\Gamma$ is trivial. As a consequence, we characterize the unit ball $\mathbb{B}^2$, among 2 dimensional Stein spaces with isolated normal singularities, proving an algebraic version of Cheng's conjecture for 2 dimensional Stein spaces.</description>

      <title>Weighted Ehrhart Theory: Extending Stanley's nonnegativity theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.09614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize R. P. Stanley's celebrated theorem that the $h^\ast$-polynomial of the Ehrhart series of a rational polytope has nonnegative coefficients and is monotone under containment of polytopes. We show that these results continue to hold for weighted Ehrhart series where lattice points are counted with polynomial weights, as long as the weights are homogeneous polynomials decomposable as sums of products of linear forms that are nonnegative on the polytope. We also show nonnegativity of the $h^\ast$-polynomial as a real-valued function for a larger family of weights.
  We then target the case when the weight function is the square of a single (arbitrary) linear form. We show stronger results for two-dimensional convex lattice polygons and give concrete examples showing tightness of the hypotheses. As an application, we construct a counterexample to a conjecture by Berg, Jochemko, and Silverstein on Ehrhart tensor polynomials.</description>

      <title>The Generalized Makeev Problem Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.03818v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on a result of Makeev, in 2012 Blagojevi\'c and Karasev proposed the following problem: given any positive integers $m$ and $1\leq \ell\leq k$, find the minimum dimension $d=\Delta(m;\ell/k)$ such that for any $m$ mass distributions on $\mathbb{R}^d$, there exist $k$ hyperplanes, any $\ell$ of which equipartition each mass. The $\ell=k$ case is a central question in geometric and topological combinatorics which remains open except for few values of $m$ and $k$. For $\ell&lt; k$ and arbitrary $m$, we establish new upper bounds on $\Delta(m;\ell/k)$ when (1) $\ell=2$ and $k$ is arbitrary and (2) $\ell=3$ and $k=4$. When $\ell=k-1$ and $m+1$ is a power of two these bounds are nearly optimal and are exponentially smaller than the current best upper bounds when $\ell=k$. Similar remarks apply to our upper bounds when the hyperplanes are prescribed to be pairwise orthogonal. Lastly, we provide transversal extensions of our results along the lines recently established by Frick et al.: given $m$ families of compact convex sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$ such that no $2^\ell$ members of any family are pairwise disjoint, we show that every member of each family is pierced by the union of any $\ell$ of some collection of $k$ hyperplanes.</description>
