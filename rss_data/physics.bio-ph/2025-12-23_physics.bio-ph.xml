      <title>Subcellular Metabolic Tracking Using Fluorescent Nanodiamonds Relaxometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) relaxometry holds promising future for advancement of high spatiotemporal resolution metabolic imaging technology. In this study, we demonstrate a simultaneous integration of spatial position tracking with FND relaxometry to characterize the temporal dynamics of metabolic processes, thereby enhancing the capability to monitor cellular activities over time. To enable targeted metabolic probing in living cells, FNDs were surface-functionalized to achieve specific localization within key organelles, including the nucleus and mitochondria. This strategy not only facilitates subcellular-level metabolic monitoring but also allows for direct comparison between intra- and extranuclear microenvironments within the same living cell, offering substantial potential for elucidating the spatial and functional heterogeneity of cellular metabolism.</description>

      <title>All in one: holographic microscopy unveils bacterial transport from single cells to population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prior to pioneer surface adhesion, bacteria have to navigate in flows, often in confined environments. While much is known about their individual swimming dynamics, our understanding of their transport properties at the population level remains limited. This is primarily due to the experimental challenges associated with tracking, in three dimensions and under flow, a large sample of these microorganisms. Here we investigate, through fast digital holographic microscopy (DHM), a suspension of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 bacteria in a confined Poiseuille flow. Based on the analysis of several thousand Lagrangian trajectories, we first demonstrate the ability of DHM to discriminate between the fraction of bacteria that adhere to walls, those that are only convected by the flow, and those for which motility helps them migrate through the channel and cross streamlines. Focusing on the motile part of the population, we report new experimental results concerning the spatial and orientational distributions across the confinement direction. In the central part of the flow, migration and shear trapping are observed and well described by existing kinetic models. Close to the walls, averaging over the entire motile population clearly shows an accumulation layer but with no net orientational order, which contradicts models that neglect hydrodynamic interactions with solid surfaces. We think that DHM coupled with the analysis of large-scale bacterial populations will help to understand their transfer mechanisms from the bulk to surfaces.</description>

      <title>Life as Non-Normal Chemical Accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Life is commonly described as a self-organized, far-from-equilibrium process that maintains internal order by consuming free energy and exporting entropy. This thermodynamic view underlies diverse theoretical frameworks -- from autopoiesis and relational biology to autocatalytic sets and hypercycles -- yet dissipation is typically treated as a necessary consequence of living organization rather than as a property shaped by its internal dynamics. Here, through explicit calculations of biotic chemical reactions and empirical documentation, we show that living systems universally function as non-normal chemical accelerators. Their elevated entropy production emerges from the asymmetric and hierarchical architecture of their biochemical networks. We introduce a general conceptual and mathematical framework in which biological structuration is understood as a dynamical property. Characterized by asymmetric couplings and transient amplification despite asymptotic stability, non-normal dynamics are shown to naturally generate kinetic acceleration, enhanced energy throughput, and phase-transition-like reorganizations without classical bifurcations. In this view, biological organization is not merely compatible with dissipation but actively structured to amplify free-energy flux and entropy export. We support this perspective with empirical and theoretical evidence that biochemical networks generically give rise to intrinsically non-normal operators through non-reciprocal interactions and hierarchical design. This framework yields testable predictions for dissipation rates, robustness, and evolutionary design principles, and suggests a kinetic principle of evolution in which living systems preferentially construct increasingly non-normal reaction architectures, driving sustained amplification of chemical fluxes and entropy flow.</description>

      <title>Load-Aware Calibration of EMG-Driven Musculoskeletal Models for Accurate and Generalizable Joint Torque Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate EMG-driven musculoskeletal (MSK) modeling is critical for biomechanics, rehabilitation, and assistive technology. However, most models calibrate parameters under a single load, ignoring the fact that tasks with similar kinematics may differ in mechanical demand. This study introduces a load-aware calibration framework to improve joint torque prediction accuracy and generalizability. Surface EMG and joint kinematics were recorded from eleven participants during elbow flexion-extension under 0, 2, and 4\,kg loads. We evaluated three calibration strategies (load-specific, global, cross-load) and three optimization frameworks (simulated annealing (SA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and hybrid PSO-pattern search (PSO-PS)). Results indicate that load-specific calibration significantly improves performance, with lower RMSE and higher correlation ($r &gt; 0.75$). Parameters related to muscle force, fiber length, and activation dynamics showed high load sensitivity. PSO-based methods yielded more consistent and physiologically plausible estimates than simulated annealing. The proposed framework enables MSK models to distinguish between visually similar but mechanically distinct tasks, supporting robust subject-specific modeling for clinical and real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Endoplasmic Reticulum Structure Determines Optimal Ribosome Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work has shown an increasing interest in understanding the structure of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and how ribosomes are displayed on it. Here we present a model that explains a physical reason for why the cell creates different structures of the ER. Due to the diffusion of biomolecules, we find that flat sheets and a matrix of tubules have different regimes of optimized capture efficiency. We extend the model to explain the observed difference in density of ribosomes on the structures of the ER. Due to the capture efficiency of tubules, less ribosomes are needed on those structures. For flat sheets, more ribosome coverage at biological separation distance is needed to match the same fraction of relative flux. We then push the model to predict that depending on the future life of the translated protein and overall demand for protein expression, the cell will utilize one structure of the ER over another. Predictions are compared with experimental data.</description>

      <title>Is the active suspension in a complex viscoelastic fluid more chaotic or more ordered?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The habitat of microorganisms is typically complex and viscoelastic. A natural question arises: Do polymers in a suspension of active swimmers enhance chaotic motion or promote orientational order? We address this issue by performing lattice Boltzmann simulations of squirmer suspensions in polymer solutions. At intermediate swimmer volume fractions, comparing to the Newtonian counterpart, polymers enhance polarization by up to a factor of 26 for neutral squirmers and 5 for pullers, thereby notably increasing orientational order. This effect arises from hydrodynamic feedback mechanism: squirmers stretch and align polymers, which in turn reinforce swimmer orientation and enhance polarization via hydrodynamic and steric interactions. The mechanism is validated by a positive correlation between polarization and a defined polymer-swimmer alignment parameter. Our findings establish a framework for understanding collective motion in complex fluids and suggest strategies for controlling active systems via polymer-mediated interactions.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Emergence of Selection Prior to Biological Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Selection is central to biological evolution, yet there has been no general experimental framework for quantifying selection in chemical systems before life. Here we demonstrate that selection in a prebiological chemical system can be directly quantified. Assembly Theory predicts that selection corresponds to a transition from undirected to directed exploration of chemical possibility space, measurable through the amount of Assembly, A, which integrates molecular assembly index with observed copy number. By analysing peptide ensembles produced under diverse polymerisation conditions, we show that undirected reactions explore sequence space almost uniformly, yielding exploration ratios of 0.85-0.95, whereas reactions influenced by evolved proteases generate markedly lower ratios (0.51-0.75) and elevated A, consistent with selective reinforcement of specific assembly pathways. Across multiple environments and amino-acid combinations, the exploration ratio and ensemble assembly A robustly distinguish directed from undirected exploration, establishing a general, experimentally tractable metric for detecting and measuring selection in chemical evolution.</description>

      <title>A Fixed-Volume Variant of Gibbs-Ensemble Monte Carlo Yields Significant Speedup in Binodal Calculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gibbs-ensemble Monte Carlo (GEMC) is a powerful method for calculating the gas-liquid binodals of simple models and small molecules, but is too demanding computationally for realistic models of proteins. Here we discover that the main reason for long simulations is that volume exchange is very slow to achieve, and develop a variant GEMC without volume exchange. The key is to determine an appropriate initial density. Test of this fixed-volume GEMC method on Lennard-Jones and patchy particles shows enormous speedup without any loss of accuracy in predicted binodals. The fast speed of fixed-volume GEMC promises many applications.</description>

      <title>Enhanced sinterability and in vitro bioactivity of diopside through fluoride doping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, diopside (CaMgSi2O6) was doped with fluoride at a level of 1 mol.%, without the formation of any second phase, by a wet chemical precipitation method. The sintered structure of the synthesized nanopowders was studied by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and field-emission scanning electron microscopy. Also, the samples' in vitro apatite-forming ability in a simulated body fluid was comparatively evaluated by electron microscopy, inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. According to the results, the material's sinterability was improved by fluoride doping, as realized from the further development of sintering necks. It was also found that compared to the undoped bioceramic, a higher amount of apatite was deposited on the surface of the doped sample. It is concluded that fluoride can be considered as a doping agent in magnesium-containing silicates to improve biological, particularly bioactivity, behaviors.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Vascularity in Gelatin Scaffolds via Copper-Doped Magnesium-Calcium Silicates Incorporation: In-Vitro and Ex-Ovo Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Addressing a critical challenge in current tissue-engineering practices, this study aims to enhance vascularization in 3D porous scaffolds by incorporating bioceramics laden with pro-angiogenic ions. Specifically, freeze-dried gelatin-based scaffolds were infused with sol-gel-derived powders of Cu-doped akermanite (Ca2MgSi2O7) and bredigite (Ca7MgSi4O16) at various concentrations (10, 20, and 30 wt%). The scaffolds were initially characterized for their structural integrity, biodegradability, swelling behavior, impact on physiological pH, and cytocompatibility with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The silicate incorporation effectiveness in promoting vascularity was then assessed through HUVEC attachment, capillary tube formation, and ex-ovo chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane assays. The findings revealed significant improvements in both in-vitro and ex-ovo vascularity of the gelatin scaffolds upon the addition of Cu-doped akermanite. The most effective concentrations were determined to be 10 and 20%, which led to notable HUVEC metabolic activity, a well-spread morphology with extensive peripheral filopodia and lamellipodia at 10% and a cobblestone phenotype indicative of in-vivo endothelium at 20% during cell attachment, the formation of complex networks of tubular structures, and robust vascularization in chick embryo development. Moving forward, the incorporation of Cu-doped akermanite into tissue-engineering scaffolds shows great potential for addressing the limitations of vascularization, especially for critical-sized bone defects, by facilitating the controlled release of pro-angiogenic and pro-osteogenic ions.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning of Temperature-dependent Chemical Kinetics Using Parallel Droplet Microreactors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temperature is a fundamental regulator of chemical and biochemical kinetics, yet capturing nonlinear thermal effects directly from experimental data remains a major challenge due to limited throughput and model flexibility. Recent advances in machine learning have enabled flexible modeling beyond conventional physical laws, but most existing strategies remain confined to surrogate models of end-point yields rather than full kinetic dynamics. Consequently, an end-to-end framework that unifies systematic kinetic data acquisition with machine learning based modeling has been lacking. In this paper, we present a unified framework that integrates droplet microfluidics with machine learning for the systematic analysis of temperature-dependent reaction kinetics. The platform is specifically designed to enable stable immobilization and long-term time-lapse imaging of thousands of droplets under dynamic thermal gradients. This configuration yields massively parallel time-resolved datasets across diverse temperature conditions that capture transient kinetics and provides particularly suitable inputs for training machine-learning models of reaction dynamics. Leveraging these datasets, we train Neural ODE models, which embed neural networks within differential equations to flexibly represent nonlinear temperature dependencies beyond conventional formulations. We demonstrate accurate prediction of enzymatic kinetics across diverse thermal environments, highlighting the robustness and versatility of the approach. Our framework bridges high-throughput experimental data acquisition with data-driven modeling, establishing a versatile foundation for enhanced predictive ability and rational analysis and design of temperature-sensitive biochemical processes.</description>

      <title>Topological Flux on a Context Manifold Generates Nonreciprocal Collective Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal interactions, where the influence of agent $i$ on $j$ differs from that of $j$ on $i$, are fundamental in active and living matter. Yet, most models implement such asymmetry phenomenologically. Here we show that non-reciprocity can emerge from internal topology alone. Agents evolve on an internal ``context manifold'' coupled to a Chern-Simons gauge field. Because the gauge field is first order in time, it relaxes rapidly; eliminating it yields an effective transverse, antisymmetric interaction kernel that generically produces chiral waves, persistent vorticity, and irreversible state transitions. Numerical simulations reveal clear signatures of broken reciprocity: long-lived vortex cores, finite circulation, asymmetric information flow, and a nonzero reciprocity residual. The dynamics further exhibit pronounced hysteresis under parameter sweeps, demonstrating memory effects that cannot occur in reciprocal or potential-driven systems. These results identify Chern-Simons gauge fields as a minimal and universal source of directional influence and robust non-reciprocal collective behavior.</description>

      <title>Separating water content from network dynamics in cell nuclei with Brillouin microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Probing forces, deformations and generally speaking the mechanical properties of cells is the hallmark of mechanobiology. In the last two decades many techniques have been developed to this end that are largely based on deforming the cells and measuring the reaction force. In cells, an alternative approach has been implemented mid 2010's, based on Brillouin Light Scattering (BLS) that produces a spectrum that can be interpreted as the response of the sample to an infinitesimal uniaxial compression at picosecond timescales. In all of these measurements, the response of the cell is quantified with a colloquial "stiffness" that encompasses both the contribution of load-bearing structures and volume changes, much to confusion. To clarify the interpretation of the hypersonic data obtained from BLS spectra, we vary the relative volume fraction of intracellular water and solid network by applying osmotic compressions to single cells. In the nucleus, we observe a non-linear increase in the sound velocity and attenuation with increasing osmotic pressure that we fit to a poroelastic model, providing an estimate of the friction coefficient between the water phase and the network. By comparing BLS data to volume measurements, our approach demonstrates clearly that BLS shift alone is mostly sensitive to water content while the additional analysis of the linewidth allows identifying the contribution of the biopolymer-based network dynamics in living cells.</description>

Abstract: In earlier work, we introduced a discrete Fibonacci-based ontogenetic model in which the metabolic scaling exponent $b(n)$ is treated as a dynamic function of an organism's developmental stage, and we estimated $b(n)$ for selected mammalian species. In the present article, we revisit this framework with a complementary aim. Rather than proposing new parameter estimates or statistical fits, we provide a didactic, step-by-step reconstruction of the derivation that leads from the recursive growth hypothesis to analytical expressions for the stage-dependent exponent $b(n)$. Building directly on these previously obtained exponents, we then incorporate Kleiber's classical result into the model by interpreting the constant $70$ in the law $B \approx 70\,M^{3/4}$ (with $B$ denoting basal metabolic rate and $M$ body mass) as a metabolic "anchoring point". This yields a stage-dependent basal metabolic rate of the form $B(n) = 70\,M^{b(n)}$, which defines an ontogenetic metabolic trajectory linking recursive growth to changes in scaling. We show, at a conceptual level, how this anchored formulation can describe a shift from strongly sublinear behavior at early stages towards an almost linear regime as development proceeds, while still producing basal rates that are compatible, in order of magnitude, with those reported for mammals of different sizes. In this way, the paper offers a self-contained and pedagogical presentation of the model, emphasizing how ontogenetic changes in metabolic rate can be understood through the combined ideas of Fibonacci-like recursion and metabolic anchoring.</description>

      <title>Full-Wave Optical Modeling of Leaf Internal Light Scattering Dynamics with Potential Applications for Early Detection of Foliar Fungal Disease</title>

Abstract: Light interacting with plant leaves undergoes reflection, transmission, scattering, and absorption, which together determine leaf optical properties. Changes in leaf architecture disrupt internal light scattering dynamics and consequently affect photosynthetic performance. Previous studies on internal leaf light scattering have primarily relied on ray-tracing approaches (e.g., Raytran) or radiative-transfer models (e.g., PROSPECT). However, these high-frequency approximations cannot capture diffraction and coherent multiple scattering in wavelength-scale leaf tissues, unlike full-wave electromagnetic simulations. Here, we employ GPU-accelerated Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) simulations to model internal light scattering dynamics using segmented cross-section image geometries of representative dicot and monocot leaves with wavelength-dependent complex refractive indices. The simulations accurately reproduce the reflectance and transmittance characteristics of healthy leaves, showing strong agreement with the PROSPECT model, with average Lin's concordance values of 0.8962 for dicot leaves and 0.7849 for monocot leaves. We further simulate early-stage necrotrophic fungal infection by modeling melanized hyphae penetrating the cuticle and upper epidermis. Diseased leaves exhibit a pronounced reduction in visible green reflectance and a marked suppression of the near-infrared reflectance plateau, consistent with experimental observations. Remaining discrepancies in the visible band are expected to be reduced through more advanced geometric and material modeling. This proof-of-concept study presents a full-wave FDTD optical modeling framework for plant-leaf light scattering, enabling physics-based analysis of internal scattering before and after early-stage fungal penetration and supporting the use of light scattering as an indicator for pre-symptomatic plant fungal disease detection.</description>

      <title>Slow spatial migration can help eradicate cooperative antimicrobial resistance in time-varying environments</title>

Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global threat and combating its spread is of paramount importance. AMR often results from a cooperative behaviour with shared drug protection. Microbial communities generally evolve in volatile, spatially structured settings. Migration, space, fluctuations, and environmental variability all have a significant impact on the development and proliferation of AMR. While drug resistance is enhanced by migration in static conditions, this changes in time-fluctuating spatially structured environments. Here, we consider a two-dimensional metapopulation consisting of demes in which drug-resistant and sensitive cells evolve in a time-changing environment. This contains a toxin against which protection can be shared (cooperative AMR). Cells migrate between demes and connect them. When the environment and the deme composition vary on the same timescale, strong population bottlenecks cause fluctuation-driven extinction events, countered by migration. We investigate the influence of migration and environmental variability on the AMR eco-evolutionary dynamics by asking at what migration rate fluctuations can help clear resistance and what are the near-optimal environmental conditions ensuring the quasi-certain eradication of resistance in the shortest possible time. By combining analytical and computational tools, we answer these questions by determining when the resistant strain goes extinct across the entire metapopulation. While dispersal generally promotes strain coexistence, here we show that slow-but-nonzero migration can speed up and enhance resistance clearance, and determine the near-optimal conditions for this phenomenon. We discuss the impact of our findings on laboratory-controlled experiments and outline their generalisation to lattices of any spatial dimension.</description>

      <title>Neutral theory of cooperative dynamics</title>

Abstract: Mutualistic interactions are widespread in nature, from plant communities and microbiomes to human organizations. Along with competition for resources, cooperative interactions shape biodiversity and contribute to the robustness of complex ecosystems. We present a stochastic neutral theory of cooperator species. Our model shares with the classic neutral theory of biodiversity the assumption that all species are equivalent, but crucially differs in requiring cooperation between species for replication. With low migration, our model displays a bimodal species-abundance distribution, with a high-abundance mode associated with a core of cooperating species. This core is responsible for maintaining a diverse pool of long-lived species, which are present even at very small migration rates. We derive analytical expressions of the steady-state species abundance distribution, as well as scaling laws for diversity, number of species, and residence times. With high migration, our model recovers the results of classic neutral theory. We briefly discuss implications of our analysis for research on the microbiome, synthetic biology, and the origin of life.</description>

      <title>Controlling the collective transport of large passive particles with suspensions of microorganisms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08133v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A promising approach to transport cargo at the microscale lies within the use of self-propelled microorganisms, whose motion entrains that of passive particles. However, most applications remain limited to just a few passive particles of similar size as the microorganisms, since the transport mechanism relies on the interaction between individual swimmers and single particles. Here, we demonstrate how to control the collective transport of hundreds of large passive particles with phototactic microalga. Using directional light stimuli in suspensions of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, we trigger bioconvection rolls capable of macroscale transport. Passive particles an order of magnitude larger than the microalgae are either attracted or repelled by the rolls depending on their density. Using experiments and simulation, we rationalize these bioconvective flows and describe how to harness them for cargo transport, with future applications in targeted drug delivery and decontamination.</description>

      <title>3D printed waveguides for optogenetics applications: design optimization and optical characterization</title>

Abstract: Optogenetics has emerged as a powerful tool for disease modeling, enabling precise control of cellular activities through light stimulation and providing a valuable insights into disease mechanisms and therapeutic possibilities. Innovative materials and technologies such as micro-LEDs, optical fibers and micro/nano probes have been developed to allow precise spatial and temporal control of light delivery to target cells. Recent advances in 3D printing have further enhanced optogenetic applications by enabling the fabrication of implantable, customizable, and miniaturized light stimulation systems with high spatial resolution. In this study, we introduce a novel concept of a 3D printed light delivery system for brain organoid stimulation exploring the capabilities of projection microstereolithography (P$\mu$SL). We characterized the optical properties of the high-resolution acrylate-based 3D print resin, i.e., refractive index and extinction coefficient, to evaluate if the light transmission efficiency might limit the performance of the optogenetic stimulation systems. Finite element method simulations were employed to optimize the 3D printed design. An optogenetic setup was developed for optimal light delivery, and initial tests with optogenetically modified cells showed light-induced dopamine release with a stimulation efficiency of 2.8\%, confirming the 3D printed waveguide functionality and guiding future optimization. Our results demonstrate that this light stimulation tool offers strong potential for advancing customizable optogenetic applications.</description>

      <title>Decomposing Non-Markovian History Dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13933v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Markovian stochastic processes are ubiquitous in biology. Nevertheless, we lack a general framework for quantifying historical dependencies. In this Letter, we propose an information-theoretic approach to decompose history dependence in systems with non-Markovian dynamics, quantifying the information encoded in dependencies of each order. In minimal models of non-Markovian dynamics, we show that this framework correctly captures the underlying historical dependencies, even when autocorrelations do not. In prolonged recordings of fly behavior, we find that the scaling of non-Markovian dependencies is invariant across timescales from fractions of a second to minutes. Despite this invariance, the overall amount of non-Markovian information is non-monotonic, suggesting a unique timescale on which historical dependencies are strongest.</description>
