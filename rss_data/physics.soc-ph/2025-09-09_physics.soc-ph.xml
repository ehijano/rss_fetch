      <title>A note on the mechanism of substitution of labour with capital in the production processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considering the production processes, it was noted that the use of various equipment leads to an increase in output -- the phenomenon that is usually described as the substitution of labor with capital. The proposed theory of substitution is based on the assumption that not the quantity of capital (production equipment) does substitute labor, but rather its ability to operate similar to the workers. This is the true content of the substitution of labor by capital. To formulate a correct mechanism of substitution requires considering three factors of production: the amount of production equipment (capital $K$), human activity (labor $L$), and the substitutive capacity of equipment (substitutive work $P$). The technological properties of production equipment are characterized by the technological coefficients $\overline \lambda$ and $\overline \varepsilon$, indicating the amount of labor and energy required to engaged with a unit of equipment. The production function can assume various forms, none of which coincide with the popular Cobb-Douglas expression, which seems to be erroneous in its core.</description>

      <title>Recursive Hierarchical Networks and the Law of Functional Evolution: A Universal Framework for Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and predicting the evolution of across complex systems remains a fundamental challenge due to the absence of unified and computationally testable frameworks. Here we propose the Recursive Hierarchical Network(RHN), conceptualizing evolution as recursive encapsulation along a trajectory of node $\to$ module $\to$ system $\to$ new node, governed by gradual accumulation and abrupt transition. Theoretically, we formalize and prove the law of functional evolution, revealing an irreversible progression from structure-dominated to regulation-dominated to intelligence-dominated stages. Empirically, we operationalize functional levels and align life, cosmic, informational, and social systems onto this scale. The resulting trajectories are strictly monotonic and exhibit strong cross-system similarity, with high pairwise cosine similarities and robust stage resonance. We locate current system states and project future transitions. RHN provides a mathematically rigorous, multi-scale framework for reconstructing and predicting system evolution, offering theoretical guidance for designing next-generation intelligent systems.</description>

      <title>The origin of long-range links of air pollution in China</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weather conditions significantly influence the formation and dispersion of pollution variations. Here we study networks of pollution as well as climate networks and find that pollutants may not only have an impact close to their source but also show a significant correlation with pollutant concentrations thousands of kilometers away. We develop a pollution network model based on cross-correlation between PM2.5 concentration time series in different sites in China to detect stable long-range links during the last ten years. A multi-network analysis of the 500 hPa geopotential height and PM2.5 concentration suggests that long-range correlations in PM2.5 levels are also influenced by synoptic activity.</description>

      <title>Mean-field Modeling of Social Interactions Using Classical Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incorporating social interactions is essential to an accurate modeling of epidemic spreading. This work proposes a novel local mean-field density functional theory model by using the sum-of-exponential approximation of convolution kernels for social interactions, which in turn converts the convolution terms into interaction potentials that are governed by the Debye-H\"uckel equation. Thanks to the local formulation of the proposed model, linear stability analysis is able to derive a novel instability condition associated with cross interactions. Global existence of the solution to the proposed model with a simplified self-repulsive interaction potential is established. Extensive numerical simulations are performed to assess the impact of cross social interactions on transmission and isolation, verify the instability conditions obtained from linear stability analysis, and provide theoretical guides for the control of disease spreading.</description>

      <title>Second-order multilane traffic flow models: from the microscopic to the macroscopic scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study addresses multilane vehicular traffic modelling, focusing on the transition between microscopic (individual vehicle-based) to macroscopic (aggregate flow-based) descriptions. While previous research on multilane traffic has largely focused on first-order models, we derive two new multilane second-order macroscopic models by applying a microscopic-to-macroscopic limit to the multilane Bando-Follow-the-Leader model. The resulting models incorporate lane-changing through source terms in a hyperbolic system of balance laws. We propose several numerical experiments showing that the models can reproduce complex traffic phenomena, including congestion propagation, non-equilibrium effects, and asymmetric lane usage. Leveraging experimental datasets from real-world highways, we further construct lane-specific empirical fundamental diagrams and compare them with their simulated counterparts, showing that our models can faithfully capture critical density values and characteristic lane-dependent patterns, thus offering a robust and generalizable tool for realistic traffic flow analysis</description>

      <title>The three-dimensional structure of population density in world cities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A good understanding of cities is crucial to implement urban planning policies leading to social and economic sustainability and an efficient use of resources. While urban concentration has been associated with both positive and negative effects, echoing debates on compact cities, few studies have documented how density evolves with city size. We fill this gap by investigating how the population density radial structure changes across the urban hierarchy. Our results uncover strong regularities in urban settlements. In terms of density, cities can be seen as exponential cones which evolve homothetically with city population. This rather simple but universal geometric structure of cities provides a new spatial scaling law, which is an important step forward in understanding how cities work and grow. Some deviations can be observed, which mainly oppose dense cities in the developing world and sprawled cities in high-income countries, associated with high energy use per capita. This suggests that urban lifestyle in wealthiest countries has come at the price of negative impacts on environmental outcomes. This research has a broad range of applications as it provides a powerful tool to compare cities of different sizes.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking, Group Decision Making and Beyond 2. Distorted Polarization and Vulnerability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper extends previous work on echo chambers modeled by an Ising-like system at zero temperature (1. Echo Chambers and random Polarization, Symmetry 2024, 16(12), 1566). There, polarization emerged as a spontaneous symmetry-breaking process with a randomly selected direction. Here using a mean-field analysis and Monte Carlo simulations I show that this mechanism is highly vulnerable to minimal distortions. An external symmetry-breaking field, even vanishingly small, suffices to impose a global direction and suppress opposite domains, producing distorted full polarization. In contrast, a handful of quenched local fields with zero average do not erase polarization but reorganize it into opposing domains. Remarkably, as few as two opposed fields, if placed at tipping sites, can redirect the entire system. These fragile sites, indistinguishable from others, act as hidden tipping points that amplify microscopic biases into macroscopic outcomes. Difference in local field proportions is found to be instrumental to guarantee a winning majority. The results highlight how minimal, strategically placed interventions can override autonomous self-organization. The results could, if applicable on social media platforms, question their presumed democratic nature of consensus.</description>

      <title>How competition propels scientific risk-taking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In science as elsewhere, attention is a limited resource and scientists compete with one another to produce the most exciting, novel and impactful results. We develop a game-theoretic model to explore how such competition influences the degree of risk that scientists are willing to embrace in their research endeavors. We find that competition for scarce resources -- for example, publications in elite journals, prestigious prizes, and faculty jobs -- motivates scientific risk-taking and may be important in counterbalancing other incentives that favor cautious, incremental science. Even small amounts of competition induce substantial risk-taking. Moreover, we find that in an ``opt-in'' contest, increasing the stakes induces increased participation -- which crowds the contest and further impels entrants to pursue higher-risk, higher-return investigations. The model also illuminates a source of tension in academic training and collaboration. Researchers at different career stages differ in their need to amass accomplishments that distinguish them from their peers, and therefore may not agree on what degree of risk to accept.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Interaction and Bias Effects in Opinion Dynamics of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly used to simulate human opinion dynamics, yet the effect of genuine interaction is often obscured by systematic biases. We present a Bayesian framework to disentangle and quantify three such biases: (i) a topic bias toward prior opinions in the training data; (ii) an agreement bias favoring agreement irrespective of the question; and (iii) an anchoring bias toward the initiating agent's stance. Applying this framework to multi-step dialogues reveals that opinion trajectories tend to quickly converge to a shared attractor, with the influence of the interaction fading over time, and the impact of biases differing between LLMs. In addition, we fine-tune an LLM on different sets of strongly opinionated statements (incl. misinformation) and demonstrate that the opinion attractor shifts correspondingly. Exposing stark differences between LLMs and providing quantitative tools to compare them to human subjects in the future, our approach highlights both chances and pitfalls in using LLMs as proxies for human behavior.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Compartment Model of Epidemic Spreading in Complex Networks with Mortality and Resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an epidemic compartment model, which includes mortality caused by the disease, but excludes demographic birth and death processes. Individuals are represented by random walkers, which are in one of the following states (compartments) S (susceptible to infection), E (exposed: infected but not infectious corresponding to the latency period), I (infected and infectious), R (recovered, immune), D (dead). The disease is transmitted with a certain probability at contacts of I to S walkers. The compartmental sojourn times are independent random variables drawn from specific (here Gamma-) distributions. We implement this model into random walk simulations. Each walker performs an independent simple Markovian random walk on a graph, where we consider a Watts-Strogatz (WS) network. Only I walkers may die. For zero mortality, we prove the existence of an endemic equilibrium for basic reproduction number ${\cal R}_0 &gt; 1$ and for which the disease free (globally healthy) state is unstable. We explore the effects of long-range-journeys (stochastic resetting) and mortality. Our model allows for various interpretations, such as certain chemical reactions, the propagation of wildfires, and in population dynamics.</description>

      <title>A Spatiotemporal Adaptive Local Search Method for Tracking Congestion Propagation in Dynamic Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traffic congestion propagation poses significant challenges to urban sustainability, disrupting spatial accessibility. The cascading effect of traffic congestion propagation can cause large-scale disruptions to networks. Existing studies have laid a solid foundation for characterizing the cascading effects. However, they typically rely on predefined graph structures and lack adaptability to diverse data granularities. To address these limitations, we propose a spatiotemporal adaptive local search (STALS) method, which feeds the dynamically adaptive adjacency matrices into the local search algorithm to learn propagation rules. Specifically, the STALS is composed of two data-driven modules. One is a dynamic adjacency matrix learning module, which learns the spatiotemporal relationship from congestion graphs by fusing four node features. The other one is the local search module, which introduces local dominance to identify multi-scale congestion bottlenecks and search their propagation pathways. We test our method on the four benchmark networks with an average of 15,000 nodes. The STALS remains a Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) score at 0.97 and an average execution time of 27.66s, outperforming six state-of-the-art methods in robustness and efficiency. We also apply the STALS to three large-scale traffic networks in New York City, the United States, Shanghai, China, and Urumqi, China. The ablation study reveals an average modularity of 0.78 across three cities, demonstrating the spatiotemporal-scale invariance of frequencytransformed features and the spatial heterogeneity of geometric topological features. By integrating dynamic graph learning with Geo-driven spatial analytics, STALS provides a scalable tool for congestion mitigation.</description>

      <title>Learning to detect continuous gravitational waves: an open data-analysis competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report results of a public data-analysis challenge, hosted on the open data-science platform Kaggle, to detect simulated continuous gravitational-wave signals. These are weak signals from rapidly spinning neutron stars that remain undetected despite extensive searches. The competition dataset consisted of a population of CW signals using both simulated and real LIGO detector data matching the conditions of actual CW searches. The competition attracted more than 1,000 participants to develop realistic CW search algorithms. We describe the top 10 approaches and discuss their applicability as a pre-processing step compared to standard CW-search approaches. For the competition's dataset, we find that top approaches can reduce the computing cost by 1 to 3 orders of magnitude at a 2% dismissal probability. Additionally, the competition drove the development of new GPU-accelerated detection pipelines and extended CW-inspired statistics to other domains. We release the associated dataset, which constitutes the first open standardized benchmark for CW detection, to enable reproducible method comparisons and to encourage further developments toward the first detection of these elusive signals.</description>

      <title>Properties of pedestrians walking in line without density constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article deals with the experimental study of pedestrian behaviours in some situations of one-dimensional traffic. Participants were pre-organized in a line, and asked to walk either in a straight line with a fast or slow leader, or to form a circle. The originality of our experimental protocol compared to previous ones on similar situations, is to have left the condition of density free. While the observed density results from individual decisions in the line case, both density and velocity have to be collectively chosen in the case of circle formation. Our major findings are the following. In the case of circle formations, we observe that the resulting velocity is very stable among realizations, as if collective decision was playing the role of an average. For line flows with a slow leader, the same operating point close to the jamming transition is chosen as in previous experiments where it was not velocity but density that was imposed. In the less constrained line experiments, although participants could choose comfortable headways, they rather stick to short headways requiring a faster adaption - a fact that could come from a "social pressure from behind" and had previously only been observed at high densities. This could be due to the uncertainty and individual responsibility that stem in less constrained situations. Our results open new avenues for future research, as they show that the walking values preferred by humans in following tasks depend on more factors than previously considered.</description>

      <title>Universal emergence of local Zipf's law</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15946v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A plethora of natural and socio-economic phenomena share a striking statistical regularity, that is the magnitude of elements decreases with a power law as a function of their position in a ranking of magnitude. Such regularity is known as Zipf-Mandelbrot law (ZM), and plenty of problem-specific explanations for its emergence have been provided in different fields. Yet, an explanation for ZM ubiquity is currently lacking. In this paper we first provide an analytical expression for the cumulants of any ranked sample of i.i.d. random variables once sorted in decreasing order. Then we make use of this result to rigorously demonstrate that, whenever a small fraction of such ranked dataset is considered, it becomes statistically indistinguishable from a ZM law. We finally validate our results against several relevant examples.</description>

      <title>Pedestrian fluxes in confined geometric networks: entropic measures and robustness of accessibility in a university campus</title>

Abstract: When discussing urban life, pedestrian accessibility to all main services is crucial for fostering social interactions, promoting healthy lifestyles, and reducing pollution. This is especially relevant in coherent urban agglomerations like university campuses, which feature a high concentration of streets and social facilities. Using Wi-Fi data, we study pedestrian movements within a confined geometric network representing the pathways on a university campus. We estimate the level of crowding in each arc of the network and identify pedestrian flows along all possible paths, measuring the entropy and robustness of the network. In particular, we calculate the information gain achieved through the use of Wi-Fi data and we assess how pedestrian traffic redistributes within the network after the removal of individual arcs. Our results can be used to facilitate the investigation of the current state of walkability across the university campus while also testing a set of methods for analyzing urban complex networks, potentially allowing us to pinpoint areas in urgent need of road maintenance and enhancement.</description>

      <title>Policy, Risk, and Norms Shape Collective Behaviors Worldwide</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15098v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Societal responses to environmental change vary widely, even under comparable shocks, reflecting differences in both policy measures and public reactions shaped by cultural and socioeconomic contexts. We examine mask-wearing dynamics across 47 countries during the COVID-19 pandemic using a process-based, utility-driven model of individual behavior with three evolving drivers: policy stringency, disease risk, and social norms to understand emergent collective behavior. Calibrated with daily data on mask usage, COVID-19 deaths, and policy mandates, the model reproduces diverse national trajectories with minimal complexity. Policy and norms are crucial for explaining variation, and we find significant associations between weights for all three drivers and cultural and socioeconomic indicators. Our findings demonstrate how mechanistic models can uncover the processes shaping collective behavior, enabling policymakers to anticipate the magnitude and timing of behavioral change and design more effective, context-sensitive interventions.</description>

      <title>The Recursive Panopticon Hypothesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cosmic "Great Silence" revealed by the Fermi paradox remains a central puzzle in contemporary science. Existing explanations such as the "Big Filter," "Zoo Hypothesis," and "Dark Forest" theory are trapped in isolated frameworks of "hypothesis list paradigm" that resist falsification. This paper proposes the "Recursive Panopticon Hypothesis" arguing that under the uncertainty of recursive higher-order deterrence, cosmic civilizations will universally adopt "silence" as their optimal survival strategy through rational risk avoidance. To test this hypothesis, we innovatively introduce the interdisciplinary research paradigm of "Computational Cosmic Sociology." By constructing a highly parameterized Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) simulation, we abstract civilizations as rational agents with risk perception, strategy learning, and interactive memory evolving within a simulated cosmic grid. The model's core lies in a utility function based on recursive deterrence theory and a network co-evolution mechanism connecting micro-decisions with macro-social structures. Research findings indicate: "Silence" is an evolutionarily stable strategy; the "Dark Forest" state is merely a special case of system instability under extreme resource scarcity and high-density civilizations; civilizational interactions spontaneously form structured social networks with small-world properties; and a hypothetical "Ultimate Civilization" can effectively maintain order. This study aims to drive paradigm shifts, from listing mutually exclusive hypotheses to a unified, computable theoretical framework, thereby establishing an empirical foundation for cosmological sociology and providing profound insights for SETI strategies.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Social Costs of Power Outages and Restoration Disparities Across Four U.S. Hurricanes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The multifaceted nature of disaster impact shows that densely populated areas contribute more to aggregate burden, while sparsely populated but heavily affected regions suffer disproportionately at the individual level. This study introduces a framework for quantifying the societal impacts of power outages by translating customer weighted outage exposure into deprivation measures, integrating welfare metrics with three recovery indicators, average outage days per customer, restoration duration, and relative restoration rate, computed from sequential EAGLE I observations and linked to Zip Code Tabulation Area demographics. Applied to four United States hurricanes, Beryl 2024 Texas, Helene 2024 Florida, Milton 2024 Florida, and Ida 2021 Louisiana, this standardized pipeline provides the first cross event, fine scale evaluation of outage impacts and their drivers. Results demonstrate regressive patterns with greater burdens in lower income areas, mechanistic analysis shows deprivation increases with longer restoration durations and decreases with faster restoration rates, explainable modeling identifies restoration duration as the dominant driver, and clustering reveals distinct recovery typologies not captured by conventional reliability metrics. This framework delivers a transferable method for assessing outage impacts and equity, comparative cross event evidence linking restoration dynamics to social outcomes, and actionable spatial analyses that support equity informed restoration planning and resilience investment.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-driven Community Resilience Rating based on Intertwined Socio-Technical Systems Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Community resilience is a complex and muti-faceted phenomenon that emerges from complex and nonlinear interactions among different socio-technical systems and their resilience properties. However, present studies on community resilience focus primarily on vulnerability assessment and utilize index-based approaches, with limited ability to capture heterogeneous features within community socio-technical systems and their nonlinear interactions in shaping robustness, redundancy, and resourcefulness components of resilience. To address this gap, this paper presents an integrated three-layer deep learning model for community resilience rating (called Resili-Net). Twelve measurable resilience features are specified and computed within community socio-technical systems (i.e., facilities, infrastructures, and society) related to three resilience components of robustness, redundancy, and resourcefulness. Using publicly accessible data from multiple metropolitan statistical areas in the United States, Resili-Net characterizes the resilience levels of spatial areas into five distinct levels. The interpretability of the model outcomes enables feature analysis for specifying the determinants of resilience in areas within each resilience level, allowing for the identification of specific resilience enhancement strategies. Changes in community resilience profiles under urban development patterns are further examined by changing the value of related socio-technical systems features. Accordingly, the outcomes provide novel perspectives for community resilience assessment by harnessing machine intelligence and heterogeneous urban big data.</description>

      <title>Destabilizing a Social Network Model via Intrinsic Feedback Vulnerabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10868v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social influence plays a significant role in shaping individual sentiments and actions, particularly in a world of ubiquitous digital interconnection. The rapid development of generative AI has engendered well-founded concerns regarding the potential scalable implementation of radicalization techniques in social media. Motivated by these developments, we present a case study investigating the effects of small but intentional perturbations on a simple social network. We employ Taylor's classic model of social influence and tools from robust control theory (most notably the Dynamical Structure Function (DSF)), to identify perturbations that qualitatively alter the system's behavior while remaining as unobtrusive as possible. We examine two such scenarios: perturbations to an existing link and perturbations that introduce a new link to the network. In each case, we identify destabilizing perturbations of minimal norm and simulate their effects. Remarkably, we find that small but targeted alterations to network structure may lead to the radicalization of all agents, exhibiting the potential for large-scale shifts in collective behavior to be triggered by comparatively minuscule adjustments in social influence. Given that this method of identifying perturbations that are innocuous yet destabilizing applies to any suitable dynamical system, our findings emphasize a need for similar analyses to be carried out on real systems (e.g., real social networks), to identify the places where such dynamics may already exist.</description>

      <title>Uncovering complementary information sharing in spider monkey collective foraging using higher-order spatial networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01167v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collectives are often able to process information in a distributed fashion, surpassing each individual member's processing capacity. In fission-fusion dynamics, where group members come together and split from others often, sharing complementary information about uniquely known foraging areas could allow a group to track a heterogenous foraging environment better than any group member on its own. We analyse the partial overlaps between individual spider monkey core ranges, which we assume represent the knowledge of an individual during a given season. Sets of individuals with complementary overlaps are identified, showing a balance between redundantly and uniquely known portions, and we use simplicial complexes to represent these higher-order interactions. The structure of the simplicial complexes shows holes in various dimensions, revealing complementarity in the foraging information that is being shared. We propose that the complex spatial networks arising from fission-fusion dynamics allow for adaptive, collective processing of foraging information in dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Sequential Monte Carlo Squared for online inference in stochastic epidemic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective epidemic modeling and surveillance require computationally efficient methods that can continuously update estimates as new data becomes available. This paper explores the application of an online variant of Sequential Monte Carlo Squared (O-SMC$^2$) to the stochastic Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model for real-time epidemic tracking. The particularity of O-SMC$^2$ lies in its ability to update the parameters using a particle Metropolis-Hastings kernel, ensuring that the target distribution remains invariant while only utilizing a fixed window of recent observations. This feature enables timely parameter updates and significantly enhances computational efficiency compared to the standard SMC$^2$, which processes the entire dataset. First, we demonstrate the efficiency of O-SMC$^2$ on simulated data, where both the parameters and the observation process are known. We then apply the method to a real-world COVID-19 dataset from Ireland, successfully tracking the epidemic trajectory and estimating the time-dependent reproduction number of the disease. Our results show that O-SMC$^2$ provides highly accurate online estimates of both static and dynamic epidemiological parameters while substantially reducing computational costs. These findings highlight the potential of O-SMC$^2$ for real-time epidemic monitoring and supporting adaptive public health interventions.</description>

      <title>Composing $\alpha$-Gauss and logistic maps: Gradual and sudden transitions to chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the $\alpha$-Gauss-Logistic map, a new nonlinear dynamics constructed by composing the logistic and $\alpha$-Gauss maps. Explicitly, our model is given by $x_{t+1} = f_L(x_t)x_t^{-\alpha} - \lfloor f_L(x_t)x_t^{-\alpha} \rfloor $ where $f_L(x_t) = r x_t (1-x_t)$ is the logistic map and $ \lfloor \ldots \rfloor $ is the integer part function. Our investigation reveals a rich phenomenology depending solely on two parameters, $r$ and $\alpha$. For $\alpha &lt; 1$, the system exhibits multiple period-doubling cascades to chaos as the parameter $r$ is increased, interspersed with stability windows within the chaotic attractor. In contrast, for $1 \leq \alpha &lt; 2$, the onset of chaos is abrupt, occurring without any prior bifurcations, and the resulting chaotic attractors emerge without stability windows. For $\alpha \geq 2$, the regular behavior is absent. The special case of $\alpha = 1$ allows an analytical treatment, yielding a closed-form formula for the Lyapunov exponent and conditions for an exact uniform invariant density, using the Perron-Frobenius equation. Chaotic regimes for $\alpha = 1$ can exhibit gaps or be gapless. Surprisingly, the golden ratio $\Phi$ marks the threshold for the disappearance of the largest gap in the regime diagram. Additionally, at the edge of chaos in the abrupt transition regime, the invariant density approaches a $q$-Gaussian with $q=2$, which corresponds to a Cauchy distribution.</description>
