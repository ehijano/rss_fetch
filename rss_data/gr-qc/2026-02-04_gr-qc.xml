      <title>Quasi-normal modes of quantum gravity black hole with perfectly fluid dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we have studied the motion of a massless scalar photon in the renormalization group (RG) improved Schwarzschild black hole spacetime in the presence of perfectly fluid dark matter (PFDM). Considering the critical orbit conditions and the null geodesics condition in static spherically sym- In metric geometry, we have shown the variation of the radius of the photon sphere $r_{ph}$ with the PFDM parameter $\zeta$. Due to perturbations in black hole spacetime, gravitational waves are emitted in the form of quasi-normal radiations, which correspond to quasi-normal modes (QNMs). In this work, we have studied two types of perturbations in RG improved Schwarzschild spacetime: scalar field perturbations and electromagnetic (EM) field perturbations. For both cases, we have studied the effect of the PFDM parameter on the quasi-normal mode frequencies and the shadow of the black hole, which is related to the photon radius.</description>

      <title>Scale-Invariant Bounce Cosmology in Weyl f(Q) Gravity with Quintom Signature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a bouncing cosmological model within the Weyl-type $f(Q)$ gravity framework, employing a power-law form of the non-metricity scalar $Q$. The model successfully resolves the initial singularity problem by demonstrating a nonsingular bounce, where the universe transitions from a contracting phase $ \dot{a}(t)&lt;0 $ to an expanding phase ($ \dot{a}(t)&gt;0 $) at the bouncing point $t \approx 0.$ Key features include the violation of the null energy condition (NEC) near the bounce and the crossing of the phantom divide line ($\omega=-1$) by the equation of state (EoS) parameter, indicating quintom-like behavior. The model exhibits accelerated expansion post-bounce, suggesting an inflationary phase. Stability analysis via the adiabatic index reveals instability near the bouncing point, while energy conditions highlight the dominance of dark energy. Additionally, the study explores scalar fields, showing that quintessence-like kinetic energy becomes negative and phantom-like kinetic energy peaks positively near the bounce, aligning with dark energy dynamics. The Hubble parameter, deceleration parameter, and Hubble radius further validate the bouncing scenario, with the latter displaying symmetric behaviour around the bounce. These results underscore the viability of Weyl-type $f(Q)$ gravity as a framework for nonsingular bouncing cosmologies, offering insights into early universe dynamics and dark energy behaviour.</description>

      <title>Observational signatures of charged Bardeen black holes in perfect fluid dark matter with a cloud of strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a charged Bardeen black hole (BH) surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM) and coupled to a cloud of strings (CS). The metric function combines the magnetic monopole charge from nonlinear electrodynamics, the PFDM logarithmic correction, and the CS parameter that renders the spacetime asymptotically non-flat. We analyze the horizon structure, identifying parameter ranges yielding non-extremal BHs, extremal configurations, and naked singularities. The null geodesics, photon sphere radius, and shadow are computed, revealing that both CS and PFDM enlarge the shadow. For neutral particle dynamics, we derive the specific energy, angular momentum, and innermost stable circular orbit location. Quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) are examined through the azimuthal, radial, and vertical epicyclic frequencies, where notably the azimuthal frequency is independent of the CS parameter. Scalar field perturbations governed by the Klein-Gordon equation yield an effective potential whose peak decreases with both parameters, yet the transmission and reflection probabilities respond oppositely to CS and PFDM variations. The greybody factor bounds are obtained using semi-analytical methods. Our results demonstrate that the distinct effects of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ on various observables could allow independent constraints on these parameters through shadow measurements, QPO timing, and gravitational wave ringdown observations.</description>

      <title>Matching collapse and expansion across Matter Trapping surfaces in inhomogeneous $\Lambda$CDM models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work we examine the MTS, for the restriction to spherical dust plus $\Lambda$, proving that it actually is a characteristic surface of the Cauchy problem (generated by its characteristic curves), which opens the possibility for infinite solutions. This translate as the MTS being a boundary between arbitrarily independent solutions, reminiscent of the Birkhoff theorem effects. This property is illustrated with combinations of 3 examples containing MTSs and $\Lambda$ ($\Lambda$CDM, Schwarzschild-de\,Sitter, Lema\^itre-Tolman-Bondi-de\,Sitter: LTBdS -- i.e. the inhomogeneous, spherically symmetric $\Lambda$CDM). The LTBdS model presents a static, stable MTS for the first time.</description>

      <title>The emergent Big Bang scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter proposes a new avenue for understanding the cosmological singularity. The standard cosmological model contains a generic initial singularity usually referred to as the {\em big bang}. Herein, we present a novel idea to extend the description of our Universe beyond this limit. The proposal relies on rewriting physics in a purely Riemannian, {\em i.e.} locally Euclidean, 4-dimensional space and the emergence of Lorentzian patches owing to the interaction of all matter fields to a clock field that is responsible for a signature change. If our universe is contained within one of these patches, the initial singularity is replaced by a smooth boundary on which the signature of the physical metric flips. In this letter, we first define the model and draw the necessary conditions on its arbitrary functions for solutions to exist. Next, we prove the existence of solutions that lead to an emergent universe with a primordial (almost) de Sitter phase. To finish, we discuss the consequences of this construction for the universe on scales much larger than our observable universe: a large ``Euclidean sea'' in which Lorentzian islands locally emerge and host an expanding universe potentially similar to ours. While speculative, this scenario has specific features that can be tested, and the present letter sets the basis for further phenomenological investigations.</description>

      <title>Dynamical hair growth in black hole binaries in Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of scalar-tensor theories of gravity, certain models can evade classical black hole no-hair theorems. A well-known example is Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, where black holes carrying a scalar charge can exist. We find that, within this theory, binary black holes initially described by General Relativity can acquire scalar charges once they reach a critical orbital separation ("dynamical scalarization"). We develop a simple semi-analytic model, based on the adiabatic conservation of the total Wald entropy, to estimate the scalar charge evolution during the binary inspiral. We also run fully nonlinear numerical-relativity simulations for different configurations, finding consistent results. The gravitational-wave phase difference between Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet and General Relativity waveforms, which we use to assess detectability, is also computed. We find that dynamical scalarization might be observable in nearly equal-mass binary black hole mergers with third-generation ground-based gravitational-wave detectors, in a narrow range of the dimensional coupling of the theory.</description>

      <title>The favoured twin: on the dynamical response of twin stars to perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If a strong first-order phase transition takes place at sufficiently high rest-mass densities in the equation of state (EOS) modelling compact stars, a new branch will appear in the mass-radius sequence of stable equilibria. This branch will be populated by stars comprising a quark-matter core and a hadronic-matter envelope, i.e., hybrid stars, which represent ``twin-star'' solutions to equilibria having the same mass but a fully hadronic EOS. While both branches are stable to linear perturbations, it is unclear which of the twin solutions is the ``favoured'' one, that is, which of the two configurations is expected to be found in nature. We assess this point by performing a large campaign of general-relativistic simulations aimed at assessing the response of compact stars on the two branches to perturbations of various strength. In this way, we find that, independently of whether the stars populate the hadronic or the twin branch, their response is characterised by a critical-perturbation strength such that the star will oscillate on the original branch for subcritical perturbations and migrate to the neighbouring branch for supercritical perturbations while conserving rest-mass. Because the critical values are different for stars with the same rest-mass but sitting on either branch, it is possible to define as favoured the part of the branch that has the largest critical perturbation, thus correcting the common wisdom that stellar models on the twin branch are the favoured ones. Interestingly, we show that the binding energies on the two branches can be used to deduce without simulations which of the stellar configurations is more likely to be found in nature.</description>

      <title>Comment on ''The space-time line element for static ellipsoidal objects''</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent paper proposes a static ellipsoidal space-time metric that reduces to Schwarzschild. After examining the corrected line element using Maple's Differential geometry package, we find that the Einstein tendor and Ricci scalar are non-zero, and the metric yields non-zero pressures when interpreted as an anisotropic fluid. Thus, it does not represent a vacuum solution. We also checked a cited ellipsoidal metric from the literature and found it likewise fails to satisfy the vacuum Einstein equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We search for violations of the Equivalence Principle towards the Sun using a rotating torsion balance apparatus. We set 95\%-confidence limits on violations with beryllium and aluminum test bodies of $\eta_{\odot, Be-Al} \leq 2.1 \times 10^{-13}$. These results are a factor of four improvement of previously reported results towards the Sun and a $\sim20\%$ improvement on previous torsion balance tests regardless of source.</description>

      <title>Exact Bachian singularity in quadratic gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For specifically coupled values of the quadratic gravity parameters, we present a fully explicit static spherically symmetric solution. It contains the central singularity surrounded by the black-hole or the cosmological horizon for the negative or positive cosmological parameter, respectively. This spacetime, thus, belongs to the already analyzed classes of solutions expressed in terms of the Frobenius expansions, continuous fractions, or numerical simulations; however, it has not been explicitly identified before. The purpose of the presented highly-constrained somehow unphysical model is to reveal a global geometric picture that may occur in spherical spacetimes within quadratic gravity, which is typically hidden in more general approximative solutions. At the same time, it can serve as a solid benchmark for evaluating the accuracy of the methods employed to obtain such solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02936v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following the numerous evidence for large-scale cosmic isotropy violation with the advent of the `precision cosmology' era, we explore the possible advantages of extending the flat $\Lambda$CDM model to more general models in order to constrain anisotropies in the universe, otherwise absent in the standard model based on FLRW spacetime. Such extensions are offered by the topologically unique Thurston geometries, which are homogeneous but anisotropic spacetime models. In this work, we attempt to distinguish Thurston geometries from one another by introducing anisotropies via different scale factors in different directions, thereby introducing additional model parameters such as shear, eccentricity, curvature, and a preferred axis. We used the latest compilation of Pantheon+ \&amp; SH0ES Type Ia supernova data for deriving model constraints, and found mild evidence of large-scale isotropy violation.</description>

      <title>Black hole (BH) junction conditions. Exterior BH geometry with an interior cloud and a new fluid of strings with integrable singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regular black holes are often used to address singularities, but they typically involve a potentially unstable de Sitter core and an internal horizon that breaks predictability. Integrable singularities (IS) have recently gained attention because they avoid both issues and exhibit finite tidal forces, allowing nondestructive radial infall. First, we present a new BH solution sourced by a string fluid (FS) that exhibits an IS. Motivated by the divergence of the conserved energy in the cloud of strings (CS) model, we introduce an energy density profile based on the screening of the CS energy density within an FS framework, yielding a finite conserved energy. On the other hand, it has been proposed \cite{Ovalle:2024wtv} that an interior region, rather than a pointlike mass, can generate a Schwarzschild BH exterior region. Secondly, motivated by the variety of BH solutions with singularities in the literature, we establish the conditions that an interior region with an IS must satisfy to represent a generic exterior BH solution, with Schwarzschild being only a particular case of the latter. We derive the junction conditions (JC) between the interior and exterior regions, showing that they lead to temperature continuity at the interface, while discontinuities in tangential pressure lead to phase transitions. We propose that the nature of the interior region is described by CS and FS, while the exterior corresponds to Reissner Nordstr\"om.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field effects on spherical orbit in Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson spacetime: constraints from jet precession of M87*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently reported precession period of about $11.24$ years of the M87* jet provides a sensitive probe of strong field gravity and the electromagnetic environment in the immediate vicinity of supermassive black holes. In this work, we study the precession of the spherical orbit in the Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson geometry describing a rotating black hole immersed in a uniform electromagnetic field. Although the timelike geodesics is non-separable, we develop a Hamiltonian approach to investigate the spherical orbits. For sufficiently strong magnetic fields, the study shows that the spherical orbits can only exist within a finite radial range for given orbital inclination. Requiring the existence of the spherical orbits, we obtain an upper bound of the magnetic field, i.e., $B&lt;0.33 M^{-1}$ for prograde and $B&lt;0.0165 M^{-1}$ for retrograde motion. Furthermore, imposing the observed jet precession period, we obtain a significantly tighter constraint, $B\lesssim 0.0145 M^{-1}$, providing a new constrain on the magnetic field of M87* independent of the shadow. Our results provide unified constraints on the parameters of the KBR black hole and demonstrate that the jet precession offers a robust and complementary probe of magnetized black holes in the strong gravity regime.</description>

      <title>Linear perturbations of an exact gravitational wave in the Bianchi IV universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proper-time method for constructing perturbative dynamical gravitational fields is presented. Using the proper-time method, a perturbative analytical model of gravitational waves against the backdrop of an exact wave solution of Einstein's equations in a Bianchi IV universe is constructed. To construct the perturbative analytical wave model a privileged wave coordinate system and a synchronous time function associated with the proper time of an observer freely moving in a gravitational wave were used. Reduction of the field equations, taking into account compatibility conditions, reduces the mathematical model of gravitational waves to a system of coupled ordinary differential equations for functions of the wave variable. Analytical solutions for the components of the gravitational-wave metric have been found. The stability of the resulting perturbative solutions is proven. The stability of the exact solution for a gravitational wave in the anisotropic Bianchi IV universe is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Scalar and Spinor Quasi Normal Modes of a 2D Dilatonic Blackhole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: External non-minimally coupled scalar and spinor field perturbations have been studied in a (1 + 1) dimensional dilatonic blackhole spacetime [1, 2]. Exact analytical expressions of the quasi- normal mode frequencies have been found for both the cases. In the scalar perturbations the quasi-normal mode frequencies turn out to be purely imaginary and negative. Furthermore we have found that the quasi-normal frequencies for Dirac field exhibit both real and imaginary part. The QNM frequencies decay monotonically with the overtone number under certain class of the blackhole parameters. The decay profile ensures the stability of the blackhole spacetime under these perturbations.</description>

      <title>Novel exact black hole solution in Dehnen $\left(1,4,\frac32\right)$ halo thermodynamics, photon circular motion and eikonal quasinormal modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dehnen $(1,4,\frac32)$ dark matter halo has been proven to be a valuable model for describing the surface brightness distributions of elliptical galaxies, yet its implications for black hole spacetimes remain largely unexplored. In this work, we construct a novel exact black hole solution embedded in this Dehnen halo and investigate its physical consequences. The influence of the halo on black hole thermodynamics is analyzed through the mass function, entropy, Hawking temperature, heat capacity, and Gibbs free energy, allowing us to assess both local and global thermodynamic stability of the black hole-dark matter system. Our results show that the presence of a Dehnen-type halo not only stabilizes the otherwise thermodynamically unstable Schwarzschild black hole but also induces phase transitions. In addition, we study null geodesics to examine photon motion, the shadow radius and the optical appearance of the system. The dark matter halo modifies the effective potential, leading to observable changes in the photon sphere and the apparent size of the shadow. We also explore the instability of circular null geodesics and its relation to quasinormal modes in an eikonal limit. These findings highlight the significant role of realistic dark matter distributions in shaping both the thermodynamic behavior and the observable signatures of black holes, providing further insight into the interplay between dark matter halos and central black holes in galaxies.</description>

      <title>Finite time pseudo-rip singularity in cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By studying first a new decelerating sudden future singularity (SFS) universe we report finding a novel type of cosmological singularity which we dub a finite time pseudo-rip (FTPR) because unlike for a pseudo-rip, it happens in the finite future of the universe. In contrast to the new SFS model, where the expansion is decelerating before reaching the pressure singularity, the FTPR scenario is preceded by a super-accelerated phantom phase. Our claim is based on the thorough study of the energy conditions showing the violations of all of them for a FTPR, and only the dominant energy one for an SFS. Application of the so-called Raychaudhuri averaging shows that, alike within the requirement of geodesic completeness, these singularities are weak in the sense of this definition. We study the properties of the models including the behaviour of the cosmological horizons presented in the appropriate Penrose diagrams.</description>

      <title>Dirac Observables for Gowdy Cosmologies regular at the Big Bang</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gowdy cosmologies are exact, spatially inhomogeneous solutions of the vacuum Einstein equations which describe nonlinear gravitational waves coalescing at the Big Bang singularity. With toroidal spatial sections they provenly have the Asymptotic Velocity Domination property, in that close to the Big Bang dynamical spatial gradients fade out and the dynamics is governed by a Carroll-type gravity theory. Here we construct an infinite set of Dirac observables for Gowdy cosmologies, valid off-shell, strongly, and without gauge fixing. These observables stay regular at the Big Bang and can be matched to much simpler Dirac observables of the Carroll-type gravity theory. Conversely, in an adapted foliation there is a systematic anti-Newtonian expansion (in inverse powers of the reduced Newton constant) of the full Dirac observables whose leading terms are the Carroll ones. In particular, this provides an off-shell generalization of the Asymptotic Velocity Domination property.</description>

      <title>Statistical physics on Euclidean Snyder space: connections with the GUP and cosmological implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a systematic formulation of statistical mechanics on Euclidean Snyder space, where noncommutativity is geometrically encoded in the curvature of momentum space. Adopting a realization independent approach based on momentum-space invariants, we derive modified partition functions and thermodynamic quantities for systems obeying Maxwell-Boltzmann, Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac statistics in both non-relativistic and ultrarelativistic regimes. We show that momentum-space curvature induces temperature-dependent corrections that suppress the energy, entropy and energy density with respect to their standard counterparts. We apply these results to early-Universe cosmology, deriving the corresponding corrections to the Friedmann equations driven by the modified energy density of radiation. Using Big Bang Nucleosynthesis as a precision probe, we derive bounds on the Snyder deformation parameter and, via a phenomenological mapping, on the Generalized Uncerainty Principle (GUP) parameter, providing one of the most stringent cosmological and astrophysical constraints currently available. Our analysis demonstrates that high-energy cosmological processes provide a predictive arena for testing momentum-space curvature and noncommutative geometry effects.</description>

      <title>Non-Singular Bouncing cosmology from Phantom Scalar-Gauss-Bonnet Coupling: Reconstruction with Observational Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine non-singular bounce cosmology within the framework of a phantom scalar field coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet term in both non-viscous and bulk-viscous cases. Using the scale factor ansatz $\alpha(t)=\left(\frac{\alpha}{\eta}+t^2\right)^{\frac{1}{2 \eta}}$, we reconstruct the scalar field potential $V(t)$, and observe a smooth potential well centered at the bounce point. The resulting energy density, pressure, and equation-of-state parameter show NEC violation necessary for successful bounce, while viscosity controls post-bounce dynamics with a positive and smooth squared speed of sound. In contrast, for the non-viscous model, sharp divergences occur just at the bounce and continues to be negative in the expanding phase, which in turn emphasises the stabilising role of dissipative effects. The energy condition analysis indicates a temporary NEC and SEC violation in the viscous scenario, whereas its persistent violation within the non-viscous model suggests a continuous accelerated expansion. Observational viability is found through Bayesian MCMC fitting in regards to the Pantheon+ supernova data, with best-fit parameters providing a reduced chi-squared of $\chi_{red}^2 =0.995$ while the inflation observables derived from the reconstructed potential place our model predictions inside $68\%$ CL Planck 2018 confidence contours. Our findings suggest that bounce cosmologies could offer a physically reasonable and observationally acceptable alternative or pre-inflationary scenario, while highlighting the role that viscosity could play for a stable and smooth cosmological evolution.</description>

      <title>Carrollian Physics and Holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This report reviews key developments in Carrollian physics with an emphasis on their role in the emerging framework of holography in asymptotically flat spacetimes. We begin by introducing the Carrollian limit, understood as the non-relativistic contraction of the Poincar\'e group obtained by formally taking the speed of light to zero. The geometric structures associated with this limit are described and argued to arise naturally on null hypersurfaces, most notably on null infinity, as well as black hole and cosmological horizons. Building on this, we examine the relation between the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs symmetries governing asymptotically flat gravity and the conformal Carrollian symmetries. Explicit examples of Carrollian field theories are constructed by implementing the limit on well-known relativistic field theories, with particular attention to Carrollian CFTs. We then present the Carrollian holography proposal, according to which gravity in asymptotically flat spacetimes is dual to a Carrollian CFT living at null infinity in one lower dimension. In this framework, the massless $\mathcal{S}$-matrix written in position space at null infinity is naturally reinterpreted in terms of boundary Carrollian CFT correlators, called Carrollian amplitudes. We highlight their relation to celestial amplitudes and show how they naturally emerge from holographic CFT correlators through a correspondence between the flat space limit in the bulk and the Carrollian limit at the boundary. Using this correspondence, we provide strong evidence that flat space holography arises from a controlled and consistent limiting procedure applied to both sides of the AdS/CFT duality. We conclude by outlining future directions and open questions in the program.</description>

      <title>Complexity and the Hilbert space dimension of 3D gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central problem in formulating a theory of quantum gravity is to determine the size and structure of the Hilbert space of black holes. Here we use a quantum dynamical Krylov complexity approach to calculate the Hilbert space dimension of a black hole in 2+1-dimensional Anti-de Sitter space. We achieve this by obtaining the spread of an initial thermofield double state over the Krylov basis. The associated Lanczos coefficients match those for chaotic motion on the $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ group. By including non-perturbative effects in the path integral, which computes coarse-grained ensemble averages, we find that the complexity saturates at late times. The saturation value is given by the exponential of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Our results introduce a new way to compute the Hilbert space dimension of complex interacting systems from the saturating value of spread complexity.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-Wave Signals for Supernova Explosions of Three-Dimensional Progenitors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Core-collapse supernovae (SNe) are sources of gravitational waves (GWs) produced by hydrodynamical instabilities and highly time-dependent anisotropies of the neutrino radiation. In this work we analyze both contributions to the GW signal for two state-of-the-art three-dimensional (3D) SN models computed with the Prometheus-Vertex neutrino-hydrodynamics code. In contrast to the far majority of models analyzed for GWs so far, our core-collapse simulations were started with 12.28 M_sun (18.88 M_sun) progenitors, whose final hour (7 min) of convective oxygen-shell burning was computed in 3D and featured a vigorous oxygen-neon shell merger. The corresponding large-scale asymmetries in the oxygen layer are conducive to buoyancy-aided neutrino-driven explosions. The models were continuously evolved in 3D from the pre-collapse evolution until 5.11 s (1.68 s) after the core bounce. The GW signals result from the well-known dynamical phenomena in the SN core such as prompt postshock convection, neutrino-driven convection, the standing accretion shock instability, proto-neutron star oscillations, and anisotropic ejecta expansion. They do not exhibit any new or specific features that can be unambiguously connected to the powerful pre-collapse activity in the progenitors, but we identify interesting differences compared to results in the literature. We also discuss measurement prospects by interferometers, confirming that GW signals from future Galactic SNe will be detectable with existing and next-generation experiments working in the frequency range f ~ 1-2000 Hz.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study pseudospectra of quasinormal frequencies and complex linear momenta of a U(1) gauge field in a Schwarzschild black branes in Anti-de Sitter. We present a novel approach for computing the pseudospectra which uses directly the gauge field variables and contrast it to a conventional master scalar field approach. Upon clarifying a subtlety in the energy norm of the master scalar we show that the pseudospectra of both approaches conincide. In the hydrodynamic regime we find that the hydrodynamic quasinormal frequency, the diffusive mode, is spectrally stable to a very good approximation. On the other hand hydrodynamic complex linear momenta show enhanced spectral instability as a consequence of a pole-collision at zero frequency.</description>

Abstract: We analyze a bulk effective field theory in AdS containing a U(1)-charged massive spin-2 field coupled to a gauge field, by performing the required holographic renormalization, and computing the one and two-point functions. We then compute the renormalized bulk three-point function involving two massive spin-2 fields and one gauge field. Matching with the CFT 3-point correlator of two non-conserved spin-2 operators and a conserved current, we obtain explicit mappings between the bulk minimal and gyromagnetic couplings and the boundary OPE data. Finally, we take the flat-space limit of the momentum space CFT correlator and verify that the resulting amplitude matches the expected flat-space structure.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic inference in very large universes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: [Abridged] Some cosmological theories propose that the observable universe is a small part of a much larger universe in which parameters describing the low-energy laws of physics vary from region to region. How can we reasonably assess a theory that describes such a mostly unobservable universe? We propose a Bayesian method based on theory-generated probability distributions for our observations. We focus on basic principles, leaving aside concerns about practicality. (We also leave aside the measure problem, to discuss other issues.) We argue that cosmological theories can be tested by standard Bayesian updating, but we need to use theoretical predictions for "first-person" probabilities -- i.e., probabilities for our observations, accounting for all relevant selection effects. These selection effects can depend on the observer, and on time, so in principle first-person probabilities are defined for each observer-instant -- an observer at an instant of time. First-person probabilities should take into account everything the observer believes about herself and her surroundings -- i.e., her "subjective state". We advocate a "Principle of Self-Locating Indifference" (PSLI), asserting that any real observer should make predictions as if she were chosen randomly from the theoretically predicted observer-instants that share her subjective state. We believe the PSLI is intuitively very reasonable, but also argue that it maximizes the expected fraction of observers who will make correct predictions. Cosmological theories will in general predict a set of possible universes, each with a probability. To calculate first-person probabilities, we argue that each possible universe should be weighted by the number of observer-instants in the specified subjective state that it contains. We also discuss Boltzmann brains, the humans/Jovians parable of Hartle and Srednicki, and the use of "old evidence".</description>

      <title>Consistent Evaluation of the No-Boundary Proposal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the Hartle-Hawking no-boundary proposal. To extract probabilities, one must use the gravitational path integral (GPI) to compute not only the no-boundary amplitude, but also the norms by which its square is divided. We find that this dramatically alters predictions: the probability for any closed universe is either nearly 1, or exactly 1. That is, in the Hilbert space of closed universes defined by the GPI, the states of interest in cosmology are all nearly parallel to the Hartle-Hawking state up to nonperturbative corrections in $G_N^{-1}$. We also consider a statistical interpretation of the GPI, as an average of arbitrary products of amplitudes. We find that all amplitudes are exactly 1 in this case, consistent with recent arguments that the statistical approach to the GPI with a closed boundary computes an average over one-dimensional Hilbert spaces. As an example, we illustrate the consistent evaluation of the no-boundary proposal in inflationary cosmology.</description>

      <title>Evidence for a 3.0$\sigma$ Deviation in Gravitational Light Deflection from General Relativity at Cosmological Scales with KiDS-Legacy and CMB Lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General Relativity (GR) faces challenges from cosmic acceleration and observational tensions, necessitating stringent tests at cosmological scales. In this work, we probe GR deviations via a $\mu$-$\Sigma$ modified gravity parameterization, integrating KiDS-Legacy weak lensing (1347 deg$^2$, $z\leq 2.0$), joint CMB data (Planck/ACT/SPT), DESI DR2 BAO, and DES-Dovekie supernovae. KiDS-Legacy significantly improves constraint precision: $\mu_0$ (matter clustering) by $\sim 43\%$ and $\Sigma_0$ (gravitational light deflection) by $\sim 60\%$ relative to CMB alone. In the $\Lambda$CDM background, $\mu_0 = 0.21\pm 0.21$ is consistent with GR, while $\Sigma_0 = 0.149\pm 0.051$ deviates from GR at the 3.0$\sigma$ level -- attributed to large-scale CMB lensing from ACT/SPT. This precise separation of GR-consistent matter clustering and deviant light deflection provides key observational clues for new physics or data systematics. Our work underscores the critical role of synergizing high-precision CMB and WL data in advancing GR tests.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Islands, Page curves and Phase Transitions of Kerr-AdS Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Page curve and information paradox for Kerr AdS black hole in light of entanglement entropy by employing the recently proposed island paradigm. By incorporating the island rule, we show that the entanglement entropy of Kerr AdS black hole grows linearly at early times and declines to a constant value at late times in agreement with the well established Page curve. The novelty of this study resides in the investigation of influence of phase transitions on the page curve in two different ensembles. We find that a first order phase transition results in a sharp discontinuity in the Page curve. We study the evaporation process in different scenarios and find that in all the situations, the Page curve doesn't violate the unitary principle of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>A low-regularity Riemannian positive mass theorem for non-spin manifolds with distributional curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article establishes a low-regularity Riemannian positive mass theorem for non-spin manifolds whose metrics are only $C^0 \cap W_{\mathrm{loc}}^{1,n}$ and smooth outside a compact set. The main theorem asserts that asymptotically flat manifolds with nonnegative distributional scalar curvature have nonnegative ADM mass. The proof uses smooth approximations of the metric together with a Sobolev version of Friedrichs' Lemma, which yields improved convergence for commutators between differentiation and convolution operators. Rigidity is obtained for $C^0 \cap W_{\mathrm{loc}}^{1,p}$ metrics with $p&gt;n$ via the comparison theory of $\sf{RCD}$-spaces and a rigidity theorem for compact manifolds with metrics of nonnegative distributional curvature by Jiang-Sheng-Zhang. The argument relies on either elementary techniques or generalisations of the standard argument. In essence, a version of the main theorem of Lee-LeFloch is presented in which the spin condition is removed under the assumption that the metric is smooth outside a compact set.</description>

      <title>Observers, $\alpha$-parameters, and the Hartle-Hawking state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we extend recent ideas about observers and closed universes to theories where observers can be fluctuated into existence in the Hartle-Hawking state. This introduces a phenomenon that was not considered in these earlier discussions: the dominant transition from one cosmological state to another can go through a fluctuation that annihilates the universe and creates a new one. We nonetheless argue that the observer decoherence rule allows for the third-quantized description of such a theory to emerge from a factorizing holographic theory with a one-dimensional Hilbert space, without any need for $\alpha$-parameters. We also point out a close analogy between the observer rule in this context and the coarse-graining of the spectral form factor at late times for AdS black holes. Along the way we clarify several aspects of the relationship between holography, the gravitational path integral, and $\alpha$-parameters. We also explain why string theory scattering amplitudes do not lead to a one-dimensional Hilbert space on the worldsheet, despite being computed by a gravitational path integral with a sum over topology. Finally we point out that using the path integral to compute integrated local operators conditioned on an observer in the context of a theory with a landscape can lead to rather surprising conclusions. For example we argue that in a landscape with one AdS minimum and one dS minimum, both of which can support observers, an observer almost surely finds themself in dS and not AdS even if the boundary conditions are dual to a state with an observer in AdS.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Correlator Discontinuities from Scattering Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent theoretical work has revealed that basic observables of quantum field theory in de Sitter space, known as in-in or cosmological correlators, exhibit surprisingly simple mathematical structure reminiscent of scattering amplitudes in flat space. For many theories, this simplicity can be made manifest using a set of ``cosmological dressing rules'' which uplift flat-space Feynman diagrams to in-in correlators in de Sitter space by attaching auxiliary propagators to the interaction vertices. In this paper, we show that discontinuities of cosmological correlators with respect to internal energy variables can be obtained by applying auxiliary propagators to unitarity cuts of flat space Feynman diagrams. Moreover, discontinuities with respect to external energy variables can be obtained by cutting auxiliary propagators attached to Feynman diagrams. This observation in turn implies highly non-trivial constraints on cosmological correlators in the form of simple sum rules. We illustrate these ideas in a number of examples at tree-level and 1-loop for conformally coupled scalar theories, although they hold more generally. Finally, we show how to reconstruct cosmological correlators from their discontinuities using dispersion relations, providing a powerful new approach to computing cosmological observables by systematically reconstructing them from data uplifted from flat space.</description>

      <title>Challenges and Opportunities of Gravitational Wave Searches above 10 kHz</title>

Abstract: The first direct measurement of gravitational waves by the LIGO and Virgo collaborations has opened up new avenues to explore our Universe. This white paper outlines the challenges and gains expected in gravitational-wave searches at frequencies above the LIGO/Virgo band. The scarcity of possible astrophysical sources in most of this frequency range provides a unique opportunity to discover physics beyond the Standard Model operating both in the early and late Universe, and we highlight some of the most promising of these sources. We review several detector concepts that have been proposed to take up this challenge, and compare their expected sensitivity with the signal strength predicted in various models. This report is the summary of a series of workshops on the topic of high-frequency gravitational wave detection, held in 2019 (ICTP, Trieste, Italy), 2021 (online) and 2023 (CERN, Geneva, Switzerland).</description>

      <title>Investigating Graviton Mass Effects on Black Hole Lensing in dRGT Massive Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we delve into the gravitational lensing and photon trajectories in the vicinity of non-asymptotically flat black hole spacetimes within the framework of dRGT massive gravity, incorporating a non-zero graviton mass. We assume that both the observer and the light source are located at a finite distance from the lens object, and calculate the gravitational deflection angle of light ray by such a black hole based on Gauss-Bonnet theorem. Furthermore, we derive the angular radius of Einstein rings associated with black holes in dRGT massive gravity, thereby facilitating a comprehensive discussion on the ramifications of the graviton mass. Notably, our findings reveal pronounced impacts of the graviton mass on both light deflection angles and Einstein ring characteristics, underscoring its significance in dRGT massive gravity and enhancing the detectability of black holes in gravitational lensing observations, thereby opening new avenues for future research.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy dark matter soliton as gravitational lens</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Schr\"odinger-Poisson (SP) equations predict fuzzy dark matter (FDM) solitons. Given the FDM mass $\sim10^{-20}\rm~{eV}/c^2$, the FDM soliton in the Milky Way is massive $\sim 10^7~M_{\odot}$ but diffuse $\sim 10{\rm~pc}$. Therefore, such FDM soliton can serve as a gravitational lens for gravitational waves (GWs) with frequency $\sim10^{-8}{\rm~Hz}$. In this paper, we investigate its gravitational lensing effects by numerical simulation of the propagation of GWs through it. We find that the maximum magnification factor of GWs is very small $\sim10^{-4}$, but the corresponding magnification zone is huge $\sim6{\rm~pc}$ for FDM with mass equal to $8\times10^{-21}\rm~{eV}/c^2$. Consequently, this small magnification factor compounding over such large magnification zone results in a small antisotropy of $\sim10^{-4}$ over a large solid angle in the GW background. That level of antisotropy is out of the sensitivity, $&lt;20\%$, of the pulsar timing arrays today.</description>

      <title>Emergent Turbulence in Nonlinear Gravity</title>

Abstract: Gravity in nonlinear and dynamical regimes underpins spectacular astrophysical phenomena and observable consequences, from the early universe to black hole collisions. In these extreme environments, inverse energy cascades - mediated by nonlinear interactions - may help explain the near scale-invariance of cosmic structure and the simplicity of gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers. Yet the presence, characteristics, and generality of such interactions in full General Relativity remain largely unexplored. Here we show that two types of nonlinear interactions - a four-mode and a three-mode interaction - emerge in the fully nonlinear regime, and can indeed channel inverse energy cascades by inducing resonant and anti-damping instabilities. This establishes what was previously only hinted at in highly specialized perturbative contexts. We further demonstrate a ``laminar'' to ``turbulent'' transition for the largest-possible angular structure in General Relativity, whereas finer structures remain persistently turbulent. Our results reveal the impact and generality of these nonlinear interactions (instabilities), which can be key to understanding observations ranging from cosmological to kilometer scales. We anticipate that our work will shed new light on nonlinear gravitational phenomena and their consequences, such as constructing gravitational wave templates and testing General Relativity in the most extreme regime. Moreover, our work is a starting point for addressing nonlinear gravitational interactions using ideas and methods inspired by fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>A quantum information method for early universe with non-trivial sound speed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many quantum gravitational frameworks, such as DBI inflation, k-essence, and effective field theories obtained by integrating out heavy modes, can lead to a non-trivial sound speed. Meanwhile, our universe can be described as an open system. Under the non-trivial sound speed, we employ the method of open quantum systems combined with Arnoldi iterations to study the Krylov complexity throughout the early universe, including the inflationary, radiation-dominated, and matter-dominated epochs. A key ingredient in our analysis is the open two-mode squeezed state formalism and the generalized Lanczos algorithm. To numerically compute the Krylov complexity, we are the first time to derive the evolution equations for the parameters $r_k$ and $\phi_k$ within an open two-mode squeezed state. Our results indicate that the Krylov complexity exhibits a similar trend in both the standard case and the case with non-trivial sound speed. To distinguish between these two scenarios, we also investigate the Krylov entropy for completeness. The evolution of the Krylov entropy shows a clear difference between the standard case and the non-trivial sound speed case. Furthermore, based on the behavior of the Lanczos coefficients, we find that the case of non-trivial sound speed behaves as a maximally chaotic system. However, our numerical results suggest that the Krylov complexity does not saturate to a constant value due to the huge expansion of spacetime background. This study offers a new perspective for exploring the early universe through the quantum information.</description>

      <title>The Gravitational Wave Memory from Binary Neutron Star Mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gravitational wave signal produced by the merger of two compact objects includes both an oscillatory transient and a non-oscillatory part, the so-called memory effect. This produces a permanent displacement of test masses and has not yet been measured. We use general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations, including neutrinos, with several representative viable equations of state, to quantify--for the first time--the effects of the neutron star magnetic field, neutrino emission, and the ejected mass on the linear and nonlinear displacement memory in binary neutron star mergers. We find that the additional contributions due to the emission of electromagnetic radiation, neutrinos and baryonic ejecta can be ~15% of the total memory for moderate magnetic fields and up to ~50% for extreme magnetic fields. The memory is most affected by changes in the equation of state, the binary mass, and the magnetic field. In particular, for moderate premerger field strengths, the dominant impact of the electromagnetic field is the change in the gravitational wave luminosity, and the associated gravitational wave null memory, due to the unstable growth of the magnetic field and the resulting redistribution of angular momentum it induces in the remnant. While the direct electromagnetic contribution to the null memory is additive, the change in the gravitational wave null memory can--in some cases--result in the total memory being smaller than that from the corresponding nonmagnetized binary. Furthermore, in contrast to binary black hole mergers, the growth of the memory in binary neutron star mergers is extended due to the long emission timescale of electromagnetic fields, neutrinos, and ejecta. These results necessitate the consideration of the magnetic field, as well as the equation of state, for accurate parameter estimation in future analyses of gravitational wave memory data.</description>

Abstract: We present a cosmological analysis of an exponential $f(Q)$ gravity model, within the dynamical systems formalism. Following the method introduced by B\"ohmer \textit{et al} [Universe \textbf{9} no.4, 166 (2023)], the modified Friedmann modified equations are successfully reduced to an autonomous system. Given the exponential form of $f(Q)$, the equilibrium conditions result in transcendental equations, which we approximate to identify the critical points. We therefore perform a general stability analysis of these points in terms of the model parameters. Finally, we extend the model by including a linear dark energy-dark matter interaction, where the equilibrium points are found with their stability properties. The model exhibits the three main domination epochs in the Universe, as well as a non-trivial impact on the late-time de Sitter attractor.</description>

      <title>Validity of the Background Subtraction Method for Black Hole Thermodynamics in Matter-Coupled Gravity Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07209v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The background subtraction method has long served as a practical tool for computing the Euclidean action and thermodynamic quantities of black holes. While its equivalence to the Iyer--Wald formalism is well understood in pure gravity theories, its validity in matter-coupled theories remains less clear and has even been questioned in the literature. In this work, we revisit this issue and demonstrate that the equivalence between the Euclidean action method and the Iyer--Wald formalism persists in matter-coupled scenarios. We apply the resulting formulation to two representative examples of such theories, and in both cases, the Euclidean approach performs smoothly. We further identify situations where the method may encounter subtleties due to the special properties of certain matter fields. Our results clarify when background subtraction remains reliable beyond pure gravity and when additional care is necessary.</description>

      <title>Simulations of gravitational collapse in null coordinates IV: evolving through the event horizon, with an application to the spherical charged scalar field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14874v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider line elements of the form $-2G\,du\,(dx+B\,du) + R^2(...)$, where $(...)$ does not contain $dx$. Surfaces of constant $u$ are then null surfaces, and their affinely parameterised generators have tangent vector $G^{-1}\partial_x$. Considering $u$ as the time coordinate, we can evolve either $R$ or $G$, with the other one found by solving the Raychaudhuri equation along the null generators, or we can evolve both. This choice of {\em formulation} is independent from the remaining {\em gauge} choice $x\to x'(u,x,...)$ in the line element above, which is fixed incrementally by the choice of $B$. For example, we can evolve $G$, in order to be able to evolve through an event horizon, and use $B$ to adapt the coordinates to type-II critical collapse. As a demonstration of these ideas, we consider a charged scalar field in spherical symmetry. We consider two settings: a domain where the outgoing null cones emanate from a regular centre $R=0$, and a domain where they emanate from an ingoing-null boundary. In both settings, we demonstrate convergence with resolution, within each formulation and between the three formulations. As testbeds, we compute the critical exponents and periodic fine-structures of the black hole charge and mass scaling laws in a one-parameter family of charged regular initial data, and examples of perturbed extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om solutions.</description>

      <title>Covariant Measures of Non-Markovianity in Curved Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Standard measures of quantum non-Markovianity are usually defined in terms of dynamical maps on a preferred time foliation and therefore do not extend straightforwardly to curved spacetimes, where no global time coordinate exists and causal structure is primary. We develop a covariant framework for open quantum dynamics along arbitrary timelike worldlines by building multi-time quantum processes (process tensors) from overlapping causal diamonds. For an Unruh--DeWitt detector weakly coupled to a scalar field in a Hadamard state, we define a foliation-independent measure of non-Markovianity as the operational distance between the physical process tensor and the convex set of Markovian (CP-divisible) processes. Numerical benchmarks in $(1{+}1)$ dimensions compare inertial motion, uniform acceleration, and static and infalling trajectories in Schwarzschild spacetime. Inertial trajectories are found to be almost Markovian, whereas acceleration and curvature generate pronounced long-range temporal correlations and strong non-Markovian behaviour. In Rindler spacetime, acceleration produces horizon-induced memory tails. In Schwarzschild spacetime, near-horizon field correlations cause both static and freely falling observers to experience enhanced memory, which can remain hidden in single-step diagnostics but becomes evident in multi-time protocols and can even be superactivated by combining different time steps. Our results provide, to our knowledge, the first coordinate-independent, operational quantification of quantum memory in relativistic settings. They identify spacetime curvature, horizons, and acceleration as controllable ingredients that can either degrade or be harnessed as resources in relativistic quantum information tasks, including communication and metrology with accelerated detectors and near black holes.</description>

      <title>Tidal perturbations of an extreme mass ratio inspiral around a Kerr black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We determine the metric of a Kerr black hole subject to external tidal fields using metric reconstruction techniques. Working within the Newman-Penrose formalism, we solve the Teukolsky master equation for static, quadrupolar modes associated with a slowly varying tidal environment, and reconstruct the corresponding metric perturbation in the outgoing radiation gauge. As an application, we derive the secular Hamiltonian governing the motion of a test particle in the tidally deformed Kerr spacetime and investigate long-term tidal effects relevant to extreme-mass-ratio inspirals. In particular, we compute tidal-induced shifts of the innermost stable circular orbit and the light ring. We find that these tidal corrections are strongly spin dependent, with significantly larger effects for retrograde orbits around rapidly rotating black holes. Our results provide a fully analytic framework for studying tidal interactions and secular dynamics in rotating black-hole spacetimes, with direct applications to gravitational-wave modeling and tests of gravity in the strong-field regime.</description>

      <title>The FRW Universe as a van der Waals-like Thermodynamic Heat Engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe is a dynamical spacetime, and it has thermodynamics embodied on the apparent horizon. Notably, it also possesses a van der Waals-like equation of state, enabling us to consider thermodynamic cycles and explore the potential of the FRW universe as a heat engine. In this paper, we investigate two types of cycle--the Carnot cycle and the rectangular cycle--based on the phase diagram derived from the equation of state, to study the heat engine characteristics of the FRW universe. Furthermore, we calculate the work done and assess the corresponding efficiencies, illustrating the efficiency diagram for the FRW universe's heat engine. We observe that the efficiency of the rectangular cycle consistently remains below unity and never exceeds the Carnot efficiency--the thermodynamic upper limit. This finding is in alignment with the traditional thermodynamic principles that govern heat engines.</description>

      <title>Classical emergence of the quantum-backreacted BTZ black hole from exponential electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we revisit a recently reported generalization of the Ba\~nados-Teitelboim-Zanelli black hole arising in New Massive Gravity sourced by the quantum fluctuations of scalar matter, now examined through the lens of a purely classical framework. We show that the same geometry, distinguished by its logarithmic asymptotic structure, emerges as the unique static solution of Einstein gravity coupled to an exponential nonlinear electrodynamics. We trace the origin of this correspondence and prove that this geometry belongs to a unique class of metrics constituting the intersection of the moduli spaces of the static and circularly symmetric sectors of the two theories, thereby revealing a dynamical equivalence between them. An explicit mapping is established between the global charges of the nonlinearly charged black holes and the parameters governing the quantum backreaction in New Massive Gravity, allowing for a natural reinterpretation of the quantum imprints in terms of classical charges. A detailed analysis of the horizon structure of these spacetimes is presented. In addition, the full thermodynamics of the more general configurations is constructed using the Iyer-Wald formalism, from which we derive the first law and the associated Smarr relation. Altogether, our results provide a classical realization of a semiclassical spacetime and point toward a broader correspondence between higher-curvature corrections in quantum gravity and nonlinear effects in self-gravitating electrodynamics in three dimensions.</description>

      <title>Branch structure and nonextensive thermodynamics of Kalb-Ramond-ModMax black holes: observational signatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a static, spherically symmetric black hole arising in Einstein gravity coupled to a Kalb-Ramond field and ModMax nonlinear electrodynamics, both of which are independently well motivated extensions of standard electrovacuum gravity. The solution depends, beyond mass and charge, on a Lorentz-violating parameter, a ModMax deformation parameter, and a discrete branch selector $\zeta=\pm1$. We show that the ordinary branch admits extremal and non-extremal configurations, while the phantom branch generically supports a single-horizon geometry. Black-hole thermodynamics is analyzed within the Tsallis non-extensive framework, revealing branch-dependent stability and Joule-Thomson behavior. Weak gravitational lensing is analyzed using the Ono-Ishihara-Asada extension of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, which is required by the non-Euclidean asymptotic structure of the Kalb-Ramond optical geometry and yields a negative topological correction that reduces light bending relative to the Schwarzschild baseline. Photon propagation in plasma and tidal forces are also studied, revealing clear optical and strong-field signatures that distinguish the two branches.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we describe the procedure implemented in the Multi-Band Template Analysis (MBTA) search pipeline to produce online posterior distributions of compact binary coalescence (CBC) gravitational-wave parameters. This procedure relies on an SNR optimizer technique, which consists of filtering dense local template banks. We present how these banks are constructed using information from the initial detection and detail how the results of the filtering are used to estimate source parameters and provide posterior distributions. We demonstrate the performance of our procedure on simulations and compare our source parameter estimates with the results from the first part of the fourth observing run (O4a) recently released by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration.</description>

      <title>Scalar-tensor-vector gravity theory is tested by black hole photon rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the photon ring and shadow structure of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole in the scalar-tensor-vector gravitational framework. The black hole is characterized by the ( MOG) parameter (\alpha) and the charge (Q). The study finds that as (\alpha) increases, the event horizon radius (r_h), photon sphere radius (r_{ph}), and critical impact parameter (b_{ph}) all increase, while these decrease as (Q) increases. The innermost stable circular orbit radius (r_{isco}) exhibits similar monotonic behavior. Ray-tracing shows that as (Q) increases, the impact parameter (b) interval between the lensing ring and photon ring widens; (b_{\text{ph}}) is non-degenerate, and the photon ring radius is uniquely determined by (\alpha) and (Q). Using $EHT$ constraints on (SgrA^*) and (M87^*), the bounds on (\alpha) and (Q) are derived. For (Q = 0), (0.5), and (1), the allowed ranges are (\alpha \in [0, 0.06]), ([0, 0.11]), and ([0.19, 0.36]), respectively. Radiative simulations show that for fixed (Q), larger (\alpha) leads to a larger, non-degenerate photon ring. The Schwarzschild case is approached only when both (\alpha) and (Q) are small. This provides a computational basis for testing modified black holes and offers a non-degenerate observational criterion for distinguishing quantum gravity models, consistent with current $EHT$ data. Future observations with $ngEHT$ and multi-band polarization can further test this. The results suggest that studying the photon ring structure of a Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole in scalar-tensor-vector gravity provides a unique optical diagnostic for potential quantum-gravity tests and black hole properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1993, the global stability of Minkowski spacetime was proved in the celebrated work of Christodoulou and Klainerman. In 2003, Klainerman and Nicol\`o revisited Minkowski stability in the exterior of an outgoing null cone. In 2023, the author extended the results of Christodoulou-Klainerman to minimal decay assumptions. In this paper, we prove that the exterior stability of Minkowski holds with decay that is borderline compared to the minimal decay considered in 2023.</description>

      <title>Power law $\alpha$-Starobinsky inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16853v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we consider a generalization of Starobinsky inflation obtained by combining power law ($R^\beta$), and $\alpha$-Starobinsky inflation ($E$-model). The Einstein frame potential for this model is that of power law Starobinsky inflation modified by a parameter $\alpha$ in the exponential. After computing power spectra for scalar and tensor perturbations numerically, we perform MCMC analysis to put constraints on the potential parameters $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $M$, and the number of e-foldings $N_{pivot}$ during inflation, using Planck-2018, BICEP/Keck (BK18), DES and BAO observations. We find $\log_{10}\alpha= 0.37^{+0.82}_{-0.85}$, $\beta = 1.969^{+0.020}_{-0.023}$, $M=\left(3.54^{+2.62}_{-1.73}\right)\times 10^{-5}$ and $N_{pivot} = 47\pm{10}$. With these mean values of the potential parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$, and varying $N_{pivot}$ between $40$ to $55$, we also find that the $r-n_s$ predictions of our model lie well within the $1\sigma$ bounds of joint constraints from combined analysis of ACT, Planck-2018, BICEP and BAO observations. We compute the Bayesian evidences for our proposed model, power law Starobinsky inflation, $\alpha$-Starobinsky inflation and Starobinsky inflation. Considering the Starobinsky model as the base model, we calculate the Bayes factor and find that our proposed model is mildly favored by the CMB and LSS observations.</description>

Abstract: We consider a class of linear eigenvalue problems depending on a small parameter epsilon in which the series expansion for the eigenvalue in powers of epsilon is divergent. We develop a new technique to determine the precise nature of this divergence. We illustrate the technique through its application to four examples: the anharmonic oscillator, a simplified model of equatorially-trapped Rossby waves, and two simplified models based on quasinormal modes of Reissner-Nordstrom-de Sitter black holes.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-Wave Signatures of Highly Eccentric Stellar-Mass Binary Black Holes in Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A significant fraction of compact-object mergers in galactic nuclei are expected to be eccentric in the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) frequency sensitivity range, $10^{-4} - 10^{-1}\ \rm Hz$. Several compact binaries detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration may retain hints of residual eccentricity at $\sim 10$ Hz, suggesting dynamical or triple origins for a significant fraction of the gravitational-wave-observable population. In triple systems, von-Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai oscillations perturb both the eccentricity and the argument of pericentre, $\omega$, of the inner black hole binary. The latter could be fully \textit{circulating}, where $\omega$ cycles through $2\pi$, or may \textit{librate}, with $\omega$ ranges about a fixed value with small or large variation. We use \texttt{TSUNAMI}, a regularised N-body code with up to 3.5 post-Newtonian (PN) term corrections, to identify four different families of orbits: (i) circulating, (ii) small and (iii) large amplitude librating, and (iv) merging orbits. We develop and demonstrate a new method to construct gravitational waveforms using the quadrupole formula utilising the instantaneous {\it total} acceleration of each binary component in \texttt{TSUNAMI}. We show that the four orbital families have distinct waveform phenomenologies, enabling them to be distinguished if observed in LISA. The orbits are also distinguishable from an isolated binary or from a binary perturbed by a different tertiary orbit, even if the secular timescale is the same. Future burst timing models will be able to distinguish the different orbital configurations. For efficient binary formation, about $\sim 1000$ binaries can have highly eccentric, librating orbits in the Galactic Centre.</description>

      <title>Illuminating gravitational wave sources with Sgr A* flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sagittarius A* exhibits daily energetic flares characterized by non-thermal emission in the infrared and X-ray bands. While the underlying accretion flow is a Radiatively Inefficient Accretion Flow (RIAF) peaking at radio frequencies, the mechanism powering these non-thermal transients remains debated. Stellar dynamics predict a population of faint brown dwarfs orbiting Sgr A*. We investigate whether the tidal stripping of brown dwarfs provides a viable fueling mechanism for the observed flares. These objects are progenitors of Extremely Large Mass Ratio Inspirals (XMRIs), crucial sources of low-frequency gravitational waves for the future LISA mission. We present high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations of grazing tidal interactions coupled with a parameterized non-thermal radiation model. We numerically model the stripping of the brown dwarf envelope and the subsequent accretion of this material. We demonstrate that the dynamics of the tidal fallback and subsequent viscous evolution naturally reproduce the fundamental temporal characteristics of observed flares: the peak luminosity and the characteristic 1-hour duration. We show that this fueling mechanism is dynamically viable and energetically consistent, placing strong constraints on the required efficiency of the non-thermal emission process, suggesting extreme radiative inefficiency. These findings provide compelling evidence for a hidden population of brown dwarfs in the Galactic Center. Crucially, the observed high flare frequency implies tight orbits characteristic of advanced inspirals. This establishes a direct link between electromagnetic transients and active gravitational wave sources, alerting the LISA consortium years in advance to the presence of specific XMRI systems promising exceptionally high signal-to-noise ratios for precision tests of general relativity.</description>

Abstract: We provide an explicit realization of the Corner Proposal for Quantum Gravity in the case of spherically symmetric spacetimes in four dimensions, or equivalently, two-dimensional dilaton gravity. We construct coherent states of the Quantum Corner Symmetry group and compute the entanglement entropy relative to these states. We derive the classical corner charges and relate them to operator expectation values in coherent states. For a subset of coherent states that we call classical states, we find that the entanglement entropy exhibits a leading term proportional to the area, recovering the Bekenstein-Hawking area law in the semiclassical limit.</description>

Abstract: We formalise the self-referential definition of physical laws using monotone operators on a lattice of theories, resolving the pathologies of naive set-theoretic formulations. By invoking Tarski fixed point theorem, we identify physical theories as the least fixed points of admissibility constraints derived from Galois connections. We demonstrate that QED and GR can be represented in such a logical structure with respect to their symmetry and locality principles.</description>

Abstract: We investigate accretion disk dynamics and the formation of quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in the infrared limit around Kerr-like black holes in asymptotically safe gravity. Relativistic hydrodynamic solutions of Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion reveal that quantum corrections significantly modify the structure of the shock cone formed around the black hole. The black hole spin controls the azimuthal asymmetry of the shock cone through frame-dragging effects, whereas the quantum correction parameter effectively reduces the strength of gravitational focusing by modifying the metric coefficients in the strong-field region, resulting in a wider shock opening angle, weaker post-shock compression, and reduced density concentration within the cone. Time-dependent mass accretion rates reveal oscillation modes trapped within the shock cone. The power spectral density (PSD) investigations suggest that these modes naturally generate low-frequency QPOs, whose amplitudes, coherence, and harmonic structure depend on both the spin and the quantum correction parameter. The PSD analyses performed at different radial locations reveal that identical QPO frequencies are obtained in all cases. The numerically detected frequencies result from the excitation of global oscillation modes trapped within the post-shock region. The resulting global modes are found to consist of fundamental frequencies, their associated harmonic overtones, and near-commensurate frequency ratios such as 2:1 and 3:2. Coherent oscillations are enhanced and near-commensurate frequency ratios are produced when moderate rotation and moderate quantum corrections are coupled. Large quantum correction parameters, on the other hand, wash out unique spectral peaks and suppress oscillation amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Conservative Black Hole Scattering at Fifth Post-Minkowskian and Second Self-Force Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16256v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the worldline quantum field theory formalism, we compute the conservative scattering angle and impulse for classical black hole scattering at fifth post-Minkowskian (5PM) order by providing the second self-force (2SF) contributions. This four-loop calculation involves non-planar Feynman integrals and requires advanced integration-by-parts reduction, novel differential-equation strategies, and efficient boundary-integral algorithms to solve a system of hundreds of master integrals in four integral families on high-performance computing systems. The resulting function space includes multiple polylogarithms as well as iterated integrals with a K3 period, which generate a spurious velocity divergence at $v/c=\sqrt{8}/3$. This divergence is present in the potential region and must be canceled by contributions from the radiative memory region, while its dimensional-regularisation pole should cancel against the radiative tail region. We find that the standard use of Feynman propagators to access the conservative sector fails to ensure this cancellation. We propose a conservative propagator prescription which realises both cancellations leading to a physically sensible answer. All available low-velocity checks of our result against the post-Newtonian literature are satisfied.</description>

      <title>Hubble Tension as an Effect of Horizon Entanglement Nonequilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an infrared mechanism for alleviating the Hubble constant tension, based on a small departure from entanglement equilibrium at the cosmological apparent horizon. If the horizon entanglement entropy falls slightly below the Bekenstein-Hawking value, we parametrize the shortfall by a fractional deficit $\delta(a)$ evolving with the FLRW scale factor $a$. The associated equipartition deficit at the Gibbons-Hawking temperature then sources a smooth, homogeneous component whose density scales as $H^{2}/G$, with a dimensionless coefficient $c_{e}^{2}(a)$ of order unity times $\delta(a)$. Because this component tracks $H^{2}$, it is negligible at early times but can activate at redshifts $z\lesssim 1$, raising the late time expansion rate by a few percent without affecting recombination or the sound horizon. We present a minimal three parameter activation model for $c_{e}^{2}(a)$ and derive its impact on the background expansion, effective equation of state, and linear growth for a smooth entanglement sector. The framework predicts a small boost in $H(z)$, a mild suppression of $f\sigma_{8}(z)$, and a corresponding modification of the low-$z$ distance-redshift relation. We test these predictions against current low-redshift data sets, including SN~Ia distance moduli, baryon acoustic oscillation distance measurements, cosmic chronometer $H(z)$ data, and redshift space distortion constraints, and discuss whether the $H_0$ tension can be consistently interpreted as a late-time, horizon-scale information deficit rather than an early universe modification.</description>

      <title>Isotropic Equivalence of STVG--MOG and $\Lambda$CDM and Its Breakdown in Large--Scale Anisotropic Cosmological Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that Scalar-Tensor-Vector Gravity (STVG-MOG) is observationally equivalent to the standard model $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model for all probes that depend on isotropic and linear gravitational dynamics, including galaxy rotation curves, cluster lensing, the linear matter power spectrum P(k), $\sigma_8$, baryon acoustic oscillations, and the cosmic microwave background (CMB). This degeneracy arises from the scale-dependent effective gravitational coupling $G_{\mathrm{eff}}$, which ensures identical background evolution, transfer functions, and linear growth. Consequently, all early-universe, low and intermediate scale cosmological observables are equally well described by STVG-MOG without invoking non-baryonic dark matter. We argue that the equivalence implies that isotropic cosmological data alone cannot establish the physical existence of dark matter. The degeneracy is broken only by observables sensitive to large-scale, anisotropic gravitational response. In particular, recent measurements of enhanced radio-galaxy and quasar number-count dipoles at gigaparsec scales probe a regime where $G_{\mathrm{eff}}$ departs from its $\Lambda$CDM limit, allowing STVG-MOG to generate anisotropic bulk flows, while preserving consistency with all isotropic constraints. These observations provide a concrete pathway for empirically distinguishing modified gravity from particle dark matter.</description>

      <title>Remarks on Dirac-Bergmann algorithm, Dirac's conjecture and the extended Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00284v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Dirac-Bergmann algorithm for the Hamiltonian analysis of constrained systems is a nice and powerful tool, widely used for quantization and non-perturbative counting of degrees of freedom. However, certain aspects of its application to systems with first-class constraints are often overlooked in the literature, which is unfortunate, as a naive treatment leads to incorrect results. In particular, when transitioning from the total to the extended Hamiltonian, the physical information encoded in the constrained modes is lost unless a suitable redefinition of gauge invariant quantities is made. An example of this is electrodynamics, in which the electric field gets an additional contribution to its longitudinal component in the form of the gradient of an arbitrary Lagrange multiplier. Moreover, Dirac's conjecture, the common claim that all first-class constraints are independent generators of gauge transformations, is somewhat misleading in the standard notion of gauge symmetry used in field theories. At the level of the total Hamiltonian, the true gauge generator is a specific combination of primary and secondary first-class constraints; in general, Dirac's conjecture holds only in the case of the extended Hamiltonian.
  The aim of the paper is primarily pedagogical. We review these issues, providing examples and general arguments. Also, we show that the aforementioned redefinition of gauge invariants within the extended Hamiltonian approach is equivalent to a form of the Stueckelberg trick applied to variables that are second-class with respect to the primary constraints.</description>
