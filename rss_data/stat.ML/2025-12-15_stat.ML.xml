      <title>STARK denoises spatial transcriptomics images via adaptive regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an approach to denoising spatial transcriptomics images that is particularly effective for uncovering cell identities in the regime of ultra-low sequencing depths, and also allows for interpolation of gene expression. The method -- Spatial Transcriptomics via Adaptive Regularization and Kernels (STARK) -- augments kernel ridge regression with an incrementally adaptive graph Laplacian regularizer. In each iteration, we (1) perform kernel ridge regression with a fixed graph to update the image, and (2) update the graph based on the new image. The kernel ridge regression step involves reducing the infinite dimensional problem on a space of images to finite dimensions via a modified representer theorem. Starting with a purely spatial graph, and updating it as we improve our image makes the graph more robust to noise in low sequencing depth regimes. We show that the aforementioned approach optimizes a block-convex objective through an alternating minimization scheme wherein the sub-problems have closed form expressions that are easily computed. This perspective allows us to prove convergence of the iterates to a stationary point of this non-convex objective. Statistically, such stationary points converge to the ground truth with rate $\mathcal{O}(R^{-1/2})$ where $R$ is the number of reads. In numerical experiments on real spatial transcriptomics data, the denoising performance of STARK, evaluated in terms of label transfer accuracy, shows consistent improvement over the competing methods tested.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Variant of One-Class SVM with Lifelong Online Learning Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study outlier (a.k.a., anomaly) detection for single-pass non-stationary streaming data. In the well-studied offline or batch outlier detection problem, traditional methods such as kernel One-Class SVM (OCSVM) are both computationally heavy and prone to large false-negative (Type II) errors under non-stationarity. To remedy this, we introduce SONAR, an efficient SGD-based OCSVM solver with strongly convex regularization. We show novel theoretical guarantees on the Type I/II errors of SONAR, superior to those known for OCSVM, and further prove that SONAR ensures favorable lifelong learning guarantees under benign distribution shifts. In the more challenging problem of adversarial non-stationary data, we show that SONAR can be used within an ensemble method and equipped with changepoint detection to achieve adaptive guarantees, ensuring small Type I/II errors on each phase of data. We validate our theoretical findings on synthetic and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Provable Recovery of Locally Important Signed Features and Interactions from Random Forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feature and Interaction Importance (FII) methods are essential in supervised learning for assessing the relevance of input variables and their interactions in complex prediction models. In many domains, such as personalized medicine, local interpretations for individual predictions are often required, rather than global scores summarizing overall feature importance. Random Forests (RFs) are widely used in these settings, and existing interpretability methods typically exploit tree structures and split statistics to provide model-specific insights. However, theoretical understanding of local FII methods for RF remains limited, making it unclear how to interpret high importance scores for individual predictions. We propose a novel, local, model-specific FII method that identifies frequent co-occurrences of features along decision paths, combining global patterns with those observed on paths specific to a given test point. We prove that our method consistently recovers the true local signal features and their interactions under a Locally Spike Sparse (LSS) model and also identifies whether large or small feature values drive a prediction. We illustrate the usefulness of our method and theoretical results through simulation studies and a real-world data example.</description>

      <title>TPV: Parameter Perturbations Through the Lens of Test Prediction Variance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify test prediction variance (TPV) -- the first-order sensitivity of model outputs to parameter perturbations around a trained solution -- as a unifying quantity that links several classical observations about generalization in deep networks. TPV is a fully label-free object whose trace form separates the geometry of the trained model from the specific perturbation mechanism, allowing a broad family of parameter perturbations like SGD noise, label noise, finite-precision noise, and other post-training perturbations to be analyzed under a single framework. Theoretically, we show that TPV estimated on the training set converges to its test-set value in the overparameterized limit, providing the first result that prediction variance under local parameter perturbations can be inferred from training inputs alone. Empirically, TPV exhibits a striking stability across datasets and architectures -- including extremely narrow networks -- and correlates well with clean test loss. Finally, we demonstrate that modeling pruning as a TPV perturbation yields a simple label-free importance measure that performs competitively with state-of-the-art pruning methods, illustrating the practical utility of TPV.

      <title>Data-Driven Model Reduction using WeldNet: Windowed Encoders for Learning Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many problems in science and engineering involve time-dependent, high dimensional datasets arising from complex physical processes, which are costly to simulate. In this work, we propose WeldNet: Windowed Encoders for Learning Dynamics, a data-driven nonlinear model reduction framework to build a low-dimensional surrogate model for complex evolution systems. Given time-dependent training data, we split the time domain into multiple overlapping windows, within which nonlinear dimension reduction is performed by auto-encoders to capture latent codes. Once a low-dimensional representation of the data is learned, a propagator network is trained to capture the evolution of the latent codes in each window, and a transcoder is trained to connect the latent codes between adjacent windows. The proposed windowed decomposition significantly simplifies propagator training by breaking long-horizon dynamics into multiple short, manageable segments, while the transcoders ensure consistency across windows. In addition to the algorithmic framework, we develop a mathematical theory establishing the representation power of WeldNet under the manifold hypothesis, justifying the success of nonlinear model reduction via deep autoencoder-based architectures. Our numerical experiments on various differential equations indicate that WeldNet can capture nonlinear latent structures and their underlying dynamics, outperforming both traditional projection-based approaches and recently developed nonlinear model reduction methods.</description>

      <title>Conditional Coverage Diagnostics for Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluating conditional coverage remains one of the most persistent challenges in assessing the reliability of predictive systems. Although conformal methods can give guarantees on marginal coverage, no method can guarantee to produce sets with correct conditional coverage, leaving practitioners without a clear way to interpret local deviations. To overcome sample-inefficiency and overfitting issues of existing metrics, we cast conditional coverage estimation as a classification problem. Conditional coverage is violated if and only if any classifier can achieve lower risk than the target coverage. Through the choice of a (proper) loss function, the resulting risk difference gives a conservative estimate of natural miscoverage measures such as L1 and L2 distance, and can even separate the effects of over- and under-coverage, and non-constant target coverages. We call the resulting family of metrics excess risk of the target coverage (ERT). We show experimentally that the use of modern classifiers provides much higher statistical power than simple classifiers underlying established metrics like CovGap. Additionally, we use our metric to benchmark different conformal prediction methods. Finally, we release an open-source package for ERT as well as previous conditional coverage metrics. Together, these contributions provide a new lens for understanding, diagnosing, and improving the conditional reliability of predictive systems.</description>

      <title>In-Context Multi-Objective Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Balancing competing objectives is omnipresent across disciplines, from drug design to autonomous systems. Multi-objective Bayesian optimization is a promising solution for such expensive, black-box problems: it fits probabilistic surrogates and selects new designs via an acquisition function that balances exploration and exploitation. In practice, it requires tailored choices of surrogate and acquisition that rarely transfer to the next problem, is myopic when multi-step planning is often required, and adds refitting overhead, particularly in parallel or time-sensitive loops. We present TAMO, a fully amortized, universal policy for multi-objective black-box optimization. TAMO uses a transformer architecture that operates across varying input and objective dimensions, enabling pretraining on diverse corpora and transfer to new problems without retraining: at test time, the pretrained model proposes the next design with a single forward pass. We pretrain the policy with reinforcement learning to maximize cumulative hypervolume improvement over full trajectories, conditioning on the entire query history to approximate the Pareto frontier. Across synthetic benchmarks and real tasks, TAMO produces fast proposals, reducing proposal time by 50-1000x versus alternatives while matching or improving Pareto quality under tight evaluation budgets. These results show that transformers can perform multi-objective optimization entirely in-context, eliminating per-task surrogate fitting and acquisition engineering, and open a path to foundation-style, plug-and-play optimizers for scientific discovery workflows.</description>

      <title>Autotune: fast, accurate, and automatic tuning parameter selection for Lasso</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11139v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso), a popular method for high-dimensional regression, is now used widely for estimating high-dimensional time series models such as the vector autoregression (VAR). Selecting its tuning parameter efficiently and accurately remains a challenge, despite the abundance of available methods for doing so. We propose $\mathsf{autotune}$, a strategy for Lasso to automatically tune itself by optimizing a penalized Gaussian log-likelihood alternately over regression coefficients and noise standard deviation. Using extensive simulation experiments on regression and VAR models, we show that $\mathsf{autotune}$ is faster, and provides better generalization and model selection than established alternatives in low signal-to-noise regimes. In the process, $\mathsf{autotune}$ provides a new estimator of noise standard deviation that can be used for high-dimensional inference, and a new visual diagnostic procedure for checking the sparsity assumption on regression coefficients. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of $\mathsf{autotune}$ on a real-world financial data set. An R package based on C++ is also made publicly available on Github.</description>

      <title>Causal Judge Evaluation: Calibrated Surrogate Metrics for LLM Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LLM-as-judge evaluation has become the de facto standard for scaling model assessment, but the practice is statistically unsound: uncalibrated scores can invert preferences, naive confidence intervals on uncalibrated scores achieve near-0% coverage, and importance-weighted estimators collapse under limited overlap despite high effective sample size (ESS). We introduce Causal Judge Evaluation (CJE), a framework that fixes all three failures. On n=4,961 Chatbot Arena prompts (after filtering from 5k), CJE achieves 99% pairwise ranking accuracy at full sample size (94% averaged across configurations), matching oracle quality, at 14x lower cost (for ranking 5 policies) by calibrating a 16x cheaper judge on just 5% oracle labels (~250 labels). CJE combines three components: (i) AutoCal-R, reward calibration via mean-preserving isotonic regression; (ii) SIMCal-W, weight stabilization via stacking of S-monotone candidates; and (iii) Oracle-Uncertainty Aware (OUA) inference that propagates calibration uncertainty into confidence intervals. We formalize the Coverage-Limited Efficiency (CLE) diagnostic, which explains why IPS-style estimators fail even when ESS exceeds 90%: the logger rarely visits regions where target policies concentrate. Key findings: SNIPS inverts rankings even with reward calibration (38% pairwise, negative Kendall's tau) due to weight instability; calibrated IPS remains near-random (47%) despite weight stabilization, consistent with CLE; OUA improves coverage from near-0% to ~86% (Direct) and ~96% (stacked-DR), where naive intervals severely under-cover.</description>

      <title>Classifying High-Energy Celestial Objects with Machine Learning Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning is a field that has been growing in importance since the early 2010s due to the increasing accuracy of classification models and hardware advances that have enabled faster training on large datasets. In the field of astronomy, tree-based models and simple neural networks have recently garnered attention as a means of classifying celestial objects based on photometric data. We apply common tree-based models to assess performance of these models for discriminating objects with similar photometric signals, pulsars and black holes.
  We also train a RNN on a downsampled and normalized version of the raw signal data to examine its potential as a model capable of object discrimination and classification in real-time.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic Gaussian Blurring Mean Shift: A Statistical Mode-Seeking Framework for Clustering in Curved Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental unsupervised learning task for uncovering patterns in data. While Gaussian Blurring Mean Shift (GBMS) has proven effective for identifying arbitrarily shaped clusters in Euclidean space, it struggles with datasets exhibiting hierarchical or tree-like structures. In this work, we introduce HypeGBMS, a novel extension of GBMS to hyperbolic space. Our method replaces Euclidean computations with hyperbolic distances and employs M\"obius-weighted means to ensure that all updates remain consistent with the geometry of the space. HypeGBMS effectively captures latent hierarchies while retaining the density-seeking behavior of GBMS. We provide theoretical insights into convergence and computational complexity, along with empirical results that demonstrate improved clustering quality in hierarchical datasets. This work bridges classical mean-shift clustering and hyperbolic representation learning, offering a principled approach to density-based clustering in curved spaces. Extensive experimental evaluations on $11$ real-world datasets demonstrate that HypeGBMS significantly outperforms conventional mean-shift clustering methods in non-Euclidean settings, underscoring its robustness and effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Contrastive Time Series Forecasting with Anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series forecasting predicts future values from past data. In real-world settings, some anomalous events have lasting effects and influence the forecast, while others are short-lived and should be ignored. Standard forecasting models fail to make this distinction, often either overreacting to noise or missing persistent shifts. We propose Co-TSFA (Contrastive Time Series Forecasting with Anomalies), a regularization framework that learns when to ignore anomalies and when to respond. Co-TSFA generates input-only and input-output augmentations to model forecast-irrelevant and forecast-relevant anomalies, and introduces a latent-output alignment loss that ties representation changes to forecast changes. This encourages invariance to irrelevant perturbations while preserving sensitivity to meaningful distributional shifts. Experiments on the Traffic and Electricity benchmarks, as well as on a real-world cash-demand dataset, demonstrate that Co-TSFA improves performance under anomalous conditions while maintaining accuracy on normal data. An anonymized GitHub repository with the implementation of Co-TSFA is provided and will be made public upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Covariate-assisted graph matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data integration is essential across diverse domains, from historical records to biomedical research, facilitating joint statistical inference. A crucial initial step in this process involves merging multiple data sources based on matching individual records, often in the absence of unique identifiers. When the datasets are networks, this problem is typically addressed through graph matching methodologies. For such cases, auxiliary features or covariates associated with nodes or edges can be instrumental in achieving improved accuracy. However, most existing graph matching techniques do not incorporate this information, limiting their performance against non-identifiable and erroneous matches. To overcome these limitations, we propose two novel covariate-assisted seeded graph matching methods, where a partial alignment for a set of nodes, called seeds, is known. The first one solves a quadratic assignment problem (QAP) over the whole graph, while the second one only leverages the local neighborhood structure of seed nodes for computational scalability. Both methods are grounded in a conditional modeling framework, where elements of one graph's adjacency matrix are modeled using a generalized linear model (GLM), given the other graph and the available covariates. We establish theoretical guarantees for model estimation error and exact recovery of the solution of the QAP. The effectiveness of our methods is demonstrated through numerical experiments and in an application to matching the statistics academic genealogy and the collaboration networks. By leveraging additional covariates, we achieve improved alignment accuracy. Our work highlights the power of integrating covariate information in the classical graph matching setup, offering a practical and improved framework for combining network data with wide-ranging applications.</description>

      <title>Softmax as Linear Attention in the Large-Prompt Regime: a Measure-based Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Softmax attention is a central component of transformer architectures, yet its nonlinear structure poses significant challenges for theoretical analysis. We develop a unified, measure-based framework for studying single-layer softmax attention under both finite and infinite prompts. For i.i.d. Gaussian inputs, we lean on the fact that the softmax operator converges in the infinite-prompt limit to a linear operator acting on the underlying input-token measure. Building on this insight, we establish non-asymptotic concentration bounds for the output and gradient of softmax attention, quantifying how rapidly the finite-prompt model approaches its infinite-prompt counterpart, and prove that this concentration remains stable along the entire training trajectory in general in-context learning settings with sub-Gaussian tokens. In the case of in-context linear regression, we use the tractable infinite-prompt dynamics to analyze training at finite prompt length. Our results allow optimization analyses developed for linear attention to transfer directly to softmax attention when prompts are sufficiently long, showing that large-prompt softmax attention inherits the analytical structure of its linear counterpart. This, in turn, provides a principled and broadly applicable toolkit for studying the training dynamics and statistical behavior of softmax attention layers in large prompt regimes.</description>

Abstract: Mathematical modeling in systems toxicology enables a comprehensive understanding of the effects of pharmaceutical substances on cardiac health. However, the complexity of these models limits their widespread application in early drug discovery. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to solving parameterized models of cardiac action potentials by combining meta-learning techniques with Systems Biology-Informed Neural Networks (SBINNs). The proposed method, hyperSBINN, effectively addresses the challenge of predicting the effects of various compounds at different concentrations on cardiac action potentials, outperforming traditional differential equation solvers in speed. Our model efficiently handles scenarios with limited data and complex parameterized differential equations. The hyperSBINN model demonstrates robust performance in predicting APD90 values, indicating its potential as a reliable tool for modeling cardiac electrophysiology and aiding in preclinical drug development. This framework represents an advancement in computational modeling, offering a scalable and efficient solution for simulating and understanding complex biological systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the problem of safely learning controlled stochastic dynamics from discrete-time trajectory observations, ensuring system trajectories remain within predefined safe regions during both training and deployment. Safety-critical constraints of this kind are crucial in applications such as autonomous robotics, finance, and biomedicine. We introduce a method that ensures safe exploration and efficient estimation of system dynamics by iteratively expanding an initial known safe control set using kernel-based confidence bounds. After training, the learned model enables predictions of the system's dynamics and permits safety verification of any given control. Our approach requires only mild smoothness assumptions and access to an initial safe control set, enabling broad applicability to complex real-world systems. We provide theoretical guarantees for safety and derive adaptive learning rates that improve with increasing Sobolev regularity of the true dynamics. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the practical effectiveness of our method in terms of safety, estimation accuracy, and computational efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Privacy preservation in machine learning, particularly through Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD), is critical for sensitive data analysis. However, existing statistical inference methods for SGD predominantly focus on cyclic subsampling, while DP-SGD requires randomized subsampling. This paper first bridges this gap by establishing the asymptotic properties of SGD under the randomized rule and extending these results to DP-SGD. For the output of DP-SGD, we show that the asymptotic variance decomposes into statistical, sampling, and privacy-induced components. Two methods are proposed for constructing valid confidence intervals: the plug-in method and the random scaling method. We also perform extensive numerical analysis, which shows that the proposed confidence intervals achieve nominal coverage rates while maintaining privacy.</description>

      <title>Echoes of the past: A unified perspective on fading memory and echo states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have become increasingly popular in information processing tasks involving time series and temporal data. A fundamental property of RNNs is their ability to create reliable input/output responses, often linked to how the network handles its memory of the information it processed. Various notions have been proposed to conceptualize the behavior of memory in RNNs, including steady states, echo states, state forgetting, input forgetting, and fading memory. Although these notions are often used interchangeably, their precise relationships remain unclear. This work aims to unify these notions in a common language, derive new implications and equivalences between them, and provide alternative proofs to some existing results. By clarifying the relationships between these concepts, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of RNNs and their temporal information processing capabilities.</description>

      <title>Misspecification-robust amortised simulation-based inference using variational methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in neural density estimation have enabled powerful simulation-based inference (SBI) methods that can flexibly approximate Bayesian inference for intractable stochastic models. Although these methods have demonstrated reliable posterior estimation when the simulator accurately represents the underlying data generative process (DGP), recent work has shown that they perform poorly in the presence of model misspecification. This poses a significant issue for their use in real-world problems, due to simulators always misrepresenting the true DGP to a certain degree. In this paper, we introduce robust variational neural posterior estimation (RVNP), a method which addresses the problem of misspecification in amortised SBI by bridging the simulation-to-reality gap using variational inference and error modelling. We test RVNP on multiple benchmark tasks, including using real data from astronomy, and show that it can recover robust posterior inference in a data-driven manner without adopting hyperparameters or priors governing the misspecification influence.</description>

      <title>Statistical physics of deep learning: Optimal learning of a multi-layer perceptron near interpolation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24616v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For four decades statistical physics has been providing a framework to analyse neural networks. A long-standing question remained on its capacity to tackle deep learning models capturing rich feature learning effects, thus going beyond the narrow networks or kernel methods analysed until now. We positively answer through the study of the supervised learning of a multi-layer perceptron. Importantly, (i) its width scales as the input dimension, making it more prone to feature learning than ultra wide networks, and more expressive than narrow ones or ones with fixed embedding layers; and (ii) we focus on the challenging interpolation regime where the number of trainable parameters and data are comparable, which forces the model to adapt to the task. We consider the matched teacher-student setting. Therefore, we provide the fundamental limits of learning random deep neural network targets and identify the sufficient statistics describing what is learnt by an optimally trained network as the data budget increases. A rich phenomenology emerges with various learning transitions. With enough data, optimal performance is attained through the model's "specialisation" towards the target, but it can be hard to reach for training algorithms which get attracted by sub-optimal solutions predicted by the theory. Specialisation occurs inhomogeneously across layers, propagating from shallow towards deep ones, but also across neurons in each layer. Furthermore, deeper targets are harder to learn. Despite its simplicity, the Bayes-optimal setting provides insights on how the depth, non-linearity and finite (proportional) width influence neural networks in the feature learning regime that are potentially relevant in much more general settings.</description>

      <title>Generative Bayesian Optimization: Generative Models as Acquisition Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a general strategy for turning generative models into candidate solution samplers for batch Bayesian optimization (BO). The use of generative models for BO enables large batch scaling as generative sampling, optimization of non-continuous design spaces, and high-dimensional and combinatorial design. Inspired by the success of direct preference optimization (DPO), we show that one can train a generative model with noisy, simple utility values directly computed from observations to then form proposal distributions whose densities are proportional to the expected utility, i.e., BO's acquisition function values. Furthermore, this approach is generalizable beyond preference-based feedback to general types of reward signals and loss functions. This perspective avoids the construction of surrogate (regression or classification) models, common in previous methods that have used generative models for black-box optimization. Theoretically, we show that the generative models within the BO process approximately follow a sequence of distributions which asymptotically concentrate at the global optima under certain conditions. We also demonstrate this effect through experiments on challenging optimization problems involving large batches in high dimensions.</description>

      <title>Assumption-Lean Post-Integrated Inference with Surrogate Control Outcomes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04996v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data integration methods aim to extract low-dimensional embeddings from high-dimensional outcomes to remove unwanted variations, such as batch effects and unmeasured covariates, across heterogeneous datasets. However, multiple hypothesis testing after integration can be biased due to data-dependent processes. We introduce a robust post-integrated inference method that accounts for latent heterogeneity by utilizing control outcomes. Leveraging causal interpretations, we derive nonparametric identifiability of the direct effects using negative control outcomes. By utilizing surrogate control outcomes as an extension of negative control outcomes, we develop semiparametric inference on projected direct effect estimands, accounting for hidden mediators, confounders, and moderators. These estimands remain statistically meaningful under model misspecifications and with error-prone embeddings. We provide bias quantifications and finite-sample linear expansions with uniform concentration bounds. The proposed doubly robust estimators are consistent and efficient under minimal assumptions and potential misspecification, facilitating data-adaptive estimation with machine learning algorithms. Our proposal is evaluated using random forests through simulations and analysis of single-cell CRISPR perturbed datasets, which may contain potential unmeasured confounders.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Spontaneous Topic Changes in Next Token Prediction with Self-Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06382v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human cognition is punctuated by abrupt, spontaneous shifts between topics-driven by emotional, contextual, or associative cues-a phenomenon known as spontaneous thought in neuroscience. In contrast, self-attention based models depend on structured patterns over their inputs to predict each next token, lacking spontaneity. Motivated by this distinction, we characterize spontaneous topic changes in self-attention architectures, revealing both their similarities and their divergences from spontaneous human thought. First, we establish theoretical results under a simplified, single-layer self-attention model with suitable conditions by defining the topic as a set of Token Priority Graphs (TPGs). Specifically, we demonstrate that (1) the model maintains the priority order of tokens related to the input topic, (2) a spontaneous topic change can occur only if lower-priority tokens outnumber all higher-priority tokens of the input topic, and (3) unlike human cognition, the longer context length or the more ambiguous input topic reduces the likelihood of spontaneous change. Second, we empirically validate that these dynamics persist in modern, state-of-the-art LLMs, underscoring a fundamental disparity between human cognition and AI behaviour in the context of spontaneous topic changes. To the best of our knowledge, no prior work has explored these questions with a focus as closely aligned to human thought.</description>

      <title>How Muon's Spectral Design Benefits Generalization: A Study on Imbalanced Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22980v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growing adoption of spectrum-aware matrix-valued optimizers such as Muon and Shampoo in deep learning motivates a systematic study of their generalization properties and, in particular, when they might outperform competitive algorithms. We approach this question by introducing appropriate simplifying abstractions as follows: First, we use imbalanced data as a testbed. Second, we study the canonical form of such optimizers, which is Spectral Gradient Descent (SpecGD) -- each update step is $UV^T$ where $U\Sigma V^T$ is the truncated SVD of the gradient. Third, within this framework we identify a canonical setting for which we precisely quantify when SpecGD outperforms vanilla Euclidean GD. For a Gaussian mixture data model and both linear and bilinear models, we show that unlike GD, which prioritizes learning dominant principal components of the data first, SpecGD learns all principal components of the data at equal rates. We demonstrate how this translates to a growing gap in class balanced loss favoring SpecGD early in training and further show that the gap remains consistent even when the GD counterpart uses adaptive step-sizes via normalization. By extending the analysis to deep linear models, we show that depth amplifies these effects. We empirically verify our theoretical findings on a variety of imbalanced datasets. Our experiments compare practical variants of spectral methods, like Muon and Shampoo, against their Euclidean counterparts and Adam. The results validate our findings that these spectral optimizers achieve superior generalization by promoting a more balanced learning of the data's underlying components.</description>

      <title>A Variance-Based Analysis of Sample Complexity for Grid Coverage</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Verifying uniform conditions over continuous spaces through random sampling is fundamental in machine learning and control theory, yet classical coverage analyses often yield conservative bounds, particularly at small failure probabilities. We study uniform random sampling on the $d$-dimensional unit hypercube and analyze the number of uncovered subcubes after discretization. By applying a concentration inequality to the uncovered-count statistic, we derive a sample complexity bound with a logarithmic dependence on the failure probability ($\delta$), i.e., $M =O( \tilde{C}\ln(\frac{2\tilde{C}}{\delta}))$, which contrasts sharply with the classical linear $1/\delta$ dependence. Under standard Lipschitz and uniformity assumptions, we present a self-contained derivation and compare our result with classical coupon-collector rates. Numerical studies across dimensions, precision levels, and confidence targets indicate that our bound tracks practical coverage requirements more tightly and scales favorably as $\delta \to 0$. Our findings offer a sharper theoretical tool for algorithms that rely on grid-based coverage guarantees, enabling more efficient sampling, especially in high-confidence regimes.</description>

      <title>A Multivariate Bernoulli-Based Sampling Method for Multi-Label Data with Application to Meta-Research</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08371v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Datasets may contain observations with multiple labels. If the labels are not mutually exclusive, and if the labels vary greatly in frequency, obtaining a sample that includes sufficient observations with scarcer labels to make inferences about those labels, and which deviates from the population frequencies in a known manner, creates challenges. In this paper, we consider a multivariate Bernoulli distribution as our underlying distribution of a multi-label problem. We present a novel sampling algorithm that takes label dependencies into account. It uses observed label frequencies to estimate multivariate Bernoulli distribution parameters and calculate weights for each label combination. This approach ensures the weighted sampling acquires target distribution characteristics while accounting for label dependencies. We applied this approach to a sample of research articles from Web of Science labeled with 64 biomedical topic categories. We aimed to preserve category frequency order, reduce frequency differences between most and least common categories, and account for category dependencies. This approach produced a more balanced sub-sample, enhancing the representation of minority categories.</description>

      <title>Decoupled Q-Chunking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10926v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Temporal-difference (TD) methods learn state and action values efficiently by bootstrapping from their own future value predictions, but such a self-bootstrapping mechanism is prone to bootstrapping bias, where the errors in the value targets accumulate across steps and result in biased value estimates. Recent work has proposed to use chunked critics, which estimate the value of short action sequences ("chunks") rather than individual actions, speeding up value backup. However, extracting policies from chunked critics is challenging: policies must output the entire action chunk open-loop, which can be sub-optimal for environments that require policy reactivity and also challenging to model especially when the chunk length grows. Our key insight is to decouple the chunk length of the critic from that of the policy, allowing the policy to operate over shorter action chunks. We propose a novel algorithm that achieves this by optimizing the policy against a distilled critic for partial action chunks, constructed by optimistically backing up from the original chunked critic to approximate the maximum value achievable when a partial action chunk is extended to a complete one. This design retains the benefits of multi-step value propagation while sidestepping both the open-loop sub-optimality and the difficulty of learning action chunking policies for long action chunks. We evaluate our method on challenging, long-horizon offline goal-conditioned tasks and show that it reliably outperforms prior methods. Code: github.com/ColinQiyangLi/dqc.</description>
