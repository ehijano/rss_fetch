      <title>A two-temperature gas-kinetic scheme for hypersonic nonequilibrium flow computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate aerodynamic and aerothermodynamic predictions are crucial for numerous hypersonic applications. This paper proposes a gas-kinetic scheme (GKS) coupled with a two-temperature kinetic model, which distinguishes between the translational-rotational and vibrational modes of temperature. Compared with one-temperature model and the translational-rotational multi-temperature model, the proposed model provides a more physically accurate simulation of real gas effects when vibrational energy modes of air are excited. On the other hand, it is computationally simpler than multi-temperature model with independent translational, rotational and vibrational modes. The scheme is implemented on both structured and unstructured grids. To further improve the robustness for strong shock and rarefaction waves, the discontinuity feedback factor is employed instead of traditional limiters. Numerical verifications are conducted on one-dimensional shock structure, two-dimensional (2D) hypersonic flow over a cylinder, 2D hypersonic flow over a wedge and 2D Edney Type IV shock/shock interaction. Compared with experimental data, the reference results from direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method and Navier--Stokes (NS) solvers, the present method demonstrates accurate prediction of the thermally non-equilibrium shock wave structures and hypersonic flow fields.</description>

      <title>On the local anisotropy of quasi-two-dimensional forced shallow flow: An experimental study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate quasi-two-dimensional (Q2D) forced shallow flows in the presence of solid boundaries and analyze the deviation from the Kolmogorov-Kraichnan (KK) theory. Complex motion is generated using a thin electrolyte subject to electromagnetic forces, and we employ particle tracking velocimetry to resolve the flow properties down to the Kolmogorov scale. Although the velocity probability distribution function closely resembles a Gaussian, deviations from Gaussianity emerge for velocity increments as scales decrease. The second-order structure function supports the onset of local anisotropy at small scales. The sign of the third-order structure function indicates the dominance of the inverse cascade in energy transfer, and the cross-correlation between longitudinal and transverse directions proves to be significant at large scales. The breakdown of local isotropy is consistent with the effect of bottom friction, which primarily affects the longitudinal motion, while leaving the perpendicular direction unaffected. This local anisotropy propagates to larger scales via the inverse energy cascade, with nonlinear interactions eventually influencing the perpendicular direction.</description>

      <title>Shuttlecock velocity decay after smash and slice shots in badminton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reports on the decay in shuttlecock velocity after smash and slice shots performed by elite and international players, based on the analysis of videos captured on a badminton court with high-speed cameras. The trajectories of feather shuttlecocks show an exponential decay in velocity and an exponential increase in time-of-flight with distance, in accordance with the equation of motion of a shuttlecock subjected to high drag. The initial speed, which can exceed 500 km/h, is reduced by half every 3.35 m, depending on the physical parameters of the shuttlecock characterized by a speed index. The videos show that plastic shuttlecocks, which are more resistant than feather shuttlecocks, deform at high speeds. The resulting decay of their drag coefficient with increasing speed makes them unsuitable for high-level play. The study also shows that the spin induced by the slice shots of left-handed players or the reverse slice shots of right-handed players slows the shuttlecock down.</description>

      <title>Wave turbulence of inertia--gravity waves: a theory for the oceanic spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a derivation using kinetic wave theory of the two-dimensional empirical Garrett--Munk spectrum for ocean internal waves, valid at all frequencies including near-inertial frequencies. This is based directly on the governing equations for a two-dimensional Boussinesq system with constant stratification and rotation. Our results improve on previous work by side-stepping the use of canonical variables, by taking full account of the Coriolis parameter in a non-hydrostatic dispersion relation, by filtering the balanced flow component from the dynamics, by using the conservation laws for energy and two components of pseudomomentum to bring the collision integral into a very simple form, by giving precise convergence conditions for the collision integral, and by finding the unique scale-invariant turbulent wave spectrum that corresponds to turbulent fluxes from small to large wavenumbers. The last step was achieved in the limit of small but nonzero Coriolis parameter.
  Key results are that any nonzero Coriolis parameter regularizes the singular nature of the non-rotating problem and that the homogeneity properties of the dispersion relation and of the interaction coefficients alone already imply that the spectrum is separable in vertical wavenumber and frequency. Within the restrictions of two-dimensional dynamics, this provides a theoretical framework for internal-wave turbulence consistent with oceanic observations.</description>

      <title>Scalar mixing in non-Markovian homogeneous isotropic synthetic turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that non-Markovianity of the velocity field is an essential property of turbulent mixing. We demonstrate this via passive scalar mixing by synthetically generated stochastic velocity fields. Including a separate velocity decorrelation time scale for each spatial scale (random sweeping) yields an essentially non-Markovian velocity field with a finite time memory decaying as -5 (for a decaying spectrum) instead of an exponential decay (Markovian), which is obtained by including a constant time scale for all spatial scales, irrespective of the filtering function. We characterize the Lagrangian mixing statistics of both the Markovian and non-Markovian synthetic fields and compare them against a corresponding incompressible direct numerical simulation (DNS). We also study diffusive passive scalar mixing in the Schmidt number range Sc&lt;1 using the DNS and the synthetic fields. While both the synthetic fields recover the -17/3 scalar spectrum for low Schmidt numbers, the mean gradients in a decaying simulation, as well as the production and dissipation of scalar variance in a statistically stationary simulation, are severely underpredicted by the Markovian fields compared to the non-Markovian fields. Throughout, we compare our results with companion 3D DNS to show the necessity of non-Markovianity in synthetic fields to capture mixing dynamics.</description>

      <title>Complete Matched Asymptotic Expansions for Velocity Statistics in Turbulent Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complete high fidelity matched asymptotic expansions (abbreviated MAE) are developed for the first and second order turbulence statistics in channel flow from 11 direct numerical simulations (DNS). To put the crucial identification of overlaps on a solid footing, a simple a priori test is devised, which only requires a DNS or experimental profile and the presumed overlap of the MAE for the quantity in question. This test fully supports the form c0 - c1 Y^1/4 of the overlaps for the stream-wise and cross-stream normal stresses &lt;uu&gt; and &lt;ww&gt;, which has been advocated by Chen and Sreenivasan (2022, 2023, 2025) and Monkewitz (2022, 2023). The first MAE analysis of the wall-normal stress &lt;vv&gt; then reveals an overlap of the form c0 - c1 Y^5/4 , which is extensively documented. Finally, the logarithmic indicator function Xi = y dU/dy for the mean velocity overlap is reanalyzed, with focus on its spatial oscillations. The latter are compared in the concluding section to the spatial oscillations of &lt;uu&gt;, together with further observations and suggestions.</description>

      <title>Applying contact angles based on a continuously moving contact line in 2D VOF simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A height-function-based numerical approach is developed for enforcing contact angles on flat and curved solid surfaces within two-dimensional volume-of-fluid simulations. This method incorporates the contact line position into the curvature estimation in the contact line cell, where the interface normal is constrained to the prescribed angle to ensure smooth contact line motion. On flat solid surfaces, the proposed model achieves higher accuracy than the conventional vertical height-function method for enforcing very small and very large contact angles. Moreover, it extends naturally to curved solid surfaces represented by the embedded boundary method, enabling the imposition of arbitrary contact angles without inducing significant spurious currents near the contact line. Numerical validations confirm the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method, demonstrating its applicability to multiphase flows involving complex wall geometries and contact-line dynamics.</description>

      <title>Data-driven sparse modeling and decomposition for superspreading-wetting dynamics of a droplet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superspreading wetting is traditionally attributed to surfactant-driven mechanisms. However, recent observations of superspreading in surfactant-free nanofluids defy standard theoretical explanations. This study considers a data-driven approach to model droplet dynamics with the thickness of liquid films on the nanometer-micrometer scale in a compact form of a partial differential equation. We examine spatiotemporal film-thickness profiles resolved at the nanometer scale via phase-shifting imaging ellipsometry. For a pure solvent, the present governing equation recovers the classical lubrication physics driven by disjoining pressure and evaporation. In contrast, the nanofluid dynamics necessitates a unique transport term scaling with the gradient of the inverse film thickness. Theoretical analysis suggests this term represents a nanoparticle-induced bias flux, consistent with a hypothesized capillary wicking mechanism within the precursor film. The identification of the current nanofluid-specific term underscores the efficacy of integrating high-precision experimental measurements with data-driven modeling to unravel complex wetting dynamics.</description>

      <title>Bridging Filtering and Point-Splitting Approaches for Variable-Density Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy transfer in turbulent flows is typically described either through correlation functions, via the K\'arm\'an-Howarth-Monin relation, or through a scale-by-scale budget of filtered energy (Frisch 1995). For constant-density turbulence, the equivalence between these two descriptions is well understood. In compressible turbulence, however, several definitions of filtered energy exist, and for most of them the associated formulation in terms of correlation functions is unclear. We develop a general framework to determine the multi-point correlation functions corresponding to any specified filtered energy. As a demonstration, we show that the Favre filtered energy--defined as the ratio of the squared filtered momentum to the filtered density--and the terms in its budget can be written as an infinite series of multi-point correlation functions. We validate the framework numerically using three-dimensional buoyancy-driven bubbly flows.</description>

      <title>Efficient temporal prediction of compressible flows in irregular domains using Fourier neural operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the temporal evolution of high-speed compressible fluids in irregular flow fields using the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO). We reconstruct the irregular flow field point set into sequential format compatible with FNO input requirements, and then embed temporal bundling technique within a recurrent neural network (RNN) for multi-step prediction. We further employ a composite loss function to balance errors across different physical quantities. Experiments are conducted on three different types of irregular flow fields, including orthogonal and non-orthogonal grid configurations. Then we comprehensively analyze the physical component loss curves, flow field visualizations, and physical profiles. Results demonstrate that our approach significantly surpasses traditional numerical methods in computational efficiency while achieving high accuracy, with maximum relative $L_2$ errors of (0.78, 0.57, 0.35)% for ($p$, $T$, $\mathbf{u}$) respectively. This verifies that the method can efficiently and accurately simulate the temporal evolution of high-speed compressible flows in irregular domains.</description>

      <title>Zonal flows driven by libration in rotating spherical shells: the case of periodic characteristic paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the weakly nonlinear dynamics of internal shear layers and the mean zonal flow induced by the longitudinal libration of an inner core within a spherical shell. Building on the work of He et al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 939, 2022, A3), which focused on linear dynamics, we adopt a similar setup to explore the nonlinear regime using both asymptotic theory and numerical computations, with Ekman numbers as low as $E=10^{-10}$. A specific forcing frequency of $\widehat{\omega}=\sqrt{2}\widehat{\Omega}$, where $\widehat{\Omega}$ denotes the rotation rate, is introduced to generate a closed rectangular path of characteristics for the inertial wave beam generated at the critical latitude. Our approach extends previous results by Le Diz\`es (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 899, 2020, A21) and reveals that nonlinear interactions are predominantly localized around regions where the wave beam reflects on the boundary. We derive specific scaling laws governing the nonlinear interactions: the width of the interaction region scales as $E^{1/3}$, and the amplitude of the resulting mean zonal flow scales as $E^{1/6}$ in general. However, near the rotation axis, where the singularity of the self-similar solution becomes more pronounced, the amplitude exhibits a scaling of $E^{-1/2}$. In addition, our study also examines the nonlinear interactions of beams which are governed by different scaling laws. Through comparison with numerical results, we validate the theoretical predictions of the asymptotic framework, observing good agreement as the Ekman number decreases.</description>

      <title>Settling of chiral particles in a turbulent flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral particles are experimentally investigated while settling inwater with various turbulence intensity levels. The locations and orientations of the particles are tracked over time, allowing the close investigation of the particles' settling dynamics. The generated turbulent flow is measured using laser Doppler anemometry (LDA), and the turbulence strength varies between experiments in the range $0 \leq Re_\lambda \leq 250$. Starting with quiescent particle settling, the chiral particle's orientation dynamics are studied, revealing a preferred alignment and a strong translation-rotation coupling. The particle chirality determines the preferred rotation direction, though the alignment and translation-rotation coupling gradually vanish with increasing turbulence. We identify multiple settling modes for the chiral particles, which are characterised by the evolution of the rotation angles. Finally, a theoretical model assuming a simplified chiral particle in Stokes flow clarifies the emergence of each settling mode.</description>

      <title>Effect of particle-momentum on an isothermal flow-field inside a swirl combustor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of particles on isothermal flow inside a lab-scale swirl combustor for a fixed inlet swirl number of 0.67 using steady-state CFD simulations. The combustor geometry and baseline conditions, with no particles, are taken from Taamallah et al. [1], but with a simplification. In the present work, we provide rotation to the flow using velocity boundary condition, whereas in [1], a swirler is built into the geometry to achieve the same effect. Shear stress transport (SST) k-omega model, an eddy-viscosity based Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equation approach, is used for modelling turbulence. The comprehensive model is validated against the experimental axial-velocity data in [1]. Two simulations, one with 75 and another with 100 micron particles using Discrete particle model (DPM) were conducted to isolate the effect of particle motion on swirl-combustor flow without combustion. Their analysis shows significant downstream shift of central recirculation zone (CRZ). An effect that can significantly impact the stabilization of coal flame in pulverized particle reactors.</description>

      <title>Statistical state dynamics modes and equilibria underlie the structure and mechanism of wide channel Couette turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wide channel Couette (WCC) turbulence is striking in being dominated by a large-scale spanwise periodic structure composed of streamwise streaks and associated roll superstructures. This apparent equilibrium is shown in this work to correspond to a fixed point solution of the Navier-Stokes equations expressed in the statistical state dynamics (SSD) framework. Moreover, this fixed point solution is found to be rank-three, consisting of one analytically identified roll-streak structure (RSS) constituting the first cumulant of the SSD, and two analytically determined eigenmodes supporting the second cumulant. This minimal representation captures both the structure and the dynamics of WCC turbulence, while the remaining spectral components contribute negligibly to the equilibrium dynamics. Turbulent Couette flows other than WCC can be understood to be limit cycle and chaotic extensions supported by the same underlying mechanism as the fixed point WCC turbulence except for the two eigenmodes supporting WCC turbulence being replaced by two Floquet modes and two Lyapunov vectors, respectively. These results provide an analytic solution for turbulence in Couette flow.</description>

Abstract: We propose a graph-based, multi-fidelity learning framework for the prediction of stationary Navier--Stokes solutions in non-parametrized two-dimensional geometries. The method is designed to guide the learning process through successive approximations, starting from reduced-order and full Stokes models, and progressively approaching the Navier--Stokes solution. To effectively capture both local and long-range dependencies in the velocity and pressure fields, we combine graph neural networks with Transformer and Mamba architectures. While Transformers achieve the highest accuracy, we show that Mamba can be successfully adapted to graph-structured data through an unsupervised node-ordering strategy. The Mamba approach significantly reduces computational cost while maintaining performance. Physical knowledge is embedded directly into the architecture through an encoding -- processing -- physics informed decoding pipeline. Derivatives are computed through algebraic operators constructed via the Weighted Least Squares method. The flexibility of these operators allows us not only to make the output obey the governing equations, but also to constrain selected hidden features to satisfy mass conservation. We introduce additional physical biases through an enriched graph convolution with the same differential operators describing the PDEs. Overall, we successfully guide the learning process by physical knowledge and fluid dynamics insights, leading to more regular and accurate predictions</description>

      <title>Density-based topology optimization for turbulent fluid flow using the standard k-epsilon RANS model with wall-functions imposed through an implicit wall penalty formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulent flows have high requirements for very fine meshes near the boundary to ensure accuracy. In the context of topology optimization (TO), such fine meshes become unrealistic and common approaches are hampered by low accuracy and overestimation of boundary layer thickness. Wall-functions are a natural way to ease the computational requirements, but they are not naturally imposed in density-based TO due to the diffuse design parametrization. We propose an implicit wall-function formulation for the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS), standard k-epsilon model that extracts wall-normal information directly from the gradient of the design variable and enables a penalty-based formulation for imposing wall-functions to the RANS equations, without the need for body-fitted meshes. The method provides a reliable route to high Reynolds number turbulent topology optimization, delivering boundary layer accuracy comparable to explicit-wall body-fitted analyses, while retaining the flexibility of density-based TO. Furthermore, because wall effects are modeled using wall-functions, accurate solutions are obtained on substantially coarser meshes, leading to significant reductions in computational cost. The approach is validated on three canonical benchmarks over Reynolds numbers up to Re = 2e5: a pipe-bend; a U-bend; and a Tesla-valve. Across all cases, the proposed method accurately recovers near-wall velocity profiles, closely matching verification simulations on body-fitted meshes with explicit wall-functions. In contrast, a conventional turbulent TO formulation, without the proposed wall-function treatment, mispredicts boundary-layer development and yields sub-optimal results.</description>

      <title>Liouville Spectral Gap and Bifurcation Driven Lagrangian Eulerian Decoupling with Nondiffusive Turbulence Closures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In fully developed homogeneous and isotropic turbulence, the Lagrangian and Eulerian descriptions of motion, although formally equivalent, become statistically decoupled. In this work, by invoking Liouville theorem, we show that the joint probability density function (PDF) of the Eulerian and Lagrangian fields, evolving from arbitrary initial conditions, relaxes exponentially toward a factorized form given by the product of the corresponding marginal PDFs. This relaxation is governed by a genuine spectral gap of the Liouville operator, whose magnitude is primarily set by the bifurcation rate of the velocity gradient dynamics, whereas the contribution of Lyapunov exponents is shown to be significantly smaller. As a consequence, Eulerian Lagrangian correlations decay rapidly, and if the joint PDF is initially factorized, its factorized structure is preserved at all subsequent times, with each marginal evolving independently under the corresponding dynamics. We further show that the formal equivalence between the two descriptions implies the invariance of the relative kinetic energy between arbitrarily chosen points. When combined with the asymmetric statistics of instantaneous finite scale Lyapunov exponents in incompressible turbulence, this property provides a quantitative interpretation of particle pair separation and of the turbulent energy cascade.
  Finally, these results naturally lead to nondiffusive closure relations for the von K\'arm\'an Howarth and Corrsin equations, which coincide with those previously proposed by the author, thereby providing an independent theoretical validation of those closures.</description>

      <title>Receptivity and instability of the hypersonic flow over moderately blunt cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With a view to identifying and understanding the linear receptivity and amplification mechanisms that underpin laminar-to-turbulent transition over blunt bodies in hypersonic flow, we use resolvent analysis to study the flow over a blunt cone with 7{\deg} half-angle at Mach number $M_{\infty} = 6$, zero angle of attack, and nose-radius-based Reynolds number $Re_{R_n} = 90000$. Optimal forcing and responses are obtained for frequencies up to 330 kHz and azimuthal wavenumbers between 0 and 200. Wall-temperature effects are accounted for by considering both isothermal ($T_w =$ 300 K) and adiabatic wall conditions. The resolvent analysis shows that stationary streak modes are the most amplified in the isothermal case, followed by entropy-layer modes between 20 and 140 kHz. In the adiabatic case, the $1^{st}$ Mack mode is the most amplified. The entropy layer, caused by the nose-tip bluntness, has a profound influence on the receptivity structures. For the optimal streak mode, the most intense receptivity structures lie deep in the entropy layer, further away from the boundary-layer edge compared to the equivalent sharp-cone streak mode. This indicates that atmospheric disturbances may excite streak-like instability without fully penetrating the boundary layer. For the entropy-layer modes, the dominant receptivity and fluctuation signatures are located within the entropy layer. An energy-budget analysis reveals that these modes are most susceptible to kinetic disturbances and they sign the most on temperature fluctuations. These modes are found to leverage a temperature mixing mechanism that exploits the baseflow's wall-normal temperature gradient in the entropy layer to grow.</description>

      <title>Euler-Korteweg vortices: A fluid-mechanical analogue to the Schr\"odinger and Klein-Gordon equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum theory and relativity exhibit several formal analogies with fluid mechanics. This paper examines under which conditions a classical fluid model may reproduce the most basic mathematical formalism of both theories. By assuming that the angular momentum of an irrotational vortex in an inviscid, barotropic, isothermal fluid with sound speed c is equal in magnitude to the reduced Planck constant, and incorporating Korteweg capillary stress, a complex wave equation describing the momentum and continuity equations of a Euler-Korteweg vortex is obtained. When uniform convection is introduced, the weak field approximation of this wave equation is equivalent to Schr\"odinger's equation. The model is shown to yield classical analogues to de Broglie wavelength, the Einstein-Planck relation, the Born rule and the uncertainty principle. Accounting for the retarded propagation of the wavefield of a vortex in convection produces the Lorentz transformation and the Klein-Gordon equation, with Schr\"odinger's equation appearing as the low-Mach-number limit. These results demonstrate that, under explicit assumptions, a classical continuum can reproduce the mathematical formalism of quantum and relativistic theory in their simplest form, without assuming the postulates principal to those theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primary human cells offer the most faithful representation of native human physiology, yet their practical utility is constrained by the difficulty of introducing exogenous genetic material. Electroporation provides a promising non-viral gene delivery approach; however, conventional bulk systems lack the uniformity and integration required for heterogeneous primary cell samples. Here, we present a vortex-assisted electroporation platform integrating size-selective cell trapping with enhanced throughput, parameter optimization across buffer and electrical conditions, and robust delivery of plasmid DNA and in vitro-transcribed mRNA in primary human cells. This integrated platform provides a unified workflow that addresses sample heterogeneity, throughput demands, and delivery efficiency, enabling broader implementation of non-viral gene delivery into primary cells for research and translational applications.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Magnetic Milli-Spinner for Robotic Endovascular Intervention</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis, thrombosis, and aneurysms can lead to life-threatening medical events. Conventional catheter- or guidewire-based endovascular diagnostic and therapeutic devices often struggle to navigate through highly tortuous vascular pathways. The recently developed multifunctional magnetic milli-spinner offers a promising wireless solution by integrating a central through-hole and side slits into a cylindrical body with helical fins, enabling rapid and stable navigation in complex vascular environments for clot debulking, targeted drug delivery, and aneurysm treatment. Here, we combine computational fluid dynamics simulations with experimental validation to optimize the milli-spinner's structural design for high-speed untethered navigation and high-efficiency clot debulking in tubular flow environments. By systematically examining the effects of through-hole radius, fin number, fin helical angle, and slit dimension on propulsion performance, the optimized magnetic milli-spinner achieves a swimming speed of 55 cm/s (~175 body lengths per second), far exceeding existing untethered magnetic robots in tubular environments (&lt; 80 body lengths per second). This exceptional speed enables stable upstream operation against strong physiological flows representative of major arteries and veins, establishing the magnetic milli-spinner as a robust untethered navigation platform for operation in high-flow, tortuous vasculature, with potential applications in robotic mechanical thrombectomy, embolectomy, and targeted drug delivery.</description>

      <title>Towards LLM-enabled autonomous combustion research: A literature-aware agent for self-corrective modeling workflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) is transforming artificial intelligence into autonomous research partners, yet a critical gap persists in complex scientific domains such as combustion modeling. Here, practical AI assistance requires the seamless integration of domain literature knowledge with robust execution capabilities for expertise-intensive tools such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes. To bridge this gap, we introduce FlamePilot, an LLM agent designed to empower combustion modeling research through automated and self-corrective CFD workflows. FlamePilot differentiates itself through an architecture that leverages atomic tools to ensure the robust setup and execution of complex simulations in both OpenFOAM and extended frameworks such as DeepFlame. The system is also capable of learning from scientific articles, extracting key information to guide the simulation from initial setup to optimized results. Validation on a public benchmark shows FlamePilot achieved a perfect 1.0 executability score and a 0.438 success rate, surpassing the prior best reported agent scores of 0.625 and 0.250, respectively. Furthermore, a detailed case study on Moderate or Intense Low-oxygen Dilution (MILD) combustion simulation demonstrates its efficacy as a collaborative research copilot, where FlamePilot autonomously translated a research paper into a configured simulation, conducted the simulation, post-processed the results, proposed evidence-based refinements, and managed a multi-step parameter study to convergence under minimal human intervention. By adopting a transparent and interpretable paradigm, FlamePilot establishes a foundational framework for AI-empowered combustion modeling, fostering a collaborative partnership where the agent manages workflow orchestration, freeing the researcher for high-level analysis.</description>

      <title>Identifying recurrent flows in high-dimensional dissipative chaos from low-dimensional embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unstable periodic orbits (UPOs) are the non-chaotic, dynamical building blocks of spatio-temporal chaos, motivating a first-principles based theory for turbulence ever since the discovery of deterministic chaos. Despite their key role in the ergodic theory approach to fluid turbulence, identifying UPOs is challenging for two reasons: chaotic dynamics and the high-dimensionality of the spatial discretization. We address both issues at once by proposing a loop convergence algorithm for UPOs directly within a low-dimensional embedding of the chaotic attractor. The convergence algorithm circumvents time-integration, hence avoiding instabilities from exponential error amplification, and operates on a latent dynamics obtained by pulling back the physical equations using automatic differentiation through the learned embedding function. The interpretable latent dynamics is accurate in a statistical sense, and, crucially, the embedding preserves the internal structure of the attractor, which we demonstrate through an equivalence between the latent and physical UPOs of both a model PDE and the 2D Navier-Stokes equations. This allows us to exploit the collapse of high-dimensional dissipative systems onto a lower dimensional manifold, and identify UPOs in the low-dimensional embedding.</description>

      <title>New branch of the Tayler-Spruit dynamo in stellar radiative zones</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent asteroseismic observations constitute a great challenge for rotating stellar evolution models, which predict too fast internal rotation rates when only hydrodynamic processes are included. This suggests the absence of one or several unidentified angular momentum transport processes in these models. Transport by large-scale and strong magnetic fields in the radiative zone is a promising candidate to explain the observations. While these fields may have a fossil origin, a dynamo driven by the Tayler instability in a shear flow constitute a primary mechanism to form the necessary magnetic fields. Despite recent numerical studies, this mechanism remains poorly known. Motivated by this, we investigate the Tayler-Spruit dynamo through a new set of three-dimensional direct numerical simulations. We model the radiative zone as a Boussinesq stably stratified fluid whose differential rotation is maintained by a volumetric body force. We report for the first time the existence of two bistable dynamo branches, which mainly differ by the magnetic field location (near the equator and the polar axis). While the equatorial branch is driven by the magnetorotational instability, we mainly investigate the newly identified polar branch, which is driven by the Tayler instability. We show that this branch can still operate and transport angular momentum efficiently in a very strong stratification regime. We extract new scaling laws for the different magnetic field components, transports processes, and the minimum shear to trigger the Tayler instability-driven dynamo. Finally, we roughly constrain the signature of the generated magnetic fields on asteroseismic modes propagating in main-sequence and evolved stars. Thus, our results fosters new studies using stellar evolution models including our prescriptions and the search of asteroseismic signals impacted by large-scale azimuthal magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Complex dynamical regimes of the Tayler-Spruit dynamo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrophysical dynamos feature various spatial structures and dynamical regimes, ranging from hemispherical magnetic fields to the random reversals of the geodynamo. The recently observed Tayler-Spruit dynamo has been invoked to explain angular momentum transport in stellar radiative zones and magnetar formation in a proto-neutron star spun-up by fallback accretion. Whether this dynamo mechanism can lead to different dynamical regimes remains an open question. Using three-dimensional direct numerical simulations, we model the dynamics of a stably stratified spherical Couette flow, with the outer sphere rotating faster than the inner one. While the generation of strong stationary and hemispherical dynamos has been observed in our previous studies, we report for the first time the existence of reversals and complex temporal dynamics. We observe that the dynamics is strongly correlated with the equatorial symmetry breaking of the flow. Focusing on a fiducial dynamo simulation, we propose a simple interpretation of its dynamics, which consists in the coupling of two large-scale magnetic modes with two opposite equatorial symmetries by the flow symmetry breaking. While this interpretation captures the simplest observed dynamics, the nonlinear interaction between a higher number of magnetic modes is certainly required to describe some of the more complex regimes. The wide diversity of dynamical regimes generated by the Tayler-Spruit dynamo may have interesting implications for the geometry of the neutron star magnetic fields, and therefore neutron star emissions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the quest to understand large-scale collective behavior in active matter, the complexity of hydrodynamic and phoretic interactions remains a fundamental challenge. To date, most works either focus on minimal models that do not (fully) account for these interactions, or explore relatively small systems. The present work develops a generic method that combines high-fidelity simulations with symmetry-preserving descriptors and neural networks to predict hydro-phoretic interactions directly from particle coordinates (effective interactions). This method enables, for the first time, self-contained particle-only simulations and theories with full hydro-phoretic pair interactions.</description>

      <title>Colloidal Suspensions can have Non-Zero Angles of Repose below the Minimal Value for Athermal Frictionless Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the angle of repose ${\theta}_r$ of dense suspensions of colloidal silica particles ($d = 2$ $\mu m$ to $7$ $\mu m$) in water-filled microfluidic rotating drums experiments, to probe the crossover between the thermal (colloidal) and athermal (granular) regimes. For the smallest particles, thermal agitation promotes slow creep flows, and piles always flatten completely regardless of their initial inclination angle, resulting in ${\theta}_r = 0$. Above a critical particle size, piles of colloids stop flowing at a finite angle of repose, which increases with particle size but remains below the minimal value expected for athermal frictionless granular materials: $0 &lt; {\theta}_r &lt; {\theta}_{ath} \approx 5.8{\deg}$. We quantify the arrest dynamics as a function of the gravitational P\'eclet number $Pe_g$, which characterizes the competition between particle weight and thermal agitation. Our measurements are consistent with a recent rheological model [Billon et al., Phys. Rev. Fluids 8, 034302, 2023], in which the arrested state stems from a crossover between glass-like and jamming-dominated regimes as the granular pressure in the pile increases relative to the thermal pressure.</description>

Abstract: A machine-learning strategy for investigating the stability of fluid flow problems is proposed herein. The goal is to provide a simple yet robust methodology to find a nonlinear mapping from the parametric space to an indicator representing the probability of observing a bifurcated solution. The computational procedure is demonstrably robust and does not require parameter tuning. The essential feature of the strategy is that the computational solution of the Navier-Stokes equations is a reliable proxy for laboratory experiments investigating sensitivity to flow parameters. The applicability of our probabilistic bifurcation detection strategy is demonstrated by an investigation of two classical examples of flow instability associated with thermal convection. The codes used to generate and process the labelled data are available on GitHub.</description>

Abstract: The velocity statistics reveal non-universality in both three-dimensional (3-D) and two-dimensional (2-D) turbulence, despite both prototype systems containing an energy inertial range with constant energy flux. Recently, statistics of scale-dependent velocity circulation exhibit universal bifractal behavior in 2-D and 3-D hydrodynamic turbulence and quantum turbulence, where the circulation scale is defined as the square root of the minimum area enclosed by the loop. This loop-shape independent definition of scale bases on the area rule of circulation first proposed by Migdal: the probability density function (PDF) of circulation is only a function of the minimal surface area enclosed by the loop but not the shape of the loop. This paper demonstrates that the derivation of the circulation area rule can be generalized to all scales in 2-D instability-driven turbulence, not limited to the inertial range. However, the area rule is not the only solution to the loop equation, so it may not be observed. Another necessary condition for the validity of the area rule is that the second-order momentum of circulation is loop-shape independent. By deriving the relationship between the second-order moment of circulation on a rectangular loop and the energy spectrum, we prove that the area rule cannot be satisfied in the classic inertial-range turbulence with -5/3 or -3 spectral scalings. As in the 3-D case, the second-order moment of circulation is size-dependent. Compared with the circulation PDFs, the PDFs normalized by the second-order moment of circulation exhibit significantly weaker dependence on loop shape.</description>

      <title>Magnetic reversals in a geodynamo model with a stably-stratified layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the process of magnetic reversals in the presence of a stably-stratified layer below the core-mantle boundary using direct numerical simulations of the incompressible magnetohydrodynamics equations under the Boussinesq approximation in a spherical shell. We show that the dipolar-multipolar transition shifts to larger Rayleigh numbers in the presence of a stably-stratified layer, and that the dipolar strength of the magnetic field at the core-mantle boundary increases due to the skin effect. By imposing an heterogeneous heat flux at the outer boundary, we break the equatorial symmetry of the flow, and show that different heat flux patterns can trigger different dynamo solutions, such as hemispheric dynamos and polarity reversals. Using kinematic dynamo simulations, we show that the stably-stratified layer leads to similar growth rates of the dipole and quadrupole components of the magnetic field, playing the role of a conducting boundary layer, favouring magnetic reversals, and a dynamics predicted by low-dimensional models.</description>

      <title>Effect of Turbulence-Closure Consistency on Airfoil Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an inverse flow problem in which the airfoil shape is inferred from its wake signature, namely the velocity field in the wake of a target airfoil. This is an ill-posed problem and highly sensitive to the accuracy and consistency of the employed turbulence closure. We first demonstrate that shape identification based on a single flow condition is ill-posed, whereas incorporating multiple wake signatures obtained at different angles of attack substantially mitigates this ill-posedness. We further show that aggregating wake profiles across multiple Reynolds numbers provides an additional and practically relevant source of information that can further constrain the inverse problem and improve reconstruction robustness. We then compare the inferred geometries obtained using different turbulence closures and find that inconsistencies among the models lead to markedly divergent shapes. These findings underscore that turbulence-closure consistency is essential for reliable shape identification and further suggest that effective turbulence models must ensure not only accurate predictions but also physically consistent sensitivities - a principle that should guide the development of both classical and data-driven closure models.</description>

      <title>Spacetime-spectral analysis of flowfields</title>

Abstract: The classical Fourier analysis of a time signal, in the discrete sense, provides the frequency content of signal under the assumption of periodicity. Although the original signal can be exactly recovered using an inverse transform, the time dependence of the spectrum remains inaccessible. There exist various time-frequency analysis techniques, such as the short time fast Fourier transform and wavelets, but those are fundamentally limited in achieving high resolution in both the time and frequency domains concurrently. For spatiotemporal flowfields, the frequency based modal decompositions generally provide spatial modes with a temporal counterpart that evolves at a constant frequency. However, an accurate time-local spectral contribution and its variation over time are highly desired to better understand the intermittent/extreme events, for instance, in turbulent flowfields. To this end, this paper presents a spectral mode decomposition that yields spectral-space and spectral-time modes, where the latter along with the associated spectral energies provide a spectrogram that is at the resolution of flowfields. The spectral modes get both the frequency and energy ranks. The numerical examples demonstrate the use of technique not only in spacetime-frequency analysis but also in reduced-order modeling and denoising applications.</description>

      <title>Coupled imbibition and evaporation of droplets deposited on a nanoporous layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19932</link>

Abstract: Liquids in nanoscale hydrophilic pores generate capillary pressures so large that they could theoretically climb kilometers against gravity. However, droplets on thin nanoporous layers form imbibition fronts stopping at millimeters or less due to evaporation competing with capillary flow. Such droplet infiltration dynamics is of growing interest for studying confined fluids and for applications such as water harvesting, printing, chemical delivery, actuation, and sensing. Here, we investigate theoretically and experimentally the spontaneous imbibition and evaporation of sessile droplets into thin mesoporous layers, focusing on their dependence on imposed relative humidity (RH). Theoretically, we provide a unified analytical approach for the dynamics of the wetted annulus ("halo") around the droplet, accounting for arbitrary halo dimensions and confinement-induced thermodynamic shifts (Kelvin effect). Experimentally, we study water droplets on oxidized porous silicon layers (pore diameter 3-4 nm, thickness 5 $\mu$m), systematically investigating how halo and droplet dynamics depend on RH. We show that halo formation timescales diverge at a critical RH due to the Kelvin effect, as illustrated by comparing RH-dependent evaporation rates in the halo (confined liquid) and in the droplet (bulk liquid). Our analysis also reveals an apparent divergence of the imbibition coefficient, unexplained by standard capillary models, suggesting a key role for Kelvin-driven vapor transport along the porous surface. The complex couplings revealed by our study call for caution in interpreting halo dynamics data. Our results also highlight RH as a powerful control parameter for tuning droplet imbibition behavior and infiltration patterns.</description>

      <title>An elasto-viscoplastic thixotropic model for fresh concrete capturing flow-rest transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The flow properties of fresh concrete are critical in the construction industry, as they directly affect casting quality and the durability of the final structure. Although non-Newtonian fluid models, such as the Bingham model, are widely used to model these flow properties, they often fail to capture key phenomena, including flow stoppage, and frequently rely on non-physical regularization or stabilization techniques to mitigate numerical instabilities at low shear rates. To address these limitations, this study proposes an elasto-viscoplastic constitutive model within the continuum mechanics framework, which treats fresh concrete as a solid-like material with a rate-dependent yield stress. The model inherently captures the transition from elastic response to viscous flow following Bingham rheology, and vice versa, enabling accurate prediction of flow cessation without ad-hoc criteria. Additionally, a thixotropy evolution law is incorporated to account for the time-dependent behavior resulting from physical flocculation and shear-induced deflocculation. The proposed model is implemented within the Material Point Method (MPM), whose Lagrangian formulation facilitates tracking of history-dependent variables and robust simulation of large deformation flows. Numerical examples demonstrate the model's effectiveness in reproducing a range of typical concrete flow scenarios, offering a more physically consistent numerical tool for optimizing concrete construction processes and minimizing defects.</description>
