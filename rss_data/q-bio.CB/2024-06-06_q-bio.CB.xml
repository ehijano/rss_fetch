      <title>How cells stay together; a mechanism for maintenance of a robust cluster explored by local and nonlocal continuum models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Formation of organs and specialized tissues in embryonic development requires migration of cells to specific targets. In some instances, such cells migrate as a robust cluster. We here explore a recent local approximation of nonlocal continuum models by Falc\'o, Baker, and Carrillo (2023). We apply their theoretical results by specifying biologically-based cell-cell interactions, showing how such cell communication results in an effective attraction-repulsion Morse potential. We then explore the clustering instability, the existence and size of the cluster, and its stability. We also extend their work by investigating the accuracy of the local approximation relative to the full nonlocal model.</description>

      <title>Scientific Hypothesis Generation by a Large Language Model: Laboratory Validation in Breast Cancer Treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12258v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed AI and achieved breakthrough performance on a wide range of tasks that require human intelligence. In science, perhaps the most interesting application of LLMs is for hypothesis formation. A feature of LLMs, which results from their probabilistic structure, is that the output text is not necessarily a valid inference from the training text. These are 'hallucinations', and are a serious problem in many applications. However, in science, hallucinations may be useful: they are novel hypotheses whose validity may be tested by laboratory experiments. Here we experimentally test the use of LLMs as a source of scientific hypotheses using the domain of breast cancer treatment. We applied the LLM GPT4 to hypothesize novel pairs of FDA-approved non-cancer drugs that target the MCF7 breast cancer cell line relative to the non-tumorigenic breast cell line MCF10A. In the first round of laboratory experiments GPT4 succeeded in discovering three drug combinations (out of 12 tested) with synergy scores above the positive controls. These combinations were itraconazole + atenolol, disulfiram + simvastatin and dipyridamole + mebendazole. GPT4 was then asked to generate new combinations after considering its initial results. It then discovered three more combinations with positive synergy scores (out of four tested), these were disulfiram + fulvestrant, mebendazole + quinacrine and disulfiram + quinacrine. A limitation of GPT4 as a generator of hypotheses was that its explanations for them were formulaic and unconvincing. We conclude that LLMs are an exciting novel source of scientific hypotheses.</description>
