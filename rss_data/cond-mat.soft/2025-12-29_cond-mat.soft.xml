      <title>Clogging of cohesive particles in a two-dimensional hopper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study clogging of cohesive particles in a 2D hopper with experiments and simulations. The system consists of buoyant, monodisperse oil droplets in an aqueous solution, where the droplet size, buoyant force, cohesion, and hopper opening are varied. Stronger cohesion enhances clogging, a trend confirmed in simulations. Balancing buoyant and cohesive forces defines a cohesive length scale that collapses the data onto a master curve. Thus, under strong cohesion, we find that clogging is governed not by particle diameter, but by the cohesive length scale.</description>

      <title>The Origin of Organic Magnetoresistance Using Time-Domain Magnetic Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organic Magnetoresistance is defined as the change of resistance in an organic material, such as a conducting polymer, as a function of an imposed magnetic field. We demonstrate this effect in a Polypyrrole/ Polydimethylsiloxane complex by using a novel magnetic pulse system. The frequency spectrum of the current flowing through the sample reveals equally spaced reversed peaks in the current. We show that these peaks happen at the Lamour frequency for the dominant charge carrier of the system, namely polarons. This posits the origin Organic magnetoresistance as simple Rabi Oscillations rather than mechanisms based of bipolaron formation and singlet-triplet conversions. We directly estimate the effective polaronic mass in this complex. A semi classical theoretical approach is suggested to explain this effect as direct spin flipping in a time transient magnetic field. This is the first time that such an experimental approach has been applied in this field and the first time the effective polaronic mass has been measured in a conducting polymer.</description>

      <title>Analytic solution of the multidensity Ornstein-Zernike equation for hard-sphere fluid with tetrahedral quadrupolar-like surface adhesion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a multidensity formulation of the Ornstein-Zernike equation with Percus-Yevick closure for hard spheres with anisotropic surface adhesion of tetrahedral quadrupolar-like symmetry. An analytical solution is obtained using the invariant expansion method combined with Baxter's factorization technique. Structural properties are evaluated using both the multidensity theory and the previously proposed single-density molecular OZ approach. At low stickiness, the two theories yield nearly identical predictions, while increasing stickiness leads to growing discrepancies and eventual loss of convergence of the single-density approach. These results highlight the importance of multidensity descriptions for strongly associating anisotropic fluids.</description>

      <title>Upper bounds on the separation efficiency of diffusiophoresis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The separation of colloidal particles from fluids is essential to ensure a safe global supply of drinking water yet, in the case of microscopic particles, it remains a highly energy-intensive process when using traditional filtration methods. Water cleaning through diffusiophoresis $\unicode{x2014}$spontaneous colloid migration in chemical gradients$\unicode{x2014}$ effectively circumvents the need for physical filters, representing a promising alternative. This separation process is typically realized in internal flows where a cross-channel electrolyte gradient drives particle accumulation at walls, with colloid separation slowly increasing in the streamwise direction. However, the maximum separation efficiency, achieved sufficiently downstream as diffusiophoretic migration (driving particle accumulation) is balanced by Brownian motion (inducing diffusive spreading), has not yet been characterized. In this work, we develop a theory to predict this upper bound, and derive the colloid separation efficiency by analyzing the asymptotic structure of the governing equations. We find that the mechanism by which the chemical permeates in the channel, as well as the reaction kinetics governing its dissociation into ions, play key roles in the process. Moreover, we identify four distinct regimes in which separation is controlled by different scaling laws involving a Damk\"ohler and a P\'eclet number, which measure the ratio of reaction kinetics to ion diffusion and of diffusiophoresis to Brownian motion, respectively. We also confirm the scaling of one of these regimes using microfluidic experiments where separation is driven by CO$_\text{2}$ gradients. Our results shed light on pathways towards new, more efficient separations, and are also applicable to quantify colloidal accumulation in the presence of chemical gradients in more general situations.</description>

      <title>Impact of the sodium and calcium chlorides uptake on the interfacial behavior of ice: premelting, structure, and dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hypothesis: Seawater ice and frozen aqueous solutions in contact with air can exhibit a thin quasi-brine surface layer intruding between ice and vapor, but a detailed characterization of surface properties and its relation to three phase coexistence has been lacking. Using thermodynamic arguments we show how it is possible to characterize the surface layers by comparison to the three phase ice-brine-air bulk phase diagram, despite the difficulty to control or monitor all of the relevant thermodynamic fields of the two component system.
  Simulations: We performed computer simulations of surface briny layers of sodium and calcium chloride adsorbed on ice. Using suitable order parameters and a rigorous geometrical dividing surface, we are able to characterize the layer's thermodynamic state, measure its properties and relate them to the corresponding properties of the bulk solution.
  Results: Our results confirm that undersaturated briny surface layers can form down to the eutectic point, with a maximum concentration that is bound by the liquidus line of the ice-brine phase diagram. Such layers are distinct from finite size realizations of three phase coexistence, and can be regarded as genuine surface states, but their salt content can increase the premelting layer thickness by a factor of two or more. Owing to this significant thickness, these layers can be related to bulk electrolyte solutions of similar concentration, both as regards the structural organization of ions and the dynamical properties of the quasi-liquid film.</description>

      <title>Under pressure: poroelastic regulation of flow in espresso brewing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sensory richness of coffee is widely recognised and arises from the complex chemistry and immersion in cultural practices of coffee preparation. In contrast, the physical complexity of espresso has received less attention. The multiphase reactive flow through a dissolving, elastic porous medium remains challenging to describe. Using a controlled experimental setup based on a caf\'e-grade espresso machine, we demonstrate that the interplay between elasticity and porosity governs the long-time flow rate during espresso extraction and, consequently, the concentration of solubles in the final beverage. We introduce a minimal model that captures the resulting non-linear pressure-flow relationship and propose a methodology capable of reproducing the time-dependent behaviour of the espresso brewing process. Finally, we show that dissolution dynamics play a central role in determining the temporal evolution of flow during extraction.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Characterization of Metallocene Single Crystals Grown by Physical Vapor Transport Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-quality metallocene single crystals with a low density of impurities and high homogeneity were prepared using the physical vapor transport method. These crystals were then characterized using various spectroscopic tools and X-ray diffraction. Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy confirmed the presence of metal ions in each freshly grown sample despite all these crystals undergoing physical deformation with different lifetimes. X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed that all our metallocene single crystals retained a monoclinic structure at room temperature. The vibrational properties of our metallocene crystals were examined using Raman and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. The inter- and intra-ring vibrational modes, along with additional modes associated with the crystalline form, were identified as inherent vibrational properties of our metallocene single crystals. Given the increasingly important role of metallocene in organic solar cells, organic light-emitting displays and molecular quantum systems, this research will enhance our understanding of the intrinsic physical properties of cleaner, more crystalline metallocene single crystals.</description>

      <title>Nascent biofilms on soft surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soft surfaces, spanning vastly different environmental and biomedical settings, are frequently colonised by surface-associated bacteria. Yet, how soft surfaces govern bacterial dynamics and their self-organisation into colonies remains poorly understood. Using experiments and agent-based modelling, we report the self-organisation of bacterial cells into nascent biofilms on soft substrates. By tuning the elastic modulus over two orders of magnitude, we show that the colony morphology, spreading dynamics and collective behaviour depend on the substrate stiffness, wherein softer surfaces promote slowly expanding, geometrically anisotropic, multilayered colonies, while harder substrates drive rapid, isotropic expansion of bacterial monolayers before multilayer structures emerge. Supported a cell mechanical model and two-dimensional agent-based simulations, our results identify that anisotropic drag forces on soft substrates, emerging due to local deformations, underpin colony anisotropy and swift verticalisation. In contrast, reduced drag on hard surfaces allows rapid expansion of monolayers, thus delaying the transition to a multilayer structure. Surface compliance, a key but overlooked determinant of early-stage biofilm development, could be harnessed to engineer biofilm structures and dynamics for nature-inspired and biomedical applications.</description>

      <title>Tuning diffusioosmosis of electrolyte solutions by hydrostatic pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When two reservoirs of a distinct salinity are connected by channels or pores, a fluid flow termed diffusio-osmotic is generated. This article investigates the flow emerging in an uniformly charged long slit whose thickness exceeds the local Debye screening length. Attention is focussed on the role of hydrostatic pressure drop $\Delta p$ between reservoirs. For a thick slit we recover the known formula for a local diffusioosmotic slip over a single wall, which is determined by the surface potential, salt concentration and its gradient. An equation for the global fluid flow rate $\mathcal{Q}$ is presented as a sum of the diffusio-osmotic and pressure-driven contributions. Although the diffusio-osmotic term itself remains unaffected by $\Delta p$, the concentration and surface potential profiles along the slit, and consequently, the local slip velocity are dramatically modified. We present an equation relating the local concentration to $\mathcal{Q}$ and employ it to derive an expression describing the surface potential variation in the slit. Since $\mathcal{Q}$ can easily be tuned by $\Delta p$, the variety of possible concentration and surface potential profiles becomes very rich. Our theory provides a simple explanation of recent flow rate measurements and shows that experimental data provide rather direct information about concentration and surface potential profiles in the uniformly charged slit. The relevance of our results for sensing the salt dependence of surface potentials is discussed briefly.</description>

      <title>A Minimal Network of Brain Dynamics: Hierarchy of Approximations to Quasi-critical Neural Network Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an interacting branching model of neural network dynamics, incorporating key biological features such as inhibition with several types of inhibitory interactions. We establish a hierarchy of analytical mean-field approximations to the model, which characterizes nonequilibrium phase transitions between disorder and ordered phases, and perform a stability analysis. Generically, inhibitory neurons increase the stability of the model dynamics. The model is consistent with the quasi-criticality hypothesis in that it displays regions of maximal dynamical susceptibility and maximal mutual information predicated on the strength of the external stimuli. Directed percolation emerges as the universality class of the critical transition of the model, consistent with some previous experimental data and models. In the unstable phase, chaotic dynamics emerge, which may be linked to the occurrence of epileptic seizures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active solids combine internal active driving with elasticity to realize states with nonequilibrium mechanics and autonomous motion. They are often studied in overdamped settings, e.g., in soft materials, and the role of inertia is less explored. We construct a model of a chemically active solid that incorporates mechanochemical feedback and show that, when feedback overwhelms mechanical damping, autonomous inertial dynamics can spontaneously emerge through sustained consumption of chemical fuel. By combining numerical simulations, analysis and dynamical systems approaches, we show how active feedback drives complex nonlinear dynamics on multiple time-scales, including limit cycles and chaos. Our results suggest design principles for creating ultrafast actuators and autonomous machines from soft, chemically-powered solids.</description>

      <title>Dual Cross-Linked Hydrogels: Linear Rheology and Fractional Calculus Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02219v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hydrogels are increasingly recognized as a versatile platform for applications spanning from tissue engineering to soft robotics or flexible electronics. Recent efforts have focused on enhancing and tailoring their mechanical performance to meet application-specific demands. However, the intricate viscoelastic response of hydrogels remains challenging to capture using conventional phenomenological models. In this study, we prepared a series of tough dual crosslinked hydrogels -- poly(methacrylamide-co-acrylic acid)-Fe3+ and systematically tuned their mechanical properties by leveraging the salting-out effect. The viscoelastic behavior of the hydrogels was characterized under shear deformations, and a four-parameter Fractional Maxwell Model (FMM) was constructed to quantitatively describe oscillatory shear, creep, and stress relaxation responses. The influence of salt concentration on each FMM parameter was analyzed and correlated with bulk mechanical performance. This framework provides a first step toward capturing the complex viscoelastic nature of the advanced hydrogels and lays the foundation for developing more comprehensive nonlinear constitutive models.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation theorems with optical tweezers: theory and practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fluctuation theorems, such as the Jarzynski equality and the Crooks relation, are effective tools connecting non-equilibrium work statistics and equilibrium free energy differences. However, detailed hands-on, reproducible protocols for implementing and analyzing these relations in real experiments remain scarce. This tutorial provides an end-to-end workflow for measuring, validating, and applying fluctuation theorems using a single-beam optical tweezers setup. It introduces the foundational ideas and consolidates practical calibration (PSD-based trap stiffness and position sensitivity), protocol design (forward/reverse finite-time drives over multiple amplitudes and durations), and robust estimators for free-energy difference and dissipated work, highlighting finite-sampling and rare-event effects. We demonstrate the procedures using an extensive set of measured trajectories under different conditions and provide openly accessible datasets and Python code, enabling new researchers or educators to reproduce the results with minimal effort. Beyond pedagogical validation, we discuss how these recipes translate to broader soft-matter and mesoscopic contexts. By combining user-friendly instruments with clear and transparent analysis, this work promotes the education and reliable adoption of stochastic thermodynamic methods in the curricula of physics and chemistry, as well as among emerging research teams.</description>

      <title>Optical tweezers assisted coupling of nematic droplets to gold nanoparticle cluster: effect on whispering gallery modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dye doped liquid crystal (LC) microdroplets exhibit tunable optical resonances modulated by size, shape, temperature, and external perturbations. When a dye-doped nematic microdroplet is coupled to a gold nanoparticle cluster, near-field interactions enhance local electric fields, boosting fluorescence emission. Optical tweezers serve as a tool for the parking of dye doped nematic microdroplets on gold nanoparticle clusters, enabling the dynamic coupling and excitation of whispering-gallery modes (WGMs). This configuration resulted in amplified WGMs, with a clearly detectable shift in the spectral position. Resonance mode red shifts confirmed efficient photonic plasmonic coupling, with up to seven nm tunability achieved without significant degradation of the Q-factor. The magnitude of tunability depends on the size of the gold nanoparticle cluster. Also, the WGM emission spectrum of the nematic microdroplet can be reversibly tuned by decoupling from the gold nanoparticle cluster.</description>
