      <title>Bringing order to network centrality measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a quantitative method to compare arbitrary pairs of graph centrality measures, based on the ordering of vertices induced by them. The proposed method is conceptually simple, mathematically elegant, and allows for a quantitative restatement of many conjectures that were previously cumbersome to formalize. Moreover, it produces an approximation scheme useful for network scientists. We explore some of these uses and formulate new conjectures that are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Topological transitivity of group cellular automata is decidable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological transitivity is a fundamental notion in topological dynamics and is widely regarded as a basic indicator of global dynamical complexity. For general cellular automata, topological transitivity is known to be undecidable. By contrast, positive decidability results have been established for one-dimensional group cellular automata over abelian groups, while the extension to higher dimensions and to non-abelian groups has remained an open problem. In this work, we settle this problem by proving that topological transitivity is decidable for the class of $d$-dimensional ($d\geq 1$) group cellular automata over arbitrary finite groups. Our approach combines a decomposition technique for group cellular automata, reducing the problem to the analysis of simpler components, with an extension of several results from the existing literature in the one-dimensional setting. As a consequence of our results, and exploiting known equivalences among dynamical properties for group cellular automata, we also obtain the decidability of several related notions, including total transitivity, topological mixing and weak mixing, weak and strong ergodic mixing, and ergodicity.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of monadically dependent tree-ordered weakly sparse structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A class of structures is monadically dependent if one cannot interpret all graphs in colored expansions from the class using a fixed first-order formula. A tree-ordered $\sigma$-structure is the expansion of a $\sigma$-structure with a tree-order. A tree-ordered $\sigma$-structure is weakly sparse if the Gaifman graph of its $\sigma$-reduct excludes some biclique (of a given fixed size) as a subgraph. Tree-ordered weakly sparse graphs are commonly used as tree-models (for example for classes with bounded shrubdepth, structurally bounded expansion, bounded cliquewidth, or bounded twin-width), motivating their study on their own. In this paper, we consider several constructions on tree-ordered structures, such as tree-ordered variants of the Gaifman graph and of the incidence graph, induced and non-induced tree-ordered minors, and generalized fundamental graphs. We provide characterizations of monadically dependent classes of tree-ordered weakly sparse $\sigma$-structures based on each of these constructions, some of them establishing unexpected bridges with sparsity theory. As an application, we prove that a class of tree-ordered weakly sparse structures is monadically dependent if and only if its sparsification is nowhere-dense. Moreover, the sparsification transduction translates boundedness of clique-width and linear clique-width into boundedness of tree-width and path-width. We also prove that first-order model checking is not fixed parameter tractable on independent hereditary classes of tree-ordered weakly sparse graphs (assuming $\mathsf{AW}[*]\neq \mathsf{FPT}$) and give what we believe is the first model-theoretical characterization of classes of graphs excluding a minor, thus opening a new perspective of structural graph theory.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Linear Subsequences of $k$-Automatic Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct automata with input(s) in base $k$ recognizing some basic relations and study their number of states. We also consider some basic operations on $k$-automatic sequences and discuss their state complexity. We find a relationship between subword complexity of the interior sequence $(h'(i))_{i \geq 0}$ and state complexity of the linear subsequence $(h(ni+c))_{i \geq 0}$. We resolve a recent question of Zantema and Bosma about linear subsequences of $k$-automatic sequences with input in most-significant-digit-first format. We also discuss the state complexity and runtime complexity of using a reasonable interpretation of B\"uchi arithmetic to actually construct some of the studied automata recognizing relations or carrying out operations on automatic sequences.</description>
