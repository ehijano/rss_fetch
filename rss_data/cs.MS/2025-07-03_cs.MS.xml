      <title>GPU-based complete search for nonlinear minimization subject to bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a GPU-based complete search method to enclose the global minimum of a nonlinear function subject to simple bounds on the variables. Using interval analysis, coupled with the computational power and architecture of GPU, the method iteratively rules out the regions in the search domain where the global minimum cannot exist and leaves a finite set of regions where the global minimum must exist. For effectiveness, because of the rigor of interval analysis, the method is guaranteed to enclose the global minimum of the nonlinear function even in the presence of rounding errors. For efficiency, the method employs a novel GPU-based single program, single data parallel programming style to circumvent major GPU performance bottlenecks, and a variable cycling technique is also integrated into the method to reduce computational cost when minimizing large-scale nonlinear functions. The method is validated by minimizing 10 multimodal benchmark test functions with scalable dimensions, including the well-known Ackley function, Griewank function, Levy function, and Rastrigin function. These benchmark test functions represent grand challenges of global optimization, and enclosing the guaranteed global minimum of these benchmark test functions with more than 80 dimensions has not been reported in the literature. Our method completely searches the feasible domain and successfully encloses the guaranteed global minimum of these 10 benchmark test functions with up to 10,000 dimensions using only one GPU in a reasonable computation time, far exceeding the reported results in the literature due to the unique method design and implementation based on GPU architecture.</description>

      <title>PDE-Constrained High-Order Mesh Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for PDE-constrained $r$-adaptivity of high-order meshes. The proposed method formulates mesh movement as an optimization problem, with an objective function defined as a convex combination of a mesh quality metric and a measure of the accuracy of the PDE solution obtained via finite element discretization. The proposed formulation achieves optimized, well-defined high-order meshes by integrating mesh quality control, PDE solution accuracy, and robust gradient regularization. We adopt the Target-Matrix Optimization Paradigm to control geometric properties across the mesh, independent of the PDE of interest. To incorporate the accuracy of the PDE solution, we introduce error measures that control the finite element discretization error. The implicit dependence of these error measures on the mesh nodal positions is accurately captured by adjoint sensitivity analysis. Additionally, a convolution-based gradient regularization strategy is used to ensure stable and effective adaptation of high-order meshes. We demonstrate that the proposed framework can improve mesh quality and reduce the error by up to 10 times for the solution of Poisson and linear elasto-static problems. The approach is general with respect to the dimensionality, the order of the mesh, the types of mesh elements, and can be applied to any PDE that admits well-defined adjoint operators.</description>

      <title>Efficiently Vectorized MCMC on Modern Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the advent of automatic vectorization tools (e.g., JAX's $\texttt{vmap}$), writing multi-chain MCMC algorithms is often now as simple as invoking those tools on single-chain code. Whilst convenient, for various MCMC algorithms this results in a synchronization problem -- loosely speaking, at each iteration all chains running in parallel must wait until the last chain has finished drawing its sample. In this work, we show how to design single-chain MCMC algorithms in a way that avoids synchronization overheads when vectorizing with tools like $\texttt{vmap}$ by using the framework of finite state machines (FSMs). Using a simplified model, we derive an exact theoretical form of the obtainable speed-ups using our approach, and use it to make principled recommendations for optimal algorithm design. We implement several popular MCMC algorithms as FSMs, including Elliptical Slice Sampling, HMC-NUTS, and Delayed Rejection, demonstrating speed-ups of up to an order of magnitude in experiments.</description>
