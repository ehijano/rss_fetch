      <title>MOSAIC: Codon Harmonization of Monte Carlo-Based Simulated Annealing for Linked Codons in Heterologous Protein Expression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Codon usage bias has a crucial impact on the translation efficiency and co-translational folding of proteins, necessitating the algorithmic development of codon optimization/harmonization methods, particularly for heterologous recombinant protein expression. Codon harmonization is especially valuable for proteins sensitive to translation rates, because it can potentially replicate native translation speeds, preserving proper folding and maintaining protein activity. This work proposes a Monte Carlo-based codon harmonization algorithm, MOSAIC (Monte Carlo-based Simulated Annealing for Linked Codons), for the harmonization of a set of linked codons, which differs from conventional codon harmonization, by focusing on the codon sets rather than individual ones. Our MOSAIC demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on ribosomal proteins (S18, S15, S10, and L11) as model systems. Among them, the harmonized gene of RP S18 was expressed and compared with the expression of the wild-type gene. The harmonized gene clearly yielded a larger quantity of the protein, from which the amount of the soluble protein was also significant. These results underscore the potential of the linked codon harmonization approach to enhance the expression and functionality of sensitive proteins, setting the stage for more efficient production of recombinant proteins in various biotechnological and pharmaceutical applications.</description>

      <title>Synergy vs. Noise: Performance-Guided Multimodal Fusion For Biochemical Recurrence-Free Survival in Prostate Cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal deep learning (MDL) has emerged as a transformative approach in computational pathology. By integrating complementary information from multiple data sources, MDL models have demonstrated superior predictive performance across diverse clinical tasks compared to unimodal models. However, the assumption that combining modalities inherently improves performance remains largely unexamined. We hypothesise that multimodal gains depend critically on the predictive quality of individual modalities, and that integrating weak modalities may introduce noise rather than complementary information. We test this hypothesis on a prostate cancer dataset with histopathology, radiology, and clinical data to predict time-to-biochemical recurrence. Our results confirm that combining high-performing modalities yield superior performance compared to unimodal approaches. However, integrating a poor-performing modality with other higher-performing modalities degrades predictive accuracy. These findings demonstrate that multimodal benefit requires selective, performance-guided integration rather than indiscriminate modality combination, with implications for MDL design across computational pathology and medical imaging.</description>

      <title>PEtab-GUI: A graphical user interface to create, edit and inspect PEtab parameter estimation problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivation: Parameter estimation is a cornerstone of data-driven modeling in systems biology. Yet, constructing such problems in a reproducible and accessible manner remains challenging. The PEtab format has established itself as a powerful community standard to encode parameter estimation problems, promoting interoperability and reusability. However, its reliance on multiple interlinked files - often edited manually - can introduce inconsistencies, and new users often struggle to navigate them. Here, we present PEtab-GUI, an open-source Python application designed to streamline the creation, editing, and validation of PEtab problems through an intuitive graphical user interface. PEtab-GUI integrates all PEtab components, including SBML models and tabular files, into a single environment with live error-checking and customizable defaults. Interactive visualization and simulation capabilities enable users to inspect the relationship between the model and the data. PEtab-GUI lowers the barrier to entry for specifying standardized parameter estimation problems, making dynamic modeling more accessible, especially in educational and interdisciplinary settings.
  Availability and Implementation: PEtab-GUI is implemented in Python, open-source under a 3-Clause BSD license. The code, designed to be modular and extensible, is hosted on https://github.com/PEtab-dev/PEtab-GUI and can be installed from PyPI.

      <title>Advanced Data Analysis of Spontaneous Biophoton Emission: A Multi-Method Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-weak photon emission (UPE) from living systems is widely hypothesized to reflect un-derlying self-organization and long-range coordination in biological dynamics. However, distin-guishing biologically driven correlations from trivial stochastic or instrumental effects requires a robust, multi-method framework. In this work, we establish and benchmark a comprehensive anal-ysis pipeline for photon-count time series, combining Distribution Entropy Analysis, R\'enyi entro-py, Detrended Fluctuation Analysis, its generalization Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis, and tail-statistics characterization. Surrogate signals constructed from Poisson processes, Fractional Gaussian Noise, and Renewal Processes with power-law waiting times are used to validate sensitivity to memory, intermittency, and multifractality. Across all methods, a coherent hierarchy of dynamical regimes is recovered, demonstrating internal methodological consistency. Application to experimental dark-count data and attenuated coherent-laser emission confirm Poisson-like behavior, establishing an essential statistical baseline for UPE studies. The combined results show that this multi-resolution approach reliably separates trivial photon-counting statistics from struc-tured long-range organization, providing a validated methodological foundation for future biological UPE measurements and their interpretation in the context of non-equilibrium statistical physics, information dynamics, and prospective markers of biological coherence.</description>

      <title>Toward Scalable Early Cancer Detection: Evaluating EHR-Based Predictive Models Against Traditional Screening Criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current cancer screening guidelines cover only a few cancer types and rely on narrowly defined criteria such as age or a single risk factor like smoking history, to identify high-risk individuals. Predictive models using electronic health records (EHRs), which capture large-scale longitudinal patient-level health information, may provide a more effective tool for identifying high-risk groups by detecting subtle prediagnostic signals of cancer. Recent advances in large language and foundation models have further expanded this potential, yet evidence remains limited on how useful HER-based models are compared with traditional risk factors currently used in screening guidelines. We systematically evaluated the clinical utility of EHR-based predictive models against traditional risk factors, including gene mutations and family history of cancer, for identifying high-risk individuals across eight major cancers (breast, lung, colorectal, prostate, ovarian, liver, pancreatic, and stomach), using data from the All of Us Research Program, which integrates EHR, genomic, and survey data from over 865,000 participants. Even with a baseline modeling approach, EHR-based models achieved a 3- to 6-fold higher enrichment of true cancer cases among individuals identified as high risk compared with traditional risk factors alone, whether used as a standalone or complementary tool. The EHR foundation model, a state-of-the-art approach trained on comprehensive patient trajectories, further improved predictive performance across 26 cancer types, demonstrating the clinical potential of EHR-based predictive modeling to support more precise and scalable early detection strategies.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Posterior Sampling-based Uncertainty in PD-L1 Segmentation from H&amp;E Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate assessment of PD-L1 expression is critical for guiding immunotherapy, yet current immunohistochemistry (IHC) based methods are resource-intensive. We present nnUNet-B: a Bayesian segmentation framework that infers PD-L1 expression directly from H&amp;E-stained histology images using Multimodal Posterior Sampling (MPS). Built upon nnUNet-v2, our method samples diverse model checkpoints during cyclic training to approximate the posterior, enabling both accurate segmentation and epistemic uncertainty estimation via entropy and standard deviation. Evaluated on a dataset of lung squamous cell carcinoma, our approach achieves competitive performance against established baselines with mean Dice Score and mean IoU of 0.805 and 0.709, respectively, while providing pixel-wise uncertainty maps. Uncertainty estimates show strong correlation with segmentation error, though calibration remains imperfect. These results suggest that uncertainty-aware H&amp;E-based PD-L1 prediction is a promising step toward scalable, interpretable biomarker assessment in clinical workflows.</description>

      <title>Representation Meets Optimization: Training PINNs and PIKANs for Gray-Box Discovery in Systems Pharmacology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (PIKANs) are gaining attention as an effective counterpart to the original multilayer perceptron-based Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). Both representation models can address inverse problems and facilitate gray-box system identification. However, a comprehensive understanding of their performance in terms of accuracy and speed remains underexplored. In particular, we introduce a modified PIKAN architecture, tanh-cPIKAN, which is based on Chebyshev polynomials for parametrization of the univariate functions with an extra nonlinearity for enhanced performance. We then present a systematic investigation of how choices of the optimizer, representation, and training configuration influence the performance of PINNs and PIKANs in the context of systems pharmacology modeling. We benchmark a wide range of first-order, second-order, and hybrid optimizers, including various learning rate schedulers. We use the new Optax library to identify the most effective combinations for learning gray-boxes under ill-posed, non-unique, and data-sparse conditions. We examine the influence of model architecture (MLP vs. KAN), numerical precision (single vs. double), the need for warm-up phases for second-order methods, and sensitivity to the initial learning rate. We also assess the optimizer scalability for larger models and analyze the trade-offs introduced by JAX in terms of computational efficiency and numerical accuracy. Using two representative systems pharmacology case studies - a pharmacokinetics model and a chemotherapy drug-response model - we offer practical guidance on selecting optimizers and representation models/architectures for robust and efficient gray-box discovery. Our findings provide actionable insights for improving the training of physics-informed networks in biomedical applications and beyond.</description>

      <title>Progress and new challenges in image-based profiling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For over two decades, image-based profiling has revolutionized cell phenotype analysis. Image-based profiling processes rich, high-throughput, microscopy data into thousands of unbiased measurements that reveal phenotypic patterns powerful for drug discovery, functional genomics, and cell state classification. Here, we review the evolving computational landscape of image-based profiling, detailing the bioinformatics processes involved from feature extraction to normalization and batch correction. We discuss how deep learning has fundamentally reshaped the field. We examine key methodological advancements, such as single-cell analysis, the development of robust similarity metrics, and the expansion into new modalities like optical pooled screening, temporal imaging, and 3D organoid profiling. We also highlight the growth of public benchmarks and open-source software ecosystems as a key driver for fostering reproducibility and collaboration. Despite these advances, the field still faces substantial challenges, particularly in developing methods for emerging temporal and 3D data modalities, establishing robust quality control standards and workflows, and interpreting the processed features. By focusing on the technical evolution of image-based profiling rather than the wide-ranging biological applications, our aim with this review is to provide researchers with a roadmap for navigating the progress and new challenges in this rapidly advancing domain.</description>

      <title>Exhaustive Investigation of CBC-Derived Biomarker Ratios for Clinical Outcome Prediction: The RDW-to-MCHC Ratio as a Novel Mortality Predictor in Critical Care</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ratios of common biomarkers and blood analytes are well established for early detection and predictive purposes. Early risk stratification in critical care is often limited by the delayed availability of complex severity scores. Complete blood count (CBC) parameters, available within hours of admission, may enable rapid prognostication. We conducted an exhaustive and systematic evaluation of CBC-derived ratios for mortality prediction to identify robust, accessible, and generalizable biomarkers. We generated all feasible two-parameter CBC ratios with unit checks and plausibility filters on more than 90,000 ICU admissions (MIMIC-IV). Discrimination was assessed via cross-validated and external AUC, calibration via isotonic regression, and clinical utility with decision-curve analysis. Retrospective validation was performed on eICU-CRD (n = 156530) participants. The ratio of Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW) to Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC), denoted RDW:MCHC, emerged as the top biomarker (AUC = 0.699 discovery; 0.662 validation), outperforming RDW and NLR. It achieved near-universal availability (99.9\% vs.\ 35.0\% for NLR), excellent calibration (Hosmer--Lemeshow $p = 1.0$; $\mathrm{ECE} &lt; 0.001$), and preserved performance across diagnostic groups, with only modest attenuation in respiratory cases. Expressed as a logistic odds ratio, each one standard deviation increase in RDW:MCHC nearly quadrupled 30-day mortality odds (OR = 3.81, 95\% CI [3.70, 3.95]). Decision-curve analysis showed positive net benefit at high-risk triage thresholds. A simple, widely available CBC-derived feature (RDW:MCHC) provides consistent, externally validated signal for early mortality risk. While not a substitute for multivariable scores, it offers a pragmatic adjunct for rapid triage when full scoring is impractical.</description>

      <title>Viral population dynamics at the cellular level, considering the replication cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Viruses are microscopic infectious agents that require a host cell for replication. Viral replication occurs in several stages, and the completion time for each stage varies due to differences in the cellular environment. Thus, the time to complete each stage in viral replication is a random variable. However, no analytic expression exists for the viral population at the cellular level when the completion time for each process constituting viral replication is a random variable. This paper presents a simplified model of viral replication, treating each stage as a renewal process with independently and identically distributed completion times. Using the proposed model, we derive an analytical formula for viral populations at the cellular level, based on viewing viral replication as a birth-death process. The mean viral count is expressed via probability density functions representing the completion time for each step in the replication process. This work validates the results with stochastic simulations. This study provides a new quantitative framework for understanding viral infection dynamics.</description>
