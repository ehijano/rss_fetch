      <title>Coarse-Graining in Quantum Mechanics: Distinguishable and Indistinguishable Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bottom-up coarse-grained (CG) modeling expands the spatial and temporal scales of molecular simulation by seeking a reduced, thermodynamically consistent representation of an atomistic model. Developments in CG theory have largely focused on CG modeling of atomistic systems which behave classically, while CG modeling of quantum systems has remained largely unexplored. We present in this work two fundamental advances in particle-based, bottom-up CG theory for systems obeying quantum statistical mechanics. We first expand the bottom-up CG formalism to include indistinguishable quantum particles, including bosons and fermions. We next introduce a variational optimization procedure for CG model parameterization which is founded on the relative entropy minimization (REM) principle and then bridge the classical and quantum REM methods through a semiclassical expansion in terms of the Feynman path centroid. We provide numerical examples of REM CG models of distinguishable and indistinguishable quantum systems, including as examples a harmonically trapped bosonic system and liquid water. The theoretical results presented here constitute a means to accelerate simulating thermal quantum systems ranging from distinguishable particle systems at higher temperatures to quantum indistinguishable particle systems at lower temperatures.</description>

      <title>Kinetics of seeded protein aggregation: theory and application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ``Seeding'' is the addition of preformed fibrils to a solution of monomeric protein to accelerate its aggregation into new fibrils. It is a versatile and widely-used tool for scientists studying protein aggregation kinetics, as it enables the isolation and separate study of discrete reaction steps contributing to protein aggregation, specifically elongation and secondary nucleation. However, the seeding levels required to achieve dominating effects on each of these steps separately have been established largely by trial-and-error, due in part to the lack of availability of integrated rate laws valid for moderate to high seeding levels and generally applicable to all common underlying reaction mechanisms. Here, we improve on a recently developed mathematical method based on Lie symmetries for solving differential equations, and with it derive such an integrated rate law. We subsequently develop simple expressions for the amounts of seed required to isolate each step. We rationalize the empirical observation that fibril seeds must often be broken up into small pieces to successfully isolate elongation. We also derive expressions for average fibril lengths at different times in the aggregation reaction, and explore different methods to break up fibrils. This paper will provide an invaluable reference for future experimental and theoretical studies in which seeding techniques are employed, and should enable more sophisticated analyses than have been performed to date.</description>

      <title>Optimal Rejection-Free Path Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an efficient novel path sampling-based framework designed to accelerate the investigation of rare events in complex molecular systems. A key innovation is the shift from sampling restricted path ensemble distributions, as in transition path sampling, to directly sampling the distribution of shooting points. This allows for a rejection-free algorithm that samples the entire path ensemble efficiently. Optimal sampling is achieved by applying a selection bias that is the inverse of the free energy along a reaction coordinate. The optimal reaction coordinate, the committor, is iteratively constructed as a neural network using AI for Molecular Mechanism Discovery (AIMMD), concurrently with the free energy profile, which is obtained through reweighting the sampled path ensembles. We showcase our algorithm on theoretical and molecular bechnmarks, and demonstrate how it provides at the same time molecular mechanism, free energy, and rates at a moderate computational cost.</description>

      <title>Reaction Dynamics of the H + HeH$^+$ $\rightarrow$ He + H$_2^+$ System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reaction dynamics for the H + HeH$^+$ $\rightarrow$ He + H$_2^+$ reaction in its electronic ground state is investigated using two different representations of the potential energy surface (PES). The first uses a combined kernel and neural network representation of UCCSD(T) reference data whereas the second is a corrected PES (cR-PES) that eliminates an artificial barrier in the entrance channel appearing in its initial expansion based on full configuration interaction reference data. Despite the differences between the two PESs, both yield $k_{v=0,j=0} \approx 2 \times 10^{-9}$ cm$^3$/molecule/s at $T = 10$ K which is consistent with a $T-$independent Langevin rate $k_{\rm L} = 2.1 \times 10^{-9}$ cm$^3$/molecule/s but considerably larger than the only experimentally reported value $k_{\rm ICR} = (9.1 \pm 2.5) \times 10^{-10}$ cm$^3$/molecule/s from ion cyclotron resonance experiments. Similarly, branching ratios for the reaction outcomes are comparable for the two PESs. However, when analysing less averaged properties such as initial state-selected $T-$dependent rate coefficients and final vibrational states of the H$_2^+$ product for low temperatures, the differences in the two PESs manifest themselves in the observables. Thus, depending on the property analyzed, accurate and globally valid representations of the PES are required, whereas more approximate and empirical construction schemes can be followed for state-averaged observables.</description>

      <title>Structural bias in three-dimensional autoregressive generative machine learning of organic molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A range of generative machine learning models for the design of novel molecules and materials have been proposed in recent years. Models that can generate three-dimensional structures are particularly suitable for quantum chemistry workflows, enabling direct property prediction. The performance of generative models is typically assessed based on their ability to produce novel, valid, and unique molecules. However, equally important is their ability to learn the prevalence of functional groups and certain chemical moieties in the underlying training data, that is, to faithfully reproduce the chemical space spanned by the training data. Here, we investigate the ability of the autoregressive generative machine learning model G-SchNet to reproduce the chemical space and property distributions of training datasets composed of large, functional organic molecules. We assess the elemental composition, size- and bond-length distributions, as well as the functional group and chemical space distribution of training and generated molecules. By principal component analysis of the chemical space, we find that the model leads to a biased generation that is largely unaffected by the choice of hyperparameters or the training dataset distribution, producing molecules that are, on average, more unsaturated and contain more heteroatoms. Purely aliphatic molecules are mostly absent in the generation. We further investigate generation with functional group constraints and based on composite datasets, which can help partially remedy the model generation bias. Decision tree models can recognize the generation bias in the models and discriminate between training and generated data, revealing key chemical differences between the two sets. The chemical differences we find affect the distributions of electronic properties such as the HOMO-LUMO gap, which is a common target for functional molecule design.</description>

      <title>Illuminating Protein Dynamics: A Review of Computational Methods for Studying Photoactive Proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoactive proteins absorb light and undergo structural changes that enable them to perform essential biological functions. These proteins are critical for understanding light-induced biological processes, making them important in biophysics, biotechnology, and medicine. One effective approach to uncovering photoactive processes is through computational methods. These techniques provide atomic-level insights into the structural, electronic, and dynamic changes that occur upon light absorption. By employing these methods, we can gain a better understanding of processes that are challenging to capture experimentally, such as chromophore isomerization and protein conformational changes. Here, we provide a brief overview of the different families of photoactive proteins and the computational methods used to study them, including bioinformatics, molecular dynamics, and enhanced sampling. Our review can serve as an introduction to computational methods for studying light-activated molecular processes, specifically targeting researchers beginning their journey in this field.</description>

      <title>Stress-driven whisker formation in lithium metal batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lithium metal batteries are promising for next-generation high-energy-density batteries, especially when lithium is directly plated on a current collector. However, lithium whiskers can form in the early stages of electroplating. These whiskers lead to low Coulombic efficiency due to isolated lithium formation during stripping. The mechanism of whisker formation is not fully understood, and different mechanisms are proposed in the literature. Herein, we computationally explore a stress-driven extrusion mechanism through cracks in the solid-electrolyte-interphase (SEI), which explains the experimentally observed root growth of lithium whiskers. We model the extrusion as a flow of a power-law Herschel-Bulkley fluid parametrized by the experimental power-law creep behavior of lithium, which results in the typical one-dimensional whisker shape. Consequently, in competition with SEI self-healing, SEI cracking determines the emergence of whiskers, giving a simple rule of thumb to avoid whisker formation in liquid electrolytes.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Charge-Transfer and Auger Decay Processes in Aqueous CaCl$_2$ Solution: Insights from Core-Level Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the interaction between metal ions and their aqueous environment is fundamental in many areas of chemistry, biology, and environmental science. In this study, we investigate the electronic structure of hydrated calcium ions, focusing on how water molecules influence the behavior of the metal ion. We employed advanced X-ray techniques, including X-ray absorption, photoelectron, and Auger spectroscopies, combined with high-level quantum chemical calculations. Our analysis reveals that, alongside normal Auger decay, distinct ultrafast charge transfer processes occur between the calcium ion and surrounding water molecules, underscoring the complex nature of metal-solvent interactions. Two primary mechanisms were identified. The first one involves electron transfer from water to the calcium ion. The second mechanism depends on the photon energy and is tentatively attributed to the decay of photoelectron satellites, the capture of free solvated electrons or electrons from a Cl$^-$ ion in the second solvation shell. Additionally, we observed significant shifts in electron energies due to post-collision interactions and interpreted the Ca 1s-1 photoelectron satellites mainly as originating from inelastic photoelectron scattering (IPES). These findings provide deeper insights into the electronic properties of hydrated metal ions, with potential implications for fields such as catalysis and biochemistry, where metal ions play a crucial role.</description>

      <title>Extracting Coupling-Mode Spectral Densities with Two-Dimensional Electronic Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Methods for reconstructing the spectral density of a vibrational environment from experimental data can yield key insights into the impact of the environment on molecular function. Although such experimental methods exist, they generally only access vibrational modes that couple diagonally to the electron system. Here we present a method for extracting the spectral density of modes that couple to the transition between electronic states, using two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy. To demonstrate this, we use a process-tensor method that can simulate two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy measurements in a numerically exact way. To explain how the extraction works, we also derive an approximate analytical solution, which illustrates that the non-Markovianity of the environment plays an essential role in the existence of the simulated signal.</description>

      <title>Exponential quantum speedups in quantum chemistry with linear depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove classical simulation hardness, under the generalized $\mathsf{P}\neq\mathsf{NP}$ conjecture, for quantum circuit families with applications in near-term quantum chemical ground state estimation. The proof exploits a connection to particle number conserving matchgate circuits with fermionic magic state inputs, which are shown to be universal for quantum computation under post-selection, and are therefore not classically simulable in the worst case, in either the strong (multiplicative) or weak (sampling) sense. We apply this result to quantum multi-reference methods designed for near-term quantum hardware by ruling out certain dequantization strategies for computing the off-diagonal matrix elements. We demonstrate these quantum speedups for two choices of reference state that incorporate both static and dynamic correlations to model the electronic eigenstates of molecular systems: orbital-rotated matrix product states, which are preparable in linear depth, and unitary coupled-cluster with single and double excitations. In each case we discuss the implications for achieving exponential quantum advantage in quantum chemistry on near-term hardware.</description>

      <title>New beyond-Voigt line-shape profile recommended for the HITRAN database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parameters associated with the collisional perturbation of spectral lines are essential for modeling the absorption of electromagnetic radiation in gas media. The HITRAN molecular spectroscopic database provides these parameters, although originally they were associated only with the Voigt profile parameterization. However, in the HITRAN2016 and HITRAN2020 editions, Voigt, speed-dependent Voigt and Hartmann-Tran (HT) profiles have been incorporated, thanks to the new relational structure of the database. The HT profile was introduced in HITRAN in 2016 as a recommended profile for the most accurate spectral interpretations and modeling. It was parameterized with a four-temperature-range temperature dependence. Since then, however, some features of the HT profile have been revealed that are problematic from a practical perspective. These are: the singular behavior of the temperature dependencies of the velocity-changing parameters when the shift parameter crosses zero and the difficulty in evaluating the former for mixtures. In this article, we summarize efforts to eliminate the above-mentioned problems that led us to recommend using the quadratic speed-dependent hard-collision (qSDHC) profile with double-power-law (DPL) temperature dependencies. We refer to this profile as a modified Hartmann-Tran (mHT) profile. The computational cost of evaluating it is the same as for the HT profile. We give a detailed description of the mHT profile (also including line mixing) and discuss the representation of its parameters, together with their DPL temperature parametrization adopted in the HITRAN database. We discuss an efficient algorithm for evaluating this profile and provide corresponding computer codes in several programming languages: Fortran, Python, MATLAB, Wolfram Mathematica, and LabVIEW. We also discuss the associated update of the HITRAN Application Programming Interface (HAPI).</description>

      <title>Dielectric permittivity of water confined in stacks of charged lipid layers: extracting profiles from molecular dynamics simulations using a modified Poisson-Boltzmann equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most organic and inorganic surfaces (e.g., glass, nucleic acids or lipid membranes) become charged in aqueous solutions. The resulting ionic distribution induces effective interactions between the charged surfaces. Stacks of like-charged lipid bilayers immersed in multivalent ion solutions exhibit strong coupling (SC) effects, where ion correlations cause counter-intuitive membrane attraction. A similar attraction observed with monovalent ions is explained by SC theory through reduced dielectric permittivity under confinement. To explore this phenomenon, we propose a modified Poisson-Boltzmann (mPB) model with spatially varying dielectric permittivity and explicit Born solvation energy for ions. We use the model to investigate the dielectric permittivity profile of confined water in molecular dynamics simulations of charged lipid layers stacks at varying hydration levels, and compare the results with alternative computational methods. The model captures a sharp decrease in permittivity as the system enters the attractive regime, converging to a plateau value that we attribute to lipid headgroups. The generic nature of the mPB framework allows application to other systems, such as other biological interfaces or solid walls, provided ions follow Boltzmann statistics.</description>

      <title>Numerically efficient quasi-adiabatic propagator path integral approach with two independent non-commuting baths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Path integral methods, like the quasi-adiabatic propagator path integral (QUAPI), are widely used in general-purpose and highly accurate numerical benchmark simulations of open quantum systems, particularly in regimes inaccessible to perturbative methods. Nevertheless, the applicability of the QUAPI method to realistic systems of interest is restricted by the exponentially growing computer memory requirements with respect to the size of the quantum system and the time range of non-Markovian correlation effects. This exponential ''wall'' becomes even more severe for multiple non-commuting fluctuating environments. In the present work, we address the numerical efficiency and accuracy of approximations that have been introduced for the QUAPI method with a single general environment, for the case of two independent non-commuting environments where one of them is considered as a pure dephasing environment. Specifically, we consider a sharply defined cut-off of the memory time, path filtering and mask assisted coarse graining of influence functional coefficients (MACGIC-QUAPI) as approximations. We demonstrate that commonly applied numerical techniques such as path filtering cannot be straightforwardly transferred to the two bath case even in the weak-coupling and quasi-Markovian limits. On the other hand, the sharply defined memory cut-off can be accurately handled with the mask assisted coarse graining (MACGIC-QUAPI) approach. Our findings demonstrates that if system coupling operators to different baths do not commute, the additive nature of the statistically independent environments may be misleading. Particularly, the quasi-Markovian nature of a pure dephasing bath is lost, once there simultaneously exists another non-commuting source of fluctuations.</description>

Abstract: High-resolution X-ray spectroscopy is an essential tool in X-ray astronomy, enabling detailed studies of celestial objects and their physical and chemical properties. However, comprehensive mapping of high-resolution X-ray spectra for even simple interstellar and circumstellar molecules is still lacking. In this study, we conducted systematic quantum chemical simulations to predict the C1s X-ray absorption spectra of CN$^+$, CN, and CN$^-$. Our findings provide valuable references for both X-ray astronomy and laboratory studies. We assigned the first electronic peak of CN$^+$ and CN to C1s $\rightarrow \sigma^*$ transitions, while the peak for CN$^-$ corresponds to a C1s $\rightarrow \pi^*$ transition. We explained that the two-fold degeneracy ($\pi^*_{xz}$ and $\pi^*_{yz}$) of the C1s$\rightarrow\pi^*$ transitions results in CN$^-$ exhibiting a significantly stronger first absorption compared to the other two systems. We further calculated the vibronic fine structures for these transitions using the quantum wavepacket method based on multiconfigurational-level, anharmonic potential energy curves, revealing distinct energy positions for the 0-0 absorptions at 280.7 eV, 279.6 eV, and 285.8 eV. Each vibronic profile features a prominent 0-0 peak, showing overall similarity but differing intensity ratios of the 0-0 and 0-1 peaks. Notably, introducing a C1s core hole leads to shortened C-N bond lengths and increased vibrational frequencies across all species. These findings enhance our understanding of the electronic structures and X-ray spectra of carbon-nitrogen species, emphasizing the influence of charge state on X-ray absorptions.</description>

      <title>Capturing strong correlation effects on a quantum annealer: calculation of avoided crossing in the H$_4$ molecule using the quantum annealer eigensolver</title>

Abstract: We broaden the scope of the Quantum Annealer Eigensolver (QAE) algorithm, an underexplored noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) era approach for calculating atomic and molecular properties, to predict avoided crossings, where strong correlation effects are at play. For this purpose, we consider the classic example of the H$_4$ molecule in a rectangular geometry. Our results are obtained on the 5000-qubit D-Wave Advantage system 4.1 quantum computer. We benchmark our quantum annealing results with full configuration interaction (FCI) as well as with those obtained using simulated annealing. We find that we can predict avoided crossings within about 1.2% of the FCI value on real quantum hardware. We carry out analyses on the effect of the number of shots, anneal time, and the choice of Lagrange multiplier on our obtained results. Since the QAE algorithm provides information on the wave function as its output, we also check the quality of the computed wave function by calculating the fidelity, and find it to be 99.886%. Finally, we qualitatively discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the QAE algorithm relative to its gate-based NISQ algorithm counterpart, the celebrated Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE).</description>

      <title>MetaWave: A Platform for Unified Implementation of Nonrelativistic and Relativistic Wavefunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: \texttt{MetaWave} is a C++ template-based architecture designed for unified implementation of nonrelativistic and relativistic wavefunction-based quantum chemical methods. It is highly modular, extendable, and efficient. This is achieved by decoupling the three distinct aspects of quantum chemical methods
  (i.e., nature of Hamiltonian, structure of wavefunction, and strategy of parallelization ), thereby allowing for separate treatment of them through their internal type-trait and tagging systems furnished by C++ metaprogramming. Once the second-quantized Hamiltonians, whether nonrelativistic (spin-free) or relativistic (spin-dependent), are decomposed into topologically equivalent diagrams for a unified evaluation of the basic coupling coefficients between (randomly selected) spin-free or spin-dependent configuration state functions or Slater determinants incorporating full molecular symmetry (including single or double point group and spin or time reversal symmetry), the many-electron wavefunctions, whether built up with scalar or spinor orbitals, can be assembled with the same templates. As for parallelization, \texttt{MetaWave} supports both OpenMP and MPI, with the majority of the latter being translated automatically from its OpenMP counterparts.The whole structure of \texttt{MetaWave} is reviewed here, with some showcases for illustrating its performance.</description>

      <title>Applying the Liouville-Lanczos Method of Time-Dependent Density-Functional Theory to Warm Dense Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04921v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ab initio modeling of dynamic structure factors (DSF) and related density response properties in the warm dense matter (WDM) regime is a challenging computational task. The DSF, convolved with a probing X-ray beam and instrument function, is measured in X-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) experiments, which allows for the study of electronic structure properties at the microscopic level. Among the various ab initio methods, linear response time-dependent density functional theory (LR-TDDFT) is a key framework for simulating the DSF. The standard approach in LR-TDDFT for computing the DSF relies on the orbital representation. A significant drawback of this method is the unfavorable scaling of the number of required empty bands as the wavenumber increases, making LR-TDDFT impractical for modeling XRTS measurements over large energy scales, such as in backward scattering geometry. We consider and test an alternative approach that employs the Liouville-Lanczos (LL) method for simulating the DSF. This approach does not require empty states and allows the DSF at large momentum transfer values and over a broad frequency range to be accessed. We compare the results obtained from the LL method with those from the standard LR-TDDFT within the projector augmented-wave formalism for isochorically heated aluminum and warm dense hydrogen. Additionally, we utilize exact path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) results for the imaginary-time density-density correlation function (ITCF) of warm dense hydrogen to rigorously benchmark the LL approach. We discuss the application of the LL method for calculating DSFs and ITCFs at different wavenumbers, the effects of pseudopotentials, and the role of Lorentzian smearing. The successful validation of the LL method under WDM conditions makes it a valuable addition to the ab initio simulation landscape, supporting experimental efforts and advancing WDM theory.</description>

      <title>Review of the Electrochemical Double Layer Theory and Its Applications in Battery Electrode Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18202v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interface plays a critical role in electrochemical systems, driving the development of various theories to investigate properties at nanoscale and microscale levels, including the electrictrochemical double layer (EDL) theory and continuum theory. However, the application of EDL theory within the realm of battery electrode materials has not been clearly defined according to material type. The diverse range of materials and their intricate interactions with interface theories often lead to misunderstandings. This review meticulously outlines the origins and principles of the EDL theory. Additionally, it categorizes battery electrode materials into two main groups: semiconductors and conductors. A comprehensive examination is presented on the implementation of EDL and other interface theories, accompanied by a comparative evaluation of the fundamental models and experiments described. The review also explores the potential advancements of EDL and other interface theories, as well as their application in electrode materials. This exhaustive review serves as an invaluable resource for scholars in electrochemistry and materials science, aiding in their understanding of interface theories, their scope of applicability, and the integration of these theories with practical experimental approaches.</description>
