      <title>Out-of-bounds hydrodynamics in holographic anisotropic Dirac semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a version of a strongly correlated 2+1-dimensional condensed matter system that features a thermal phase transition between a semimetal and an insulator through a semi-Dirac quantum critical region using AdS/CFT holography. We introduce backreaction into the bulk equations of motion to measure transport coefficients in the boundary; specifically the shear viscosity $\eta$. By explicitly breaking rotational symmetry we find a new instance of violation of the KSS-bound for the $\eta/s$ ratio in the quantum critical region, as well as a monotone dependence on temperature in the $T\to 0$ regime fixed by a Lifshitz dynamical critical exponent. We find that the Lifshitz critical exponent in the anisotropic direction is approximately equal to $2$ for our choice of backreaction parameters. We find explicit $T=0$ solutions separated by a quantum critical point in parameter space, showing that the thermal critical phase found in previous work comes from a quantum phase transition at zero temperature.</description>

      <title>An indirect correlation of dielectric properties using optical trapping and dielectric resonance in two different frequency regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dielectric permittivity, $\varepsilon_r$, of materials are often limited to a sub-GHz range using normal LCR meters. In the GHz range the $\varepsilon_r$ can be measured using Vector Network Analyzers and measurement jigs (waveguides) which are specific for different frequency regimes. Hence, to measure er for the entire frequency range one needs several components and is an extremely costly experiment. However, for applications such as Dielectric Resonator Antennas one need to know the er and the dielectric loss to estimate the resonant frequency. An indirect method is proposed in this letter to find the er from Transversely Misaligned Dual-Fiber Optical Trapping at the optical frequency range to approximately estimate {\epsilon}r and thereby understand the correlation between these two regimes of frequency responses.</description>

      <title>Extension of Second-Principles Density Functional Theory into the time domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an extension of the second-principles density functional theory (SPDFT) method to perform time-dependent simulations. Our approach, which calculates the evolution of the density matrix in real time and real space using the Liouville-von Neumann equation of motion, allows determining optical and transport properties for very large systems, involving tens of thousands of atoms, using very modest computational platforms. In contrast with other methods, we show that SPDFT can be applied to a wide variety of materials including both metals and insulators. In particular, we illustrate its capabilities by obtaining the spectra of SrTiO$_3$, diamond and metallic lithium. We find that, while SPDFT results in SrTiO$_3$ are quite similar to those obtained from DFT using linear perturbation theory, we observe significant improvements over this method in both diamond and metallic lithium. The inclusion of electron-electron interactions during the evolution of the density matrix in diamond allows the spectra to more closely resemble those obtained with the Bethe-Salpeter equation than from perturbation theory. In lithium time-dependent SPDFT not only predicts interband transitions but also the Drude peak, opening the possibility of detailed ab initio studies of transport properties beyond many of the usual approximations.</description>

      <title>Magnetic monopoles with an internal degree of freedom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of spontaneously broken $SU(2)$ gauge theories with adjoint scalar and look for exact magnetic monopole solutions in the Bogomol'nyi--Prasad--Sommerfield (BPS) limit. We find that some of the resulting solutions exhibit a new internal degree of freedom (a moduli space parameter) that controls the energy density profile of the monopole while keeping the total energy (mass) constant.</description>

      <title>Efficient Variational Dynamics of Open Quantum Bosonic Systems via Automatic Differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a scalable variational method for simulating the dynamics of interacting open quantum bosonic systems deep in the quantum regime. The method is based on a multi-dimensional Wigner phase-space representation and employs a Variational Multi-Gaussian (VMG) ansatz, whose accuracy is systematically controlled by the number of Gaussian components. The variational equations of motion are derived from the Dirac-Frenkel principle and evaluated efficiently by combining the analytical structure of Gaussian functions with automatic differentiation. As a key application, we study a driven-dissipative two-dimensional Bose-Hubbard lattice with two-boson coherent driving and two-body losses. Using our dynamical approach, we compute the finite-size scaling of the Liouvillian spectral gap - extracted from the relaxation dynamics - which vanishes in the thermodynamic limit. Our results reveal critical slowing down with dynamical exponents of the 2D quantum Ising universality class, demonstrating the power of our method to capture complex quantum dynamics in large open systems.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-aided Optimal Control of a noisy qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply a graybox machine-learning framework to model and control a qubit undergoing Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics from environmental noise. The approach combines physics-informed equations with a lightweight transformer neural network based on the self-attention mechanism. The model is trained on simulated data and learns an effective operator that predicts observables accurately, even in the presence of memory effects. We benchmark both non-Gaussian random-telegraph noise and Gaussian Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise and achieve low prediction errors even in challenging noise coupling regimes. Using the model as a dynamics emulator, we perform gradient-based optimal control to identify pulse sequences implementing a universal set of single-qubit gates, achieving fidelities above 99% for the lowest considered value of the coupling and remaining above 90% for the highest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spherical Harmonic Gaussian type orbitals and Slater functions can be expressed using spherical coordinates or a linear combinations of the appropriate Cartesian functions. General expressions for the transformation coefficients between the two representations are provided. Values for the transformation coefficients are tabulated up to the quantum number $\ell = 10$. The formula is applied to construct the Hartree potential by an arbitrary-order multipole expansion.</description>

      <title>Electronic stopping cross sections of tungsten to swift ions and comparisons with models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate stopping power data for tungsten is crucial for ion beam analysis (IBA) techniques applied to fusion-related materials. In this work, we present new experimental measurements of the stopping power of tungsten for protons and alpha particles, addressing key gaps in fundamental databases. Our results provide a densely spaced dataset, refining the practical uncertainty limits to approximately 1.5% for protons and 2.0% for alpha particles. We critically compare our findings with semi-empirical and theoretical models, evaluating their performance in describing the stopping power of tungsten for light projectiles. By improving the accuracy and reliability of stopping power data, we contribute to the enhancement of the applicability of ion-beam methods for characterizing tungsten in fusion-related research. These findings contribute to the refinement of semi-empirical models and support the ongoing efforts to develop more precise theoretical frameworks for ion-solid interactions in high-Z materials.</description>

      <title>An Overview of CV-MDI-QKD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As quantum key distribution (QKD) emerges as a robust defense against quantum computer threats, significant advancements have been realized by researchers. A pivotal focus has been the development of protocols that not only simplify hardware implementation like the use of continuous-variable (CV) systems, but also negate the necessity for trusted nodes, as seen with the measurement-device independent (MDI) approach. This paper delves into the integration of these methodologies in the CV-MDI-QKD protocol, offering an in-depth exploration of its evolution, primary characteristics, and the latest advancements in both theory and experiment.</description>
