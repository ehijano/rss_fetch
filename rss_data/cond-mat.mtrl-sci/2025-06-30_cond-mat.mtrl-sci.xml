      <title>A Review on Improving PSC Performance through Charge Carrier Management: Where We Stand and What's Next?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) represent a breakthrough in photovoltaic technology, combining high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), ease of fabrication, and tunable optoelectronic properties. However, their commercial viability is limited by critical issues such as charge carrier recombination, interfacial defects, instability under environmental stress, and toxicity of lead-based components. This review systematically examines recent advancements in charge carrier management strategies aimed at overcoming these limitations. Initially, fundamental mechanisms governing carrier generation, separation, transport, and recombination are outlined to provide a clear foundation. The study then delves into an in-depth analysis of carrier lifetime and mobility, evaluating recent methodologies for their enhancement through compositional engineering and structural optimization. Subsequently, trap state passivation techniques and interface engineering approaches are reviewed, with a particular focus on their impact on device stability and efficiency. The review also discusses long-term stability strategies and emerging trends in lead-free and scalable PSC technologies. In this work, recent strategies for charge carrier management are systematically categorized, comparative analyses are provided and synergistic solutions with high potential for real-world implementation are highlighted. By synthesizing data and perspectives from over thirty recent studies, this article offers a comprehensive roadmap for researchers seeking to optimize PSC performance and accelerate their transition toward commercial application.</description>

      <title>Understanding and Controlling V-Doping and S-Vacancy Behavior in Two-Dimensional Semiconductors- Toward Predictive Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Doping in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers provides a powerful method to precisely tailor their electronic, optical, and catalytic properties for advanced technological applications, including optoelectronics, catalysis, and quantum technologies. However, doping efficiency and outcomes in these materials are strongly influenced by the complex interactions between introduced dopants and intrinsic defects, particularly sulfur vacancies. This coupling between dopants and defects can lead to distinctly different behaviors depending on doping concentration, presenting significant challenges in the predictable and controlled design of TMD properties. For example, in this work we systematically varied the p-type vanadium (V) doping density in tungsten disulfide (WS2) monolayers and observed a transition in doping behavior. At low concentrations, V-dopants enhance the native optical properties of WS2, as evidenced by increased photoluminescence, without introducing new electronic states. However, at higher concentrations, V-dopants promote the formation of vanadium-sulfur vacancy complexes that generate mid-gap states, with energies that can be precisely tuned by controlling the vanadium concentration. Using a combination of excitation- and temperature-dependent photoluminescence microscopy, atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy, and first-principles calculations, we identify attractive interactions between p-type V-dopants and n-type monosulfur vacancies. Our results provide mechanistic understanding of how enthalpic dopant-defect interactions versus entropic effects govern the balance between property enhancement versus perturbation of transition metal dichalcogenides and suggest a pathway toward the rational design of doping strategies for next-generation optoelectronic, catalytic, and quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Angular Momentum Fluctuations in the Phonon Vacuum of Symmetric Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although time-reversal and inversion symmetry constrain the angular momentum of each phonon mode to vanish, we show that the vacuum state of crystals with such symmetries can nevertheless exhibit finite angular momentum fluctuations. These fluctuations arise from quantum coherence between nondegenerate, orthogonally polarized modes and are encoded in the off-diagonal components of the angular momentum operator. Their origin lies in the noncommutativity between the phonon Hamiltonian and angular momentum, which enables time-dependent rotational dynamics even in symmetric vacua. We provide intuitive insight into the coherence underlying this phenomenon by drawing an analogy with the beating between linearly polarized classical waves. Finally, we show that these angular momentum fluctuations produce distinct spectral signatures that can, in principle, be probed via established techniques sensitive to the polarization content and symmetry of lattice excitations, opening an uncharted avenue for accessing and leveraging rotational vacuum correlations in crystalline systems.</description>

      <title>Symmetry analysis of cross-circular and parallel-circular Raman optical activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Raman scattering regarding the circularly-polarized incident and scattered lights is closely related to the circular activity of a given system. We investigate the symmetry of its activity, called the cross-circular and parallel-circular Raman optical activity. The analysis is systematically performed with the magnetic point groups and indicates that the response allows for a useful diagnosis of the symmetry of materials like chirality and (magneto-)axiality. It is also shown that the Stokes and anti-Stokes processes are related to each other by the conserved antiunitary symmetry for the time-reversal operation and that combined with the mirror reflection.</description>

      <title>Spin non-Collinear Real-Time Time-Dependent Density-Functional Theory and Implementation in the Modern GPU-Accelerated INQ code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is a theory that describes the time evolution of quantum mechanical many-electron systems under the influence of external time-dependent electric and magnetic fields. INQ is a specially designed software to efficiently solve the real-time TDDFT equations on graphics processing units (GPUs), which aim to overcome the computational limitation of time and size scales of non-equilibrium quantum dynamics. In this work we will present an implementation of non-collinear TDDFT for the INQ code to simulate spin dynamics in real time and discuss the implementation of non-collinear magnetic effects into the code. We will discuss the implementation of exchange-correlation magnetic fields, spin-orbit coupling, and the interaction between the electronic system and external magnetic fields. We will then consider several prototypical examples of spin dynamics in magnetic clusters and solids after light excitation. Potential applications range from the study of real-time dynamics of magnons to ultrafast spin dynamics under linear and circularly polarized laser excitation, as well as spectroscopic signatures such as magnetic circular dichroism and pump-probe Kerr rotation.</description>

      <title>Scalable Etch-Free Transfer of Low-Dimensional Materials from Metal Films to Diverse Substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-dimensional materials hold great promises for exploring emergent physical phenomena, nanoelectronics, and quantum technologies. Their synthesis often depends on catalytic metal films, from which the synthesized materials must be transferred to insulating substrates to enable device functionality and minimize interfacial interactions during quantum investigations. Conventional transfer methods, such as chemical etching or electrochemical delamination, degrade material quality, limit scalability, or prove incompatible with complex device architectures. Here, a scalable, etch-free transfer technique is presented, employing Field's metal (51% In, 32.5% Bi, and 16.5% Sn by weight) as a low-melting-point mechanical support to gently delaminate low-dimensional materials from metal films without causing damage. Anchoring the metal film during separation prevents tearing and preserves material integrity. As a proof of concept, atomically precise graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) are transferred from Au(111)/mica to dielectric substrates, including silicon dioxide (SiO_2) and single-crystalline lanthanum oxychloride (LaOCl). Comprehensive characterization confirms the preservation of structural and chemical integrity throughout the transfer process. Wafer-scale compatibility and device integration are demonstrated by fabricating GNR-based field-effect transistors (GNRFETs) that exhibit room-temperature switching with on/off current ratios exceeding 10^3. This method provides a scalable and versatile platform for integrating low-dimensional materials into advanced low-dimensional materials-based technologies.</description>

      <title>Prediction of A15 Tilt Grain Boundary Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a theoretical method to predict all coincidence site lattice (CSL) tilt grain boundaries (GBs) in A15, especially high-$\Sigma$ CSL GBs. This method includes a modified Farey diagram (MFD) and a computational framework based on the 3D phase field crystal model. Applied to [001] CSL symmetric tilt grain boundaries (STGBs) in A15, this method identifies building blocks of A15 GBs, known as structural units (SUs). The MFD predicts the quantity and proportion of SUs within GBs. The developed computational approach further determines the arrangement of these SUs. The predictive rule reveals the SU arrangement of A15 [001] CSL STGBs.</description>

      <title>The Bulk Penetration of Edge Properties in Two-Dimensional Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Edges are essential for the mechanical, chemical, electronic, and magnetic properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials. Research has shown that features assigned to edges are not strictly localized but often penetrate the bulk to some degree. However, mechanical edge properties, such as edge energies and stresses, are typically assigned at the system level, with spatial bulk penetrations that remain unknown. Here, we use density-functional tight-binding simulations to study how deep various edge properties spatially penetrate the 2D bulk. We study nine different edges made of four materials: graphene, goldene, boron nitride, and molybdenum disulfide. By investigating edge energies, edge stresses, and edge elastic moduli, we find that although the edge properties typically originate near edges, they still penetrate the bulk to some degree. An utmost example is goldene with a staggered edge, whose edge properties penetrate the bulk nanometer-deep. Our results caution against associating system-level edge properties too strictly with the edge, especially if those properties are further used in continuum models.</description>

      <title>The Structural Behavior of Physisorbed Metallenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomically thin metallenes have properties attractive for applications, but they are intrinsically unstable and require delicate stabilization in pores or other nano-constrictions. Substrates provide solid support, but metallenes' wanted properties can only be retained in weak physisorption. Here, we study the 45 physisorbed, atomically thin metallene structures in flat and buckled lattices using a sequential multi-scale model based on density-functional theory calculations. The lattices are mostly buckled but flat for a handful of elements such as Na, K, Rb, Ag, Au, and Cd, depending on physisorption strength. Moreover, under certain conditions, the structure can be controlled by applying biaxial tensile stress parallel or an electric field normal to the surface. The stress reduces the threshold of adhesion strength required to flatten a buckled lattice, and the electric field can be used to increase that threshold controllably. Our results help provide fundamental information about the structures of physisorbed metallenes and suggest means to control them at will by suitable substrate choice or tuning of experimental parameters.</description>

      <title>Non-Relativistic Anisotropic Magnetoresistance with Collinear and Non-Collinear Magnetic Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) arises from symmetry lowering of the conductivity tensor induced by magnetic order. In simple ferromagnets, AMR is a relativistic effect, relying on spin-orbit interaction (SOC). Here, we demonstrate that a comparable symmetry lowering can also occur in a non-relativistic limit. Using tight-binding models, density functional theory calculations, and Boltzmann transport theory, we investigate systems with multiple magnetic sublattices, including both collinear and non-collinear antiferromagnets, as well as ferrimagnetic configurations. We show that AMR and related anisotropies can emerge purely from magnetic order, without the need for SOC, and may reach significant magnitudes. The findings are supported by case studies on toy-model lattices and real materials such as MnN, Mn$_3$Sn, and are further interpreted using a symmetry analysis based on Neumann's principle. Material candidates that exhibit non-relativistic anisotropic magnetoresistance are identified by symmetry analysis applied to entries in the MAGNDATA database.</description>

      <title>Exceptional thermoelectric properties in Na$_2$TlSb enabled by quasi-1D band structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-low-dimensional band structures in bulk high-symmetry materials can exhibiting density of states (DOS) profiles akin to those of low-dimensional materials. A particular striking example is the full-Heusler compound Na$_2$TlSb, with valence band energy isosurfaces consisting of intersecting 2D-dimensional pockets forming a box-like structure, with the sides individually akin to the energy isosurfaces arising in one-dimensional (1D) quantum wells. The combination of high velocities and rapidly increasing DOS with energy is extremely promising for thermoelectric applications. However, these beneficial properties could in principle be counteracted by high electronic scattering rates, and the benefits of for instance band convergence has been questioned precisely because of increased scattering rates. It is therefore critical to understand the electronic scattering nature of low-dimensional systems. In the current study, describing electronic transport properties of Na$_2$TlSb from first principles, we found that electronic scattering rates remained modest despite the high DOS. This was caused by the intricate interplay between several effects: (i) delocalized energetic isosurfaces giving rise to large momentum scattering paths with low wavefunction overlap, reducing the scattering probability; (ii) a high DOS resulting in a high free-carrier screening; (iii) a large portion of the scattering paths within the flat energy isosurfaces keeps the electron group velocity nearly constant, reducing the effective relaxation rates. The high velocity and modest relaxation time result in a high carrier mobility, which, together with the high DOS and beneficial DOS profile, results in excellent electron transport properties. Combined with an ultra-low $\kappa_\ell$ of $&lt;1$ reported in literature, we predict a thermoelectric figure of merit ranging from 2.4 at 300 K to a maximum of 4.4 at 600 K.</description>

      <title>Wurtzite AlScN/AlN Superlattice Ferroelectrics Enable Endurance Beyond 1010 Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wurtzite ferroelectrics are rapidly emerging as a promising material class for next-generation non-volatile memory technologies, owing to their large remanent polarization, intrinsically ordered three-dimensional crystal structure, and full compatibility with CMOS processes and back-end-of-line (BEOL) integration. However, their practical implementation remains critically constrained by a severe endurance bottleneck: under conditions where the remanent polarization (2Pr) reaches or exceeds 200 uC/cm^2, devices typically undergo catastrophic failure before reaching 10^8 cycles. Here, we report a vacancy-confining superlattice strategy that addresses this limitation, achieving reliable ferroelectric switching beyond 10^10 cycles while preserving saturated polarization (2Pr &gt;= 200 uC/cm^2). This is achieved by embedding periodic ultrathin AlN layers within AlScN films, forming wurtzite AlScN/AlN superlattices, in conjunction with a dynamic recovery protocol that actively stabilizes the defect landscape throughout repeated cycling. Atomic-resolution imaging and EELS spectrum imaging technique, supported by first-principles calculations, reveal a self-regulated defect topology in which nitrogen vacancies are spatially confined by heterostructure energy barriers and dynamically re-trapped into energetically favorable lattice sites. This dual spatial-energetic confinement mechanism effectively inhibits both long-range percolative migration and local defect clustering, enabling such an ultrahigh endurance exceeding 10^10 cycles and limiting polarization degradation to below 3% after 10^9 cycles. These findings establish nitrogen vacancy topology stabilization as a foundational design principle for reliable operation of wurtzite ferroelectrics, providing a scalable and CMOS-compatible platform for future high-endurance ferroelectric memory technologies.</description>

Abstract: Cavity magnonics explores the hybridization of photons and magnons within microwave resonators. One of the hallmarks of these systems is their ability to exhibit non-reciprocity, which is a key feature for radio frequency (RF) applications. One way to control non-reciprocal behaviors in cavity magnonics is the design of chiral cavities that allow selective coupling between photons and magnons depending on their polarization. However, a built-in chiral platform to harness and control non-reciprocity remains to be achieved. Here, we experimentally demonstrate controllable non-reciprocity (with an absolute isolation ratio reaching 46 dB) in a chiral resonator loaded with multiple yttrium iron garnet spheres. We develop a theoretical model of the S-parameters based on input-output formalism which highlights the links between the phases occurring in the system and its non-reciprocal behavior. Controllable non-reciprocity in cavity magnonics could enable the development of programmable isolators, circulators, and RF switches with improved performance. Such developments could pave the way toward more versatile and scalable information processing systems.</description>

      <title>Role of long-range dipolar interactions in the simulation of the properties of polar crystals using effective atomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driven by novel approaches and computational techniques, second-principles atomic potentials are nowadays at the forefront of computational materials science, enabling large-scale simulations of material properties with near-first-principles accuracy. However, their application to polar materials can be challenging, particularly when longitudinal-optical phonon modes are active on the material, as accurately modeling such systems requires incorporating the long-range part of the dipole-dipole interactions. In this study, we challenge the influence of these interactions on the properties of polar materials taking BaTiO$_3$ as paradigmatic example. By comparing models with and without the long-range part of the electrostatic contributions in a systematic way, we demonstrate that even if these interactions are neglected, the models can still provide an overall good description of the material, though they may lead to punctual significant artifacts. Our results propose a pathway to identify when an atomistic potential may be inadequate and needs to be corrected through the inclusion of the long-range part of dipolar interactions.</description>

      <title>Multislice Hollow Ptychography for Simultaneous Atomic-Layer-Resolved 3D Structural Imaging and Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron matter interactions in electron microscopy produce both elastic and inelastic scattering, forming the basis for imaging and spectroscopy. However, the integration of electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) with 4D-STEM and electron ptychography remains challenging because of detector geometry conflicts. Song et al. solved this issue by introducing a hollow type pixelated detector that enables hollow ptychography and allows low angle electrons to go through to the EELS spectrometer. The single-slice approach of hollow ptychography proves effective for 2D thin materials but struggles with multiple scattering in thicker specimens. Here, we introduce multislice hollow ptychography (MHP), a robust imaging modality that overcomes these limitations by accounting for multiple scattering. MHP enables high-resolution structural imaging from hollow diffraction patterns while remaining compatible with simultaneous EELS acquisition. It potentially can provide sub-angstrom lateral resolution at intermediate doses and supports full 3D atomic-layer reconstruction at ultrahigh doses, with up to 70% of total electrons available for spectroscopy. This flexible framework facilitates correlative 3D imaging and chemical mapping in complex materials, including interfaces, defects, and dopants.</description>

      <title>Structure-Property Correlations in Sb, Ge, and Ga Doped AlFe$_2$B$_2$ for Magnetocaloric Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the effects of Sb, Ge, and Ga doping in AlFe$_2$B$_2$ on magnetic and magneto-caloric properties. Samples of AlFe$_2$B$_2$ and AlFe$_{1.9}$M$_{0.1}$B$_2$ (M= Ge, Ga and Sb) with 20\% excess Al were synthesized by arc melting, and the powder processed were investigated for their phase constituents, microstructure, magnetic and magneto-caloric effect. The parent compounds prepared showed the AlFe$_2$B$_2$ phase with a FeB secondary phase. However, in Sb and Ga-doped samples, an additional impurity phase, Al$_{13}$Fe$_4$, was observed apart from FeB, while in Ge-doped, only the AlB$_2$ impurity phase was present. The Curie temperature of AlFe$_2$B$_2$ is 277 K, increasing with Sb, Ge, and Ga doping to 287\,K, 297\,K, and 296\,K, respectively. The magnetization ($M$) is also higher with Ge and Ga addition in the 100-300\,K range; however, with Sb doping, the $M$ decreases significantly compared to parent AlFe$_2$B$_2$. The magnetic entropy change under 2\,T reached 2.93 JKg$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ near 274\,K in AlFe$_2$B$_2$, which decreases to 2.53 JKg$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ and 1.92 JKg$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ with Ge and Ga, respectively. With Sb doping, the MC change was affected dramatically to 0.32 JKg$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$. However, the relative cooling power of Ge doped is the same as that of parent AlFe$_2$B$_2$. This research advances the understanding of the relationship between doping elements and magnetic properties in AlFe$_2$B$_2$ and opens pathways for designing magneto-caloric materials with tailored magnetic characteristics.</description>

      <title>Pressure dependence of liquid iron viscosity from machine-learning molecular dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have developed a machine-learning potential that accurately models the behavior of iron under the conditions of Earth's core. By performing numerous nanosecond scale equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, the viscosities of liquid iron for the whole outer core conditions are obtained with much less uncertainty. We find that the Einstein-Stokes relation is not accurate for outer core conditions. The viscosity is on the order of 10s \si{mPa.s}, in agreement with previous first-principles results. We present a viscosity map as a function of pressure and temperature for liquid iron useful for geophysical modeling.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Electronic Origin of Anomalous Contact Conductance in Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study theoretically investigates the contact conductance in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG), providing a theoretical explanation for recent experimental observations from scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and conductive atomic force microscopy (c-AFM). These experiments revealed a surprising non-monotonic current pattern as a function of the TBG rotation angle $\theta$, with a peak at $\theta \approx 5^\circ$, a finding that markedly departs from the well-known magic angle TBG behavior. To elucidate this phenomenon, we develop a comprehensive theoretical and computational framework. Our calculations, performed on both relaxed and rigid TBG structures, simulate contact conductance by analyzing the local density of states across a range of biases and rotational angles. Contrary to the current interpretation, our results demonstrate that the maximum conductance at $\theta \approx 5^{\rm o}$ is not caused by structural relaxation or AA stacking zone changes. Instead, we attribute this peak to the evolution of the electronic band structure, specifically the shifting of van Hove singularities (vHs) to the Fermi level as the twist angle decreases. We further show that the precise location of this conductance maximum is dependent on the applied bias voltage. This interplay between twist angle, bias, and vHs energy provides a robust explanation for the experimental findings.</description>

      <title>Scalable Dip-Coated Bragg Mirrors for Strong Light-Matter Coupling with 2D Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a scalable and cost-effective method for fabricating high-performance Bragg mirrors using a bottom-up approach that combines evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA) and dip-coating. The photonic crystals are composed of alternating mesoporous SiO$_2$ and dense TiO$_2$ layers, providing a high refractive index contrast ($\sim$0.8). This enables strong reflectance (up to 96%) with as few as five bilayers and precise control of the photonic stop band across the visible spectrum by simply adjusting the deposition parameters. Integration of a thin film of the two-dimensional perovskite (PEA)$_2$PbI$_4$ leads to strong light--matter coupling at room temperature. Angle-resolved reflectance and photoluminescence measurements reveal the formation of upper and lower polariton branches, with a Rabi splitting of 90 meV. The observed polaritonic dispersion is well described by a two-level system and Green's function formalism. This work demonstrates an efficient strategy for constructing tunable optical cavities using simple solution-based methods. The combination of high optical quality, spectral tunability, and strong coupling performance positions this platform as a promising candidate for low-threshold polariton lasers, nonlinear optics, and integrated optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Multi-task parallelism for robust pre-training of graph foundation models on multi-source, multi-fidelity atomistic modeling data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph foundation models using graph neural networks promise sustainable, efficient atomistic modeling. To tackle challenges of processing multi-source, multi-fidelity data during pre-training, recent studies employ multi-task learning, in which shared message passing layers initially process input atomistic structures regardless of source, then route them to multiple decoding heads that predict data-specific outputs. This approach stabilizes pre-training and enhances a model's transferability to unexplored chemical regions. Preliminary results on approximately four million structures are encouraging, yet questions remain about generalizability to larger, more diverse datasets and scalability on supercomputers. We propose a multi-task parallelism method that distributes each head across computing resources with GPU acceleration. Implemented in the open-source HydraGNN architecture, our method was trained on over 24 million structures from five datasets and tested on the Perlmutter, Aurora, and Frontier supercomputers, demonstrating efficient scaling on all three highly heterogeneous super-computing architectures.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed neural network framework for solving forward and inverse flexoelectric problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flexoelectricity, the coupling between strain gradients and electric polarization, poses significant computational challenges due to its governing fourth-order partial differential equations that require C1-continuous solutions. To address these issues, we propose a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework grounded in an energy-based formulation that treats both forward and inverse problems within a unified architecture. The forward problem is recast as a saddle-point optimization of the total potential energy, solved via the deep energy method (DEM), which circumvents the direct computation of high-order derivatives. For the inverse problem of identifying unknown flexoelectric coefficients from sparse measurements, we introduce an additional variational loss that enforces stationarity with respect to the electric potential, ensuring robust and stable parameter inference. The framework integrates finite element-based numerical quadrature for stable energy evaluation and employs hard constraints to rigorously enforce boundary conditions. Numerical results for both direct and converse flexoelectric effects show excellent agreement with mixed-FEM solutions, and the inverse model accurately recovers material parameters from limited data. This study establishes a unified, mesh-compatible, and scalable PINN approach for high-order electromechanical problems, offering a promising alternative to traditional simulation techniques.</description>

      <title>Investigation of magnetic and magneto-transport properties in non-centrosymmetric antiferromagnetic semimetal GdGaSi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigated the magneto-transport and magnetic properties of GdGaSi, having non-centrosymmetric tetragonal structure, with space group $I4_1md$. Our theoretical results are supported by experimental studies. First-principles calculations reveal that GdGaSi is an antiferromagnetic semimetallic system, characterized by dominant electron-type charge carriers. In addition, the possible nontriviality of the crossing at the Fermi energy is consistent with isostructural LaPtSi-structured materials. The compound shows robust antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering with a N\'eel temperature of 19 K, and spin-reorientation signature below $T_N$. The semimetallic nature with positive magnetoresistance ($\simeq$ 2\% at 2 K and 8 T) is observed from the magnetotransport data, having electrons as majority charge carrier, established from the Hall measurements. The strong correlation in magnetism and transport is supported by various observations, like (1) concordant transitions in $M(T)$ and $\rho (T)$ data, (2) change in the concentration and mobility of electron below $T_N$, and (3) splitting of Kohler's plots in the two branches across the transition. Thus, our findings establish GdGaSi as a material with intertwined magnetic and transport degrees of freedom, within noncentrosymmetric lattice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we systematically investigate how the accuracy of CIA spectra depends on the quality of the ab initio data used. We evaluate quantitatively the impact of different quantum chemical methods and basis sets on spectral features, finding that even the lowest-level calculations are accurate to approximately 10 % at room temperature, and better at higher temperatures. This study also reveals a previously unreported double-peak structure for the He-Ne complex, which cannot be described by simple but commonly used single-exponential models for the short-range dipole. Our analysis shows that the range of internuclear distances relevant for CIA spectra varies with temperature, with short-range interactions becoming increasingly important at high temperatures. The long-range van der Waals induced dipoles never contribute. These findings provide new insights into the temperature-dependent behavior of CIA spectra and emphasize the importance of accurate modeling of short-range interactions for reliable astronomical modeling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel method for generating potential landscapes in GaAs microcavities through focused $He^{+}$ implantation. The ion beam imprints micron-scale patterns of non-radiative centers that deplete the exciton reservoir and form a loss-defined potential minimum. Under non-resonant pumping, the resulting traps have a lateral size $\le 1.2 ~\mathrm{\mu m}$ and a three-dimensional mode volume of only $\approx 0.6 ~ \mathrm{\mu m^3}$, small enough to to support a single polariton condensate mode. The implantation process maintains strong coupling and provides lithographic ($ &lt; 300 ~ \mathrm{nm}$) resolution. These loss-engineered traps effectively overcome the micrometer-scale limitations of conventional microcavity patterning techniques, opening new avenues for device development and polariton research within the quantum regime.</description>

      <title>Two types of compressible isotropic neo-Hookean material models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this book, we present a systematic study of the performance of two known types of compressible generalization of the incompressible neo-Hookean material model. The first type of generalization is based on the development of \emph{vol-iso} neo-Hookean models and involves the additive decomposition of the elastic energy into volumetric and isochoric parts. The second simpler type of generalization is based on the development of \emph{mixed} neo-Hookean models that do not use this decomposition. Theoretical studies of model performance and simulations of some homogeneous deformations have shown that when using volumetric functions $(J^q+J^{-q}-2)/(2q^2)$ ($J$ is the volume ratio, and $q\in \mathbb{R}$ is a parameter, $q\geq 0$) from the Hartmann--Neff family [Hartmann and Neff, Int. J. Solids Structures, 40: 2767--2791 (2003)] with parameter $q\geq 2$ (the preferred value is $q=5$), mixed and vol-iso models show similar performance in applications and have physically reasonable responses in extreme states, which is convenient for theoretical studies. However, contrary to vol-iso models, mixed models allow the use of a wider set of volumetric functions with physically reasonable responses in extreme states. A further feature of mixed models is simpler expressions for stresses and tangent stiffness tensors.</description>

However, real materials exhibit not only Kitaev exchange interactions but also other magnetic exchanges, which may drive the transition from a spin liquid phase to a long-range ordered ground state. This work focuses on modelling the effective spin Hamiltonian for two-dimensional (2D) honeycomb magnetic systems with $d^5$ electronic configurations. The Hubbard-Kanamori (HK) Hamiltonian equipped with spin-orbit coupling and electron correlations is considered where onsite energies and hopping parameters, preserving the crystal symmetry, are extracted from the first principles Density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Exact diagonalization (ED) calculations for the HK Hamiltonian on a two-site cluster are performed to construct the effective magnetic Hamiltonian. The ground-state magnetic properties are explored using the semi-classical Luttinger-Tisza approach. As a representative case, the magnetic ground state of the $d^5$ honeycomb system OsCl$_3$ is investigated, and the variation of magnetic exchange parameters with respect to the correlation strength (U) and Hund's coupling ($J_H$) is analyzed. The magnetic ground state exhibits zigzag antiferromagnetic ordering for a chosen value of $U$ and $J_H$, consistent with DFT results. This study provides insight into the magnetism of OsCl$_3$ and offers a computationally efficient alternative to traditional energy-based methods for calculating exchange interactions for strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <title>Site-polarized Mott phases competing with a correlated metal in twisted WSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Twisted WSe$_2$ hosts superconductivity, metal-insulator phase transitions, and field-controllable Fermi-liquid to non-Fermi-liquid transport properties. In this work, we use dynamical mean-field theory to provide a coherent understanding of the electronic correlations shaping the twisted WSe$_2$ phase diagram. We find a correlated metal competing with three distinct site-polarized correlated insulators; the competition is controlled by interlayer potential difference and interaction strength. The insulators are characterized by a strong differentiation between orbitals with respect to carrier concentration and effective correlation strength. Upon doping, a strong particle-hole asymmetry emerges, resulting from a Zaanen-Sawatzky-Allen-type charge-transfer mechanism. The associated charge-transfer physics and proximity to a van Hove singularity in the correlated metal sandwiched between two site-polarized insulators naturally explains the interlayer potential-driven metal-to-insulator transition, particle-hole asymmetry in transport, and the coherence-incoherence crossover in $3.65^\circ$ twisted WSe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Quantum-geometric dipole: a topological boost to flavor ferromagnetism in flat bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robust flavor-polarized phases are a striking hallmark of many flat-band moir\'e materials. In this work, we trace the origin of this spontaneous polarization to a previously overlooked quantum-geometric quantity: the quantum-geometric dipole. Analogous to how the quantum metric governs the spatial spread of wavepackets, we show that the quantum-geometric dipole sets the characteristic size of particle-hole excitations, e.g. magnons in a ferromagnet, which in turn boosts their gap and stiffness. Indeed, the larger the particle-hole separation, the weaker the mutual attraction, and the stronger the excitation energy. In topological bands, this energy enhancement admits a lower bound within the single-mode approximation, highlighting the crucial role of topology in flat-band ferromagnetism. We illustrate these effects in microscopic models, emphasizing their generality and relevance to moir\'e materials. Our results establish the quantum-geometric dipole as a predictive geometric indicator for ferromagnetism in flat bands, a crucial prerequisite for topological order.</description>

      <title>Swapping exchange and spin-orbit induced correlated phases in proximitized Bernal bilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.16025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ex-so-tic van der Waals heterostructures take advantage of the electrically tunable layer polarization to swap proximity exchange and spin-orbit coupling in the electronically active region. Perhaps the simplest example is Bernal bilayer graphene (BBG) encapsulated by a layered magnet from one side and a strong spin-orbit material from the other. Taking WS$_2$/BBG/Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ as a representative ex-so-tronic device, we employ realistic \emph{ab initio}-inspired Hamiltonians and effective electron-electron interactions to investigate the emergence of correlated phases within the random phase approximation. We find that for a given doping level, exchange and spin-orbit coupling induced Stoner and intervalley coherence instabilities can be swapped, allowing to explore the full spectrum of correlated phases within a single device.</description>

      <title>Strong anharmonicity dictates ultralow thermal conductivities of type-I clathrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Type-I clathrate solids have attracted significant interest due to their ultralow thermal conductivities and subsequent promise for thermoelectric applications, yet the mechanisms underlying these properties are not well understood. Here, we extend the framework of vibrational dynamical mean-field theory (VDMFT) to calculate temperature-dependent thermal transport properties of $X_8$Ga$_{16}$Ge$_{30}$, where $X=$ Ba, Sr, using a many-body Green's function approach. We find that nonresonant scattering between cage acoustic modes and rattling modes leads to a reduction of acoustic phonon lifetimes and thus thermal conductivities. Moreover, we find that the moderate temperature dependence of conductivities above 300 K, which is consistent with experimental measurements, cannot be reproduced by standard perturbation theory calculations, which predict a $T^{-1}$ dependence. Therefore, we conclude that nonperturbative anharmonic effects, including four- and higher-phonon scattering processes, are responsible for the ultralow thermal conductivities of type-I clathrates.</description>

      <title>Deterministic role of chemical bonding in the formation of altermagnetism: Reflection from correlated electron system NiS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00453v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnetism, a new collinear magnetic state, has gained significant attention in the last few years, and the underlying mechanisms driving this quantum phase are still evolving. Going beyond the group theoretical analyses, which focus on providing a binary description of the presence or absence of the altermagnetic state, in this work, we explore the role of crystal chemical bonding. As the latter successfully integrates the crystal and orbital symmetries and is tunable, it provides a quantitative and realistic mechanism to explain the formation of altermagnetism. From the first principles calculations and tight-binding models within the framework of the linear combination of atomic orbitals on NiS, we establish a set of selection rules for the formation of altermagnetism in the NiAs prototype compounds (e.g. CrSb, MnTe, etc.). Broadly, if single orbitals from Ni and S sites are involved in the bonding, the second neighbor interaction between the nonmagnetic atoms is a must to modulate the intra-sublattice interactions differently for the opposite spin sublattices so that the antiferromagnetic sublattice band degeneracy is lifted and momentum-dependent altermagnetic spin split (AMSS) appears. However, when multiple orbitals are involved from the Ni and S sites in the chemical bonding, altermagnetism is naturally present. Together, they amplify the AMSS. Further, we propose twelve antinodal regions in the NiAs type hexagonal crystals, where AMSS split is maximum. Specific to NiS, AMSS increases with correlation, and for the edge valence and conduction bands, it can go beyond 1eV. The present study opens up new pathways to design chemical bonding driven selection rules in addition to the existing crystal symmetry criteria to tailor tunable altermagnetism.</description>

Abstract: Exploring the chemistry of materials at high pressures has lead to the discovery of previously unknown exotic compounds. Here, we systematically search for all thermodynamically stable Sr-C compounds under pressure (up to 100 GPa) using the ab initio evolutionary crystal structure prediction method. Our search lead to the discovery of hitherto unknown phases of SrC3, Sr2C5, Sr2C3, Sr2C, Sr3C2, and SrC. The newly discovered crystal structures feature a variety of different carbon environments ranging from isolated C anions and C-dimers to exotic polyatomic carbon anions including chains, stripes, and infinite ribbons consisting of pentagonal C5 and hexagonal C6 rings. Dynamical stability of all predicted compounds is confirmed by phonons calculations. Bader analysis unravels very diverse chemistry in these compounds and bonding patterns in some of them can be described using Zintl-Klemm rule.</description>

      <title>Mic-hackathon 2024: Hackathon on Machine Learning for Electron and Scanning Probe Microscopy</title>

Abstract: Microscopy is a primary source of information on materials structure and functionality at nanometer and atomic scales. The data generated is often well-structured, enriched with metadata and sample histories, though not always consistent in detail or format. The adoption of Data Management Plans (DMPs) by major funding agencies promotes preservation and access. However, deriving insights remains difficult due to the lack of standardized code ecosystems, benchmarks, and integration strategies. As a result, data usage is inefficient and analysis time is extensive. In addition to post-acquisition analysis, new APIs from major microscope manufacturers enable real-time, ML-based analytics for automated decision-making and ML-agent-controlled microscope operation. Yet, a gap remains between the ML and microscopy communities, limiting the impact of these methods on physics, materials discovery, and optimization. Hackathons help bridge this divide by fostering collaboration between ML researchers and microscopy experts. They encourage the development of novel solutions that apply ML to microscopy, while preparing a future workforce for instrumentation, materials science, and applied ML. This hackathon produced benchmark datasets and digital twins of microscopes to support community growth and standardized workflows.

      <title>A Hierarchical Approach to Quantum Many-Body Systems in Structured Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Open quantum systems that feature non-Markovian dynamics are routinely solved using techniques such as the Hierarchical Equations of Motion (HEOM). However, their usage of the entire system density-matrix renders them intractable for many-body systems. Here, we combine the HEOM with the Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon (BBGKY) hierarchy to achieve a rigorous description of open many-body systems in contact with structured photonic and phononic baths. We first rationalize that this stacked hierarchy accounts for spin-squeezing and superradiant emission despite its applicability to arbitrarily many emitters. The full potential of BBGKY-HEOM is then illustrated for two relevant applications: (i) the explicit treatment of vibrational modes provides access to resonant enhancements in few-emitter lasing, and (ii) the impact of phononic coupling and charge noise on many-body electronic systems embedded in host materials (e.g. molecules in organic crystals) is as relevant as electronic correlation. Our work establishes an accessible, yet rigorous, route between condensed matter and quantum optics, fostering the growth of a new domain at their interface.</description>

      <title>Thermal response functions and second sound in single-layer hexagonal boron nitride</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10649v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ballistic heat transport and second sound propagation in solids is of direct relevance in electronic and energy applications at short length scales and low temperatures. Measurement or calculation of thermal conductivity, which is typically a primary objective, may be of limited usefulness for predicting heat transport which does not follow the heat-diffusion equation. In this paper, molecular-dynamics simulations of hexagonal BN (h-BN) are used to compute thermal response functions from equilibrium correlation functions defined in Fourier space. The response functions are useful for describing the time-dependent transport beyond the usual assumptions of Fourier's law. The results demonstrate that for length scales ~110nm at T=100K second sound should be experimentally observable. At higher temperatures and longer length scales, while second sound may not be directly observable, thermal transport can nevertheless strongly deviate from predictions based on the heat-diffusion equation. Along with classical simulations, we outline a first-principles, many-body theoretical approach for calculation of the response function based on solutions of the Bethe-Salpeter equation. The relevant expressions for heat current clarify the importance of phase coherence within a phonon branch to the observation of second sound. Previous work on one-dimensional chains is also discussed to show that materials characterized by linear dispersion and simple phonon band structure should more readily display second sound.</description>

      <title>Nano-silica based Aqueous Colloidal Gels as Eco-friendly Thixotropic Lubricant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The environmental risks posed by traditional oil and grease-based lubricants can be significantly mitigated by adopting water-based alternatives engineered with superior rheological performance. In this work, we present a fundamentally new and environmentally sustainable aqueous thixotropic colloidal gel of silica nanoparticles formed in the presence of NaCl. We conducted a systematic and detailed investigation of their rheological and tribological characteristics. The tribological performance was evaluated against dry and water-lubricated conditions for steel-steel interface. Our experiments demonstrate that the tribological performance of the formulated nanoparticle gel can be optimized by tuning its rheological properties. A combination of super-low friction and negligible wear was observed. The friction coefficient reduced by up to 97.46% (from 0.63 to 0.016) compared to dry sliding, and by 97.04% (from 0.541 to 0.016) compared to water lubrication. Similarly, the specific wear rate decreased by up to 99.62% and 96.10% under dry conditions and water lubrication respectively. This performance is attributed to a thixotropic, chemically robust gel formed via van der Waals interactions between silica flocs, enabling self-repairing properties, continuous tribo-film formation, and a nano-bearing effect from silica nanoparticles. These attributes enable the gel to maintain and regain its structure during periods of non-shear while also forming a thin film with sufficiently low viscosity to slip into the interfacial contact zone and continuously replenish it with lubricant.</description>
