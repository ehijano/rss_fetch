      <title>The log-open correspondence for two-component Looijenga pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A two-component Looijenga pair is a rational smooth projective surface with an anticanonical divisor consisting of two transversally intersecting curves. We establish an all-genus correspondence between the logarithmic Gromov-Witten theory of a two-component Looijenga pair and open Gromov-Witten theory of a toric Calabi-Yau threefold geometrically engineered from the surface geometry. This settles a conjecture of Bousseau, Brini and van Garrel in the case of two boundary components. We also explain how the correspondence implies BPS integrality for the logarithmic invariants and provides a new means for computing them via the topological vertex method.</description>

      <title>K-Theoretic Donaldson-Thomas Theory of $[\mathbb{C}^2/\mu_r]\times\mathbb{C}$ and Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the equivariant K-theoretic Donaldson--Thomas invariants of $[\mathbb{C}^2/\mu_r]\times \mathbb{C}$ using factorization and rigidity techniques. For this, we develop a generalization of Okounkov's factorization technique that applies to Hilbert schemes of points on orbifolds. We show that the (twisted) virtual structure sheaves of Hilbert schemes of points on orbifolds satisfy the desired factorization property. We prove that the generating series of Euler characteristics of such factorizable systems are the plethystic exponential of a simpler generating series. For $[\mathbb{C}^2/\mu_r]\times \mathbb{C}$, the computation is then completed by a rigidity argument, involving an equivariant modification of Young's combinatorial computation of the corresponding numerical Donaldson-Thomas invariants.</description>

      <title>The Integral Chow Ring of the Stack of Pointed Hyperelliptic Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the integral Chow ring of the stack $\mathcal{H}_{g,n}$ parametrizing $n$-pointed smooth hyperelliptic curves of genus $g$. We compute the integral Chow ring of $\mathcal{H}_{g,n}$ for $n=1,2$ completely, while for $3\leq n\leq2g+2$ we compute it up to the additive order of a single class in degree 2. We obtain partial results also for $n=2g+3$. In particular, taking $g=2$ and recalling that $\mathcal{H}_{2,n}=\mathcal{M}_{2,n}$, our results hold for $\mathrm{CH}^*(\mathcal{M}_{2,n})$ for $1\leq n\leq7$.</description>

      <title>Instantons and multibananas: Relating elliptic genus and cohomological Donaldson-Thomas theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article the cohomological Donaldson-Thomas theory of local multibanana threefolds is computed using Descombes' hyperbolic localisation formula. The resulting expression is precisely given by the elliptic genus of the moduli space of framed instanton sheaves. As part of the proof, an infinite-wedge-space trace formula is computed for the elliptic genus of the moduli space of framed instanton sheaves.</description>

      <title>On the topology of $\mathcal{M}_{0,n+1}/\Sigma_n$ and $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0,n+1}/\Sigma_n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper contains some results about the topology of $\mathcal{M}_{0,n+1}/\Sigma_n$ and $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0,n+1}/\Sigma_n$, where $\mathcal{M}_{0,n+1}$ is the moduli space of genus zero Riemann surfaces with marked points and $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0,n+1}$ is its Deligne-Mumford compactification. We show that $\mathcal{M}_{0,n+1}/\Sigma_n$ and $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0,n+1}/\Sigma_n$ are not topological manifolds for $n\geq 4$, and they are simply connected for any $n\in\mathbb{N}$. We also present some homology computations: for example we show that the homology of $\mathcal{M}_{0,n+1}/\Sigma_n$ is all torsion and that $\mathcal{M}_{0,p+1}/\Sigma_p$ has no $p$ torsion, where $p$ is a prime. Lastly we compute $H_*(\mathcal{M}_{0,n+1}/\Sigma_n;\mathbb{Z})$ for small values of $n$, proving that $\mathcal{M}_{0,n+1}/\Sigma_n$ is contractible for $n\leq 5$ while $\mathcal{M}_{0,7}/\Sigma_6$ is not.</description>

      <title>The integral motivic Satake equivalence for ramified groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct the geometric Satake equivalence for quasi-split reductive groups over nonarchimedean local fields, using \'etale Artin-Tate motives with $\mathbb{Z}[\frac{1}{p}]$-coefficients. We consider local fields of both equal and mixed characteristic. Along the way, we extend the work of Gaussent--Littelmann on the connection between LS galleries and MV cycles to the case of residually split reductive groups. As an application, we generalize Zhu's integral Satake isomorphism for spherical Hecke algebras to ramified groups. Moreover, for residually split groups, we define generic spherical Hecke algebras, and construct generic Satake and Bernstein isomorphisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1910.06917v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: General canonical bundle formula due to Kawamata and others has played fundamental roles in algebraic geometry. We show that the canonical bundle formula has analytic characterization in terms of fiberwise integration, which confirms a folklore conjecture. The proof uses $L^2$ metrics and the valuative equivalence of plurisubharmonic singularities. As an application, we identify the singularity of the Ohsawa measure from a general $L^2$ extension theorem of Demailly for log canonical pairs, in terms of the singularity in Kawamata's subadjunction. As another application, we give a partial answer to a question of Berndtsson on semipositivity theorems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2109.00850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a reductive group, and let $X$ be an algebraic curve over an algebraically closed field $k$ with positive characteristic. We prove a version of nonabelian Hodge correspondence for tame $G$-local systems over $X$ and logarithmic $G$-Higgs bundles over the Frobenius twist $X'$. To obtain a full description of the correspondence for the noncompact case, we introduce the language of parahoric group schemes to establish the correspondence.</description>

      <title>Higher Du Bois and higher rational singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.04729v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the higher direct images $R^qf_*\Omega^p_{\mathcal Y/S}$ of the sheaves of relative K\"ahler differentials are locally free and compatible with arbitrary base change for flat proper families whose fibers have $k$-Du Bois local complete intersection singularities, for $p\leq k$ and all $q\geq 0$, generalizing a result of Du Bois (the case $k=0$). We then propose a definition of $k$-rational singularities extending the definition of rational singularities, and show that, if $X$ is a $k$-rational variety with either isolated or local complete intersection singularities, then $X$ is $k$-Du Bois. As applications, we discuss the behavior of Hodge numbers in families and the unobstructedness of deformations of singular Calabi-Yau varieties.
  In an appendix, Morihiko Saito proves that, in the case of hypersurface singularities, the $k$-rationality definition proposed here is equivalent to a previously given numerical definition for $k$-rational singularities. As an immediate consequence, it follows that for hypersurface singularities, $k$-Du Bois singularities are $(k-1)$-rational. This statement has recently been proved for all local complete intersection singularities by Chen-Dirks-Musta\c{t}\u{a}.</description>

Abstract: We describe the twisted $K$-polynomial of multiplicity-free varieties in a multiprojective setting. More precisely, for multiplicity-free varieties, we show that the support of the twisted $K$-polynomial is a generalized polymatroid. As applications, we show that the support of the M\"obius function of a linear polymatroid is a generalized polymatroid, and we settle a conjecture of Monical, Tokcan and Yong regarding Grothendieck polynomials for the case of zero-one Schubert polynomials.</description>

Abstract: We develop Milne's theory of Lefschetz motives for general adequate equivalence relations and over a not necessarily algebraically closed base field. The corresponding categories turn out to enjoy all properties predicted by standard and less standard conjectures, in a stronger way: algebraic and numerical equivalences agree in this context. We also compute the Tannakian group associated to a Weil cohomology in a different and more conceptual way than Milne's case-by-case approach.</description>

Abstract: The resonance varieties are cohomological invariants that are studied in a variety of topological, combinatorial, and geometric contexts. We discuss their scheme structure in a general algebraic setting and introduce various properties that ensure the reducedness of the associated projective resonance scheme. We prove an asymptotic formula for the Hilbert series of the associated Koszul module, then discuss applications to vector bundles on algebraic curves and to Chen ranks formulas for finitely generated groups, with special emphasis on K\"ahler and right-angled Artin groups.</description>

Abstract: In this short note we develop new methods toward the ultimate goal of classifying geproci sets in $\mathbb P^3$. We apply these methods to show that among sets of $16$ points distributed evenly on $4$ skew lines, up to projective equivalence there are only two distinct geproci sets. We give different geometric distinctions between these sets. The methods we develop here can be applied in a more general set-up; this is the context of the follow-up work arXiv:2308.00761.</description>

Abstract: The Zariski closures of the orbits for representations of type A Dynkin quivers under the action of general linear groups (i.e. quiver loci) exhibit a profound connection with Schubert varieties. In this paper, we present a scheme-theoretical isomorphism between a type A quiver locus and the intersection of an opposite Schubert cell and a Schubert variety, also known as a Kazhdan-Lusztig variety in geometric representation theory. Our results generalize and unify the Zelevinsky maps for equioriented type A quiver loci and bipartite type A quiver loci, as presented respectively by A. V. Zelevinsky in 1985 and by R. Kinser and J. Rajchgot in 2015. Through this isomorphism, we establish a direct and natural connection between type A quiver loci and Schubert varieties. We compute an explicit relationship between Zelevinsky permutations and the indecomposable factors of the corresponding representations. Additionally, we present three applications of our isomorphism with examples in order to justify its further potentials.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we show that a normal affine toric variety X different from the algebraic torus is uniquely determined by its automorphism group in the category of affine irreducible, not necessarily normal, algebraic varieties if and only if X is isomorphic to the product of the affine line and another affine toric variety. In the case where X is the algebraic torus T, we reach the same conclusion if we restrict the category to only include irreducible varieties of dimension at most the dimension of T. There are examples of varieties of dimension one higher than T having the same automorphism group of T. Hence, this last result is optimal.</description>

      <title>Height moduli on cyclotomic stacks and counting elliptic curves over function fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.04450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For proper stacks, unlike schemes, there is a distinction between rational and integral points. Moreover, rational points have extra automorphism groups. We show that these distinctions exactly account for the lower order main terms appearing in precise counts of elliptic curves over function fields, answering a question of Venkatesh in this case. More generally, using the theory of twisted stable maps and the stacky height functions recently introduced by Ellenberg, Zureick-Brown, and the third author, we construct finite type moduli spaces which parametrize rational points of fixed height on a large class of stacks, so-called cyclotomic stacks. The main tool is a correspondence between rational points, twisted maps and weighted linear series. Along the way, we obtain the Northcott property as well as a generalization of Tate's algorithm for cyclotomic stacks, and compute the exact motives of these moduli spaces for weighted projective stacks.</description>

      <title>An Algebraic characterization of the affine three space in arbitrary characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05424v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give an algebraic characterization of the affine $3$-space over an algebraically closed field of arbitrary characteristic. We use this characterization to reformulate the following question. Let $$A=k[X, Y, Z, T]/(XY+Z^{p^e}+T+T^{sp})$$ where $p^e\nmid sp$, $sp\nmid p^e$, $e, s\geq 1$ and $k$ is an algebraically closed field of positive characteristic $p$. Is $A= k^{[3]}$? We prove some results on ML and ML$^*$ invariants and use them to prove a special case of the strong cancellation of $k^{[2]}$.</description>

      <title>Overgroups of exterior powers of an elementary group. Normalizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00101v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish two characterizations of an algebraic group scheme $\bigwedge^m GL_n$ over $\mathbb{Z}$. Geometrically, the scheme $\bigwedge^m GL_n$ is a stabilizer of an explicitly given invariant form or, generally, an invariant ideal of forms. Algebraically, $\bigwedge^m GL_n$ is isomorphic (as a scheme over $\mathbb{Z}$) to a normalizer of the elementary subgroup functor $\bigwedge^m E_n$ and a normalizer of the subscheme $\bigwedge^m SL_n$.
  Our immediate goal is to apply both descriptions in the "sandwich classification" of overgroups of the elementary subgroup. Additionally, the results can be seen as a solution of the linear preserver problem for algebraic group schemes over $\mathbb{Z}$, providing a more functorial description that goes beyond geometry of the classical case over fields.</description>

      <title>Counting $\mathcal{N} = 8$ Black Holes as Algebraic Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04786v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the helicity trace index $B_{14}$ for $\mathcal{N} = 8$ pure D-brane black holes using various techniques of computational algebraic geometry and find perfect agreement with the existing results in the literature. For these black holes, microstate counting is equivalent to finding the number of supersymmetric vacua of a multi-variable supersymmetric quantum mechanics which in turn is equivalent to solving a set of multi-variable polynomial equations with syzygies. We explore four different techniques to solve a set of polynomial equations, namely Newton Polytopes, Homotopy continuation, Monodromy and Hilbert series. Unlike other schemes, these methods are almost exact with a very high success rate for finding all solutions. A gauge invariant analysis is also possible using the symbolic Hilbert series. Furthermore, exploiting various exchange symmetries, we show the non-existence of a quartic and(or) higher order terms in the potential which if present would have spoiled the counting. Incorporating recent developments in mathematics, algorithms and multi-threading, we have extended the scope of one of the author's previous works to other charges and presented a new perspective for the microstate counting problem. This further establishes the pure D-brane system as a consistent model, bringing us a step closer to $\mathcal{N} = 2$ black hole counting.</description>
