      <title>Local subcell monolithic DG/FV convex property preserving scheme on unstructured grids and entropy consideration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article aims at presenting a new local subcell monolithic Discontinuous-Galerkin/Finite-Volume (DG/FV) convex property preserving scheme solving system of conservation laws on 2D unstructured grids. This is known that DG method needs some sort of nonlinear limiting to avoid spurious oscillations or nonlinear instabilities which may lead to the crash of the code. The main idea motivating the present work is to improve the robustness of DG schemes, while preserving as much as possible its high accuracy and very precise subcell resolution. To do so, a convex blending of high-order DG and first-order FV scheme will be locally performed, at the subcell scale, where it is needed. To this end, by means of the theory developed in our previous work, we first recall that it is possible to rewrite DG scheme as a subcell FV scheme on a subgrid provided with some specific numerical fluxes referred to as DG reconstructed fluxes. Then, the monolithic DG/FV method will be defined as following: each face of each subcell will be assigned with two fluxes, a 1st-order FV one and a high-order reconstructed one, that in the end will be blended in a convex way. The goal is then to determine, through analysis, optimal blending coefficients to achieve the desire properties. Numerical results on various type problems will be presented to assess the very good performance of the design method. A particular emphasis will be put on entropy consideration. By means of this subcell monolithic framework, we will attempt to address the following questions: is this possible through this monolithic framework to ensure any entropy stability? what do we mean by entropy stability? What is the cost of such constraints? Is this absolutely needed while aiming for high-order accuracy?</description>

      <title>Polynomial histopolation on mock-Chebyshev segments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In computational practice, we often encounter situations where only measurements at equally spaced points are available. Using standard polynomial interpolation in such cases can lead to highly inaccurate results due to numerical ill-conditioning of the problem. Several techniques have been developed to mitigate this issue, such as the mock-Chebyshev subset interpolation and the constrained mock-Chebyshev least-squares approximation. The high accuracy and the numerical stability achieved by these techniques motivate us to extend these methods to histopolation, a polynomial interpolation method based on segmental function averages.
  While classical polynomial interpolation relies on function evaluations at specific nodes, histopolation leverages averages of the function over subintervals. In this work, we introduce three types of mock-Chebyshev approaches for segmental interpolation and theoretically analyse the stability of their Lebesgue constants, which measure the numerical conditioning of the histopolation problem under small perturbations of the segments. We demonstrate that these segmental mock-Chebyshev approaches yield a quasi-optimal logarithmic growth of the Lebesgue constant in relevant scenarios. Additionally, we compare the performance of these new approximation techniques through various numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Solving Partial Differential Equations on Evolving Surfaces via the Constrained Least-Squares and Grid-Based Particle Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a framework for solving partial different equations on evolving surfaces. Based on the grid-based particle method (GBPM) [18], the method can naturally resample the surface even under large deformation from the motion law. We introduce a new component in the local reconstruction step of the algorithm and demonstrate numerically that the modification can improve computational accuracy when a large curvature region is developed during evolution. The method also incorporates a recently developed constrained least-squares ghost sample points (CLS-GSP) formulation, which can lead to a better-conditioned discretized matrix for computing some surface differential operators. The proposed framework can incorporate many methods and link various approaches to the same problem. Several numerical experiments are carried out to show the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>A C^s-smooth mixed degree and regularity isogeometric spline space over planar multi-patch domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct over a given bilinear multi-patch domain a novel $C^s$-smooth mixed degree and regularity isogeometric spline space, which possesses the degree $p=2s+1$ and regularity $r=s$ in a small neighborhood around the edges and vertices, and the degree $\widetilde{p} \leq p$ with regularity $\widetilde{r} = \widetilde{p}-1 \geq r$ in all other parts of the domain. Our proposed approach relies on the technique [35], which requires for the $C^s$-smooth isogeometric spline space a degree at least $p=2s+1$ on the entire multi-patch domain. Similar to [35], the $C^s$-smooth mixed degree and regularity spline space is generated as the span of basis functions that correspond to the individual patches, edges and vertices of the domain. The reduction of degrees of freedom for the functions in the interior of the patches is achieved by introducing an appropriate mixed degree and regularity underlying spline space over $[0,1]^2$ to define the functions on the single patches. We further extend our construction with a few examples to the class of bilinear-like $G^s$ multi-patch parameterizations [33,35], which enables the design of multi-patch domains having curved boundaries and interfaces. Finally, the great potential of the $C^s$-smooth mixed degree and regularity isogeometric spline space for performing isogeometric analysis is demonstrated by several numerical examples of solving two particular high order partial differential equations, namely the biharmonic and triharmonic equation, via the isogeometric Galerkin method.</description>

      <title>Computing asymptotic eigenvectors and eigenvalues of perturbed symmetric matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a perturbed matrix can be remarkably difficult when the unperturbed matrix has repeated eigenvalues. In this work we show how the limiting eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a symmetric  matrix $K(\varepsilon)$ as $\varepsilon \to 0$ can be obtained relatively easily from successive Schur complements, provided that the entries scale in different orders of $\varepsilon$. If the matrix does not directly exhibit this structure, we show that putting the matrix into a ``generalised kernel form'' can be very informative. The resulting formulas are much simpler than classical expressions obtained from complex integrals involving the resolvent.  We apply our results to the problem of computing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of kernel matrices in the ``flat limit'', a problem that appears in many applications in statistics and approximation theory. In particular, we prove a conjecture from [SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl., 2021, 42(1):17--57]  which connects the eigenvectors of kernel matrices to multivariate orthogonal polynomials.</description>

      <title>A Coupled Diffusion Approximation for Spatiotemporal Hemodynamic Response and Deoxygenated Blood Volume Fraction in Microcirculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background and Objective: This article concerns a diffusion-based mathematical model for analyzing blood flow and oxygen transport within the capillaries, emphasizing its significance in understanding the physiological and biochemical dynamics of the cerebrovascular system and brain tissue. The focus of this study is, in particular, on neurovascular coupling and the spatiotemporal aspects of blood flow and oxygen transport in microcirculation. Methods: By adopting a coupled modelling approach that integrates the hemodynamic response function (HRF) with Fick's law and the Navier-Stokes equations (NSEs), we provide a computational framework for the diffusion-driven transport of deoxygenated and total blood volume fractions (DBV and TBV), essential for understanding blood oxygenation level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) applications. Results: The applicability of the model is further demonstrated through numerical experiments utilizing a 7 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dataset for head segmentation, which facilitates the differentiation of arterial blood vessels and various brain tissue compartments. By simulating hemodynamical responses and analyzing their impact on volumetric DBV and TBV, this study offers valuable insights into spatiotemporal modelling of brain tissue and blood flow. Conclusions: By integrating spatiotemporal modelling within a realistic head model derived from high-resolution 7 Tesla-MRI, we analyze the complex interplay between blood flow, oxygen transport, and brain tissue dynamics. This inclusion of a realistic head model not only enriches the accuracy of our simulations but is also beneficial for understanding the physiological and hemodynamic responses within the human brain.</description>

      <title>Universal Approximation of Dynamical Systems by Semi-Autonomous Neural ODEs and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17092v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce semi-autonomous neural ordinary differential equations (SA-NODEs), a variation of the vanilla NODEs, employing fewer parameters. We investigate the universal approximation properties of SA-NODEs for dynamical systems from both a theoretical and a numerical perspective. Within the assumption of a finite-time horizon, under general hypotheses we establish an asymptotic approximation result, demonstrating that the error vanishes as the number of parameters goes to infinity. Under additional regularity assumptions, we further specify this convergence rate in relation to the number of parameters, utilizing quantitative approximation results in the Barron space. Based on the previous result, we prove an approximation rate for transport equations by their neural counterparts. Our numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of SA-NODEs in capturing the dynamics of various ODE systems and transport equations. Additionally, we compare SA-NODEs with vanilla NODEs, highlighting the superior performance and reduced complexity of our approach.</description>

      <title>Multiscale modeling for a class of high-contrast heterogeneous sign-changing problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mathematical formulation of sign-changing problems involves a linear second-order partial differential equation in the divergence form, where the coefficient can assume positive and negative values in different subdomains. These problems find their physical background in negative-index metamaterials, either as inclusions embedded into common materials as the matrix or vice versa. In this paper, we propose a numerical method based on the constraint energy minimizing generalized multiscale finite element method (CEM-GMsFEM) specifically designed for sign-changing problems. The construction of auxiliary spaces in the original CEM-GMsFEM is tailored to accommodate the sign-changing setting. The numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in handling sophisticated coefficient profiles and the robustness of coefficient contrast ratios. Under several technical assumptions and by applying the \texttt{T}-coercivity theory, we establish the inf-sup stability and provide an a priori error estimate for the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Pointwise error bounds in POD methods without difference quotients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) methods that do not include difference quotients (DQs) of snapshots in the data set. The inclusion of DQs have been shown in the literature to be a key element in obtaining error bounds that do not degrade with the number of snapshots. More recently, the inclusion of DQs has allowed to obtain pointwise (as opposed to averaged) error bounds that decay with the same convergence rate (in terms of the POD singular values) as averaged ones. In the present paper, for POD methods not including DQs in their data set, we obtain error bounds that do not degrade with the number of snapshots if the function from where the snapshots are taken has certain degree of smoothness. Moreover, the rate of convergence is as close as that of methods including DQs as the smoothness of the function providing the snapshots allows. We do this by obtaining discrete counterparts of Agmon and interpolation inequalities in Sobolev spaces. Numerical experiments validating these estimates are also presented.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Reduced Order Modelling on Parametric and Data driven domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) are extensively utilized for modeling various physical phenomena. These equations often depend on certain parameters, necessitating either the identification of optimal parameters or solving the equation across multiple parameters to understand how a structure might react under different conditions. Performing an exhaustive search over the parameter space requires solving the PDE multiple times, which is generally impractical. To address this challenge, Reduced Order Models (ROMs) are constructed from a snapshot dataset comprising parameter-solution pairs. ROMs facilitate the rapid solving of PDEs for new parameters.
  Recently, Deep Learning ROMs (DL-ROMs) have been introduced as a new method to obtain ROM. Additionally, the PDE of interest may depend on the domain, which can be characterized by parameters or measurements and may evolve with the system, requiring parametrization for ROM construction. In this paper, we develop a Deep-ROM capable of extracting and efficiently utilizing domain parametrization. Unlike traditional domain parametrization methods, our approach does not require user-defined control points and can effectively handle domains with varying numbers of components. Moreover, our model can derive meaningful parametrization even when a domain mesh is unavailable, a common scenario in biomedical applications. Our work leverages Deep Neural Networks to effectively reduce the dimensionality of the PDE and the domain characteristic function.</description>

      <title>Applications of Dual Complex Adjoint Matrix in Eigenvalue Computation of Dual Quaternion Hermitian Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dual quaternions and dual quaternion matrices have found widespread applications in robotic research, with their spectral theory been extensively studied in recent years. This paper delves into the realm of eigenvalue computation and related problems specific to dual quaternion Hermitian matrices. We establish the connection between dual quaternion matrices and their dual complex adjoint matrices, concerning eigenvalue problems and matrix rank-k approximations. By integrating the dual complex adjoint matrix, we refine the power method for eigenvalue computation for dual quaternion Hermitian matrices, achieving greater numerical efficiency. Furthermore, leveraging the eigen-decomposition of dual complex adjoint matrices, we introduce a novel approach for calculating all eigenpairs of dual quaternion Hermitian matrices. This method surpasses the power method in terms of accuracy and speed and addresses its limitations, as exemplified by its application to the eigenvalue computation of Laplacian matrices, where our algorithm demonstrates significant advantages. Additionally, we apply the improved power method and optimal rank-k approximations to pose graph optimization problem, enhancing efficiency and success rates, especially under low observation conditions.</description>

      <title>A New Scalar Auxiliary Variable Approach for Gradient Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17258v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) approach is a highly efficient method widely used for solving gradient flow systems. This approach offers several advantages, including linearity, unconditional energy stability, and ease of implementation. By introducing scalar auxiliary variables, a modified system that is equivalent to the original system is constructed at the continuous level. However, during temporal discretization, computational errors can lead to a loss of equivalence and accuracy. In this paper, we introduce a new Constant Scalar Auxiliary Variable (CSAV) approach in which we derive an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) for the constant scalar auxiliary variable r. We also introduce a stabilization parameter ({\alpha}) to improve the stability of the scheme by slowing down the dynamics of r. The CSAV approach provides additional benefits as well. We explicitly discretize the auxiliary variable in combination with the nonlinear term, enabling the solution of a single linear system with constant coefficients at each time step. This new approach also eliminates the need for assumptions about the free energy potential, removing the bounded-from-below restriction imposed by the nonlinear free energy potential in the original SAV approach. Finally, we validate the proposed method through extensive numerical simulations, demonstrating its effectiveness and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Harmonic maps from post-critically finite fractals to the circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Every continuous map between two compact Riemannian manifolds is homotopic to a harmonic map (HM). We show that a similar situation holds for continuous maps between a post-critically finite (p.c.f.) fractal and a circle. Specifically, we provide a geometric proof of Strichartz's theorem stating that for a given degree and appropriate boundary conditions there is a unique HM from the Sierpinski Gasket (SG) to a circle. Furthermore, we extend this result to HMs on p.c.f. fractals.
  Our method uses covering spaces for the SG, which are constructed separately for HMs of a given degree, thus capturing the topology intrinsic to each homotopy class. After lifting continuous functions on the SG with values in the unit circle to continuous real-valued functions on the covering space, we use the harmonic extension algorithm to obtain a harmonic function on the covering space. The desired HM is obtained by restricting the domain of the resultant harmonic function to the fundamental domain and projecting the range to the circle.
  We show that with suitable modifications the method applies to p.c.f. fractals, a large class of self-similar domains. We illustrate our method of constructing the HMs using numerical examples of HMs from the SG to the circle and discuss the construction of the covering spaces for several representative p.c.f. fractals, including the 3-level SG, the hexagasket, and the pentagasket.</description>

      <title>How Can Deep Neural Networks Fail Even With Global Optima?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fully connected deep neural networks are successfully applied to classification and function approximation problems. By minimizing the cost function, i.e., finding the proper weights and biases, models can be built for accurate predictions. The ideal optimization process can achieve global optima. However, do global optima always perform well? If not, how bad can it be? In this work, we aim to: 1) extend the expressive power of shallow neural networks to networks of any depth using a simple trick, 2) construct extremely overfitting deep neural networks that, despite having global optima, still fail to perform well on classification and function approximation problems. Different types of activation functions are considered, including ReLU, Parametric ReLU, and Sigmoid functions. Extensive theoretical analysis has been conducted, ranging from one-dimensional models to models of any dimensionality. Numerical results illustrate our theoretical findings.</description>

Abstract: Cardiac digital twins (CDTs) of human cardiac electrophysiology (EP) are digital replicas of patient hearts that match like-for-like clinical observations. The electrocardiogram (ECG), as the most prevalent non-invasive observation of cardiac electrophysiology, is considered an ideal target for CDT calibration. Recent advanced CDT calibration methods have demonstrated their ability to minimize discrepancies between simulated and measured ECG signals, effectively replicating all key morphological features relevant to diagnostics. However, due to the inherent nature of clinical data acquisition and CDT model generation pipelines, discrepancies inevitably arise between the real physical electrophysiology in a patient and the simulated virtual electrophysiology in a CDT. In this study, we aim to qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the impact of these uncertainties on ECG morphology and diagnostic markers. We analyze residual beat-to-beat variability in ECG recordings obtained from healthy subjects and patients. Using a biophysically detailed and anatomically accurate computational model of whole-heart electrophysiology combined with a detailed torso model calibrated to closely replicate measured ECG signals, we vary anatomical factors (heart location, orientation, size), heterogeneity in electrical conductivities in the heart and torso, and electrode placements across ECG leads to assess their qualitative impact on ECG morphology. Our study demonstrates that diagnostically relevant ECG features and overall morphology appear relatively robust against the investigated uncertainties. This resilience is consistent with the narrow distribution of ECG due to residual beat-to-beat variability observed in both healthy subjects and patients.</description>

      <title>High order approximations of the log-Heston process semigroup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present weak approximations schemes of any order for the Heston model that are obtained by using the method developed by Alfonsi and Bally (2021). This method consists in combining approximation schemes calculated on different random grids to increase the order of convergence. We apply this method with either the Ninomiya-Victoir scheme (2008) or a second-order scheme that samples exactly the volatility component, and we show rigorously that we can achieve then any order of convergence. We give numerical illustrations on financial examples that validate the theoretical order of convergence, and present also promising numerical results for the multifactor/rough Heston model.</description>

      <title>Pathwise Uniform Convergence of Time Discretisation Schemes for SPDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.00411v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove convergence rates for time discretisation schemes for semi-linear stochastic evolution equations with additive or multiplicative Gaussian noise, where the leading operator $A$ is the generator of a strongly continuous semigroup $S$ on a Hilbert space $X$, and the focus is on non-parabolic problems. The main results are optimal bounds for the uniform strong error $$\mathrm{E}_{k}^{\infty} := \Big(\mathbb{E} \sup_{j\in \{0, \ldots, N_k\}} \|U(t_j) - U^j\|^p\Big)^{1/p},$$ where $p \in [2,\infty)$, $U$ is the mild solution, $U^j$ is obtained from a time discretisation scheme, $k$ is the step size, and $N_k = T/k$. The usual schemes such as the exponential Euler, the implicit Euler, and the Crank-Nicolson method, etc. are included as special cases. Under conditions on the nonlinearity and the noise, we show
  - $\mathrm{E}_{k}^{\infty}\lesssim k \sqrt{\log(T/k)}$ (linear equation, additive noise, general $S$);
  - $\mathrm{E}_{k}^{\infty}\lesssim \sqrt{k} \sqrt{\log(T/k)}$ (nonlinear equation, multiplicative noise, contractive $S$);
  - $\mathrm{E}_{k}^{\infty}\lesssim k \sqrt{\log(T/k)}$ (nonlinear wave equation, multiplicative noise)
  for a large class of time discretisation schemes. The logarithmic factor can be removed if the exponential Euler method is used with a (quasi)-contractive $S$. The obtained bounds coincide with the optimal bounds for SDEs. Most of the existing literature is concerned with bounds for the simpler pointwise strong error $$\mathrm{E}_k:=\bigg(\sup_{j\in \{0,\ldots,N_k\}}\mathbb{E} \|U(t_j) - U^{j}\|^p\bigg)^{1/p}.$$ Applications to Maxwell equations, Schr\"odinger equations, and wave equations are included. For these equations, our results improve and reprove several existing results with a unified method and provide the first results known for the implicit Euler and the Crank-Nicolson method.</description>

      <title>Localization of point scatterers via sparse optimization on measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00737v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the inverse scattering problem for time-harmonic acoustic waves in a medium with pointwise inhomogeneities. In the Foldy-Lax model, the estimation of the scatterers' locations and intensities from far field measurements can be recast as the recovery of a discrete measure from nonlinear observations. We propose a "linearize and locally optimize" approach to perform this reconstruction. We first solve a convex program in the space of measures (known as the Beurling LASSO), which involves a linearization of the forward operator (the far field pattern in the Born approximation). Then, we locally minimize a second functional involving the nonlinear forward map, using the output of the first step as initialization. We provide guarantees that the output of the first step is close to the sought-after measure when the scatterers have small intensities and are sufficiently separated. We also provide numerical evidence that the second step still allows for accurate recovery in settings that are more involved.</description>

      <title>Stochastic theta methods for free stochastic differential equations</title>

Abstract: We introduce free probability analogues of the stochastic theta methods for free stochastic differential equations in this work. Under some mild conditions, we prove the strong convergence and exponential stability in mean square of the numerical methods. The free stochastic theta method with $\theta=1$ can inherit the exponential stability of original equations for any given step size. Our method offers better stability and efficiency than the free Euler-Maruyama method. Moreover, numerical results are reported to confirm these theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Fast randomized least-squares solvers can be just as accurate and stable as classical direct solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the greatest success stories of randomized algorithms for linear algebra has been the development of fast, randomized algorithms for highly overdetermined linear least-squares problems. However, none of the existing algorithms is backward stable, preventing them from being deployed as drop-in replacements for existing QR-based solvers. This paper introduces sketch-and-precondition with iterative refinement (SPIR) and FOSSILS, two provably backward stable randomized least-squares solvers. SPIR and FOSSILS combine iterative refinement with a preconditioned iterative method applied to the normal equations and converge at the same rate as existing randomized least-squares solvers. This work offers the promise of incorporating randomized least-squares solvers into existing software libraries while maintaining the same level of accuracy and stability as classical solvers.</description>

      <title>A Note on Generalized Locally Toeplitz Operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalized Locally Toeplitz (GLT) matrix sequences arise from large linear systems that approximate Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), Fractional Differential Equations (FDEs), and Integro-Differential Equations (IDEs). GLT sequences of matrices have been developed to study the spectral/singular value behaviour of the numerical approximations to various PDEs, Fades and IDEs. These approximations can be achieved using any discretization method on appropriate grids through local techniques such as Finite Differences, Finite Elements, Finite Volumes, Isogeometric Analysis, and Discontinuous Galerkin methods. Spectral and singular value symbols are essential for analyzing the eigenvalue and singular value distributions of matrix sequences in the Weyl sense. In this article, we provide a comprehensive overview of the operator-theoretic aspect of GLT sequences. The theory of GLT sequences, along with findings on the asymptotic spectral distribution of perturbed matrix sequences, is a highly effective and successful method for calculating the spectral symbol f. Therefore, developing an automatic procedure to compute the spectral symbols of these matrix sequences would be advantageous, a task that Ahmed Ratnani, N S Sarathkumar, S. Serra-Capizzano have partially undertaken. As an application of the theory developed here, we propose an automatic procedure for computing the symbol of the underlying sequences of matrices, assuming they form a GLT sequence that meets mild conditions.</description>

      <title>Shortest-path recovery from signature with an optimal control approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10619v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the signature-to-path reconstruction problem from the control theoretic perspective. Namely, we design an optimal control problem whose solution leads to the minimal-length path that generates a given signature. In order to do that, we minimize a cost functional consisting of two competing terms, i.e., a weighted final-time cost combined with the $L^2$-norm squared of the controls. Moreover, we can show that, by taking the limit to infinity of the parameter that tunes the final-time cost, the problem $\Gamma$-converges to the problem of finding a sub-Riemannian geodesic connecting two signatures. Finally, we provide an alternative reformulation of the latter problem, which is particularly suitable for the numerical implementation.</description>
