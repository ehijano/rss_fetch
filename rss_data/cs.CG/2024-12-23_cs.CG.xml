      <title>Tracking the Persistence of Harmonic Chains: Barcode and Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The persistence barcode is a topological descriptor of data that plays a fundamental role in topological data analysis. Given a filtration of data, the persistence barcode tracks the evolution of its homology groups. In this paper, we introduce a new type of barcode, called the harmonic chain barcode, which tracks the evolution of harmonic chains. In addition, we show that the harmonic chain barcode is stable. Given a filtration of a simplicial complex of size $m$, we present an algorithm to compute its harmonic chain barcode in $O(m^3)$ time. Consequently, the harmonic chain barcode can enrich the family of topological descriptors in applications where a persistence barcode is applicable, such as feature vectorization and machine learning.</description>

      <title>The Analytic Arc Cover Problem and its Applications to Contiguous Art Gallery, Polygon Separation, and Shape Carving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show the following problems are in $\textsf{P}$:
  1. The contiguous art gallery problem -- a variation of the art gallery problem where each guard can protect a contiguous interval along the boundary of a simple polygon. This was posed at the open problem session at CCCG '24 by Thomas C. Shermer.
  2. The polygon separation problem for line segments -- For two sets of line segments $S_1$ and $S_2$, find a minimum-vertex convex polygon $P$ that completely contains $S_1$ and does not contain or cross any segment of $S_2$.
  3. Minimizing the number of half-plane cuts to carve a 3D polytope.
  To accomplish this, we study the analytic arc cover problem -- an interval set cover problem over the unit circle with infinitely many implicitly-defined arcs, given by a function.</description>

      <title>Robust and Feature-Preserving Offset Meshing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel offset meshing approach that can robustly handle a 3D surface mesh with an arbitrary geometry and topology configurations, while nicely capturing the sharp features on the original input for both inward and outward offsets. Compared to the existing approaches focusing on constant-radius offset, to the best of our knowledge, we propose the first-ever solution for mitered offset that can well preserve sharp features. Our method is designed based on several core principals: 1) explicitly generating the offset vertices and triangles with feature-capturing energy and constraints; 2) prioritizing the generation of the offset geometry before establishing its connectivity, 3) employing exact algorithms in critical pipeline steps for robustness, balancing the use of floating-point computations for efficiency, 4) applying various conservative speed up strategies including early reject non-contributing computations to the final output. Our approach further uniquely supports variable offset distances on input surface elements, offering a wider range practical applications compared to conventional methods.
  We have evaluated our method on a subset of Thinkgi10K, containing models with diverse topological and geometric complexities created by practitioners in various fields. Our results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over current state-of-the-art methods in terms of element count, feature preservation, and non-uniform offset distances of the resulting offset mesh surfaces, marking a significant advancement in the field.</description>

      <title>An efficient algorithm for identifying rainbow ortho-convex 4-sets in k-colored point sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $P$ be a $k$-colored set of $n$ points in the plane, $4 \leq k \leq n$. We study the problem of deciding if $P$ contains a subset of four points of different colors such that its Rectilinear Convex Hull has positive area. We show this problem to be equivalent to deciding if there exists a point $c$ in the plane such that each of the open quadrants defined by $c$ contains a point of $P$, each of them having a different color. We provide an $O(n \log n)$-time algorithm for this problem, where the hidden constant does not depend on $k$; then, we prove that this problem has time complexity $\Omega(n \log n)$ in the algebraic computation tree model. No general position assumptions for $P$ are required.</description>

      <title>Fast and Robust Hexahedral Mesh Optimization via Augmented Lagrangian, L-BFGS, and Line Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new software package, ``HexOpt,'' for improving the quality of all-hexahedral (all-hex) meshes by maximizing the minimum mixed scaled Jacobian-Jacobian energy functional, and projecting the surface points of the all-hex meshes onto the input triangular mesh. The proposed HexOpt method takes as input a surface triangular mesh and a volumetric all-hex mesh. A constrained optimization problem is formulated to improve mesh quality using a novel function that combines Jacobian and scaled Jacobian metrics which are rectified and scaled to quadratic measures, while preserving the surface geometry. This optimization problem is solved using the augmented Lagrangian (AL) method, where the Lagrangian terms enforce the constraint that surface points must remain on the triangular mesh. Specifically, corner points stay exactly at the corner, edge points are confined to the edges, and face points are free to move across the surface. To take the advantage of the Quasi-Newton method while tackling the high-dimensional variable problem, the Limited-Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (L-BFGS) algorithm is employed. The step size for each iteration is determined by the Armijo line search. Coupled with smart Laplacian smoothing, HexOpt has demonstrated robustness and efficiency, successfully applying to 3D models and hex meshes generated by different methods without requiring any manual intervention or parameter adjustment.</description>
