      <title>Interacting Streams of Cognitive Active Agents in a Three-Way Intersection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergent collective motion of active agents - in particular pedestrians - at a three-way intersection is studied by Langevin simulations of cognitive intelligent active Brownian particles (iABPs) with directed visual perception and self-steering avoidance. Depending on the maneuverability $\Omega$, the goal fixation $K$, and the vision angle $\psi$, different types of pedestrian motion emerge. At intermediate relative maneuverability $\Delta = \Omega/K$ and large $\psi$, pedestrians have noisy trajectories due to multiple scattering events as they encounter other pedestrians in their field of view. For $\psi = \pi$ and large relative maneuverability $\Delta$, an effectively jammed state is found, which belongs to the percolation universality class. For small $\psi$, agents exhibit localised clustering and flocking, while for intermediate $\psi$ self-organized rotational flows can emerge. The analysis of mean squared displacement and velocity auto-correlation of the agents reveals that the motion is well described by fractional Brownian Motion with positively correlated noise. Finally, despite the rich variety of collective behaviour, the fundamental flow diagram for the three-way-crossing setup shows a universal curve for the different vision angles. Our research provides valuable insights into the importance of vision angle and self-steering avoidance on pedestrian dynamics in semi-dense crowds.</description>

      <title>Weak (non)conservation and stochastic dynamics of angular momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Angular momentum conservation influences equilibrium statistical mechanics, leading to a generalized microcanonical density for an isolated system and a generalized Gibbs density for a weakly coupled system. We study the stochastic decay of angular momentum due to weakly imperfect rotational symmetry of the external potential that confines the isolated many-particle system. We present a mesoscopic description of the system, deriving Langevin and Fokker-Planck equations, which are consistent with equilibrium statistical mechanics when rotational symmetry is maintained. When the symmetry is weakly violated, we formulate a coarse-grained stochastic differential equation governing the decay of total angular momentum over time. To validate our analytical predictions, we conduct numerical simulations of the microcanonical ensemble, an isolated system undergoing thermalization due to weak two-body interactions. Our coarse-grained Langevin equation accurately characterizes both the decay of the angular momentum and its fluctuations in a steady state. Furthermore, we estimate the parameters of our mesoscopic model directly from simulations, providing insights into the dissipative phenomenological coefficients, such as friction. More generally, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of the behavior of the integrals of motion when the corresponding symmetry is weakly violated.</description>

      <title>Survival probability and position distribution of a run and tumble particle in $U(x)=\alpha |x|$ potential with an absorbing boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the late time exponential decay of the survival probability $S_\pm(t,a|x_0)\sim e^{-\theta(a)t}$, of a one-dimensional run and tumble particle starting from $x_0&lt;a$ with an initial orientation $\sigma(0)=\pm 1$, under a confining potential $U(x)=\alpha|x|$ with an absorbing boundary at $x=a&gt;0$. We find that the decay rate $\theta(a)$ of the survival probability has strong dependence on the location $a$ of the absorbing boundary, which undergoes a freezing transition at a critical value $a=a_c=(v_0-\alpha)\sqrt{v_0^2-\alpha^2}/(2\alpha\gamma)$, where $v_0&gt;\alpha$ is the self-propulsion speed and $\gamma$ is the tumbling rate of the particle. For $a&gt;a_c$, the value of $\theta(a)$ increases monotonically from zero, as $a$ decreases from infinity, till it attains the maximum value $\theta(a_c)$ at $a=a_c$. For $0&lt;a&lt;a_c$, the value of $\theta(a)$ freezes to the value $\theta(a)=\theta(a_c)$. We also obtain the propagator with the absorbing boundary condition at $x=a$. Our analytical results are supported by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Modeling public opinion control by a charismatic leader</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the average long-time behavior of the binary opinions of a social group with peer-to-peer interactions under the influence of an external bias and a persuadable leader, a strongly-biased agent with a dynamic opinion with the intention of spreading it across the system. We use a generalized, fully-connected Ising model, with each spin representing the binary opinion of an agent at a given time and a single, super spin representing the opinion of the leader. External fields and interaction constants model the opinion bias and peer-to-peer interactions, respectively, while the temperature $T$ models an idealized social climate, representing an authoritarian regime if $T$ is low or a liberal one if $T$ is high. We derive a mean-field solution for the average magnetization $m$, the "social mood", and investigate how $m$ and the super spin magnetization vary as a function of $T$. We find that, depending on the initial conditions, due to the presence of metastable states, the sign of the average magnetization depends on the temperature. Finally, we verify that this effect is also present even if we consider only nearest-neighbor interactions within the social group.</description>

      <title>Hilbert Space Diffusion in Systems with Approximate Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random matrix theory (RMT) universality is the defining property of quantum mechanical chaotic systems, and can be probed by observables like the spectral form factor (SFF). In this paper, we describe systematic deviations from RMT behaviour at intermediate time scales in systems with approximate symmetries. At early times, the symmetries allow us to organize the Hilbert space into approximately decoupled sectors, each of which contributes independently to the SFF. At late times, the SFF transitions into the final ramp of the fully mixed chaotic Hamiltonian. For approximate continuous symmetries, the transitional behaviour is governed by a universal process that we call Hilbert space diffusion. The diffusion constant corresponding to this process is related to the relaxation rate of the associated nearly conserved charge. By implementing a chaotic sigma model for Hilbert-space diffusion, we formulate an analytic theory of this process which agrees quantitatively with our numerical results for different examples.</description>

      <title>Multigraph reconstruction via nonlinear random walk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the last few years, network science has proved to be useful in modeling a variety of complex systems, composed of a large number of interconnected units. The intricate pattern of interactions often allows the system to achieve complex tasks, such as synchronization or collective motions. In this regard, the interplay between network structure and dynamics has long been recognized as a cornerstone of network science. Among dynamical processes, random walks are undoubtedly among the most studied stochastic processes. While traditionally, the random walkers are assumed to be independent, this assumption breaks down if nodes are endowed with a finite carrying capacity, a feature shared by many real-life systems. Recently, a class of nonlinear diffusion processes accounting for the finite carrying capacities of the nodes was introduced. The stationary nodes densities were shown to be nonlinearly correlated with the nodes degrees, allowing to uncover the network structure by performing a few measurements of the stationary density at the level of a single arbitrary node and by solving an inverse problem. In this work, we extend this class of nonlinear diffusion processes to the case of multigraphs, in which links between nodes carry distinct attributes. Assuming the knowledge of the pattern of interactions associated with one type of links, we show how the degree distribution of the whole multigraph can be reconstructed. The effectiveness of the reconstruction algorithm is demonstrated through simulations on various multigraph topologies.</description>

      <title>Computing the thermal transport coefficient of neutral amorphous polymers using exact vibrational density of states: Comparison with experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal transport coefficient $\kappa$ is an important property that often dictates broad applications of a polymeric material, while at the same time its computation remains challenging. In particular, classical simulations overestimate $\kappa$ than the experimentally measured $\kappa^{\rm exp}$ and thus hinder their meaningful comparison. This is even when very careful simulations are performed using the most accurate empirical potentials. A key reason for such a discrepancy is because polymers have quantum--mechanical, nuclear degrees--of--freedom whose contribution to the heat balance is non--trivial. In this work, two semi--analytical approaches are considered to accurately compute $\kappa$ by using the exact vibrational density of states $g(\nu)$. The first approach is based within the framework of the minimum thermal conductivity model, while the second uses computed quantum heat capacity to scale $\kappa$. Computed $\kappa$ of a set of commodity polymers compares quantitatively with $\kappa^{\rm exp}$.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions in debt recycling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Debt recycling is an aggressive equity extraction strategy that potentially permits faster repayment of a mortgage. While equity progressively builds up as the mortgage is repaid monthly, mortgage holders may obtain another loan they could use to invest on a risky asset. The wealth produced by a successful investment is then used to repay the mortgage faster. The strategy is riskier than a standard repayment plan since fluctuations in the house market and investment's volatility may also lead to a fast default, as both the mortgage and the liquidity loan are secured against the same good. The general conditions of the mortgage holder and the outside market under which debt recycling may be recommended or discouraged have not been fully investigated. In this paper, to evaluate the effectiveness of traditional monthly mortgage repayment versus debt recycling strategies, we build a dynamical model of debt recycling and study the time evolution of equity and mortgage balance as a function of loan-to-value ratio, house market performance, and return of the risky investment. We find that the model has a rich behavior as a function of its main parameters, showing strongly and weakly successful phases - where the mortgage is eventually repaid faster and slower than the standard monthly repayment strategy, respectively - a default phase where the equity locked in the house vanishes before the mortgage is repaid, signalling a failure of the debt recycling strategy, and a permanent re-mortgaging phase - where further investment funds from the lender are continuously secured, but the mortgage is never fully repaid. The strategy's effectiveness is found to be highly sensitive to the initial mortgage-to-equity ratio, the monthly amount of scheduled repayments, and the economic parameters at the outset. The analytical results are corroborated with numerical simulations with excellent agreement.</description>

      <title>Efficiency fluctuations of a heat engine with noise induced quantum coherences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the efficiency fluctuations of a coherent quantum heat engine coupled to a unimodal cavity using a standard full-counting statistics procedure. The engine's most likely efficiency obtained by computing the large-deviation function corresponds to the quantum efficiency obtained by defining a useful work obtainable from a steady-state fluctuation theorem. The most likely efficiency is independent of the noise induced coherences. The ratio between coherent and incoherent efficiency cumulants is found to be constant and independent of the stochastic efficiency, which we prove analytically. We also numerically demonstrate that treating the efficiency as a stochastic variable allows the enhancement of constancy only in the presence of coherences. At the engine's most likely efficiency, there is no suppression of the second efficiency cumulant leading to a robust constancy. We also report the existence of a lower bound on the second efficiency cumulant.</description>

      <title>Quantum Tunneling Could Enable Proton Transfer Reactions on Titan</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The surface of Titan, Saturn's largest moon, is rich in organics and is often suggested to model early Earth environments. Titan's surface is cold, at a temperature of approximately 90 K, which prohibits most thermally activated chemical reactions. However, quantum effects become more important at low temperatures and reactions that are classically prohibited can often proceed through quantum mechanical pathways. Using path integral molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate nuclear quantum effects on the thermodynamics of model proton transfer reactions in liquid ethane. We find that proton transfer can occur at Titan surface conditions through quantum tunneling. Consequently, we estimate that nuclear quantum effects can enhance reaction rates by many orders of magnitude. Our results suggest that nuclear quantum effects could facilitate prebiotic chemistry on Titan, and quantum effects should be considered in future investigations.</description>

      <title>Ion Correlation-Driven Hysteretic Adhesion and Repulsion between Opposing Polyelectrolyte Brushes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface interactions mediated by polyelectrolyte (PE) brushes has been of great significance in biotechnology and nanotechnology including lubrication of skeletal joints, protein-coated surfaces, and stabilization of nanoparticles. The addition of salt ions is an important tool to modulate the morphology and mechanical properties of PE brushes. In this work, the electrostatic correlation augmented self-consistent field theory we previously developed is applied to investigate the interactions between opposing PE brushes in a mixture of 1:1 and 3:1 salt solutions. Our theory predicts that adding a small amount of trivalent ions can lead to a hysteretic feature of the force profile: repulsion in the compression and adhesion in the separation. Coexistence of two collapsed modes of PE brushes induced by strong ion correlations can be obtained, clearly elucidating the molecular origin of the hysteretic force. Furthermore, trivalent ions with larger radius induce less pronounced ion correlation, leading to stronger repulsion in the compression and weaker adhesion in the separation. Our results are in good agreement with the experiments reported by Tirrell group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.12404v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conserved-charge densities are very special observables in quantum many-body systems as, by construction, they encode information about the dynamics. Therefore, their evolution is expected to be of much simpler interpretation than that of generic observables and to return universal information on the state of the system at any given time. Here we study the dynamics of the fluctuations of conserved U(1) charges in systems that are prepared in charge-asymmetric initial states. We characterise the charge fluctuations in a given subsystem using the full-counting statistics of the truncated charge and the quantum entanglement between the subsystem and the rest resolved to the symmetry sectors of the charge. We show that, even though the initial states considered are homogeneous in space, the charge fluctuations generate an effective inhomogeneity due to the charge-asymmetric nature of the initial states. We use this observation to map the problem into that of charge fluctuations on inhomogeneous, charge-symmetric states and treat it using a recently developed space-time duality approach. Specialising the treatment to interacting integrable systems we combine the space-time duality approach with generalised hydrodynamics to find explicit predictions.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic bounds on generalized transport: From single-molecule to bulk observables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the transport of any scalar observable in $d$-dimensional non-equilibrium systems is bounded from above by the total entropy production scaled by the amount the observation "stretches" microscopic coordinates. The result -- a time-integrated generalized speed limit -- reflects the thermodynamic cost of transport of observables, and places underdamped and overdamped stochastic dynamics on equal footing with deterministic motion. Our work allows for stochastic thermodynamics to make contact with bulk experiments, and fills an important gap in thermodynamic inference, since microscopic dynamics is, at least for short times, underdamped. Requiring only averages but not sample-to-sample fluctuations, the proven transport bound is practical and applicable not only to single-molecule but also bulk experiments where only averages are observed, which we demonstrate by examples. Our results may facilitate thermodynamic inference on molecular machines without an obvious directionality from bulk observations of transients probed, e.g. in time-resolved X-ray scattering.</description>

Abstract: We study the response of critical Resonating Valence Bond (RVB) spin liquids to doping with longer-range singlets, and more generally of U(1)-symmetric tensor networks to non-symmetric perturbations. Using a field theory description, we find that in the RVB, doping constitutes a relevant perturbation which immediately opens up a gap, contrary to previous observations. Our analysis predicts a very large correlation length even at significant doping, which we verify using high-accuracy numerical simulations. This emphasizes the need for careful analysis, but also justifies the use of such states as a variational ansatz for critical systems. Finally, we give an example of a PEPS where non-symmetric perturbations do not open up a gap and the U(1) symmetry re-emerges.</description>

Abstract: The long range spatial and temporal ordering displayed by discrete time crystals, can become advantageous properties when used for sensing extremely weak signals. Here, we investigate their performance as quantum sensors of weak AC-fields and demonstrate, using the quantum Fisher information measure, that they can overcome the shot noise limit while allowing long interrogation times. In such systems, collective interactions stabilize their dynamics against noise making them robust enough to protocol imperfections.</description>

      <title>Noisy Quantum Trees: Infinite Protection Without Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14294v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study quantum networks with tree structures, in which information propagates from a root to leaves. At each node in the network, the received qubit unitarily interacts with fresh ancilla qubits, after which each qubit is sent through a noisy channel to a different node in the next level. Therefore, as the tree depth grows, there is a competition between the irreversible effect of noise and the protection against such noise achieved by delocalization of information. In the classical setting, where each node simply copies the input bit into multiple output bits, this model has been studied as the broadcasting or reconstruction problem on trees, which has broad applications. In this work, we study the quantum version of this problem. We consider a Clifford encoder at each node that encodes the input qubit in a stabilizer code, along with a single qubit Pauli noise channel at each edge. Such noisy quantum trees describe a scenario in which one has access to a stream of fresh (low-entropy) ancilla qubits, but cannot perform error correction. Therefore, they provide a different perspective on quantum fault tolerance. Furthermore, they provide a useful model for describing the effect of noise within the encoders of concatenated codes. We prove that above certain noise thresholds, which depend on the properties of the code such as its distance, as well as the properties of the encoder, information decays exponentially with the depth of the tree. On the other hand, by studying certain efficient decoders, we prove that for codes with distance d&gt;=2 and for sufficiently small (but non-zero) noise, classical information and entanglement propagate over a noisy tree with infinite depth. Indeed, we find that this remains true even for binary trees with certain 2-qubit encoders at each node, which encode the received qubit in the binary repetition code with distance d=1.</description>

      <title>Exactly Solvable Floquet Dynamics for Conformal Field Theories in Dimensions Greater than Two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find classes of driven conformal field theories (CFT) in d + 1 dimensions with d &gt; 1, whose quench and Floquet dynamics can be computed exactly. The setup is suitable for studying periodic drives, consisting of square pulse protocols for which Hamiltonian evolution takes place with different deformations of the original CFT Hamiltonian in successive time intervals. These deformations are realized by specific combinations of conformal generators with a deformation parameter $\beta$; the $\beta &lt; 1$ ($\beta &gt; 1$) Hamiltonians can be unitarily related to the standard (Luscher-Mack) CFT Hamiltonian. The resulting time evolution can be then calculated by conformal transformations. For $d\leq 3$ we show that the transformations can be obtained in a quaternion formalism. Evolution with such a single Hamiltonian yields qualitatively different time dependences of observables depending on the value of $\beta$, ranging from exponential decays characteristic of heating to oscillations and power law decays. This manifests in the behavior of the fidelity, unequal-time correlator, and the energy density at the end of a single cycle of a square pulse protocol with different hamiltonians in successive time intervals. When the Hamiltonians in a cycle involve generators of a single SU(1, 1) subalgebra we calculate the Floquet Hamiltonian. We show that one can get dynamical phase transitions by varying the time period of a cycle, where the system can go from a non-heating phase which is oscillatory as a function of the time period to a heating phase with an exponentially damped behavior. Our methods can be generalized to other discrete and continuous protocols. We also point out that our results are expected to hold for a broader class of QFTs that possesses an SL(2, C) symmetry with fields that transform as quasi-primaries under this. As an example, we briefly comment on celestial CFTs in this context.</description>

      <title>Page curve entanglement dynamics in an analytically solvable model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18045v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The entanglement entropy of black holes is expected to follow the Page curve. After an initial linear increase with time the entanglement entropy should reach a maximum at the Page time and then decrease. This paper introduces an exactly solvable model of free fermions that explicitly shows such a Page curve: The entanglement entropy vanishes asymptotically for late times instead of saturating at a volume law. The bending down of the Page curve is accompanied by a breakdown of the semiclassical connection between particle current and entanglement generation, a quantum phase transition in the entanglement Hamiltonian and non-analytic behavior of the $q\rightarrow\infty$ Renyi entropy. These observations are expected to hold for a larger class of systems beyond the exactly solvable model analyzed here.</description>

      <title>Nanofluidic platform for studying the first-order phase transitions in superfluid helium-3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06079v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The symmetry-breaking first-order phase transition between superfluid phases $^3$He-A and $^3$He-B can be triggered extrinsically by ionising radiation or heterogeneous nucleation arising from the details of the sample cell construction. However, the role of potential homogeneous intrinsic nucleation mechanisms remains elusive. Discovering and resolving the intrinsic processes may have cosmological consequences, since an analogous first-order phase transition, and the production of gravitational waves, has been predicted for the very early stages of the expanding Universe in many extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics. Here we introduce a new approach for probing the phase transition in superfluid $^3$He. The setup consists of a novel stepped-height nanofluidic sample container with close to atomically smooth walls. The $^3$He is confined in five tiny nanofabricated volumes and assayed non-invasively by NMR. Tuning of the state of $^3$He by confinement is used to isolate each of these five volumes so that the phase transitions in them can occur independently and free from any obvious sources of heterogeneous nucleation. The small volumes also ensure that the transitions triggered by ionising radiation are strongly suppressed. Here we present the preliminary measurements using this setup, showing both strong supercooling of $^3$He-A and superheating of $^3$He-B, with stochastic processes dominating the phase transitions between the two. The objective is to study the nucleation as a function of temperature and pressure over the full phase diagram, to both better test the proposed extrinsic mechanisms and seek potential parallel intrinsic mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Stability of mixed-state quantum phases via finite Markov length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For quantum phases of Hamiltonian ground states, the energy gap plays a central role in ensuring the stability of the phase as long as the gap remains finite. We propose Markov length, the length scale at which the quantum conditional mutual information (CMI) decays exponentially, as an equally essential quantity characterizing mixed-state phases and transitions. For a state evolving under a local Lindbladian, we argue that if its Markov length remains finite along the evolution, then it remains in the same phase, meaning there exists another quasi-local Lindbladian evolution that can reverse the former one. We apply this diagnostic to toric code subject to decoherence and show that the Markov length is finite everywhere except at its decodability transition, at which it diverges. CMI in this case can be mapped to the free energy cost of point defects in the random bond Ising model. This implies that the mixed state phase transition coincides with the decodability transition and also suggests a quasi-local decoding channel.</description>

      <title>Quantum dynamics of the effective field theory of the Calogero-Sutherland model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10011v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the known effective field theory of the Calogero-Sutherland model in the thermodynamic limit of large number of particles, obtained from the standard procedure in conformal field theory: the Hilbert space is constructed a priori in terms of irreducible representations of the symmetry algebra, and not by diagonalization of the hamiltonian, which is given in terms of fields that carry representations of the W-infinity algebra (representing the incompressibility of the Fermi sea). Nevertheless, the role of the effective hamiltonian of the theory is to establish a specific dynamics, which deserves further consideration. We show that the time evolution of the (chiral or antichiral) density field is given by the quantum Benjamin-Ono equation, in agreement with previous results obtained from the alternative description of the continuous limit of the model, based on quantum hydrodynamics. In this study, all calculations are performed at the quantum operator level, without making any assumption on the semiclassical limit of the fields and their equations of motion. This result may be considered as a reliable indication of the equivalence between the quantum field theoretic and quantum hydrodynamical formulations of the effective theories of the model. A one-dimensional quantum compressible fluid that includes both chiralities is the physical picture that emerges for the continuous limit of the Calogero-Sutherland model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Microphase separation is common in active biological systems as exemplified by the separation of RNA and DNA-rich phases in the cell nucleus driven by the transcriptional activity of polymerase enzymes acting similarly to amphiphiles in a microemulsion. Here we propose an analytically tractable model of an active microemulsion to investigate how the activity affects its structure and relaxation dynamics. Continuum theory derived from a lattice model exhibits two distinct regimes of the relaxation dynamics and is linked to the broken detailed balance due to intermittent activity of the amphiphiles.</description>

      <title>2d Ising Critical Couplings from Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using an exact holographic duality formula between the inhomogeneous 2d Ising model and 3d quantum gravity, we provide a formula for "real" zeroes of the 2d Ising partition function on finite trivalent graphs in terms of the geometry of a 2d triangulation embedded in the three-dimensional Euclidean space. The complex phase of those zeroes is given by the dihedral angles of the triangulation, which reflect its extrinsic curvature within the ambient 3d space, while the modulus is given by the angles within the 2d triangles, thus encoding the intrinsic geometry of the triangulation. Our formula can not cover the whole set of Ising zeroes, but we conjecture that a suitable complexification of these "real" zeroes would provide a more thorough formula. Nevertheless, in the thermodynamic limit, in the case of flat planar 2d triangulations, our Ising zeros' formula gives the critical couplings for isoradial graphs, confirming its generality. Finally, the formula naturally extends to graphs with arbitrary valence in terms of geometry of circle patterns embedded in 3d space. This approach shows an intricate, but precise, new relation between statistical mechanics and quantum geometry.</description>

      <title>Cascade of phase transitions in the training of Energy-based models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the feature encoding process in a prototypical energy-based generative model, the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM). We start with an analytical investigation using simplified architectures and data structures, and end with numerical analysis of real trainings on real datasets. Our study tracks the evolution of the model's weight matrix through its singular value decomposition, revealing a series of phase transitions associated to a progressive learning of the principal modes of the empirical probability distribution. The model first learns the center of mass of the modes and then progressively resolve all modes through a cascade of phase transitions. We first describe this process analytically in a controlled setup that allows us to study analytically the training dynamics. We then validate our theoretical results by training the Bernoulli-Bernoulli RBM on real data sets. By using data sets of increasing dimension, we show that learning indeed leads to sharp phase transitions in the high-dimensional limit. Moreover, we propose and test a mean-field finite-size scaling hypothesis. This shows that the first phase transition is in the same universality class of the one we studied analytically, and which is reminiscent of the mean-field paramagnetic-to-ferromagnetic phase transition.</description>

      <title>Lindbladian way for the relaxation time approximation, application to Kibble-Zurek processes due to environment temperature quench, and to Lindbladian perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present paper, a global Lindbladian ansatz is constructed which leads to thermalization at temperature $T$ to the Gibs state of the investigated system. This ansatz connects every two eigenstates of the Hamiltonian and leads to a simple master equation known in the literature as the relaxation time approximation (RTA). The main message of this paper is that RTA, being a Lindbladian approach itself, can be used as Lindbladian securing thermalization when modeling physical processes, and can be consequently combined with other types of Lindbladians which would drive the system of the equilibrium state. I demonstrate it with two applications. The first application is the slow cooling (or heating) of quantum systems by varying the environment temperature to a critical point. With this RTA-Lindblad ansatz, one can directly relate to the equilibrium behavior of the system, and if an order parameter has the exponent $\Psi$, the remaining value at the phase transition will decrease with $1/\tau^{\Psi}$, where $\tau$ is the overall time of the slow process. In the second application, I investigate the change in the expectation value of a conserved quantity (an operator commuting with the Hamiltonian) due to an extra Lindbladian term which would drive the system out from equilibrium, while the thermalizing RTA-Lindbladian term is also present. I give a closed perturbative expression in the first order for the expectation value in the new steady state using only expectation values calculated in the original thermal equilibrium.</description>
