      <title>Arbitrage-Free Bond and Yield Curve Forecasting with Neural Filters under HJM Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an arbitrage-free deep learning framework for yield curve and bond price forecasting based on the Heath-Jarrow-Morton (HJM) term-structure model and a dynamic Nelson-Siegel parameterization of forward rates. Our approach embeds a no-arbitrage drift restriction into a neural state-space architecture by combining Kalman, extended Kalman, and particle filters with recurrent neural networks (LSTM/CLSTM), and introduces an explicit arbitrage error regularization (AER) term during training. The model is applied to U.S. Treasury and corporate bond data, and its performance is evaluated for both yield-space and price-space predictions at 1-day and 5-day horizons. Empirically, arbitrage regularization leads to its strongest improvements at short maturities, particularly in 5-day-ahead forecasts, increasing market-consistency as measured by bid-ask hit rates and reducing dollar-denominated prediction errors.</description>

      <title>Diffusive Limit of Hawkes Driven Order Book Dynamics With Liquidity Migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a theoretical mesoscopic model of the limit order book driven by multivariate Hawkes processes, designed to capture temporal self-excitation and the spatial propagation of order flow across price levels. In contrast to classical zero-intelligence or Poisson based queueing models, the proposed framework introduces mathematically defined migration events between neighbouring price levels, whose intensities are themselves governed by the underlying Hawkes structure. This provides a principled stochastic mechanism for modeling interactions between order arrivals, cancellations, and liquidity movement across adjacent queues.
  Starting from a microscopic specification of Hawkes driven order flow, we derive a diffusion approximation which yields a reflected mesoscopic stochastic differential equation (SDE) system for queue volumes. The limiting generator is obtained through a Taylor expansion of the microscopic generator, demonstrating how temporal excitation together with spatial migration determine the drift and diffusion structure of the limit order book in the mesoscopic regime. The resulting model extends existing diffusion limits by incorporating correlated excitations and price level to price level liquidity movement within a unified Hawkes based formulation.
  By establishing this diffusive limit, the paper provides a mathematically consistent bridge between high frequency event based models and macroscopic stochastic descriptions of market microstructure. The work is entirely theoretical and lays a foundation for future analytical and numerical developments without relying on empirical calibration.</description>

      <title>Set risk measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18687v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of set risk measures (SRMs), which are real-valued maps defined on the space of all non-empty, closed, and bounded sets of almost surely bounded random variables. Traditional risk measures typically operate on random variables, but SRMs extend this framework to sets of random variables. We establish an axiomatic scheme for SRMs, similar to classical risk measures but adapted for set operations. The main technical contribution is an axiomatic dual representation of convex SRMs by using regular, $\tau$-additive (for nets) measures on the unit ball of the dual space of essentially bounded random variables. We explore worst-case SRMs, which evaluate risk as the supremum of individual risks within a set, and provide a collection of examples illustrating the applicability of our framework to systemic risk, optimization, and decision-making under uncertainty.</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning-Based Method for Fully Coupled Non-Markovian FBSDEs with Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we extend deep learning-based numerical methods to fully coupled forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) within a non-Markovian framework. Error estimates and convergence are provided. In contrast to the existing literature, our approach not only analyzes the non-Markovian framework but also addresses fully coupled settings, in which both the drift and diffusion coefficients of the forward process may be random and depend on the backward components $Y$ and $Z$. Furthermore, we illustrate the practical applicability of our framework by addressing utility maximization problems under rough volatility, which are solved numerically with the proposed deep learning-based methods.</description>

      <title>Inverting the Markovian projection for pure jump processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Markovian projections arise in problems where we aim to mimic the one-dimensional marginal laws of an It\^o semimartingale by using another It\^o process with Markovian dynamics. In applications, Markovian projections are useful in calibrating jump-diffusion models with both local and stochastic features, leading to the study of the inversion problems. In this paper, we invert the Markovian projections for pure jump processes, which can be used to construct calibrated local stochastic intensity (LSI) models for credit risk applications. Such models are jump process analogues of the notoriously hard to construct local stochastic volatility (LSV) models used in equity modeling.</description>
