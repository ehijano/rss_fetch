      <title>New Tight Wavelet Frame Constructions Sharing Responsibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tight wavelet frames (TWFs) in $L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)$ are versatile and practical structures that provide the perfect reconstruction property. Nevertheless, existing TWF construction methods exhibit limitations, including a lack of specific methods for generating mother wavelets in extension-based construction, and the necessity to address the sum of squares (SOS) problem even when specific methods for generating mother wavelets are provided in SOS-based construction. It is a common practice for current TWF constructions to begin with a given refinable function. However, this approach places the entire burden on finding suitable mother wavelets. In this paper, we introduce TWF construction methods that spread the burden between both types of functions: refinable functions and mother wavelets. These construction methods offer an alternative approach to circumvent the SOS problem while providing specific techniques for generating mother wavelets. We present examples to illustrate our construction methods.</description>

      <title>Exploring Convexity in Normed Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Normed spaces appear to have very little going for them: aside from the hackneyed linear structure, you get a norm whose only virtue, aside from separating points, is the Triangle Inequality. What could you possibly prove with that? As it turns out, quite a lot. In this article we will start by considering basic convexity properties of normed spaces, and gradually build up to some of the highlights of Functional Analysis, emphasizing how these notions of convexity play a key role in proving many surprising and deep results.</description>

      <title>Additional Studies on Displacement Mapping with Restrictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of monotone operators plays a major role in modern optimization and many areas of nonlinera analysis. The central classes of monotone operators are matrices with a positive semidefinite symmetric part and subsifferential operators. In this paper, we complete our study to the displacement mappings. We derive formulas for set-valued and Moore-Penrose inverses. We also give a comprehensive study of the the operators ($(1/2) {\rm Id} + T$ and its inverse) and provide a formula for $((1/2) {\rm Id} + T)^{-1}$. We illustrate our results by considering the reflected and the projection operators to closed linear subspaces.</description>

      <title>Spectra of infinitesimal generators of composition semigroups on weighted Bergman spaces induced by doubling weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose $(C_t)_{t\geq0}$ is the composition semigroup induced by a one-parameter semigroup $(\varphi_t)_{t\geq0}$ of analytic self-maps of the unit disk. The main purpose of the paper is to investigate the spectrum of the infinitesimal generator of $(C_t)_{t\geq0}$ acting on the weighted Bergman space induced by doubling weights, provided $(\varphi_t)_{t\geq0}$ is elliptic. The method applied is a certain spectral mapping theorem and a characterization of the spectra of certain composition operators. Eventual norm-continuity of $(C_t)_{t\geq0}$ also plays an important role, which can be depicted in terms of studying the difference of two distinct composition operators. As a byproduct, we also characterize a certain compact integral operator that is closely related to the resolvent of the infinitesimal generator of $(C_t)_{t\geq0}$.</description>

      <title>Contractive representations of odometer semigroup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a natural number $n \geq 1$, the odometer semigroup $O_n$, also known as the adding machine or the Baumslag-Solitar monoid with two generators, is a well-known object of study in group theory. This is also a central object of study for various algebraic-analytic structures. This paper examines the odometer semigroup in relation to representations of bounded linear operators. We focus on noncommutative operators and prove that contractive representations of $O_n$ always admit to nicer isometric representations of $O_n$ on vector-valued Fock spaces. We give a complete description of representations of $O_n$ on the Fock space and relate it to the dilation theory and invariant subspaces of Fock representations of $O_n$. Along the way, we also classify Nica covariant representations of $O_n$.</description>

      <title>Restriction theorems for the $p$-analog of the Fourier-Stieltjes algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a locally compact group $G$ and $1 &lt; p &lt; \infty,$ let $B_p(G)$ denote the $p$-analog of the Fourier-Stieltjes algebra $B(G) \, (\text{or} \, B_2(G))$. Let $r: B_p(G) \to B_p(H)$ be the restriction map given by $r(u) = u|_H$ for any closed subgroup $H$ of $G.$ In this article, we prove that the restriction map $r$ is a surjective isometry for any open subgroup $H$ of $G.$ Further, we show that the range of the map $r$ is dense in $B_p(H)$ when $H$ is either a compact normal subgroup of $G$ or compact subgroup of an [SIN]$_H$-group.</description>

      <title>Spectral Synthesis on Continuous Images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently we introduced the concept of localisability of ideals in the Fourier algebra of locally compact Abelian groups. It turns out that localisability can be used to characterise synthesisability of varieties. Based on this we show that spectral synthesis holds on continuous images of varieties which have spectral synthesis.</description>

      <title>Roots and Logarithms of Multipliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By now it is a well-known fact that if $f$ is a multiplier for the Drury-Arveson space $H^2_n$, and if there is a $c&gt;0$ such that $|f(z)|\geq c$ for every $z\in B$, then the reciprocal function 1/f is also a multiplier for $H^2_n$. We show that for such an $f$ and for every $t\in \mathbb{R}$, $f^t$ is also a multiplier for $H^2_n$. We do so by deriving a differentiation formula for $R^m(f^th)$.Moreover, by this formula the same result holds for spaces $H_{m,s}$ of the Besov-Dirichlet type. The same technique also gives us the result that for a non-vanishing multiplier $f$ of $H^2_n$, $log f$ is a multiplier of $H^2_n$ if and only if log $f$ is bounded on $B$.</description>

      <title>Discrete Hankel Prolate Spheroidal Wave Functions: Spectral Analysis and Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the early 1960s, the fields of signal processing, data transmission, channel equalisation, filter design and others have been technologically developed and modernised as a result of the research carried out by D. Slepian and his co-authors H. J Landau and H. O Pollack on the time and band-limited wave system known as discrete and continuous spheroidal waves systems. Our aim in this paper is to introduce new discrete wave sequences called discrete Hankel Prolate spheroidal sequences {\bf DHPSS} and their counterparts in the frequency domain called discrete Hankel Prolate spheroidal wave functions {\bf DHPSWF} as radial parts of different solutions of a discrete multidimensional energy maximization problem similar to the one given by D. Slepian and which will generalize his classical pioneering work. In the meantime, we will ensure that our new family is the eigenfunctions set of a finite rank integral operator defined on $L^2(0,\omega),\,0&lt;\omega&lt;1,$ with an associated kernel given by $\sum_{k=1}^N\phi^{\alpha}_{n}(r)\phi^{\alpha}_{n}(r'),$ where $\phi^{\alpha}_{n}(r)=\frac{\sqrt{2r}J_{\alpha}(s_n^{(\alpha)}r)}{|J_{\alpha+1}(s^{(\alpha)}_n)|},0\leq r\leq 1.$ Here $J_\alpha$ is the Bessel function of the first kind and $(s_n^{(\alpha)})_n$ are the associated positive zeros. In addition, we will extend the various classical results proposed concerning the decay rate and spectral distribution associated with the classical case, then we will finish our work by an application on the Ingham's universal constant which we will specify with an upper bound estimate.</description>

      <title>Small Banach bundles and modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize those (continuously-normed) Banach bundles $\mathcal{E}\to X$ with compact Hausdorff base whose spaces $\Gamma(\mathcal{E})$ of global continuous sections are topologically finitely-generated over the function algebra $C(X)$, answering a question of I. Gogi\'c's and extending analogous work for metrizable $X$. Conditions equivalent to topological finite generation include: (a) the requirement that $\mathcal{E}$ be locally trivial and of finite type along locally closed and relatively $F_{\sigma}$ strata in a finite stratification of $X$; (b) the decomposability of arbitrary elements in $\ell^p(\Gamma(\mathcal{E}))$, $1\le p&lt;\infty$ as sums of $\le N$ products in $\ell^p(C(X))\cdot \Gamma(\mathcal{E})$ for some fixed $N$; (c) the analogous decomposability requirement for maximal Banach-module tensor products $F\widehat{\otimes}_{C(X)}\Gamma(\mathcal{E})$ or (d) equivalently, only for $F=\ell^1(C(X))$.</description>

      <title>Completely hyperexpansive operators with finite rank defect operator and de Branges-Rovnyak spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The process of identifying a Dirichlet-type space $D(\mu)$ for a positive, Borel measure $\mu$, supported on the unit circle $\mathbb T,$ with a de Branges-Rovnyak space was initiated by Sarason. A characterization of the symbol for a de Branges-Rovnyak spaces for which the shift operator is a $2$-isometry, was provided in an article by Kellay and Zarrabi. In this paper, capitalizing on the Aleman's model for the cyclic, analytic, completely hyperexpansive operators, we provide a characterization of cyclic, analytic, completely hyperexpansive operator with finite rank defect operator in terms of the symbol for a de Branges-Rovnyak space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Osgood functions in the source term are used to produce results for non-existence of local solutions into the framework of non-Gaussian diffusion equations. The critical exponent for non-existence of local solutions is found to depend on the fractional derivative, the non-Gaussian diffusion and the non-linear term. The instantaneous blow-up phenomenon is studied by exploiting estimates of the fundamental solutions. Nevertheless, theory of super-solutions and fixed points are combined for showing existence of global solutions. In this case, the critical exponent for existence of global solutions depends only on the last two parameters above.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we investigate the possibility of defining meaningful upper and lower quantization dimensions for a compactly supported Borel probability measure of order $r$, also for negative values of $r$. To this end, we utilize the concept of partition functions, which generalizes the idea of the $L^{q}$-spectrum and, in this way, naturally extends the work in [M. Kesseb\"ohmer, A. Niemann, and S. Zhu. Quantization dimensions of probability measures via R\'enyi dimensions. $\textit{Trans. Amer. Math. Soc.}$ 376.7 (2023), 4661$\unicode{x2013}$4678]. In particular, we provide natural fractal geometric bounds as well as easily verifiable necessary conditions for the existence of the quantization dimensions. Exact asymptotics for the absolutely continuous case are also given.</description>

      <title>Maps preserving the truncation of triple products on Cartan factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\{C_i\}_{i\in \Gamma_1},$ and $\{D_j\}_{j\in \Gamma_2},$ be two families of Cartan factors such that all of them have dimension at least $2$, and consider the atomic JBW$^*$-triples $A=\bigoplus\limits_{i\in \Gamma_1}^{\ell_{\infty}} C_i$ and $B=\bigoplus\limits_{j\in \Gamma_2}^{\ell_{\infty}} D_j$. Let $\Delta :A \to B$ be a {\rm(}non-necessarily linear nor continuous{\rm)} bijection preserving the truncation of triple products in both directions, that is, $$\begin{aligned}
  \boxed{a \mbox{ is a truncation of } \{b,c,b\}} \Leftrightarrow \boxed{\Delta(a) \mbox{ is a truncation of } \{\Delta(b),\Delta(c),\Delta(b)\}}
  \end{aligned}$$ Assume additionally that the restriction of $\Delta$ to each rank-one Cartan factor in $A$, if any, is a continuous mapping. Then we show that $\Delta$ is an isometric real linear triple isomorphism. We also study some general properties of bijections preserving the truncation of triple products in both directions between general JB$^*$-triples.</description>

We show that the recently formulated conjecture holds up to $\log \log \log n$ factor for arbitrary $n\times n$ Rademacher matrices and the triple logarithm may be eliminated for matrices with $\{0,1\}$-coefficients.</description>

      <title>On the boundedness of generalized integration operators on Hardy spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the boundedness and compactness properties of the generalized integration operator $T_{g,a}$ when it acts between distinct Hardy spaces in the unit disc of the complex plane. This operator has been introduced by the first author in connection to a theorem of Cohn about factorization of higher order derivatives of functions in Hardy spaces. We answer in the affirmative a conjecture stated in the same work, therefore giving a complete characterization of the class of symbols $g$ for which the operator is bounded from the Hardy space $H^p$ to $H^q, \, 0&lt;p,q&lt;\infty.$</description>

      <title>$L^2$ estimates and existence theorems for the $\overline{\partial}$ operators in infinite dimensions, II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.04292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is the second part of our series of works to establish $L^2$ estimates and existence theorems for the $\overline{\partial}$ operators in infinite dimensions. In this part, we consider the most difficult case, i.e., the underlying space is a general pseudo-convex domain. In order to solve this longstanding open problem, we introduce several new concepts and techniques, which have independent interest and pave the way for research that investigates some other issues in infinite-dimensional analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let  $f = f(z,t)$ be a function holomorphic in $z \in O \subseteq {\mathbb C}^d$ for fixed $t\in \Omega$ and measurable in $t$ for fixed $z$ and such that$z \mapsto f(z,\cdot)$ is bounded with values in$E := L_{p}(\Omega)$, $1\le p \le \infty$. It is proved (among other things) that \[ \langle   t\mapsto \varphi( f(\cdot,t) )  , \mu \rangle= \varphi(z \mapsto  \langle f(z, \cdot) , \mu\rangle  )\] whenever $\mu \in E'$ and $\varphi$ is a linear functional on $H^\infty(O)$ that is sequentially continuous with respect to bounded pointwise convergence in $H^\infty(O)$.</description>

      <title>Multiplication Operators on Hilbert Spaces</title>

Abstract: Let $S$ be a subnormal operator on a separable complex Hilbert space $\mathcal H$ and let $\mu$ be the scalar-valued spectral measure for the minimal normal extension $N$ of $S.$ Let $R^\infty (\sigma(S),\mu)$ be the weak-star closure in $L^\infty (\mu)$ of rational functions with poles off $\sigma(S),$ the spectrum of $S.$ The multiplier algebra $M(S)$ consists of functions $f\in L^\infty(\mu)$ such that $f(N)\mathcal H \subset \mathcal H.$ The multiplication operator $M_{S,f}$ of $f\in M(S)$ is defined $M_{S,f} = f(N) |_{\mathcal H}.$ We show that for $f\in R^\infty (\sigma(S),\mu),$ (1) $M_{S,f}$ is invertible iff $f$ is invertible in $M(S)$ and (2) $M_{S,f}$ is Fredholm iff there exists $f_0\in R^\infty (\sigma(S),\mu)$ and a polynomial $p$ such that $f=pf_0,$ $f_0$ is invertible in $M(S),$ and $p$ has only zeros in $\sigma (S) \setminus \sigma_e (S),$ where $\sigma_e (S)$ denotes the essential spectrum of $S.$ Consequently, we characterize $\sigma(M_{S,f})$ and $\sigma_e(M_{S,f})$ in terms of some cluster subsets of $f.$ Moreover, we show that if $S$ is an irreducible subnormal operator and $f \in R^\infty (\sigma(S),\mu),$ then $M_{S,f}$ is invertible iff $f$ is invertible in $R^\infty (\sigma(S),\mu).$ The results answer the second open question raised by J. Dudziak in 1984.</description>

      <title>Generalized de Branges-Rovnyak spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given the reproducing kernel $k$ of the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_k$ we study spaces $\mathcal{H}_k(b)$ whose reproducing kernel has the form $k(1-bb^*)$, where $b$ is a row-contraction on $\mathcal{H}_k$. In terms of reproducing kernels this it the most far-reaching generalization of the classical de Branges-Rovnyaks spaces, as well as their very recent generalization to several variables. This includes the so called sub-Bergman spaces in one or several variables. We study some general properties of $\mathcal{H}_k(b)$ e.g. when the inclusion map into $\mathcal{H}$ is compact. Our main result provides a model for $\mathcal{H}_k(b)$ reminiscent of the Sz.-Nagy-Foia\c{s} model for contractions. As an application we obtain sufficient conditions for the containment and density of the linear span of $\{k_w:w\in\mathcal{X}\}$ in $\mathcal{H}_k(b)$. In the standard cases this reduces to containment and density of polynomials. These methods resolve a very recent conjecture regarding polynomial approximation in spaces with kernel $\frac{(1-b(z)b(w)^*)^m}{(1-z\overline w)^\beta}, 1\leq m&lt;\beta, m\in\mathbb{N}$.</description>

      <title>The CCAP for graph products of operator algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.07323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a simple graph $\Gamma$ and for unital $C^*$-algebras with GNS-faithful states $(\mathbf{A}_v,\varphi_v)$ for $v\in V\Gamma$, we consider the reduced graph product $(\mathcal{A},\varphi)=*_{v,\Gamma}(\mathbf{A}_{v},\varphi_v)$ , and show that if every $C^*$-algebra $\mathbf{A}_{v}$ has the completely contractive approximation property (CCAP) and satisfies some additional condition, then the graph product has the CCAP as well. The additional condition imposed is satisfied in natural cases, for example for the reduced group $C^*$-algebra of a discrete group $G$ that possesses the CCAP.
  Our result is an extension of the result of Ricard and Xu in [Proposition 4.11, 25] where they prove this result under the same conditions for free products. Moreover, our result also extends the result of Reckwerdt in [Theorem 5.5, 24], where he proved for groups that weak amenability with Cowling-Haagerup constant $1$ is preserved under graph products. Our result further covers many new cases coming from Hecke-algebras and discrete quantum groups.</description>

      <title>Randomized approximation of summable sequences -- adaptive and non-adaptive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01705v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove lower bounds for the randomized approximation of the embedding $\ell_1^m \rightarrow \ell_\infty^m$ based on algorithms that use arbitrary linear (hence non-adaptive) information provided by a (randomized) measurement matrix $N \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times m}$. These lower bounds reflect the increasing difficulty of the problem for $m \to \infty$, namely, a term $\sqrt{\log m}$ in the complexity $n$. This result implies that non-compact operators between arbitrary Banach spaces are not approximable using non-adaptive Monte Carlo methods. We also compare these lower bounds for non-adaptive methods with upper bounds based on adaptive, randomized methods for recovery for which the complexity $n$ only exhibits a $(\log\log m)$-dependence. In doing so we give an example of linear problems where the error for adaptive vs. non-adaptive Monte Carlo methods shows a gap of order $n^{1/2} ( \log n)^{-1/2}$.</description>

      <title>Inner conjugate pair of Hadamard subfactors and vertex model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01664v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that any two Hadamard subfactors arising from a pair of distinct complex Hadamard matrices of order 3 are either equal or inner conjugate via a unitary in the relative commutant of their intersection. Moreover, when the Hadamard subfactors are not equal, we prove the factoriality of their intersection, and quite interestingly, it turns out to be a vertex model subfactor. We compute the first relative commutant and characterize this subfactor by identifying it with a particular type of Krishnan-Sunder subfactor. A few key invariants, including the Pimsner-Popa probabilistic number, the angle, and the Connes- St{\o}rmer relative entropy for the pair of Hadamard subfactors are computed to understand their relative position.</description>
