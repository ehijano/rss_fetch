      <title>On the fluctuations of the number of atoms in the condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bose-Einstein condensation represents a remarkable phase transition, characterized by the formation of a single quantum subsystem. As a result, the statistical properties of the condensate are highly unique. In the case of a Bose gas, while the mean number of condensed atoms is independent of the choice of statistical ensemble, the microcanonical, canonical, or grand canonical variances differ significantly among these ensembles. In this paper, we review the progress made over the past 30 years in studying the statistical fluctuations of Bose-Einstein condensates. Focusing primarily on the ideal Bose gas, we emphasize the inequivalence of the Gibbs statistical ensembles and examine various approaches to this problem. These approaches include explicit analytic results for primarily one-dimensional systems, methods based on recurrence relations, asymptotic results for large numbers of particles, techniques derived from laser theory, and methods involving the construction of statistical ensembles via stochastic processes, such as the Metropolis algorithm. We also discuss the less thoroughly resolved problem of the statistical behavior of weakly interacting Bose gases. In particular, we elaborate on our stochastic approach, known as the hybrid sampling method. The experimental aspect of this field has gained renewed interest, especially following groundbreaking recent measurements of condensate fluctuations. These advancements were enabled by unprecedented control over the total number of atoms in each experimental realization. Additionally, we discuss the fluctuations in photonic condensates as an illustrative example of grand canonical fluctuations. Finally, we briefly consider the future directions for research in the field of condensate statistics.</description>

      <title>Interaction-driven losses for atoms in a dark-state lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we estimate the collisional loss rate of ultracold bosons in the optical potential featuring subwavelength-width peaks. This is established by using $\Lambda$ arrangement of three atomic states coupled (almost) resonantly by lasers. Using Fermi's Golden Rule, we find that the loss rate is influenced by the overall strength of the lasers, with the largest losses occurring when the two-photon transition is blue-detuned from the excited state of the $\Lambda$ system. Overall, the predicted loss rates are low, which may allow the use of ultracold bosons in the construction of dark-state potentials in the $\Lambda$-type many-level system.</description>

      <title>Bose-Bose gases with nonuniversal corrections to the interactions: a droplet phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through an effective quantum field theory within Bogoliubov's framework and taking into account nonuniversal effects of the interatomic potential we analytically derive the leading Gaussian zero- and finite-temperature corrections to the equation of state of ultracold interacting Bose-Bose gases. We calculate the ground-state energy per particle at zero and low temperature for three- two- and one-dimensional two-component bosonic gases. By tuning the nonuniversal contribution to the interactions we address and establish conditions under which the formation and stability of a self-bound liquidlike phase or droplet with nonuniversal corrections to the interactions DNUC) is favorable. At zero temperature in three-dimensions and considering the nonuniversal corrections to the attractive interactions as a fitting parameter the energy per particle for DNUC is in good agreement with some diffusion Monte Carlo results. In two dimensions the DNUC present small deviations regarding conventional droplets. For the one-dimensional DNUC the handling of the nonuniversal effects to the interactions achieves a qualitative agreement with the trend of some available Monte Carlo data in usual droplets. We also introduce some improved Gross-Pitaevskii equations to describe self-trapped DNUC in three, two and one dimension. We briefly discuss some aspects at low temperature regarding nonuniversal corrections to the interactions in Bose-Bose gases. We derive the dependencies on the nonuniversal contribution to the interactions but also on the difference between intra- and inter-species coupling constants. This last dependence crucially affect the three- and the two-dimensional DNUC driving thus to a thermal-induced instability. This thermal instability is also present in one-dimensional Bose-Bose gases, but it is not relevant on the formation of DNUC...</description>

      <title>Observation of a zero-energy excitation mode in the open Dicke model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Approaching phase boundaries in many-body systems can give rise to intriguing signatures in their excitation spectra. Here, we explore the excitation spectrum of a Bose-Einstein condensate strongly coupled to an optical cavity and pumped by an optical standing wave, which simulates the famous Dicke-Hepp-Lieb phase transition of the open Dicke model with dissipation arising due to photon leakage from the cavity. For weak dissipation, the excitation spectrum displays two strongly polaritonic modes. Close to the phase boundary, we observe an intriguing regime where the lower-energetic of these modes, instead of showing the expected roton-type mode softening, is found to approach and persist at zero energy, well before the critical pump strength for the Dicke-Hepp-Lieb transition boundary is reached. Hence, a peculiar situation arises, where an excitation is possible at zero energy cost, but nevertheless no instability of the system is created.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the discovery of the complex potential of quarkonium at high temperatures, quarkonium has been regarded as an open quantum system in the quark-gluon plasma. Recently, a similar issue regarding in-medium bound states of impurities has also emerged in particle physics and cold atomic physics. We will provide an overview of recent advancements in understanding key quantities such as complex potential and transport coefficients for heavy impurities in finite temperature QCD and cold atomic systems.</description>

      <title>A Radio-Frequency Emitter Design for the Low-Frequency Regime in Atomic Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio frequency (RF) control is a key technique in cold atom experiments. Here, we present a new design based on virtual load, where a low-frequency coil with a frequency of up to 30\,MHz, functions as both an inductor and a power-sharing element in a capacitive transformer circuit. This design enables a highly efficient RF circuit with tunable matching bandwidth. It integrates broadband and narrowband coils into a compact configuration, overcoming the distance limitations of metallic chambers. The broadband RF system, tested in a 10-second evaporative cooling experiment, reduced input power from 14.7\,dBW to -3.5\,dBW due to its low-pass behavior, effectively cooling the Bose-Fermi mixture to below 10\,$\mu$K. The narrowband RF system was tested in a Landau-Zener experiment and transferred 80\,\% of Rb atoms from |F=2, m_F=2&gt; to |2, -2&gt; in 1 second, yielding a Rabi frequency of 7.6\,kHz at 0.1\,dBW. The power-sharing properties of the virtual load ensure impedance closely matches the ideal lumped-element simulations, demonstrating the design's robustness to disturbances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time crystals are an enigmatic phase of matter in which a quantum mechanical system displays repetitive, observable motion - they spontaneously break the time translation symmetry. On the other hand optomechanical systems, where mechanical and optical degrees of freedom are coupled, are well established and enable a range of applications and measurements with unparalleled precision. Here, we connect a time crystal formed of magnetic quasiparticles, magnons, to a mechanical resonator, a gravity wave mode on a nearby liquid surface, and show that their joint dynamics evolves as a cavity optomechanical system. Our results pave way for exploiting the spontaneous coherence of time crystals in an optomechanical setting and remove the experimental barrier between time crystals and other phases of condensed matter.</description>

      <title>Topological Dynamics and Correspondences in Composite Exceptional Rings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of unconventional phases and elucidation of correspondences between topological invariants and their intriguing properties are pivotal in topological physics. Here, we investigate a complex exceptional ring (CER), composed of a third-order exceptional ring and multiple Weyl exceptional rings, and establish a direct correspondence between Chern numbers and the distinctive behaviors of these structures. We show that band braiding during quasistatic encircling processes correlates with nontrivial Chern numbers, resulting in triple (double) periodic spectra for topologically nontrivial (trivial) middle bands. Moreover, Chern numbers predict mode transfer during dynamical encircling. Experimental schemes for realizing CER in cold atoms are proposed, emphasizing the crucial role of Chern numbers as both measurable quantity and descriptor of exceptional physics in dissipative systems. This discovery broadens topological classifications in non-Hermitian systems, with promising applications in quantum computing and metrology.</description>

      <title>Dynamical signatures of the Yang-Lee edge singularity in non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Yang-Lee edge singularity is an intriguing critical phenomenon characterized by nonunitary field theory. However, its experimental realization for interacting many-body systems remains elusive. We show that Yang-Lee edge singularities, regarded as many-body exceptional points, can be observed using both the self-normal and the associated-biorthogonal Loschmidt echoes, leveraging the advantages of nonunitary dynamics in non-Hermitian systems. The Loschmidt echoes are demonstrated to display unitary dynamics in the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric regime but exhibit nonunitary dynamics in the $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry-broken regime, leading to a sharp change near an exceptional point. We hereby identify exceptional points in both the non-Hermitian transverse field Ising model and the Yang-Lee model, and determine the critical exponent that is consistent with nonunitary conformal field theory. This work provides a direct observation of Yang-Lee edge singularities in non-Hermitian many-body systems arising from nonunitary dynamics.</description>

      <title>Measurement of $p$-wave contacts in an ultracold Fermi gas of $^6$Li atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13086v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using radio-frequency (RF) spectroscopy, we measure the $p$-wave contacts in a Fermi gas of $^6$Li atoms near the $p$-wave Feshbach resonance. The RF spectrum exhibits clear asymptotic behavior, characterized by $\tilde{\omega}^{-1/2}$ and $\tilde{\omega}^{-3/2}$ dependencies. The magnetic-field dependence of the $p$-wave contacts agrees reasonably well with the virial expansion theory in a detuned magnetic field range, validating the theory near the Fermi temperature. The $p$-wave contacts measured in this study constitute a second dataset, complementing the data obtained from the $^{40}$K system and contributing valuable insights into $p$-wave interactions in ultracold Fermi gases.</description>

      <title>Fermion mediated pairing in the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida to Efimov transition regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yoshida (RKKY) interaction and Efimov physics are two distinct quantum phenomena in condensed matter and nuclear physics, respectively. The RKKY interaction describes correlations between impurities mediated by an electron gas, while Efimov physics describes universal bound states of three particles with resonant interactions. Recently, both effects have been observed in Bose-Fermi mixtures in the weak and resonant interaction regimes, respectively. Intriguing conjectures exist to elucidate how the two phenomena meet in the transition regime where the mixture is strongly interacting. In this work, we explore the RKKY-Efimov transition in a mixture of bosonic Cs-133 and fermionic Li-6 near a tunable interspecies Feshbach resonance. From dispersion and relaxation measurements, we find that the transition is highlighted by a fermion-mediated scattering resonance between Cs atoms and a weaker resonance on Li atoms. These resonances represent reactive scattering of Cs and Li atoms in the many-body regime, which reduces to an Efimov resonance in the thermal gas regime. Our observation demonstrates the intriguing interplay of two-, three-, and many-body physics in an Bose-Fermi mixture that connects condensed matter physics, nuclear physics and quantum many-body chemistry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.18025v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bosonic exchange symmetry leads to fascinating quantum phenomena, from exciton condensation in quantum materials to the superfluidity of liquid Helium-4. Unfortunately, path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) simulations of bosons are computationally prohibitive beyond $\mathord{\sim} 100$ particles, due to a cubic scaling with the system size. We present an algorithm that reduces the complexity from cubic to quadratic, allowing the first simulations of thousands of bosons using PIMD. Our method is orders of magnitude faster, with a speedup that scales linearly with the number of particles and the number of imaginary time slices (beads). Simulations that would have otherwise taken decades can now be done in days. In practice, the new algorithm eliminates most of the added computational cost of including bosonic exchange effects, making them almost as accessible as PIMD simulations of distinguishable particles.</description>

      <title>Generic reduction theory for Fermi sea topology in metallic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19125v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Fermi sea of a metal can host exotic quantum topology, which governs its conductance quantization and is characterized by the Euler characteristic ($\chi_F$). In contrast to the well-known band topology, which is determined by the global features of wave functions, the topology of such metallic systems is intrinsically linked to the geometry of the Fermi sea. As a result, probing and identifying $\chi_F$ in high-dimensional systems presents a challenge. Here, we propose a generic dimensional reduction theory for the Fermi sea topology in $d$-dimensional metallic systems, showing that $\chi_F$ can be determined by the features of so-called reduced critical points on Fermi surfaces. Moreover, we reveal that $\chi_F$ can be interpreted as a topological invariant of band topology by mapping a metallic system to a gapped system. Building on this nontrivial result, we identify a broad class of topological superconductors (SCs) whose topological numbers are precisely determined by the $\chi_F$ of their normally filled bands. This provides an indirect method to capture $\chi_F$ by measuring the (pseudo)spin polarizations of these topological SCs. Our findings are expected to significantly advance research into Fermi sea topology.</description>

      <title>Violation of the Leggett-Garg inequality for dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate in a double-well potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05304v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Leggett-Garg inequality (LGI) serves as a criterion to determine the adherence of macroscopic system dynamics to macrorealism, as introduced by Leggett and Garg. A violation of this inequality implies either the absence of a realistic description of the system or the impossibility of noninvasive measurement. In this Letter, we investigate the violation of the LGI for the system of bosons in a double-well potential. Specifically, we explore the violation of the LGI in the dynamics of bosons in a double-well potential in the Bose-Einstein-condensation (BEC) regime, where the system can be considered as two weakly coupled Bose condensates, and in the single-particle regime to establish the conditions under which the violation of the LGI occurs. Our analysis reveals that the LGI is violated due to Josephson oscillations, while it remains unviolated in the strong coupling regime, attributed to the self-trapping phenomena. Notably, we observe that the violation of the LGI becomes increasingly significant as the particle number increases. These findings provide valuable insights into the macrorealistic behavior of Bose condensates and highlight the effect of measurements on the dynamics of a macroscopic system.</description>

Abstract: We define an infinite class of ``frustration-free'' interacting lattice quantum Hamiltonians for bosons, constructed such that their exact ground states have a density distribution specified by the Boltzmann weight of a corresponding classical lattice gas problem. By appropriately choosing the classical weights, we obtain boson representations of various known solvable models, including quantum dimer and vertex models, toric code, and certain Levin-Wen string-net models. We also systematically construct solvable models with other interesting ground states, including ``quantum spin liquids,'' supersolids, ``Bose-Einstein insulators,'' Bose liquids with ``Bose surfaces'', and Bose-Einstein condensates that permit adiabatic evolution from a non-interacting limit to a Gutzwiller-projected limit.</description>

      <title>Ab-Initio Approach to Many-Body Quantum Spin Dynamics</title>

Abstract: A fundamental longstanding problem in studying spin models is the efficient and accurate numerical simulation of the long-time behavior of larger systems. The exponential growth of the Hilbert space and the entanglement accumulation at long times pose major challenges for current methods. To address these issues, we employ the multilayer multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree (ML-MCTDH) framework to simulate the many-body spin dynamics of the Heisenberg model in various settings, including the Ising and XYZ limits with different interaction ranges and random couplings. Benchmarks with analytical and exact numerical approaches show that ML-MCTDH accurately captures the time evolution of one- and two-body observables in both one- and two-dimensional lattices. A comparison with the discrete truncated Wigner approximation (DTWA) highlights that ML-MCTDH is particularly well-suited for handling anisotropic models and provides more reliable results for two-point observables across all tested cases. The behavior of the corresponding entanglement dynamics is analyzed to reveal the complexity of the quantum states. Our findings indicate that the rate of entanglement growth strongly depends on the interaction range and the presence of disorder. This particular relationship is then used to examine the convergence behavior of ML-MCTDH. Our results indicate that the multilayer structure of ML-MCTDH is a promising numerical framework for handling the dynamics of generic many-body spin systems.</description>

      <title>Application of Madelung Hydrodynamics to Plasmonics and Nonlinear Optics in Two-Dimensional Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the application of Madelung hydrodynamic models to study two-dimensional electron gases, with a focus on nonlocal plasmonics and nonlinear optics. We begin by reviewing the derivation of the Madelung equations. Using the Madelung equations in conjunction with Poisson's equation, we calculate the spectrum of magnetoplasmons and the magneto-optical conductivity in the electrostatic regime, incorporating nonlocal corrections due to the Fermi pressure. In the absence of a magnetic field, we analyze nonlinear and nonlocal second-harmonic generation, demonstrating how plasmon excitation enhances this process. We further discuss the emergence of self-modulation phenomena driven by nonlinearity, leading to the renormalization of the plasmon dispersion. Notably, we show that nonlinearity amplifies nonlocal effects and, leveraging the hydrodynamic formalism, derive a simple analytic expression for the renormalized spectra.</description>

      <title>Periodic Boundary Conditions for Bosonic Path Integral Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17618v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an algorithm for bosonic path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) simulations with periodic boundary conditions (PBC) that scales quadratically with the number of particles. Path integral methods are a powerful tool to simulate bosonic condensed phases, which exhibit fundamental physical phenomena such as Bose--Einstein condensation and superfluidity. Recently, we developed a quadratic scaling algorithm for bosonic PIMD, but employed an ad hoc treatment of PBC. Here we rigorously enforce PBC in bosonic PIMD. It requires summing over the spring energies of all periodic images in the partition function, and a naive implementation scales exponentially with the system size. We present an algorithm for bosonic PIMD simulations of periodic systems that scales only quadratically. We benchmark our implementation on the free Bose gas and a model system of cold atoms in optical lattices. We also study an approximate treatment of PBC based on the minimum-image convention, and derive a numerical criterion to determine when it is valid.</description>

      <title>Superballistic paradox in electron fluids: Evidence of tomographic transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electron hydrodynamics encompasses the exotic fluid-like behavior of electrons in two-dimensional materials such as graphene. It accounts for superballistic conduction, also known as the Gurzhi effect, where increasing temperature reduces the electrical resistance. In analogy with conventional fluids, the Gurzhi effect is only expected in the hydrodynamic regime, with the decrease in the resistance occurring at intermediate temperatures. Nonetheless, experiments on electron fluids consistently show that superballistic conduction starts at close-to-zero temperatures. To address this paradox, we study hydrodynamic flow, and we find that replacing the classical dynamics with tomographic dynamics, where only head-on collisions are allowed between electrons, solves the dilemma. The latter strengthens superballistic conduction, with potential applications in low-dissipation devices, and explains its differences with the Molenkamp effect and conventional fluids dynamics. Our study reveals that the superballistic paradox is resolved by considering the electrons not as classical particles but as fermions.</description>
