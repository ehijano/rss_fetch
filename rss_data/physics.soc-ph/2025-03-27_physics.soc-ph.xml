      <title>Dynamics of Algorithmic Content Amplification on TikTok</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent algorithms increasingly shape the content we encounter and engage with online. TikTok's For You feed exemplifies extreme algorithm-driven curation, tailoring the stream of video content almost exclusively based on users' explicit and implicit interactions with the platform. Despite growing attention, the dynamics of content amplification on TikTok remain largely unquantified. How quickly, and to what extent, does TikTok's algorithm amplify content aligned with users' interests? To address these questions, we conduct a sock-puppet audit, deploying bots with different interests to engage with TikTok's "For You" feed. Our findings reveal that content aligned with the bots' interests undergoes strong amplification, with rapid reinforcement typically occurring within the first 200 videos watched. While amplification is consistently observed across all interests, its intensity varies by interest, indicating the emergence of topic-specific biases. Time series analyses and Markov models uncover distinct phases of recommendation dynamics, including persistent content reinforcement and a gradual decline in content diversity over time. Although TikTok's algorithm preserves some content diversity, we find a strong negative correlation between amplification and exploration: as the amplification of interest-aligned content increases, engagement with unseen hashtags declines. These findings contribute to discussions on socio-algorithmic feedback loops in the digital age and the trade-offs between personalization and content diversity.</description>

      <title>Protection of multilayer network systems from targeted group attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main types of simultaneous targeted group attacks on complex network systems and processes of intersystem interactions are discussed in the article. On the basis of structural model of multilayer network system (MLNS) and its aggregate-network, the most important components from a structural point of view, namely the cores of various types, whose damage will cause the greatest lesions of MLNS's structure, are highlighted. On the basis of flow model of multilayer system and its flow aggregate-network, the most important their components from a functional point of view, namely the flow cores of various types, whose damage will cause the greatest lesions of the process of inter-system interactions, are determined. Effective scenarios of successive and sim-ultaneous targeted group attacks on the structure and operation process of multilayer network systems have been developed using the structural and flow cores of aggregate-networks of MLNS. It is shown that the use of flow-based approach allows us to build much more effective scenarios of such attacks, as well as to more accurately evaluate the consequences of resulting lesions.</description>

      <title>Survey-Based Calibration of the One-Community and Two-Community Social Network Models Used for Testing Singapore's Resilience to Pandemic Lockdown</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A resilient society is one capable of withstanding and thereafter recovering quickly from large shocks. Brought to the fore by the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020--2022, this social resilience is nevertheless difficult to quantify. In this paper, we measured how quickly the Singapore society recovered from the pandemic, by first modeling it as a dynamic social network governed by three processes: (1) random link addition between strangers; (2) social link addition between individuals with a friend in common; and (3) random link deletion . To calibrate this model, we carried out a survey of a representative sample of $N = 2,057$ residents and non-residents in Singapore between Jul and Sep 2022 to measure the numbers of random and social contacts gained over a fixed duration, as well as the number of contacts lost over the same duration, using phone contacts as proxy for social contacts. Lockdown simulations using the model that fits the survey results best suggest that Singapore would recover from such a disruption after 1--2 months.</description>

      <title>Entropy in Science of Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates entropy's potential for analyzing scientific research patterns across disciplines. Originating from thermodynamics, entropy now measures uncertainty and diversity in information systems. We examine Shannon Entropy, Entropy Weight Method, Maximum Entropy Principle and structural entropy applications in scientific collaboration, knowledge networks, and research evaluation. Through publication analysis and collaboration network studies, entropy-based approaches demonstrate effectiveness in mapping interdisciplinary knowledge integration, with higher entropy values correlating to increased knowledge diversity in citation networks. Structural entropy analysis reveals dynamic collaboration patterns affecting research productivity. Results indicate entropy metrics offer objective tools for assessing research quality, optimizing team structures, and informing science policy decisions. These quantitative methods enable systematic tracking of knowledge evolution and resource allocation efficiency, providing actionable insights for researchers and policymakers managing complex scientific ecosystems</description>

      <title>Fully personalized PageRank and algebraic methods to distribute a random walker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of algebraic methods for controlling the stationary distribution of PageRank-like random walkers. Building upon existing literature, we compile and extend results regarding both structural control (through network modifications) and parametric control (through measure parameters) of these centralities. We characterize the conditions for complete control of centrality scores and the weaker notion of ranking control, establishing bounds for the required parameters. Our analysis includes classical PageRank alongside two generalizations: node-dependent dampings and node-dependent personalization vector, with the latter being a novel idea in the literature. We examine how their underlying random walk structures affect their controllability, and we also investigate the concepts of competitors and leaders in centrality rankings, providing insights into how parameter variations can influence node importance hierarchies. These results advance our understanding of the interplay between algebraic control and stochastic dynamics in network centrality measures.</description>

      <title>From reductionism to realism: Holistic mathematical modelling for complex biological systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At its core, the physics paradigm adopts a reductionist approach to modelling, aiming to understand fundamental phenomena by decomposing them into simpler, elementary processes. While this strategy has been tremendously successful in physics and is typically considered the pinnacle of scientific formulation, it has often fallen short in addressing fundamental questions in the biological sciences. This limitation arises from the inherent complexity of biological systems, characterised by heterogeneity, poly-functionality and interactions across multiple spatial and temporal scales. Nevertheless, the traditional framework of complex systems modelling also falls short, as its emphasis on broad theoretical principles has often failed to produce realistic, predictive, empirically grounded insights. To advance towards the goal of actionable mathematical models in biology, we argue here, using neuroscience as a case study, that it is necessary to move beyond simple reductionist approaches and instead embrace the intrinsic complexity and heterogeneity of biological systems-leveraging the growing availability of high-resolution data and recent advances in high-performance computing. In particular, we advocate for a holistic mathematical modelling paradigm that harnesses rich representational structures such as annotated and multilayer networks, employs agent-based models and simulation-based approaches, and focuses on the inverse problem of inferring system properties from dynamical observations. Finally, we emphasise that this approach is fully compatible with the search for fundamental principles in biophysics, and we highlight the substantial potential it holds to drive progress in mathematical biology over the next two decades.</description>

      <title>Supply chain network rewiring dynamics at the firm-level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supply chain networks (SCN) form the structural backbone of any society. They constitute the societal metabolism that literally produces everything for everybody by coordinating practically every single person on the planet. SCNs are by no means static but undergo permanent change through the entry and exit of firms and the re-arrangement of supply relations. Here we use a unique dataset to explore the temporal evolution of firms and their supplier-buyer relations of a national SCN. Monthly reported value added tax data from Hungary from 2014 to 2022 allows us to reconstruct the entire economy with 711,248 companies and 38,644,400 connections, covering practically every re-structuring event of an entire economy at firm-level resolution. We find that per year about 25\% of firms exit the SCN while 28\% new ones enter. On average, 55\% of all supply-links present in one year will not be present in the next. We report the half-life time of supply-links to be 13 months. New links attach super-preferentially to firms with a probability, $p(i)\propto k_i^{1.08}$, with $k_i$ firm $i$'s number of supply-connections. We calibrate a simple statistical network generation model that reproduces the stylized characteristics of the dominant Hungarian SCN. The model not only reproduces local network features such as in- and out-degree distributions, assortativity and clustering structure, but also captures realistic systemic risk profiles. We discuss the present model in how rewiring dynamics of the economy is essential for quantifying its resilience and to estimate shock propagation.</description>

      <title>Skill dependencies uncover nested human capital</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.15629v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern economies require increasingly diverse and specialized skills, many of which depend on the acquisition of other skills first. Here we analyse US survey data to reveal a nested structure within skill portfolios, where the direction of dependency is inferred from asymmetrical conditional probabilities-occupations require one skill conditional on another. This directional nature suggests that advanced, specific skills and knowledge are often built upon broader, fundamental ones. We examine 70 million job transitions to show that human capital development and career progression follow this structured pathway in which skills more aligned with the nested structure command higher wage premiums, require longer education and are less likely to be automated. These disparities are evident across genders and racial-ethnic groups, explaining long-term wage penalties. Finally, we find that this nested structure has become even more pronounced over the past two decades, indicating increased barriers to upward job mobility.</description>

      <title>Forecasting the Mix of World Energy Needs by mid-21st Century</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The logistic function is used to forecast energy consumed worldwide. The logistic substitution model is used to describe the energy mix since 1965 presenting a picture significantly different from the one covering the previous 100 years. In the new picture the share of heavy pollutants, i.e. coal plus oil, keeps declining systematically in favor of natural gas and renewables (wind, geothermal, solar, biomass, and waste), the share of which grows rapidly. The shares of these three energy sources (coal plus oil, natural gas, and renewables) are poised to reach around 30 percent each by the mid-21st century. Nuclear and hydroelectric energy, both with rather stable shares, are responsible for the remaining 10 percent, which goes mostly to hydroelectric.
  Zooming into the composition of renewables we find that today's dominant wind power is about to begin losing share to solar energy, which will overtake wind after 2024 and account for more than 90 percent of all renewables by mid-21st century, by which time geothermal, biomass, and other renewable energy sources will have dropped to insignificant levels.
  Forecasts in exajouls are given for all energy sources up to 2050.</description>

      <title>CoDiNG -- Naming Game with Continuous Latent Opinions of Individual Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19204v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms behind opinion formation is crucial for gaining insight into the processes that shape political beliefs, cultural attitudes, consumer choices, and social movements. This work aims to explore a nuanced model that captures the intricacies of real-world opinion dynamics by synthesizing principles from cognitive science and employing social network analysis. The proposed model is a hybrid continuous-discrete extension of the well-known Naming Game opinion model. The added latent continuous layer of opinion strength follows cognitive processes in the human brain, akin to memory imprints. The discrete layer allows for the conversion of intrinsic continuous opinion into discrete form, which often occurs when we publicly verbalize our opinions. We evaluated our model using real data as ground truth and demonstrated that the proposed mechanism outperforms the classic Naming Game model in many cases, reflecting that our model is closer to the real process of opinion formation.</description>

      <title>The myth of declining competitive balance in the UEFA Champions League group stage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19222v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The degree of competitive balance is a crucial issue in the analysis of sports competitions. According to previous studies, competitive balance has significantly declined in the UEFA Champions League group stage over the recent decades. Our paper introduces six alternative indices in order to explore the robustness of these results. The ex ante measures are based on Elo ratings, while our ex post measures compare the group ranking to reasonable benchmarks. We find no evidence of any trend in the competitive balance of the UEFA Champions League group stage between the 2003/04 and 2023/24 seasons.</description>
