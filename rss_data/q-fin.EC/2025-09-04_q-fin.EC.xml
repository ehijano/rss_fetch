      <title>Introducing LCOAI: A Standardized Economic Metric for Evaluating AI Deployment Costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes foundational to enterprise infrastructure, organizations face growing challenges in accurately assessing the full economic implications of AI deployment. Existing metrics such as API token costs, GPU-hour billing, or Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) fail to capture the complete lifecycle costs of AI systems and provide limited comparability across deployment models. This paper introduces the Levelized Cost of Artificial Intelligence (LCOAI), a standardized economic metric designed to quantify the total capital (CAPEX) and operational (OPEX) expenditures per unit of productive AI output, normalized by valid inference volume. Analogous to established metrics like LCOE (levelized cost of electricity) and LCOH (levelized cost of hydrogen) in the energy sector, LCOAI offers a rigorous, transparent framework to evaluate and compare the cost-efficiency of vendor API deployments versus self-hosted, fine-tuned models. We define the LCOAI methodology in detail and apply it to three representative scenarios, OpenAI GPT-4.1 API, Anthropic Claude Haiku API, and a self-hosted LLaMA-2-13B deployment demonstrating how LCOAI captures critical trade-offs in scalability, investment planning, and cost optimization. Extensive sensitivity analyses further explore the impact of inference volume, CAPEX, and OPEX variability on lifecycle economics. The results illustrate the practical utility of LCOAI in procurement, infrastructure planning, and automation strategy, and establish it as a foundational benchmark for AI economic analysis. Policy implications and areas for future refinement, including environmental and performance-adjusted cost metrics, are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Too Noisy to Collude? Algorithmic Collusion Under Laplacian Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of autonomous pricing systems has sparked growing concern over algorithmic collusion in markets from retail to housing. This paper examines controlled information quality as an ex ante policy lever: by reducing the fidelity of data that pricing algorithms draw on, regulators can frustrate collusion before supracompetitive prices emerge. We show, first, that information quality is the central driver of competitive outcomes, shaping prices, profits, and consumer welfare. Second, we demonstrate that collusion can be slowed or destabilized by injecting carefully calibrated noise into pooled market data, yielding a feasibility region where intervention disrupts cartels without undermining legitimate pricing. Together, these results highlight information control as a lightweight yet practical lever to blunt digital collusion at its source.</description>

      <title>Once Welcomed, Then Scapegoated: The Enduring Consequences of Assimilation Policies in the Wake of Mass Migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the short- and long-term effects of immigrant assimilation policies in Brazil following the Mass Migration period. I focus on the Nationalization Campaign, launched by the federal government amid rising anti-immigrant sentiment during the Great Depression and the two World Wars. Using newly assembled archival data spanning the twentieth century, I assess the impact of these policies on the educational outcomes of immigrants and their descendants, following the forced closure of hundreds of immigrant-community schools. In the short term, the campaign significantly reduced educational attainment among targeted immigrant groups across state, municipal, and individual levels. In the long term, immigrants who were school-age during the campaign attained less education over their lifetimes, with adverse effects extending into the second generation. The magnitude of these effects was mediated by the degree of cultural proximity between immigrant groups and native Brazilians. These findings underscore the enduring consequences of assimilationist policies and offer insights for contemporary debates on immigration and education policy.</description>

      <title>Distribution-valued Causal Machine Learning: Implications of Credit on Spending Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fintech lending has become a central mechanism through which digital platforms stimulate consumption, offering dynamic, personalized credit limits that directly shape the purchasing power of consumers. Although prior research shows that higher limits increase average spending, scalar-based outcomes obscure the heterogeneous distributional nature of consumer responses. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a new causal inference framework that estimates how continuous changes in the credit limit affect the entire distribution of consumer spending. We formalize distributional causal effects within the Wasserstein space and introduce a robust Distributional Double Machine Learning estimator, supported by asymptotic theory to ensure consistency and validity. To implement this estimator, we design a deep learning architecture comprising two components: a Neural Functional Regression Net to capture complex, nonlinear relationships between treatments, covariates, and distributional outcomes, and a Conditional Normalizing Flow Net to estimate generalized propensity scores under continuous treatment. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed estimator accurately recovers distributional effects in a range of data-generating scenarios. Applying our framework to transaction-level data from a major BigTech platform, we find that increased credit limits primarily shift consumers towards higher-value purchases rather than uniformly increasing spending, offering new insights for personalized marketing strategies and digital consumer finance.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Social Costs of Power Outages and Restoration Disparities Across Four U.S. Hurricanes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The multifaceted nature of disaster impact shows that densely populated areas contribute more to aggregate burden, while sparsely populated but heavily affected regions suffer disproportionately at the individual level. This study introduces a framework for quantifying the societal impacts of power outages by translating customer weighted outage exposure into deprivation measures, integrating welfare metrics with three recovery indicators, average outage days per customer, restoration duration, and relative restoration rate, computed from sequential EAGLE I observations and linked to Zip Code Tabulation Area demographics. Applied to four United States hurricanes, Beryl 2024 Texas, Helene 2024 Florida, Milton 2024 Florida, and Ida 2021 Louisiana, this standardized pipeline provides the first cross event, fine scale evaluation of outage impacts and their drivers. Results demonstrate regressive patterns with greater burdens in lower income areas, mechanistic analysis shows deprivation increases with longer restoration durations and decreases with faster restoration rates, explainable modeling identifies restoration duration as the dominant driver, and clustering reveals distinct recovery typologies not captured by conventional reliability metrics. This framework delivers a transferable method for assessing outage impacts and equity, comparative cross event evidence linking restoration dynamics to social outcomes, and actionable spatial analyses that support equity informed restoration planning and resilience investment.</description>

      <title>On the Smart Coordination of Flexibility Scheduling in Multi-carrier Integrated Energy Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coordinating the interactions between flexibility assets in multi-carrier integrated energy systems (MIES) can lead to an efficient integration of variable renewable energy resources, and a cost-efficient energy transition. However, the proliferation of flexibility assets and their participation in active demand response increases the complexity of coordinating these interactions. This paper introduces different approaches to model the coordination of flexibility scheduling in MIES. We propose a market auction-inspired model coupling approach to address the challenges of preserving the autonomy and privacy of flexibility providers, and the issue of scalability. We benchmark our approach against co-optimization and an iterative price-response method by conducting experiments with varying problem sizes and computing infrastructure. We show that our approach scales well and is suitable for modeling flexibility in large-scale energy systems in a more realistic way. From an optimality standpoint, the flexibility dispatch schedules and electricity prices are ``near-optimal". Our methodology is implemented as a new open-source software, which offers several practical applications. For example, flexibility providers and network operators can couple their models to simulate the interaction between their systems without disclosing confidential information; policy regulators can use it to investigate new market design and regulations to optimize the utilization of flexibility in MIES.</description>

      <title>Endogenous Persistence at the Effective Lower Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06473v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a perfect foresight method to solve models with an interest rate lower bound constraint that nests OccBin/DynareOBC and \cite{Eggertsson2010}'s as well as \cite{Mertens2014}'s pen and paper solutions as special cases. Our method generalizes the pen-and-paper solutions by allowing for endogenous persistence while maintaining tractability and interpretability. We prove that our method necessarily gives stable multipliers. We use it to solve a New Keynesian model with habit formation and government spending, which we match to expectations data from the Great Recession. We find an output multiplier of government spending close to 1 for the US and Japan.</description>

      <title>Invisible Labor, Visible Barriers: The Socioeconomic Realities of Women's Work in Pakistan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We highlight the barriers shaping women's economic opportunities in Pakistan, where female labor force participation remains among the lowest globally. Labor force surveys (2020-21) show a stark rural-urban divide: 28 percent for rural women versus 69 percent for rural men, and 10 percent for urban women versus 66 percent for urban men. Unemployment is higher for women (7 percent in rural areas; 16 percent in urban areas) than for men (5 and 6 percent, respectively). Women are concentrated in agriculture (68 percent), with limited presence in services (17 percent) and industry (15 percent), and mostly in rural (51 percent) or home-based (30 percent) work; only 14 percent are in formal business settings. Employment status reflects vulnerability: 63 percent of rural women are unpaid contributing family workers versus 17 percent of urban women. Interviews with married women in Karachi underscore childcare constraints, harassment and safety concerns, transport barriers, and family opposition. Together, the evidence points to structural and cultural constraints that restrict access to paid work; easing them will require labor market reforms, better transport and childcare, stronger protections against harassment and discrimination, and a gradual change in gender norms and household decision-making.</description>
