      <title>AI Testing Should Account for Sophisticated Strategic Behaviour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This position paper argues for two claims regarding AI testing and evaluation. First, to remain informative about deployment behaviour, evaluations need account for the possibility that AI systems understand their circumstances and reason strategically. Second, game-theoretic analysis can inform evaluation design by formalising and scrutinising the reasoning in evaluation-based safety cases. Drawing on examples from existing AI systems, a review of relevant research, and formal strategic analysis of a stylised evaluation scenario, we present evidence for these claims and motivate several research directions.</description>

      <title>A New Relaxation of Fairness in Two-Sided Matching Respecting Acquaintance Relationships</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-sided matching, such as matching between students and schools, has been applied to various aspects of real life and has been the subject of much research, however, it has been plagued by the fact that efficiency and fairness are incompatible. In particular, Pareto efficiency and justified-envy-freeness are known to be incompatible even in the simplest one-to-one matching, i.e., the stable marriage problem. In previous research, the primary approach to improving efficiency in matchings has been to tolerate students' envy, thereby relaxing fairness constraints. In this study, we take a different approach to relaxing fairness. Specifically, it focuses on addressing only the envy that students may experience or prioritize more highly and seeks matchings without such envy. More specifically, this study assumes that envy towards students who are not acquaintances has less impact compared to envy towards students who are acquaintances. Accordingly, we assume that the students know each other or not, represented by an undirected graph, and define a local envy as a justified envy toward an acquaintance or a neighbor in the graph. We then propose the property that there is no local envy as a new relaxed concept of fairness, called local envy-freeness. We analyze whether Pareto-efficient matching can be achieved while maintaining local envy-freeness by meaningfully restricting the graph structure and the school's preferences. To analyze in detail the fairness that can achieve Pareto-efficient matching, we introduce a local version of the relaxed fairness recently proposed by Cho et al. (AAMAS 2024), which parameterizes the level of local envy-freeness by nonnegative integers. We then clarify the level of local envy-freeness that can be achieved by Pareto-efficient mechanisms for graphs that are ``close'' to trees and single-peaked preferences on the graphs.</description>

      <title>{\epsilon}-Stationary Nash Equilibria in Multi-player Stochastic Graph Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A strategy profile in a multi-player game is a Nash equilibrium if no player can unilaterally deviate to achieve a strictly better payoff. A profile is an $\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium if no player can gain more than $\epsilon$ by unilaterally deviating from their strategy. In this work, we use $\epsilon$-Nash equilibria to approximate the computation of Nash equilibria. Specifically, we focus on turn-based, multiplayer stochastic games played on graphs, where players are restricted to stationary strategies -- strategies that use randomness but not memory.
  The problem of deciding the constrained existence of stationary Nash equilibria -- where each player's payoff must lie within a given interval -- is known to be $\exists\mathbb{R}$-complete in such a setting (Hansen and S{\o}lvsten, 2020). We extend this line of work to stationary $\epsilon$-Nash equilibria and present an algorithm that solves the following promise problem: given a game with a Nash equilibrium satisfying the constraints, compute an $\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium that $\epsilon$-satisfies those same constraints -- satisfies the constraints up to an $\epsilon$ additive error. Our algorithm runs in FNP^NP time.
  To achieve this, we first show that if a constrained Nash equilibrium exists, then one exists where the non-zero probabilities are at least an inverse of a double-exponential in the input. We further prove that such a strategy can be encoded using floating-point representations, as in the work of Frederiksen and Miltersen (2013), which finally gives us our FNP^NP algorithm.
  We further show that the decision version of the promise problem is NP-hard. Finally, we show a partial tightness result by proving a lower bound for such techniques: if a constrained Nash equilibrium exists, then there must be one that where the probabilities in the strategies are double-exponentially small.</description>

      <title>Almost and Approximate EFX for Few Types of Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of fair allocation of a set of indivisible goods among $n$ agents with $k$ distinct additive valuations, with the goal of achieving approximate envy-freeness up to any good ($\alpha-\mathrm{EFX}$).
  It is known that EFX allocations exist for $n$ agents when there are at most three distinct valuations due to HV et al. Furthermore, Amanatidis et al. showed that a $\frac{2}{3}-\mathrm{EFX}$ allocation is guaranteed to exist when number of agents is at most seven. In this paper, we show that a $\frac{2}{3}-\mathrm{EFX}$ allocation exists for any number of agents when there are at most four distinct valuations.
  Secondly, we consider a relaxation called $\mathrm{EFX}$ with charity, where some goods remain unallocated such that no agent envies the set of unallocated goods. Akrami et al. showed that for $n$ agents and any $\varepsilon \in \left(0, \frac{1}{2}\right]$, there exists a $(1-\varepsilon)-\mathrm{EFX}$ allocation with at most $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}((n/\varepsilon)^{\frac{1}{2}})$ goods to charity. In this paper, we show that a $(1-\varepsilon)-\mathrm{EFX}$ allocation with a $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(k/\varepsilon)^{\frac{1}{2}}$ charity exists for any number of agents when there are at most $k$ distinct valuations.</description>

      <title>Voting with Partial Orders: The Plurality and Anti-Plurality Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17413v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the theory of voting, the Plurality rule for preferences that come in the form of linear orders selects the alternatives most frequently appearing in the first position of those orders, while the Anti-Plurality rule selects the alternatives least often occurring in the final position. We explore extensions of these rules to preferences that are partial orders, offering axiomatic characterisations for them.</description>

      <title>Equitable Allocations of Mixtures of Goods and Chores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06799v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Equitable allocation of indivisible items involves partitioning the items among agents such that everyone derives (almost) equal utility. We consider the approximate notion of \textit{equitability up to one item} (EQ1) and focus on the settings containing mixtures of items (goods and chores), where an agent may derive positive, negative, or zero utility from an item. We first show that -- in stark contrast to the goods-only and chores-only settings -- an EQ1 allocation may not exist even for additive $\{-1,1\}$ bivalued instances, and its corresponding decision problem is computationally intractable. We focus on a natural domain of normalized valuations where the value of the entire set of items is constant for all agents. On the algorithmic side, we show that an EQ1 allocation can be computed efficiently for (i) $\{-1, 0, 1\}$ normalized valuations, (ii) objective but non-normalized valuations, (iii) two agents with type-normalized valuations. Previously, EQX allocations were known to exist only for 2 agents and objective valuations, while the case of subjective valuations remained computationally intractable even with two agents. We make progress by presenting an efficient algorithm that outputs an EQX allocation for $\{-1,1\}$ normalized subjective valuations for any number of agents. We complement our study by providing a comprehensive picture of achieving EQ1 allocations in conjunction with economic efficiency notions such as Pareto optimality and social welfare.</description>

      <title>Inequality in the Age of Pseudonymity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04668v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inequality measures such as the Gini coefficient are used to inform and motivate policymaking, and are increasingly applied to digital platforms. We analyze how measures fare in pseudonymous settings that are common in the digital age. One key challenge of such environments is the ability of actors to create fake identities under fictitious false names, also known as ``Sybils.'' While some actors may do so to preserve their privacy, we show that this can inadvertently hamper inequality measurements. As we prove, it is impossible for measures satisfying the literature's canonical set of desired properties to assess the inequality of an economy that may harbor Sybils. We characterize the class of all Sybil-proof measures, and prove that they must satisfy relaxed version of the aforementioned properties. Furthermore, we show that the structure imposed restricts the ability to assess inequality at a fine-grained level. By applying our results, we prove that large classes of popular measures are not Sybil-proof, with the famous Gini coefficient being but one example out of many. Finally, we examine the dynamics leading to the creation of Sybils in digital and traditional settings.</description>

      <title>On the Fundamental Impossibility of Hallucination Control in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06382v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes a fundamental impossibility theorem: no LLM capable of performing non-trivial knowledge aggregation can simultaneously achieve truthful knowledge representation, semantic information conservation, complete revelation of relevant knowledge, and knowledge-constrained optimality. The impossibility is not an engineering limitation but arises from the mathematical structure of information aggregation itself.
  We establish this result by describing the inference process as an auction of ideas, where distributed components compete exploiting their partial knowledge to shape responses. The proof spans three independent mathematical domains: mechanism design theory (Green-Laffont), the theory of proper scoring rules (Savage), and direct architectural analysis of transformers (Log-Sum-Exp convexity). In particular, we show how to quantify the creation of overconfident or intuitive responses-the signature of both hallucination and creativity, or imagination.
  To support this analysis, we introduce the complementary concepts of the semantic information measure and the emergence operator to model bounded reasoning in a general setting. We prove that while bounded reasoning generates accessible information, providing valuable insights and inspirations, the idealized unconstrained reasoning strictly preserves semantic content.
  By demonstrating that hallucination and imagination are mathematically identical phenomena-grounded in departures from truthfulness, semantic information conservation, revelation of relevant knowledge, and knowledge-constrained optimality-we offer a principled foundation for managing these behaviors in advanced AI systems. Finally, we present some speculative ideas to inspire evaluation and refinements of the proposed theory.</description>
