      <title>Electronic State Chromatography of Lutetium Cations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic effects strongly influence the electronic structures of the heaviest elements, thereby shaping their chemical and physical properties. Studying ion mobility within a noble gas environment reveals how the ion-neutral interactions depend on the ion's electronic configurations, thus providing an avenue for exploring these effects. An ion mobility spectrometer with a cryogenic drift tube was developed to precisely measure the low-field reduced mobility of heavy lanthanide and actinide cations. The apparatus was characterized by optimizing the bunching operation of ions with a miniature RF coulomb buncher and evaluating the chromatography performance of the drift tube operated with helium buffer gas at a temperature of 298K. Systematic ion mobility measurements of lutetium cations (Lu$^{+}$) drifting in helium gas were carried out as a case study. The electronic state chromatography of Lu$^{+}$ has been demonstrated. The low-field reduced ion mobility for the ground and lowest meta-stable state of Lu$^{+}$ have been examined. In addition, the variation of both states' reduced mobility and the quenching of meta-stable population has been investigated under different reduced electric fields ($E/n_0$), the ratio of an electric field to neutral gas number density.</description>

      <title>Cooling of gold cluster anions, Au$_N^-$, $N=2-13,15$, in a cryogenic ion-beam storage ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have measured the spontaneous and photo-induced decays of anionic gold clusters, Au$_N^-$, with sizes ranging from $N = 2$ to 13, and 15. After production in a sputter ion source, the size-selected clusters were stored in the cryogenic electrostatic ion-beam storage ring DESIREE and their neutralization decays were measured for storage times between 0.1 and 100 s. The dimer was observed to decay by electron emission in parallel to neutral atom emission at long times, analogously to the behavior of copper and silver dimers, implying a breakdown of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Radiative cooling is observed for all cluster sizes except for the dimer. The decay rates of clusters $N=3,6,8-13,15$ show only a single radiative cooling time. For $N=6-13$ the cooling times have a strong odd-even oscillation with an amplitude that decrease with cluster size, and with the even $N$ having the fast cooling. We compare our results with previous measurements of radiative cooling rates of the corresponding cationic gold clusters, Au$_N^+$, which also show an odd-even effect with a similar oscillation amplitude but at orders of magnitude shorter time scales, and out of phase with the anions.</description>
