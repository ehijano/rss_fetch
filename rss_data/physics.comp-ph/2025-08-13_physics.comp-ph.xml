      <title>Bridging Quantum Mechanics to Organic Liquid Properties via a Universal Force Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08575v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are essential tools for unraveling atomistic insights into the structure and dynamics of condensed-phase systems. However, the universal and accurate prediction of macroscopic properties from ab initio calculations remains a significant challenge, often hindered by the trade-off between computational cost and simulation accuracy. Here, we present ByteFF-Pol, a graph neural network (GNN)-parameterized polarizable force field, trained exclusively on high-level quantum mechanics (QM) data. Leveraging physically-motivated force field forms and training strategies, ByteFF-Pol exhibits exceptional performance in predicting thermodynamic and transport properties for a wide range of small-molecule liquids and electrolytes, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) classical and machine learning force fields. The zero-shot prediction capability of ByteFF-Pol bridges the gap between microscopic QM calculations and macroscopic liquid properties, enabling the exploration of previously intractable chemical spaces. This advancement holds transformative potential for applications such as electrolyte design and custom-tailored solvent, representing a pivotal step toward data-driven materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Representative Volume Element: Existence and Extent in Cracked Heterogeneous Medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Acknowledging the ever-increasing demand for composites in the engineering industry, this paper focuses on the failure of composites at the microscale and augmenting the use of multiscale modelling techniques to make them better for various applications. This work aims to increase the representativeness of the volume element by attenuating the mesh and size sensitivities in representative volume element (RVE) modelling. A technique to alleviate mesh sensitivity in RVE modelling is proposed, which equalises the fracture energy observed from computational analysis with the real phenomenon, thereby keeping the response independent of the bandwidth of strain localisation. Based on the hypothesis that ensuring periodicity of strain, in addition to displacement periodicity across the domain boundary and supplementing the capability of periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) to attenuate the size dependency in RVE modelling, a set of modified PBCs (MPBCs) are formulated. One thousand two hundred RVE samples falling into combinations of five fibre volume fractions and four RVE sizes are analysed under transverse loading, and the ability of MPBCs to attenuate the effect of RVE size on the precision of material response, particularly in the inelastic regime, is verified. This work also focuses on various factors affecting damage initiation in 2D composite RVEs. The arrangement of a pair of fibres with their members placed close to each other, such that the angle between the direction of loading and an imaginary line drawn between their centres is less, is observed to make the region between them more favourable to damage.</description>

      <title>Electronic transport and Fermi surface of Weyl semimetal WTe2: quantum oscillations and first-principles study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Currently, topological semimetals are being actively investigated from both theoretical and experimental perspectives due to their unique physical properties, including topologically protected states, large magnetoresistivity, and high carrier mobility, which make these materials promising for various applications in electronics. In this work, we present experimental and theoretical studies of the electronic structure and electronic transport in the Weyl semimetal $WTe_2$. Band structure of $WTe_2$ was scrutinized with DFT+U+SOC method showing the semimetallic nature and sensitivity of the structure to the value of U and to changes in the Fermi energy. Our results demonstrate that $WTe_2$ is in a near-compensated state and exhibits an almost quadratic non-saturating magnetoresistivity. It is found that $WTe_2$ violates the classical Kohler's rule, which is attributed to the coexistence of multiple scattering mechanisms and a strong temperature dependence of the current carrier concentration. Analysis of the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations reveals three distinct frequencies corresponding to two electron and one hole Fermi surface pockets, which are well reproduced in Fermi surface calculations. Using the Lifshitz-Kosevich formalism, we determined the electronic structure parameters for each Fermi surface pocket. Additionally, we discuss the relationship between the g-factor and the Berry phase extracted from quantum oscillations.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Reconstruction of the Speed of Sound in Breast Ultrasound Computed Tomography with Phase Encoding in the Frequency Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The framework of ultrasound computed tomography (USCT) has recently re-emerged as a powerful, safe and operator-independent way to image the breast. State of the art image reconstruction methods are performed with iterative techniques based on deterministic optimization algorithms in the frequency domain in the 300 kHz - 1 MHz bandwidth. Alternative algorithms with deterministic and stochastic optimization have been considered in the time-domain. In this paper, we present the equivalent stochastic inversion in the frequency domain (phase encoding), with a focus on reconstructing the speed of sound. We test the inversion algorithm on synthetic data in 2D and 3D, by explicitly differentiating between inverse crime and non-inverse crime scenarios, and compare against the deterministic inversion. We then show the results of the stochastic inversion in the frequency domain on experimental data. By leveraging on the concepts of multiple super-shots and stochastic ensembles, we provide robust evidence that image quality of a stochastic reconstruction of the speed of sound with phase encoding in the frequency domain is comparable, and essentially equivalent, to the one of a deterministic reconstruction, with the further benefit of drastically reducing reconstruction times by more than half.</description>

      <title>Beam hardening correction of Bremsstrahlung X-ray computed tomography measurements and required measurement accuracies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Doing quantitative computed tomography (CT) using Bremsstrahlung sources requires an estimate of the spectrum emitted by the X-ray source. One method of beam hardening correction (BHC), as described by Lifton[1], first uses transmission measurements of a known material and range of thicknesses to estimate the spectrum and then uses the estimated spectrum to correct the beam hardening error, not necessarily on the same material as used for estimating the spectrum. We adopt Lifton's BHC procedure and through simulations show how the uncertainties in the transmission measurements and the uncertainties in the material thickness measurements propagate to uncertainties in the spectrum, the beam hardening correction curve and thence to uncertainties in the beam hardening corrected CT reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Neural quantum states for emitter dynamics in waveguide QED</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum emitters coupled to one-dimensional waveguides constitute a paradigmatic quantum-optical platform for exploring collective phenomena in open quantum many-body systems. For appropriately spaced emitters, they realize the Dicke model, whose characteristic permutation symmetry allows for efficient exact solutions featuring superradiance. When the emitters are arbitrarily spaced, however, this symmetry is lost and general analytical solutions are no longer available. In this work, we introduce a novel numerical method to study the dynamics of such systems by extending the time-dependent neural quantum state (t-NQS) framework to open quantum systems. We benchmark our approach across a range of waveguide QED settings and compare its performance with tensor-network calculations. Our results demonstrate that the t-NQS approach is competitive with other numerical methods and highlight the potential of t-NQSs for studying open quantum many-body systems out of equilibrium.</description>

      <title>FGM Modeling of Thermo-Diffusive Unstable Lean Premixed Hydrogen-Air Flames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultra-lean premixed hydrogen combustion is a possible solution to decarbonize industry, while limiting flame temperatures and thus nitrous oxide emissions. These lean hydrogen/air flames experience strong preferential diffusion effects, which result in thermo-diffusive (TD) instabilities. To efficiently and accurately model lean premixed hydrogen flames, it is crucial to incorporate these preferential diffusion effects into flamelet tabulated chemistry frameworks, such as the Flamelet-Generated Manifold (FGM) method. This is challenging because the preferential diffusion terms in the control variable transport equations contain diffusion fluxes of all species in the mechanism. In this work, a new implementation is presented; the full term is reduced by only considering the most contributing species. When carefully selecting this set of major species, preferential diffusion fluxes along the flame front, i.e., cross-diffusion, can be captured. This is particularly important for manifolds that include heat loss effects, where enthalpy is one of the control variables. The diffusion of the H-radical has a significant contribution to the enthalpy transport equation, and cross-diffusion of the H-radical is non-negligible. Two manifolds, without and with heat loss effects, and the set of major species are analyzed in an a-priori and a-posteriori manner. Simulations of TD unstable hydrogen-air flames with detailed chemistry and several FGM models show that accurately capturing cross-diffusion of enthalpy is important for correctly predicting the flame shape and dynamics.</description>

      <title>A genetic algorithm to generate maximally orthogonal frames in complex space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A frame is a generalization of a basis of a vector space to a redundant overspanning set whose vectors are linearly dependent. Frames find applications in signal processing and quantum information theory. We present a genetic algorithm that can generate maximally orthogonal frames of arbitrary size $n$ in $d$-dimensional complex space. First, we formalize the concept of maximally orthogonal frame and demonstrate that it depends on the choice of an energy function to weigh the different pairwise overlaps between vectors. Then, we discuss the relation between different energy functions and well-known frame varieties such as tight and Grassmannian frames and complex projective $p$-designs. Obtaining maximally orthogonal frames poses a global non-convex minimization problem. We discuss the relation with established numerical problems such as the Thomson problem and the problem of finding optimal packings in complex projective space. To tackle the minimization, we design a hybrid genetic algorithm that features local optimization of the parents. To assess the performance of the algorithm, we propose two visualization techniques that allow us to analyze the coherence and uniformity of high-dimensional frames. The genetic algorithm is able to produce highly-symmetric universal frames, such as equiangular tight frames, symmetric, informationally complete, positive operator-valued measurements (SIC-POVMs) and maximal sets of mutually unbiased bases, for configurations of up to $d=6$ and $n=36$, with runtimes of the order of several minutes on a regular desktop computer for the largest configurations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08872v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We significantly enhance the simulation accuracy of initial Trotter circuits for Hamiltonian simulation of quantum systems by integrating first-order Riemannian optimization with tensor network methods. Unlike previous approaches, our method imposes no symmetry assumptions, such as translational invariance, on the quantum systems. This technique is scalable to large systems through the use of a matrix product operator representation of the reference time evolution propagator. Our optimization routine is applied to various spin chains and fermionic systems described by the transverse-field Ising Hamiltonian, the Heisenberg Hamiltonian, and the spinful Fermi-Hubbard Hamiltonian. In these cases, our approach achieves a relative error improvement of up to four orders of magnitude for systems of 50 qubits, although our method is also applicable to larger systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate the versatility of our method by applying it to molecular systems, specifically lithium hydride, achieving an error improvement of up to eight orders of magnitude. This proof of concept highlights the potential of our approach for broader applications in quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Developing a Linear Fluid Plasma Model with Accurate Kinetic Bernstein Waves: A First Step</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kinetic models provide highly accurate descriptions of plasma waves but involve complex integrals that are computationally expensive to solve. To facilitate a fluid-like treatment of the system, we propose rational approximations for both the plasma dispersion function in the parallel integral and the Bessel function in the perpendicular integral, ensuring that the system remains rational with respect to all three variables: wave frequency $\omega$, parallel wavevector $k_\parallel$, and perpendicular wavevector $k_\perp$. By accurately approximating the Bessel function over a wide range of Larmor radius $\rho_{cs}$ values, from $k_\perp\rho_{cs} \to 0$ to $k_\perp\rho_{cs} \to \infty$, we present an initial attempt to incorporate kinetic Bernstein waves into a fluid model. As an application, we employ this model to analyze { electromagnetic plasma} wave propagation conditions (i.e., accessibility) by solving for the complex perpendicular wavevector $k_\perp$ using a matrix eigenvalue method with given input parameters. This work may contribute to studies of electron cyclotron resonance heating (ECRH) and ion cyclotron resonance frequency (ICRF) heating in magnetized confinement plasmas.</description>

      <title>Revealing Nanostructures in High-Entropy Alloys via Machine-Learning Accelerated Scalable Monte Carlo Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12591v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The computational cost of traditional first-principles method quickly becomes prohibitively expensive as the number of atoms increases. This challenge is further amplified by the need to evaluate finite-temperature properties with Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, which is inherently challenging to parallelize due to sequential Markov chain updates. Here, we introduce Scalable Monte Carlo (SMC), an efficient MC simulation method that overcomes the parallelization bottlenecks in conventional MC simulation, reducing the computational complexity of a MC sweep from quadratic to linear. We present a GPU implementation of the SMC method, SMC-GPU, which simultaneously harnesses the thousands of processing cores on a GPU to accelerate the computation. By adopting a data-driven workflow that surrogates the computationally expensive density functional theory (DFT) with ML models, we demonstrate that SMC-GPU is capable of simulating systems of more than one-billion atoms, while maintaining the accuracy of first-principles methods. Using this unprecedented capability, we performed billion-atom MC simulations to investigate the nanostructure evolution of two important high-entropy alloys (HEAs), FeCoNiAlTi and MoNbTaW, in which the nanostructures are believed to be responsible for their superb mechanical properties. Our results reveal a rich diversity of nanostructures, including nanoparticles (NP), 3D-connected NP, and disorder protected nanophases. We quantitatively analyze the size, composition, and morphology of the nanostructures, as well as directly simulate the atom-probe-tomography (APT) needle. The results align well with available experimental observations. This work underscores the promising potential of leveraging large-scale MC simulation to explore the largely uncharted territory of nanostructure evolution in HEAs.</description>

      <title>Above room temperature multiferroic tunnel junction with the altermagnetic metal CrSb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13850v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets with nonrelativistic momentum-dependent spin splitting and compensated net magnetic moments have recently garnered significant interest in spintronics, particularly as pinning layers in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). However, room temperature (RT) altermagnet-based MTJs with tunable tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) or electroresistance (TER) modulated by multiferroicity remain largely unexplored. Here, we propose an experimentally fabricable above-RT multiferroic MTJ, comprising an altermagnetic metal, ferroelectric barrier, and ferromagnetic metal-epitomized by a CrSb/In2Se3/Fe3GaTe2 heterostructure. Our calculations with first-principles and nonequilibrium Green function method indicate that the architecture enables magnetically switchable TER, electrically tunable TMR, and dual-mode controllable spin filtering. To disentangle the roles of ferroelectricity and the tunnel barrier, nonferroelectric Sb2Se3 and a vacuum gap are exploited as control cases. Remarkably, the system achieves TMR up to 2308%, TER of 707%, and near-perfect spin filtering efficiency. Both TMR and TER are considerable for CrSb/In2Se3/Fe3GaTe2 with either Cr or Sb interface. The transport performance is robust under bias voltage. These findings demonstrate the above-RT multiferroic altermagnet-based MTJs and highlight their exciting potential as a versatile platform for next-generation spin dynamics, magnetic sensing, and quantum logic nanodevices.</description>

Abstract: A method is presented for the fast evaluation of the transient acoustic field generated outside a spherical surface using surface data on the sphere. The method employs Lebedev quadratures, which are optimal integration on the sphere, and Lagrange interpolation and differentiation in an advanced time algorithm for the evaluation of the transient field. Numerical testing demonstrates that the approach gives near machine-precision accuracy and a speed-up in evaluation time which depends on the order of quadrature rule employed but breaks even with direct evaluation at a number of field points about 1.15 times the number of surface quadrature nodes, making the method an efficient means of evaluating the field generated by a large number of sources.</description>

      <title>Temperature Dependent Mechanical and Structural Properties of Uniaxially Strained Planar Graphene</title>

Abstract: Using molecular dynamics simulations in a planar graphene sheet, we investigate the temperature dependence of its mechanical behavior under uniaxial tensile stress applied either along the armchair or the zigzag direction. Stress-strain curves are calculated for different temperatures and the corresponding dependence of various elastic parameters, like the Young modulus, the third-order elastic modulus, the tensile strength and failure strain, is presented. Fracture stress and strain, as well as the Young modulus, decrease almost linearly with temperature. The distributions of bond lengths and bond angles at different strains and temperatures are also discussed and approximate analytical expressions are presented. The latter describe accurately the numerically obtained distributions.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Non-Premixed, Supersonic Combustion using the Discontinuous Galerkin Method on Fully Unstructured Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04930v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, three-dimensional simulations of a reacting hydrogen jet in supersonic crossflow using a structure-preserving discontinuous Galerkin (DG) formulation are examined. The hydrogen jet, with a momentum flux ratio of five, is injected into a high enthalpy crossflow. The sensitivities of the solution to the grid element size and polynomial order are investigated to determine an accurate and computationally efficient approach to simulating high-speed airbreathing propulsion vehicles. The results demonstrate that DG(p = 2) solutions, which are nominally third-order accurate in smooth regions of the flow, show reasonable agreement with existing experimental results. The separation shock formation behind the jet is found to be heavily grid dependent and necessary for accurate simulations of the reacting jet in supersonic crossflow. It is determined that the highest resolution cell and polynomial order is required to capture the upstream separation shock and consequently the flame stabilization point. The mixing and combustion mode is also determined using the flame index and demonstrates the flow is heavily skewed towards a non-premixed diffusion mode which is consistent with previously run simulations of this case using traditional finite volume schemes and sub grid scale modeling approaches. Beyond this analysis, given the prevalent use of structured hexahedral meshes in the computation of realistic high-speed, chemically reacting flows, the novelty of this work lies in demonstrating accurate simulation of such a flow on a fully unstructured tetrahedral mesh. This highlights the potential of these methods to handle both complicated geometries and complex physics.</description>
