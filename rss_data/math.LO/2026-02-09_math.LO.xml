      <title>On some algebraic properties of Plonka sums and regularized varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: P\l onka sums consist of a general construction that provides structural description for algebras in regularized varieties, whose examples range from Clifford semigroups to many algebras of logic including involutive bisemilattices, Bochvar algebras and certain residuated structures. While properties such as subdirectly irreducible algebras, subvariety lattices, and free algebras are well-understood for plural types without constants, the general case involving nullary operations remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we extend these results to algebraic types with constants and provide new insights into splittings within the lattice of subvarieties of a regularized variety. Furthermore, we offer a complete characterization of the congruences of a P\l onka sum and establish that the construction preserves surjective epimorphisms and injective monomorphisms.</description>

      <title>PBNF-transform as a formulation of Propositional Calculus, I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, in a series of articles, we show methods for calculating propositional statements using algebraic polynomials as symbols for the connectives, which are named operators. These polynomials originate from the transformation between the principles of duality and the Disjunctive Boolean Normal Form, DBNF, and they appear if we use a geometrization in the unit square and simple algebraic methods, modulo 2. This we call the PBNF-transform. PBNF stands for Polynomial Boolean Normal Form as these families are based on DBNF involved here. In the first paper in this series, we show that statements can be mapped bijectively into different polynomial families g(p,q) belonging to H(g)$, which we call the The House of PBNF. We can also replace the connectives of logic with PBNF, as the polynomials are, in fact, a geometrization of these connectives; the systems are isomorphic. The benefit of this formulation of the Propositional Calculus(PC) is a near trivialization of the methods. No axioms are needed, no truth tables, just a list of polynomials (which in themselves are self-explanatory), the only law of inference is the rule of Substitution.</description>

      <title>On countability and representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The topic of this paper is the subtle interplay between countability and representations. In particular, we establish that the definition of countability of a certain set $X$ crucially hinges on the associated equivalence relation $=_{X}$. Armed with this knowledge, we study well-known and basic principles about countable sets, going back to Cantor, Sierpi\'nski, and K\"{o}nig, working in Kohlenbach's higher-order Reverse Mathematics. While these principles are relatively weak in second-order Reverse Mathematics, we obtain equivalences involving countable choice and Feferman's projection principle. The latter are essentially the strongest axioms studied in higher-order Reverse Mathematics and usually only come to the fore when dealing with the uncountable.</description>

      <title>Feasible constructivism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dummett's argument for intuitionism is well known. There is a concern that the argument proves too much, specifically, that it supports the extreme and apparently incoherent position of strict finitism. The central question is how to explicate the notion that it is possible in practice to construct an arithmetical term or verify a statement. The strict finitist answer is plagued by the sorites paradox. We propose and develop feasibilism as a more plausible view, where computational feasibility, as captured by the class of polynomial-time problems, yields a robust and expedient explication of "possible in practice". In this approach, the complexity is bounded by a polynomial function of the input size, rather than bounded by a constant (as in strict finitism), thus resolving the sorites issues. We show that a system of strictly bounded arithmetic, introduced by Sam Buss, precisely formalizes the feasibilist view so as to satisfy Dummett's requirements.</description>

      <title>On evaluating the measure of strong projections in infinite dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Projections of finite dimensional sets and their measures are investigated in infinite-dimensional power measure spaces. The starting point is the known algebraic formula, expressing \ the $y$-projection of a finite-dimensional set $a$ as a Boolean supremum of certain finite geometrical transformations of $a$ in the infinite-dimensional power space. This Boolean supremum somewhat unusual in classical measure theory because, it is different, in general, from the usual union of sets. The paper investigates the problem whether the power measure in the infinite-dimensional measure space is continuous with respect to the forementioned Boolean supremum. If so, then this continuity leads to a simple formula for calculating the measure of the projection of $a.$ It is shown that the answer concerning this continuity is affirmative for discrete measures but false for the Lebesgue measure, for example. However, it is proved that if the concept of the $y$-projection of $a$ is replaced by that of the so-called \textit{strong} $y$-\textit{projection} of $a,$ then the Lebesgue measure becomes continuous in this context and the value of the corresponding real supremum is exactly the measure of the foregoing strong $y $-projection. In this paper, the tools of the classical analysis are adapted to handle measures on Boolean algebras.</description>

      <title>The proof theory and semantics of second-order (intuitionistic) tense logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a second-order extension of intuitionistic modal logic, allowing quantification over propositions, both syntactically and semantically. A key feature of second-order logic is its capacity to define positive connectives from the negative fragment. Duly we are able to recover the diamond (and its associated theory) using only boxes, as long as we include both forward and backward modalities (`tense' modalities).
  We propose axiomatic, proof theoretic and model theoretic definitions of `second-order intuitionistic tense logic', and ultimately prove that they all coincide. In particular we establish completeness of a labelled sequent calculus via a proof search argument, yielding at the same time a cut-admissibility result. Our methodology also applies to the classical version of second-order tense logic, which we develop in tandem with the intuitionistic case.</description>

      <title>Computable $K$-theory for C*-algebras II: AF algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We continue the study of the effective content of $K$-theory for C*-algebras, with a focus on AF algebras. We show that from a c.e. presentation of an AF algebra it is possible to compute a representation of the algebra as an inductive limit of finite-dimensional algebras. Using this, and an analogous result for dimension groups, we show that the computable $K_0$ functor provides a computable equivalence of categories between c.e. presentations of AF algebras and c.e. presentations of unital (scaled) dimension groups, giving an effective version of Elliott's classification theorem. We use our results to determine the complexity of the index set and isomorphism problems for various classes of AF algebras.</description>

      <title>Topological Semantics for Common Inductive Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lewis' account of common knowledge in Convention describes the generation of higher-order expectations between agents as hinging upon agents' inductive standards and a shared witness. This paper attempts to draw from insights in learning theory to provide a formal account of common inductive knowledge and how it can be generated by a witness. Our language has a rather rich syntax in order to capture equally rich notions central to Lewis' account of common knowledge; for instance, we speak of an agent 'having some reason to believe' a proposition and one proposition 'indicating' to an agent that another proposition holds. A similar line of work was pursued by Cubitt &amp; Sugden 2003; however, their account was left wanting for a corresponding semantics. Our syntax affords a novel topological semantics which, following Kelly 1996's approach in The Logic of Reliable Inquiry, takes as primitives agents' information bases. In particular, we endow each agent with a 'switching tolerance' meant to represent their personal inductive standards for learning. Curiously, when all agents are truly inductive learners (not choosing to believe only those propositions which are deductively verified), we show that the set of worlds where a proposition $P$ is common inductive knowledge is invariant of agents' switching tolerances. Contrarily, the question of whether a specific witness $W$ generates common inductive knowledge of $P$ is sensitive to changing agents' switching tolerances. After establishing soundness of our proof system with respect to this semantics, we conclude by applying our logic to solve an 'inductive' variant of the coordinated attack problem.</description>

      <title>Ordinals and recursively defined functions on the reals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17210v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We determine sufficient conditions under which certain recursively defined functions are well defined for all real inputs. Given a function $f:\mathbb R\to\mathbb R$, call a decreasing sequence $x_1&gt;x_2&gt;x_3&gt;\cdots$ "$f$-bad" if $f(x_1)&gt;f(x_2)&gt;f(x_3)&gt;\cdots$, and call the function $f$ "ordinal decreasing" if there exist no infinite $f$-bad sequences. We prove the following result: Given ordinal decreasing functions $f,g_1,\ldots,g_k,s$ that are everywhere larger than $0$, define the recursive algorithm "$M(x)$: if $x&lt;0$ return $f(x)$, else return $g_1(-M(x-g_2(-M(x-\cdots-g_k(-M(x-s(x)))\cdots))))$". Then $M(x)$ halts and is ordinal decreasing for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$. The recursive algorithms $M$ and $M_n$ previously studied in the context of fusible numbers by Ericskon et al. (2022) and Bufetov et al. (2024), respectively, are special cases of this scheme.
  Moreover, given an ordinal decreasing function $f$, denote by $o(f)$ the ordinal height of the root of the tree of $f$-bad sequences. Then we prove that, for $k\ge 2$, the function $M(x)$ defined by the above algorithm satisfies $o(M)\le\varphi_{k-1}(\gamma+o(s)+1)$, where $\gamma$ is the smallest ordinal such that $\max\{o(s),o(f),o(g_1), \ldots, o(g_k)\} &lt;\varphi_{k-1}(\gamma)$.</description>

Abstract: We study the join-semilattice of constructibility real degrees in the side-by-side Sacks model, the model of set theory obtained by forcing with a countable-support product of infinitely many Sacks forcings over the constructible universe. In particular, we prove that in the side-by-side Sacks model the join-semilattice of constructibility real degrees is rigid, i.e. it does not have non-trivial automorphisms.</description>
