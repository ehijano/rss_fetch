      <title>Distribution of the cokernels of determinantal row-sparse matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the distribution of the cokernels of random row-sparse integral matrices $A_n$ according to the determinantal measure from a structured matrix $B_n$ with a parameter $k_n \ge 3$. Under a mild assumption on the growth rate of $k_n$, we prove that the distribution of the $p$-Sylow subgroup of the cokernel of $A_n$ converges to that of Cohen--Lenstra for every prime $p$. Our result extends the work of A. M\'esz\'aros which established convergence to the Cohen--Lenstra distribution when $p \ge 5$ and $k_n=3$ for all positive integers $n$.</description>

      <title>Variational principles for Hausdorff and packing dimensions of fractal percolation on self-affine sponges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish variational principles for the Hausdorff and packing dimensions of a class of statistically self-affine sponges, including in particular fractal percolation sets obtained from Bara\'nski and Gatzouras-Lalley carpets and sponges. Our first step is to compute the Hausdorff and packing dimensions of non-degenerate inhomogeneous Mandelbrot measures supported on the associated random limit sets. This is not a straightforward combination of the existing approaches for the deterministic inhomogeneous Bernoulli measures and the Mandelbrot measures on random Sierpi\'nski sponges; it reveals new structural features. The variational principles rely on a specific subclass of inhomogeneous Mandelbrot measures, which are connected to localized digit frequencies in the underlying coding space. This connection makes it possible to construct effective coverings of the random limit set, leading to sharp upper bounds for its Hausdorff and packing dimensions.</description>

      <title>Delocalization of random band matrices at the edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider $N\times N$ Hermitian random band matrices $H=(H_{xy})$, whose entries are centered complex Gaussian random variables. The indices $x,y$ range over the $d$-dimensional discrete torus $(\mathbb Z/L\mathbb Z)^d$ with $d\in \{1,2\}$ and $N=L^d$. The variance profile $S_{xy}=\mathbb E|h_{xy}|^2$ exhibits a banded structure: $S_{xy}=0$ if the distance $|x-y|$ exceeds a band width parameter $W\le L$. Let $W=L^\alpha$ for some exponent $0&lt;\alpha\le 1$. We show that as $\alpha$ increases from $\mathbf 1_{d=1}/2$ to $1-d/6$, the range of energies corresponding to delocalized eigenvectors gradually expands from the bulk toward the entire spectrum. More precisely, we prove that eigenvectors associated with energies $E$ satisfying $2 - |E| \gg N^{-c_{d,\alpha}}$ are delocalized, where the exponent $c_{d,\alpha}$ is given by $c_{d,\alpha} = 2\alpha - 1$ in dimension 1 and $c_{d,\alpha} = \alpha$ in dimension 2. Furthermore, when $\alpha &gt; 1-d/6$, all eigenvectors of $H$ become delocalized. In this regime, we also establish quantum unique ergodicity for all eigenvectors, along with a rigidity estimate for eigenvalues. Our findings extend previous results -- established in the bulk regime for one-dimensional (1D) (arXiv:2501.01718) and two-dimensional (2D) (arXiv:2503.07606) random band matrices -- to the entire spectrum, particularly near the spectral edges. They also complement the results of arXiv:0906.4047 and arXiv:2401.00492, which concern the edge eigenvalue statistics for 1D and 2D random band matrices.</description>

      <title>Generalised principal eigenvalues and global survival of branching Markov processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study necessary and sufficient criteria for global survival of discrete or continuous-time branching Markov processes. We relate these to several definitions of generalised principle eigenvalues for elliptic operators due to Berestycki and Rossi. In doing so, we extend these notions to fairly general semigroups of linear positive operators. We use this relation to prove new results about the generalised principle eigenvalues, as well as about uniqueness and non-uniqueness of stationary solutions of a generalised FKPP equation. The probabilistic approach through branching processes gives rise to relatively simple and transparent proofs under much more general assumptions, as well as constructions of (counter-)examples to certain conjectures.</description>

      <title>Extending P\'olya's random walker beyond probability I. Complex weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Working in combinatorial model $\mathrm{W_{co}}(d)$, $d=1,2,\dots$, of P\'olya's random walker in $\mathbb{Z}^d$, we prove two theorems on recurrence to a vertex. We obtain an effective version of the first theorem in case $d=2$. Using a semi-formal approach to generating functions, we extend both theorems beyond probability to a more general model $\mathrm{W_{\mathbb{C}}}$ with complex weights. We relate models $\mathrm{W_{co}}(d)$ to standard models $\mathrm{W_{Ma}}(d)$ based on Markov chains. The follow-up article will treat non-Archimedean models $\mathrm{W_{fo}}(k)$ in which weights are formal power series in $\mathbb{C}[[x_1,x_2,\dots,x_k]]$.</description>

      <title>Martingale Solutions of Fractional Stochastic Reaction-Diffusion Equations Driven by Superlinear Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the existence of martingale solutions of a class of stochastic equations with pseudo-monotone drift of polynomial growth of arbitrary order and a continuous diffusion term with superlinear growth. Both the nonlinear drift and diffusion terms are not required to be locally Lipschitz continuous. We then apply the abstract result to establish the existence of martingale solutions of the fractional stochastic reaction-diffusion equation with polynomial drift driven by a superlinear noise. The pseudo-monotonicity techniques and the Skorokhod-Jakubowski representation theorem in a topological space are used to pass to the limit of a sequence of approximate solutions defined by the Galerkin method.</description>

      <title>Speeding up quantum Markov processes through lifting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the concept of non-reversible lifts for reversible diffusion processes initiated by Eberle and Lorler (2024) to quantum Markov dynamics. The lifting operation, which naturally results in hypocoercive processes, can be formally interpreted as, though not restricted to, the reverse of the overdamped limit. We prove that the $L^2$ convergence rate of the lifted process is bounded above by the square root of the spectral gap of its overdamped dynamics, indicating that the lifting approach can at most achieve a transition from diffusive to ballistic mixing speeds. Further, using the variational hypocoercivity framework based on space-time Poincare inequalities, we derive a lower bound for the convergence rate of the lifted dynamics. These findings not only offer quantitative convergence guarantees for hypocoercive quantum Markov processes but also characterize the potential and limitations of accelerating the convergence through lifting. In addition, we develop an abstract lifting framework in the Hilbert space setting applicable to any symmetric contraction $C_0$-semigroup, thereby unifying the treatment of classical and quantum dynamics. As applications, we construct optimal lifts for various detailed balanced classical and quantum processes, including the symmetric random walk on a chain, the depolarizing semigroup, Schur multipliers, and quantum Markov semigroups on group von Neumann algebras.</description>

      <title>An Explicit Description of Extreme Points of the Set of Couplings with Given Marginals: with Application to Minimum-Entropy Coupling Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given probability distributions ${\bf p}=(p_1,p_2,\ldots,p_m)$ and ${\bf q}=(q_1,q_2,\ldots, q_n)$ with $m,n\geq 2$, denote by ${\cal C}(\bf p,q)$ the set of all couplings of $\bf p,q$, a convex subset of $\R^{mn}$. Denote by ${\cal C}_e({\bf p},{\bf q})$ the finite set of all extreme points of ${\cal C}(\bf p,q)$. It is well known that, as a strictly concave function, the Shannan entropy $H$ on ${\cal C}(\bf p,q)$ takes its minimal value in ${\cal C}_e({\bf p},{\bf q})$. In this paper, first, the detailed structure of ${\cal C}_e({\bf p},{\bf q})$ is well specified and all extreme points are enumerated by a special algorithm. As an application, the exact solution of the minimum-entropy coupling problem is obtained. Second, it is proved that for any strict Schur-concave function $\Psi$ on ${\cal C}(\bf p,q)$, $\Psi$ also takes its minimal value on ${\cal C}_e({\bf p},{\bf q})$. As an application, the exact solution of the minimum-entropy coupling problem is obtained for $(\Phi,\hbar)$-entropy, a large class of entropy including Shannon entropy, R\'enyi entropy and Tsallis entropy etc. Finally, all the above are generalized to multi-marginal case.</description>

      <title>Gaussian fluctuations of generalized $U$-statistics and subgraph counting in the binomial random-connection model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive normal approximation bounds for generalized $U$-statistics of the form \begin{equation*}
  S_{n,k}(f):=\sum_{
  1 \leq \beta (1),\dots,\beta (k) \leq n \atop
  \beta (i)\ne\beta (j), \ 1\leq i\ne j \leq k}
  f\big(X_{\beta (1)},\dots,X_{\beta (k)},Y_{\beta (1),\beta (2)},\dots,Y_{\beta (k-1),\beta (k)}\big),
  \end{equation*}
  where $\{X_i\}_{i=1}^n$ and $\{Y_{i,j}\}_{1\le i&lt;j\le n}$ are independent sequences of i.i.d. random variables. Our approach relies on moment identities and cumulant bounds that are derived using partition diagram arguments. Normal approximation bounds in the Kolmogorov distance and moderate deviation results are then obtained by the cumulant method. Those results are applied to subgraph counting in the binomial random-connection model, which is a generalization of the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi model.</description>

Abstract: Let $\{(X_t)_{t\geq 0}, \mathbb{P}_x, x\in E\}$ be a supercritical symmetric branching Markov process on a locally compact metric measure space $(E,\mu)$ with spatially dependent local branching mechanism. Under some assumptions on the semigroup of the spatial motion, we first prove law of iterated logarithm type results for $\langle f, X_t\rangle$ under the second moment condition, where $f$ is a linear combination of eigenfunctions of the mean semigroup $\{T_t, t\geq0\}$ of $X$. Then we prove law of iterated logarithm type results for $\langle f, X_t\rangle$ under the fourth moment condition, where $f\in T_r(L^2(E, \mu))$ for some $r&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>Ergodic properties of concurrent systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A concurrent system is defined as a monoid action of a trace monoid on a finite set of states. Concurrent systems represent state models where the state is distributed and where state changes are local. Starting from a spectral property on the combinatorics of concurrent systems, we prove the existence and uniqueness of a Markov measure on the space of infinite trajectories relatively to any weight distributions. In turn, we obtain a combinatorial result by proving that the kernel of the associated M\"obius matrix has dimension 1; the M\"obius matrix extends in this context the M\"obius polynomial of a trace monoid. We study ergodic properties of irreducible concurrent systems and we prove a Strong law of large numbers. It allows us to introduce the speedup as a measurement of the average amount of concurrency within infinite trajectories. Examples are studied.</description>

      <title>Convergence to equilibrium for density dependent Markov jump processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the convergence to (quasi--)equilibrium of a density dependent Markov chain in~${\mathbb Z}^d$, whose drift satisfies a system of ordinary differential equations having an attractive fixed point. For a sequence of such processes~${\mathbb X}^N$, indexed by a size parameter~$N$, the time taken until the distribution of~${\mathbb X}^N$, started in some given state, approaches its equilibrium distribution~$\pi^N$ typically increases with~$N$. To first order, it corresponds to the time~$t_N$ at which the solution to the drift equations reaches a distance of~$\sqrt N$ from their fixed point. However, the length of the time interval over which the total variation distance between ${\mathcal L} ({\mathbb X}^N(t))$ and its equilibrium distribution~$\pi^N$ changes from being close to~$1$ to being close to zero is asymptotically of smaller order than~$t_N$. In this sense, the chains exhibit `cut--off', and we are able to prove that the cut-off window is of (optimal) constant size.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we establish the It\^o-Wentzell-Lions formulae for flows of both full and conditional measures on general semimartingales. This generalizes the existing works on flows of measures on It\^o processes. The key technical components involve an appropriate approximation of random fields by cylindrical functions and localization techniques. Moreover, we present the specific formulae in two special cases, including It\^o-Wentzell-Lions formulae for time-space-measure-dependent functions and for functions driven by Poisson random measures.</description>

      <title>A Malliavin-Gamma calculus approach to Score Based Diffusion Generative models for random fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We adopt a Gamma and Malliavin Calculi point of view in order to generalize Score-based diffusion Generative Models (SGMs) to an infinite-dimensional abstract Hilbertian setting. Particularly, we define the forward noising process using Dirichlet forms associated to the Cameron-Martin space of Gaussian measures and Wiener chaoses; whereas by relying on an abstract time-reversal formula, we show that the score function is a Malliavin derivative and it corresponds to a conditional expectation. This allows us to generalize SGMs to the infinite-dimensional setting. Moreover, we extend existing finite-dimensional entropic convergence bounds to this Hilbertian setting by highlighting the role played by the Cameron-Martin norm in the Fisher information of the data distribution. Lastly, we specify our discussion for spherical random fields, considering as source of noise a Whittle-Mat\'ern random spherical field.</description>

      <title>Heyde characterization theorem for some classes of locally compact Abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $L_1$ and $L_2$ be linear forms of real-valued independent random variables. By Heyde's theorem, if the conditional distribution of $L_2$ given $L_1$ is symmetric, then the random variables are Gaussian. A number of papers are devoted to generalisation of Heyde's theorem to the case, where independent random variables take values in a locally compact Abelian group $X$. The article continues these studies. We consider the case, where $X$ is either a totally disconnected group or is of the form $\mathbb{R}^n\times G$, where $G$ is a totally disconnected group consisting of compact elements. The proof is based on the study of solutions of the Heyde functional equation on the character group of the original group. In so doing, we use methods of abstract harmonic analysis.</description>

      <title>Weak convergence of the integral of semi-Markov processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic properties, in the weak sense, of regenerative processes and Markov renewal processes. For the latter, we derive both renewal-type results, also concerning the related counting process, and ergodic-type ones, including the so-called phi-mixing property. This theoretical framework permits us to study the weak limit of the integral of a semi-Markov process, which can be interpret as the position of a particle moving with finite velocities taken for a random time according to the Markov renewal process underlying the semi-Markov one. Under mild conditions, we obtain the weak convergence to scaled Brownian motion. As a particular case, this result establishes the weak convergence of the classical generalized telegraph process.</description>

      <title>Limit distribution of the sample volume fraction of Boolean set</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the limit distribution of the volume fraction estimator $\widehat p_{\lambda, A}$ (= the Lebesgue measure of the intersection $\mathcal{X}\cap (\lambda A)$ of a random set $\mathcal{X}$ with a large observation set $\lambda A$, divided by the Lebesgue measure of $\lambda A$), as $\lambda \to \infty$, for a Boolean set $\mathcal{X}$ formed by uniformly scattered random grains $\Xi \subset \mathbb{R}^\nu$. We obtain general conditions on generic grain set $\Xi$ under which $\widehat p_{\lambda, A}$ has an $\alpha$-stable limit distribution with index $1 &lt; \alpha \le 2$. A large class of Boolean models with randomly homothetic grains satisfying these conditions is introduced. We also discuss the limit distribution of the sample volume fraction of a Boolean set
  observed on a large subset of a $\nu_0$-dimensional $(1 \le \nu_0 \le \nu -1$) hyperplane of $\mathbb{R}^\nu$.</description>

      <title>The localization transition for the directed polymer in a random environment is smooth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When $d\ge 3$, the directed polymer a in random environment on $\mathbb Z^d$ is known to display a phase transition from a diffusive phase, known as \textit{weak disorder} to a localized phase, referred to as \textit{strong disorder}. This transition is encoded by the behavior of the the free energy of the model, defined by $$\mathfrak f(\beta):=\lim_{N\to \infty} (1/n)\log W^{\beta}_n$$ where $W^{\beta}_n$ is the normalized partition function for the directed polymer of length $n$. More precisely weak disorder corresponds to $\mathfrak f(\beta)=0$ and strong disorder to $\mathfrak f(\beta)&lt;0$. Monotonicity and continuity of $\mathfrak f$ implies that there exists $\beta_c\in [0,\infty]$ such that weak disorder is equivalent to $\beta\in [0,\beta_c]$. Furthermore $\beta_c&gt;0$ if and only if $d\ge 3$. We prove that this transition is infinitely smooth in the sense that $\mathfrak f$ grows slower than any power function at the vicinity of $\beta_c$, that is $$ \lim_{\beta \downarrow \beta_c }\frac{\log |\mathfrak f(\beta)|}{\log (\beta-\beta_c)}=\infty.$$</description>

      <title>Theory: Multidimensional Space of Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper extends Bayesian probability theory by developing a multidimensional space of events (MDSE) theory that accounts for mutual influences between events and hypotheses sets. While traditional Bayesian approaches assume conditional independence between certain variables, real-world systems often exhibit complex interdependencies that limit classical model applicability. Building on established probabilistic foundations, our approach introduces a mathematical formalism for modeling these complex relationships. We developed the MDSE theory through rigorous mathematical derivation and validated it using three complementary methodologies: analytical proofs, computational simulations, and case studies drawn from diverse domains. Results demonstrate that MDSE successfully models complex dependencies with 15-20% improved prediction accuracy compared to standard Bayesian methods when applied to datasets with high interdimensionality. This theory particularly excels in scenarios with over 50 interrelated variables, where traditional methods show exponential computational complexity growth while MDSE maintains polynomial scaling. Our findings indicate that MDSE provides a viable mathematical foundation for extending Bayesian reasoning to complex systems while maintaining computational tractability. This approach offers practical applications in engineering challenges including risk assessment, resource optimization, and forecasting problems where multiple interdependent factors must be simultaneously considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper discusses the challenges encountered in building a ranking model for aggregator site products, using the example of ranking microfinance institutions (MFIs) based on post-click conversion. We suggest which features of MFIs should be considered, and using an algorithm based on Markov chains, we demonstrate the ``usefulness'' of these features on real data. The ideas developed in this work can be applied to aggregator websites in microinsurance, especially when personal data is unavailable. Since we did not find similar datasets in the public domain, we are publishing our dataset with a detailed description of its attributes.</description>

      <title>Integrability and exact large deviations of the weakly-asymmetric exclusion process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The weakly asymmetric exclusion process (WASEP) in one dimension is a paradigmatic system of interacting particles described by the macroscopic fluctuation theory (MFT) in the presence of driving. We consider an initial condition with densities $\rho_1,\rho_2$ on either side of the origin, so that for $\rho_1=\rho_2$ the gas is stationary. Starting from the microscopic description, we obtain exact formulae for the cumulant generating functions, and large deviation rate functions of the time-integrated current and the position of a tracer. As the asymmetry/driving is increased, these describe the crossover between the symmetric exclusion process (SSEP) and the weak noise regime of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation: we recover the two limits and describe the crossover from the WASEP cubic tail to the $5/2$ and $3/2$ KPZ tail exponents. Finally, we show that the MFT of the WASEP is classically integrable, by exhibiting the explicit Lax pairs, which are obtained through a novel mapping between the MFT of the WASEP and a complex extension of the classical anisotropic Landau-Lifshitz spin chain. This shows integrability of all MFTs of asymmetric models with quadratic mobility as well as their dual versions.</description>

      <title>Proximal optimal transport divergences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce proximal optimal transport divergence, a novel discrepancy measure that interpolates between information divergences and optimal transport distances via an infimal convolution formulation. This divergence provides a principled foundation for optimal transport proximals and proximal optimization methods frequently used in generative modeling. We explore its mathematical properties, including smoothness, boundedness, and computational tractability, and establish connections to primal-dual formulation and adversarial learning. Building on the Benamou-Brenier dynamic formulation of optimal transport cost, we also establish a dynamic formulation for proximal OT divergences. The resulting dynamic formulation is a first order mean-field game whose optimality conditions are governed by a pair of nonlinear partial differential equations, a backward Hamilton-Jacobi and a forward continuity partial differential equations. Our framework generalizes existing approaches while offering new insights and computational tools for generative modeling, distributional optimization, and gradient-based learning in probability spaces.</description>

      <title>Propagation of chaos and approximation error of random batch particle system in the mean field regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The random batch method [J. Comput. Phys. 400 (2020) 108877] is not only an efficient algorithm for simulation of classical $N$-particle systems and their mean-field limit, but also a new model for interacting particle system that could be more physical in some applications. In this work, we establish the propagation of chaos for the random batch particle system and at the same time obtain its sharp approximation error to the classical mean field limit of $N$-particle systems. The proof leverages the BBGKY hierarchy and achieves a sharp bound both in the particle number $N$ and the time step $\tau$. In particular, by introducing a coupling of the division of the random batches to resolve the $N$-dependence, we derive an $\mathcal{O}(k^2/N^2 + k\tau^2)$ bound on the $k$-particle relative entropy between the law of the system and the tensorized law of the mean-field limit. This result provides a useful understanding of the convergence properties of the random batch system in the mean field regime.</description>

      <title>Spectral moments of complex and symplectic non-Hermitian random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study non-Hermitian random matrices belonging to the symmetry classes of the complex and symplectic Ginibre ensemble, and present a unifying and systematic framework for analysing mixed spectral moments involving both holomorphic and anti-holomorphic parts. For weight functions that induce a recurrence relation of the associated planar orthogonal polynomials, we derive explicit formulas for the spectral moments in terms of their orthogonal norms. This includes exactly solvable models such as the elliptic Ginibre ensemble and non-Hermitian Wishart matrices. In particular, we show that the holomorphic spectral moments of complex non-Hermitian random matrices coincide with those of their Hermitian limit up to a multiplicative constant, determined by the non-Hermiticity parameter. Moreover, we show that the spectral moments of the symplectic non-Hermitian ensemble admit a decomposition into two parts: one corresponding to the complex ensemble and the other constituting an explicit correction term. This structure closely parallels that found in the Hermitian setting, which naturally arises as the Hermitian limit of our results. Within this general framework, we perform a large-$N$ asymptotic analysis of the spectral moments for the elliptic Ginibre and non-Hermitian Wishart ensemble, revealing the mixed moments of the elliptic and non-Hermitian Marchenko--Pastur laws. Furthermore, for the elliptic Ginibre ensemble, we employ a recently developed differential operator method for the associated correlation kernel, to derive an alternative explicit formula for the spectral moments and obtain their genus-type large-$N$ expansion.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Laplacians: Tunable principal component analysis under directional prior information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new family of algorithms for detecting and estimating a rank-one signal from a noisy observation under prior information about that signal's direction, focusing on examples where the signal is known to have entries biased to be positive. Given a matrix observation $\mathbf{Y}$, our algorithms construct a nonlinear Laplacian, another matrix of the form $\mathbf{Y} + \mathrm{diag}(\sigma(\mathbf{Y}\mathbf{1}))$ for a nonlinear $\sigma: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$, and examine the top eigenvalue and eigenvector of this matrix. When $\mathbf{Y}$ is the (suitably normalized) adjacency matrix of a graph, our approach gives a class of algorithms that search for unusually dense subgraphs by computing a spectrum of the graph "deformed" by the degree profile $\mathbf{Y}\mathbf{1}$. We study the performance of such algorithms compared to direct spectral algorithms (the case $\sigma = 0$) on models of sparse principal component analysis with biased signals, including the Gaussian planted submatrix problem. For such models, we rigorously characterize the critical threshold strength of rank-one signal, as a function of the nonlinearity $\sigma$, at which an outlier eigenvalue appears in the spectrum of a nonlinear Laplacian. While identifying the $\sigma$ that minimizes this critical signal strength in closed form seems intractable, we explore three approaches to design $\sigma$ numerically: exhaustively searching over simple classes of $\sigma$, learning $\sigma$ from datasets of problem instances, and tuning $\sigma$ using black-box optimization of the critical signal strength. We find both theoretically and empirically that, if $\sigma$ is chosen appropriately, then nonlinear Laplacian spectral algorithms substantially outperform direct spectral algorithms, while avoiding the complexity of broader classes of algorithms like approximate message passing or general first order methods.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic analysis for a class of planar orthogonal polynomials on the unit disc</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We carry out the asymptotic analysis as $n \to \infty$ of a class of orthogonal polynomials $p_{n}(z)$ of degree $n$, defined with respect to the planar measure \begin{equation*} d\mu(z) = (1-|z|^{2})^{\alpha-1}|z-x|^{\gamma}\mathbf{1}_{|z| &lt; 1}d^{2}z, \end{equation*} where $d^{2}z$ is the two dimensional area measure, $\alpha$ is a parameter that can grow with $n$, while $\gamma&gt;-2$ and $x&gt;0$ are fixed. This measure arises naturally in the study of characteristic polynomials of non-Hermitian ensembles and generalises the example of a Gaussian weight that was recently studied by several authors. We obtain asymptotics in all regions of the complex plane and via an appropriate differential identity, we obtain the asymptotic expansion of the partition function. The main approach is to convert the planar orthogonality to one defined on suitable contours in the complex plane. Then the asymptotic analysis is performed using the Deift-Zhou steepest descent method for the associated Riemann-Hilbert problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the approximation of stochastic delay differential equations (SDDEs) via the backward Euler-Maruyama (BEM) method under generalized monotonicity and Khasminskii-type conditions in the infinite horizon. First, by establishing the uniform moment boundedness and finite-time strong convergence of the BEM method, we prove that for sufficiently small step sizes, the numerical approximations strongly converge to the underlying solution in the infinite horizon with a rate of $1/2$, which coincides with the optimal finite-time strong convergence rate.
  Next, we establish the uniform boundedness and convergence in probability for the segment processes associated with the BEM method. This analysis further demonstrates that the probability measures of the numerical segment processes converge to the underlying invariant measure of the SDDEs. Finally, a numerical example and simulations are provided to illustrate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Filtering in a hazard rate change-point model with financial and life-insurance applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13185v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a continuous-time filtering framework for estimating a hazard rate subject to an unobservable change-point. This framework arises naturally in both financial and insurance applications, where the default intensity of a firm or the mortality rate of an individual may experience a sudden jump at an unobservable time, representing, for instance, a shift in the firm's risk profile or a deterioration in an individual's health status. By employing a progressive enlargement of filtration, we integrate noisy observations of the hazard rate with default-related information. We characterise the filter, i.e. the conditional probability of the change-point given the information flow, as the unique strong solution to a stochastic differential equation driven by the innovation process enriched with the discontinuous component. A sensitivity analysis and a comparison of the filter's behaviour under various information structures are provided. Our framework further allows for the derivation of an explicit formula for the survival probability conditional on partial information. This result applies to the pricing of credit-sensitive financial instruments such as defaultable bonds, credit default swaps, and life insurance contracts. Finally, a numerical analysis illustrates how partial information leads to delayed adjustments in the estimation of the hazard rate and consequently to mispricing of credit-sensitive instruments when compared to a full-information setting.</description>

Abstract: We prove a new lower bound for the off-diagonal Ramsey numbers, \[ R(3,k) \geq \bigg( \frac{1}{3}+ o(1) \bigg) \frac{k^2}{\log k }\, , \] thereby narrowing the gap between the upper and lower bounds to a factor of $3+o(1)$. This improves the best known lower bound of $(1/4+o(1))k^2/\log k$ due, independently, to Bohman and Keevash, and Fiz Pontiveros, Griffiths and Morris, resulting from their celebrated analysis of the triangle-free process. As a consequence, we disprove a conjecture of Fiz Pontiveros, Griffiths and Morris that the constant $1/4$ is sharp.</description>

Abstract: Stochastic localization is a pathwise analysis technique originating from convex geometry. This paper explores certain algorithmic aspects of stochastic localization as a computational tool. First, we unify various existing stochastic localization schemes and discuss their localization rates and regularization. We then introduce a joint stochastic localization framework for constructing couplings between probability distributions. As an initial application, we extend the optimal couplings between normal distributions under the 2-Wasserstein distance to log-concave distributions and derive a normal approximation result. As a further application, we introduce a family of distributional distances based on the couplings induced by joint stochastic localization. Under a specific choice of the localization process, the induced distance is topologically equivalent to the 2-Wasserstein distance for probability measures supported on a common compact set. Moreover, weighted versions of this distance are related to several statistical divergences commonly used in practice. The proposed distances also motivate new methods for distribution estimation that are of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: Let $ A_n $ be an $n \times n$ random matrix with i.i.d Bernoulli($p$) entries. For a fixed positive integer $\beta$, suppose $p$ satisfies $$ \frac{ \log(n) }{ n } \le p \le c_\beta $$ where $c_\beta \in ( 0, 1/2 )$ is a $\beta$-dependentvalue. For $t \ge 0$, $$ \mathbb{P} \left\{ s_{ n - \beta + 1}(A) \le t n^{-2\beta + \mathfrak{n}(1) }(pn)^{-7} \right\} = t + ( 1 + o_\mathfrak{n}(1) ) \mathbb{P} \bigg\{ \mbox{either $\beta$ rows or $\beta$ columns of $A_n$ equal $\vec{0}$} \bigg\}. $$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.11643v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a branching random walk in time-inhomogeneous random environment, in which all particles at generation $k$ branch into the same random number of particles $\mathcal{L}_{k+1}\ge 2$, where the $\mathcal{L}_k$, $k\in\mathbb{N}$, are i.i.d., and the increments are standard normal. Let $\mathbb{P}$ denote the law of $(\mathcal{L}_k)_{k\in\mathbb{N}}$, and let $M_n$ denote the position of the maximal particle in generation $n$. We prove that there are $m_n$, which are functions of only $(\mathcal{L}_k)_{k\in\{0,\dots, n\}}$, such that (with regard to $\mathbb{P}$) the sequence $(M_n-m_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ is tight with high probability.</description>

Abstract: We prove a frequency-independent bound on trigonometric functions of a class of singular Gaussian random fields, which arise naturally from weak universality problems for singular stochastic PDEs. This enables us to reduce the regularity assumption on the nonlinearity of the microscopic models in KPZ and dynamical $\Phi^4_3$ in [HX19] and [FG19] to that required by PDE structures.</description>

Abstract: For a certain class of McKean-Vlasov processes, we introduce proxy processes that substitute the mean-field interaction with self-interaction, employing a weighted occupation measure. Our study encompasses two key achievements. First, we demonstrate the ergodicity of the self-interacting dynamics, under broad conditions, by applying the reflection coupling method. Second, in scenarios where the drifts are negative intrinsic gradients of convex mean-field potential functionals, we use entropy and functional inequalities to demonstrate that the stationary measures of the self-interacting processes approximate the invariant measures of the corresponding McKean-Vlasov processes. As an application, we show how to learn the optimal weights of a two-layer neural network by training a single neuron.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a large deviation principle for families of random variables in the basin of attraction of spectrally positive stable distributions by proving a uniform version of the Tauberian theorem for Laplace-Stieltjes transforms. The main advantage of this method is that it can be easily applied to cases that are beyond the reach of the techniques currently used in the literature. Notable examples include large deviations for random walks with long-ranged memory kernels, as well as for randomly stopped sums where the random time $N$ is either not concentrated around its expectation or has an infinite mean. The method reveals the role of the characteristic function when Cram\'er's condition is violated and provides a unified approach within regular variation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with the three dimensional Euler equations driven by an additive stochastic forcing. First, we construct global H\"{o}lder continuous (stationary) solutions in $C(\mathbb{R};C^{\vartheta})$ space for some $\vartheta&gt;0$ via a different method from \cite{LZ24}. Our approach is based on applying stochastic convex integration to the construction of Euler flows in \cite{DelSze13} to derive uniform moment estimates independent of time. Second, for any divergence-free H\"{o}lder continuous initial condition, we show the existence of infinitely many global-in-time probabilistically strong and analytically weak solutions in $L^p_{\rm{loc}}([0,\infty);C^{\vartheta'}) \cap C_{\rm{loc}}([0,\infty);H^{-1})$ for all $p\in [1,\infty)$ and some $\vartheta'&gt;0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this second of two articles, we study the multiple radial $\mathrm{SLE}(0)$ systems as the deterministic limits of the random multiple radial $\mathrm{SLE}(\kappa)$ systems. We construct the multiple radial SLE(0) systems from stationary relations by heuristically taking the limit of partition functions as $\kappa \rightarrow 0$. By constructing the field integrals of motion for the Loewner dynamics, we show that the traces of multiple radial SLE(0) systems are the horizontal trajectories of an equivalence class of quadratic differentials. These trajectories have limiting ends at the boundary points $\{z_1,z_2,\ldots,z_n\}$. The stationary relations connect the classification of multiple radial SLE(0) systems to the enumeration of critical points of the master function of trigonometric Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (KZ) equations. In the deterministic case of $\kappa=0$, we show that the Loewner dynamics with a common parametrization of capacity form a special class of classical Calogero-Sutherland systems, restricted to a submanifold of phase space defined by the Lax matrix.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian superposition process model for stochastically describing concentration-discharge relationship</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10535v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Concentration-discharge relationship is crucial in river hydrology, as it reflects water quality dynamics across both low- and high-flow regimes. However, its mathematical description is still challenging owing to the underlying complex physics and chemistry. This study proposes an infinite-dimensional stochastic differential equation model that effectively describes the concentration-discharge relationship while staying analytically tractable, along with the computational aspects of the model. The proposed model is based on the superposition of the square-root processes (or Cox-Ingersoll-Ross processes) and its variants, through which both the long-term moments and autocovariance of river discharge and the fluctuation of water quality index can be derived in closed forms. Particularly, the model captures both long (power decay) and short (exponential decay) memories of the fluctuation in a unified manner, while quantifying the hysteresis in the concentration-discharge relationship through mutual covariances with time lags. Based on a verified numerical method, the model is computationally applied to weekly data on total nitrogen (TN. long memory with moderate fluctuation), total phosphorus (TP. short memory with large fluctuation), and total organic carbon (TOC. short memory with moderate fluctuation) from a rural catchment to validate its applicability to real-world datasets. Based on the identified model and its mutual covariance, our findings indicate that, on average, the peak concentrations of these water quality indices appear approximately 1 day after discharge. Finally, the study discusses the effects of model uncertainty on mutual covariance.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents an algorithm for applying the high-order recombination method, originally introduced by Lyons and Litterer in ``High-order recombination and an application to cubature on Wiener space'' (Ann. Appl. Probab. 22(4):1301--1327, 2012), to practical problems in mathematical finance. A refined error analysis is provided, yielding a sharper condition for space partitioning. Based on this condition, a computationally feasible recursive partitioning algorithm is developed. Numerical examples are also included, demonstrating that the proposed algorithm effectively avoids the explosive growth in the cardinality of the support required to achieve high-order approximations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a branching random walk that drifts to infinity, consider its Malthusian martingale, i.e.~the additive martingale with parameter $\theta$ being the smallest root of the characteristic equation. When particles are killed below the origin, we show that the limit of this martingale admits an exponential tail, contrary to the case without killing, where the tail is polynomial. In the critical case, where the characteristic equation has a single root, the same holds for the (truncated) derivative martingale, as we show. This study is motivated by recent work on first passage percolation on Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By taking the viewpoint of Brownian additive functionals, we extend an existing approximation theorem of the two-dimensional Laplacian singularly perturbed at the origin. The approximate operators are defined by adding a rescaled function to the two-dimensional Laplacian such that the support of the perturbation thus produced converges to a point in the limit of the rescaling, and suitable renormalizations of the coupling constants are also imposed. The first main theorem assumes the zero total mass of the function for rescaling. It proves the limits of the approximate resolvents up to an extended criticality defined by two levels of phase transitions. The second main theorem handles the case of positive total mass of the function for rescaling and proves an asymptotic expansion of a multivariate density induced by the approximate resolvent. Moreover, this expansion is valid beyond criticality.</description>

      <title>A proof of Onsager's conjecture for the stochastic 3D Euler equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the stochastic 3D Euler equations on a periodic domain $\mathbb{T}^3$, driven by a $GG^*$-Wiener process $B$ of trace class:
  \begin{align*}
  \mathrm{d} u+\mathrm{div}(u\otimes u)\,\mathrm{d} t+\nabla p\,\mathrm{d}t=\mathrm{d}B, \quad \mathrm{div} u=0.
  \end{align*} First, for any $\vartheta&lt;1/3$, we construct infinitely many global-in-time probabilistically strong and analytically weak solutions $u\in C([0,\infty),C^{\vartheta}(\mathbb{T}^3,\mathbb{R}^3))$. These solutions dissipate the energy pathwisely up to a stopping time $\mathfrak{t}$, which can be chosen arbitrarily large with high probability, i.e. it holds almost surely
  \begin{align*}
  \|u(t\wedge\mathfrak{t})\|_{L^2}^2&lt; \|u(s\wedge\mathfrak{t})\|_{L^2}^2 +2 \int_{s\wedge\mathfrak{t}}^{t\wedge\mathfrak{t}} \big\langle u(r), \mathrm{d} B(r) \big\rangle +\mathrm{Tr}\big(GG^*\big) (t\wedge\mathfrak{t}-s\wedge\mathfrak{t}),
  \end{align*}
  for any $0\leq s &lt; t&lt;\infty$. We also provide a brief proof of energy conservation for $\vartheta&gt;1/3$ based on \cite{CET94}, thereby confirming the Onsager theorem for the stochastic 3D Euler equations. Second, let $0&lt;\bar{\vartheta}&lt;\bar{\beta}&lt;1/3$, we construct infinitely many global-in-time probabilistically strong and analytically weak solutions in $C([0,\infty),C^{\bar{\vartheta}}(\mathbb{T}^3,\mathbb{R}^3))$ for arbitrary divergence-free initial data in $C^{\bar{\beta}}(\mathbb{T}^3,\mathbb{R}^3)$. Our construction relies on the convex integration method developed in the deterministic setting by \cite{Ise18}, adapting it to the stochastic context by introducing a novel energy inequality into the convex integration scheme and combining stochastic analysis arguments with a Wong--Zakai type estimate.</description>

Abstract: We show that discrete stationary random subgroups of isometry groups of Gromov hyperbolic spaces have full limit sets as well as critical exponents bounded from below. This information is used to answer a question of Gelander and show that a rank one locally symmetric space for which the bottom of the spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami operator is the same as that of its universal cover has unbounded injectivity radius.</description>

      <title>Distorted optimal transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classic optimal transport theory is formulated through minimizing the expected transport cost between two given distributions. We propose the framework of distorted optimal transport by minimizing a distorted expected cost, which is the cost under a non-linear expectation. This new formulation is motivated by concrete problems in decision theory, robust optimization, and risk management, and it has many distinct features compared to the classic theory. We choose simple cost functions and study different distortion functions and their implications on the optimal transport plan. We show that on the real line, the comonotonic coupling is optimal for the distorted optimal transport problem when the distortion function is convex and the cost function is submodular and monotone. Some forms of duality and uniqueness results are provided. For inverse-S-shaped distortion functions and linear cost, we obtain the unique form of optimal coupling for all marginal distributions, which turns out to have an interesting ``first comonotonic, then counter-monotonic" dependence structure; for S-shaped distortion functions a similar structure is obtained. Our results highlight several challenges and features in distorted optimal transport, offering a new mathematical bridge between the fields of probability, decision theory, and risk management.</description>

      <title>A Categorical Treatment of Open Linear Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03934v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An open stochastic system \`a la Jan Willems is a system affected by two qualitatively different kinds of uncertainty: one is probabilistic fluctuation, and the other one is nondeterminism caused by a fundamental lack of information. We present a formalization of open stochastic systems in the language of category theory. Central to this is the notion of copartiality which models how the lack of information propagates through a system (corresponding to the coarseness of sigma-algebras in Willems' work). As a concrete example, we study extended Gaussian distributions, which combine Gaussian probability with nondeterminism and correspond precisely to Willems' notion of Gaussian linear systems. We describe them both as measure-theoretic and abstract categorical entities, which enables us to rigorously describe a variety of phenomena like noisy physical laws and uninformative priors in Bayesian statistics. The category of extended Gaussian maps can be seen as a mutual generalization of Gaussian probability and linear relations, which connects the literature on categorical probability with ideas from control theory like signal-flow diagrams.</description>

      <title>Comparison results for positive supermodular dependent Markov tree distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Comparing strengths of positive dependencies is studied in the literature under rather strong assumptions such as equality of conditional distributions, exchangeability, or stationarity. We establish supermodular ordering results for distributions that are Markov with respect to a tree structure. Our comparison results rely on simple stochastic monotonicity conditions and a pointwise ordering of bivariate copulas associated with the edges of the underlying tree. We also study flexibility of the marginal distributions in stochastic and convex order. As a consequence, we obtain first- and second-order stochastic dominance results for extreme order statistics and sums of positively dependent random variables. As an application, we investigate distributional robustness of the maximum of a perturbed random walk under model uncertainty. Several examples and a detailed discussion of the assumptions demonstrate the generality of our results and reveal deeper insights into non-intuitive positive dependence properties of multidimensional distributions.</description>

      <title>Spectral complexity of deep neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09541v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that randomly initialized, push-forward, fully-connected neural networks weakly converge to isotropic Gaussian processes, in the limit where the width of all layers goes to infinity. In this paper, we propose to use the angular power spectrum of the limiting field to characterize the complexity of the network architecture. In particular, we define sequences of random variables associated with the angular power spectrum, and provide a full characterization of the network complexity in terms of the asymptotic distribution of these sequences as the depth diverges. On this basis, we classify neural networks as low-disorder, sparse, or high-disorder; we show how this classification highlights a number of distinct features for standard activation functions, and in particular, sparsity properties of ReLU networks. Our theoretical results are also validated by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Extended mean-field control problems with Poissonian common noise: Stochastic maximum principle and Hamiltonian-Jacobi-Bellman equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies mean-field control problems with state-control joint law dependence and Poissonian common noise. We develop the stochastic maximum principle (SMP) and establish its connection to the Hamiltonian-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation on the Wasserstein space. The presence of the conditional joint law in the McKean-Vlasov dynamics and its discontinuity caused by the Poissonian common noise bring new technical challenges. To develop the SMP when the control domain is not necessarily convex, we first consider a strong relaxed control formulation that allows us to perform the first-order variation. We propose the technique of extension transformation to overcome the compatibility issues arising from the joint law in the relaxed control formulation. By further establishing the equivalence between the relaxed control and the strict control formulations, we obtain the SMP for the original problem with strict controls. In the part to investigate the HJB equation, we formulate an auxiliary control problem subjecting to a controlled measure-valued dynamics with Poisson jumps, which allows us to derive the HJB equation of the original problem under the open-loop strict control by some newly established equivalence formulations. We also establish the connection between the SMP and the HJB equation.</description>

      <title>Conditional gene genealogies given the population pedigree for a diploid Moran model with selfing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a stochastic model of a population with overlapping generations and arbitrary levels of self-fertilization versus outcrossing. We study how the global graph of reproductive relationships, or population pedigree, influences the genealogical relationships of a sample of two gene copies at a genetic locus. Specifically, we consider a diploid Moran model with constant population size $N$ over time, in which a proportion of offspring are produced by selfing. We show that the conditional distribution of the pairwise coalescence time at a single locus given the random pedigree converges to a limit law as $N$ tends to infinity. The distribution of coalescence times obtained in this way predicts variation among unlinked loci in a sample of individuals. Traditional coalescent analyses implicitly average over pedigrees and generally make different predictions. We describe three different behaviors in the limit depending on the relative strengths, from large to small, of selfing versus outcrossing: partial selfing, limited outcrossing, and negligible outcrossing. In the case of partial selfing, coalescence times are related to the Kingman coalescent, similar to what is found in traditional analyses. In the case of limited outcrossing, the retained pedigree information forms a random graph, with coalescence times given by the meeting times of random walks on this graph. In the case of negligible outcrossing, which represents complete or nearly complete selfing, coalescence times are determined entirely by the fixed times to common ancestry of diploid individuals in the pedigree.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the smoothness of the density function of absolutely continuous measures supported on random self-similar sets on the line. We show that the natural projection of a measure with symbolic local dimension greater than 1 at every point is absolutely continuous with H\"older continuous density almost surely. In particular, if the similarity dimension is greater than 1 then the random self-similar set on the line contains an interior point almost surely.</description>

      <title>Projection-based Lyapunov method for fully heterogeneous weakly-coupled MDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06072v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heterogeneity poses a fundamental challenge for many real-world large-scale decision-making problems but remains largely understudied. In this paper, we study the fully heterogeneous setting of a prominent class of such problems, known as weakly-coupled Markov decision processes (WCMDPs). Each WCMDP consists of $N$ arms (or subproblems), which have distinct model parameters in the fully heterogeneous setting, leading to the curse of dimensionality when $N$ is large. We show that, under mild assumptions, an efficiently computable policy achieves an $O(1/\sqrt{N})$ optimality gap in the long-run average reward per arm for fully heterogeneous WCMDPs as $N$ becomes large. This is the first asymptotic optimality result for fully heterogeneous average-reward WCMDPs. Our main technical innovation is the construction of projection-based Lyapunov functions that certify the convergence of rewards and costs to an optimal region, even under full heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>Revenue Maximization Under Sequential Price Competition Via The Estimation Of s-Concave Demand Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider price competition among multiple sellers over a selling horizon of $T$ periods. In each period, sellers simultaneously offer their prices and subsequently observe their respective demand that is unobservable to competitors. The demand function for each seller depends on all sellers' prices through a private, unknown, and nonlinear relationship. To address this challenge, we propose a semi-parametric least-squares estimation of the nonlinear mean function, which does not require sellers to communicate demand information. We show that when all sellers employ our policy, their prices converge at a rate of $O(T^{-1/7})$ to the Nash equilibrium prices that sellers would reach if they were fully informed. Each seller incurs a regret of $O(T^{5/7})$ relative to a dynamic benchmark policy. A theoretical contribution of our work is proving the existence of equilibrium under shape-constrained demand functions via the concept of $s$-concavity and establishing regret bounds of our proposed policy. Technically, we also establish new concentration results for the least squares estimator under shape constraints. Our findings offer significant insights into dynamic competition-aware pricing and contribute to the broader study of non-parametric learning in strategic decision-making.</description>

      <title>Detecting Arbitrary Planted Subgraphs in Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problems of detecting and recovering planted structures/subgraphs in Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graphs, have received significant attention over the past three decades, leading to many exciting results and mathematical techniques. However, prior work has largely focused on specific ad hoc planted structures and inferential settings, while a general theory has remained elusive. In this paper, we bridge this gap by investigating the detection of an \emph{arbitrary} planted subgraph $\Gamma = \Gamma_n$ in an Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graph $\mathcal{G}(n, q_n)$, where the edge probability within $\Gamma$ is $p_n$. We examine both the statistical and computational aspects of this problem and establish the following results. In the dense regime, where the edge probabilities $p_n$ and $q_n$ are fixed, we tightly characterize the information-theoretic and computational thresholds for detecting $\Gamma$, and provide conditions under which a computational-statistical gap arises. Most notably, these thresholds depend on $\Gamma$ only through its number of edges, maximum degree, and maximum subgraph density. Our lower and upper bounds are general and apply to any value of $p_n$ and $q_n$ as functions of $n$. Accordingly, we also analyze the sparse regime where $q_n = \Theta(n^{-\alpha})$ and $p_n-q_n =\Theta(q_n)$, with $\alpha\in[0,2]$, as well as the critical regime where $p_n=1-o(1)$ and $q_n = \Theta(n^{-\alpha})$, both of which have been widely studied, for specific choices of $\Gamma$. For these regimes, we show that our bounds are tight for all planted subgraphs investigated in the literature thus far\textemdash{}and many more. Finally, we identify conditions under which detection undergoes sharp phase transition, where the boundaries at which algorithms succeed or fail shift abruptly as a function of $q_n$.</description>

      <title>Score-Based Deterministic Density Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a deterministic sampling framework using Score-Based Transport Modeling for sampling an unnormalized target density $\pi$ given only its score $\nabla \log \pi$. Our method approximates the Wasserstein gradient flow on $\mathrm{KL}(f_t\|\pi)$ by learning the time-varying score $\nabla \log f_t$ on the fly using score matching. While having the same marginal distribution as Langevin dynamics, our method produces smooth deterministic trajectories, resulting in monotone noise-free convergence. We prove that our method dissipates relative entropy at the same rate as the exact gradient flow, provided sufficient training. Numerical experiments validate our theoretical findings: our method converges at the optimal rate, has smooth trajectories, and is usually more sample efficient than its stochastic counterpart. Experiments on high dimensional image data show that our method produces high quality generations in as few as 15 steps and exhibits natural exploratory behavior. The memory and runtime scale linearly in the sample size.</description>

      <title>Community Recovery on Noisy Stochastic Block Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08251v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of community recovery in geometrically-noised stochastic block models (SBM). This work presents two primary contributions: (1) Motif--Attention Spectral Operator (MASO), an attention-based spectral operator that improves upon traditional spectral methods; and (2) Iterative Geometric Denoising (GeoDe), a configurable denoising algorithm that boosts spectral clustering performance. We demonstrate that the fusion of GeoDe+MASO significantly outperforms existing community detection methods on noisy SBMs. Furthermore, we show that using GeoDe+MASO as a denoising step improves belief propagation's community recovery by 79.7% on the Amazon Metadata dataset.</description>
