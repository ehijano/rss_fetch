      <title>One-way heat transfer in deep-subwavelength thermophotonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal thermophotonics, by breaking Lorentz reciprocity, exceeds current theoretical efficiency limits, unlocking opportunities to energy devices and thermal management. However, energy transfer in current systems is highly defect-sensitive. This sensitivity is further amplified at deep subwavelength scales by inevitable multi-source interactions, interface wrinkles, and manufacturing tolerances, making precise control of thermal photons increasingly challenging. Here, we demonstrate a topological one-way heat transport in a deep-subwavelength thermophotonic lattice. This one-way heat flow, driven by global resonances, is strongly localized at the geometric boundaries and exhibits exceptional robustness against imperfections and disorder, achieving nearly five orders of radiative enhancement. Our findings offer a blueprint for developing robust thermal systems capable of withstanding strong perturbations.</description>

      <title>Modeling Brownian Motion as a Timelapse of the Physical, Persistent, Trajectory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While it is very common to model diffusion as a random walk by assuming memorylessness of the trajectory and diffusive step lengths, these assumptions can lead to significant errors. This paper describes the extent to which a physical trajectory of a Brownian particle can be described by a random flight. Analysis of simple timelapses of physical trajectories (calculated over collisional timescales using a velocity autocorrelation function that captures the hydrodynamic and acoustic effects induced by the solvent) gave us two observations: (i) subsampled trajectories become genuinely memoryless only when the time step is ~200 times larger than the relaxation time, and (ii) the distribution of the step lengths has variances that remain significantly smaller than 2Dt (usually by a factor of ~2). This last fact is due to the combination of two effects: diffusional MSD is mathematically superballistic at short timescales and subsampled trajectories are moving averages of the underlying physical trajectory. In other words, the MSD of the physical trajectory at long time intervals asymptotically approaches 2Dt, but the MSD of the subsampled steps does not, even when the associated time interval is several hundred times larger than the relaxation time. I discuss how to best account for this effect in computational approaches.</description>

      <title>Thouless pumping in a driven-dissipative Kerr resonator array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thouless pumping is an emblematic manifestation of topology in physics, referring to the ability to induce a quantized transport of charge across a system by simply varying one of its parameters periodically in time. The original concept of Thouless pumping involves a non-interacting system, and has been implemented in several platforms. One current challenge in the field is to extend this concept to interacting systems. In this article, we propose a Thouless pump that solely relies on nonlinear physics, within a chain of coupled Kerr resonators. Leveraging the driven-dissipative nature of the system, we modulate in space and time the onsite Kerr interaction energies, and generate 1+1-dimensional topological bands in the Bogoliubov spectrum of excitations. These bands present the same topology as the ones obtained within the Harper-Hofstadter framework, and the Wannier states associated to each band experience a net displacement and show quantized transport according to the bands Chern numbers. Remarkably, we find driving configurations leading to band inversion, revealing an interaction-induced topological transition. Our numerical simulations are performed using realistic parameters inspired from exciton polaritons, which form a platform of choice for investigating driven topological phases of matter.</description>

      <title>Non-linear anomalous Edelstein response at altermagnetic interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In altermagnets, time-reversal symmetry breaking spin-polarizes electronic states, while total magnetization remains zero. In addition, at altermagnetic surfaces Rashba-spin orbit coupling is activated due to broken inversion symmetry, introducing a competing spin-momentum locking interaction. Here we show that their interplay leads to the formation of complex, chiral spin textures that offer novel, non-linear spin-to-charge conversion properties. Whereas altermagnetic order suppresses the canonical linear in-plane Rashba-Edelstein response, we establish the presence of an anomalous transversal Edelstein effect for planar applied electric and magnetic field, or alternatively, an in-plane magnetization. Moreover the non-linear Edelstein response resulting purely from electric fields also triggers the anomalous out-of-plane magnetization. We determine the anomalous response with a model based on the ab-initio electronic structure of RuO$_2$ bilayers, ultimately opening experimental avenues to explore spin-charge conversion phenomena at altermagnetic interfaces.</description>
