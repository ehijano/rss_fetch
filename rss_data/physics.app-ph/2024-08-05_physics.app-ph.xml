      <title>3D Genetic Metamaterials for Scattering Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapidly growing volume of drone air traffic demands improved radar surveillance systems and increased detection reliability in challenging conditions. The scattering cross-section, which characterizes a target's radar visibility, is a key element in detection schemes and thus becomes a primary objective in civilian applications. Here, we introduce a concept of genetically designed metamaterials, specifically engineered to enhance scattering for end-fire incidence scenarios. Multi-layer stacks of arrays, encompassing strongly coupled electric and magnetic resonators, demonstrated above 1 m^2 broadband scattering at 10 GHz, despite having an end-fire physical cross-section smaller than one squared wavelength. Those performances, crucial for effective civil radar air traffic monitoring, facilitate exploring highly scattering structures as labels for small airborne targets. This objective has been demonstrated with a set of outdoor experiments with the DJI Mini 2 drone. Lightweight, conformal add-ons with significantly high scattering cross-sections can serve as auxiliary tools to empower passive monitoring systems, thereby providing an additional layer of security in urban airspace.</description>

      <title>In-silico model of the pregnant uterus as a network of oscillators under sparse adaptive control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To ensure optimal survival of the neonate, the biological timing of parturition must be tightly controlled. Medical studies show that a variety of endocrine systems play the role of a control system, establishing a dynamic balance between the forces that cause uterine quiescence during pregnancy and the forces that produce coordinated uterine contractility at parturition. These control mechanism, and the factors that affect their performance, are still poorly understood. To help fill this gap, we propose a model of the pregnant uterus as a network of FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillators, with each cell symbolizing the electrical activity of a myocyte. The model is augmented with sparse adaptive control mechanisms representing the regulating endocrine functions. The control system is characterized by the fraction of controlled sites, and strength of control. We quantitatively find the conditions for which the control system exhibit a balance between robustness (resilience against perturbations) and flexibility (ability to switch function with minimal cost) crucial for optimal neonatal survival. Specifically, we show that Braxton-Hicks and Alvarez contractions, which are observed sporadic contractions of the uterine muscle, serve as a safety valve against over-controlling, strategically suppressed yet retained to optimize the control system's efficiency. Preterm birth is suggested to be understood as a mis-identification of the control boundaries. These insights contribute to advancing our understanding of maternal-fetal health.</description>

      <title>Slow Voltage Relaxation of Silicon Nanoparticles with a Chemo-Mechanical Core-Shell Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silicon presents itself as a high-capacity anode material for lithium-ion batteries with a promising future. The high ability for lithiation comes along with massive volume changes and a problematic voltage hysteresis, causing reduced efficiency, detrimental heat generation, and a complicated state-of-charge estimation. During slow cycling, amorphous silicon nanoparticles show a larger voltage hysteresis than after relaxation periods. Interestingly, the voltage relaxes for at least several days, which has not been physically explained so far. We apply a chemo-mechanical continuum model in a core-shell geometry interpreted as a silicon particle covered by the solid-electrolyte interphase to account for the hysteresis phenomena. The silicon core (de)lithiates during every cycle while the covering shell is chemically inactive. The visco-elastoplastic behavior of the shell explains the voltage hysteresis during cycling and after relaxation. We identify a logarithmic voltage relaxation, which fits with the established Garofalo law for viscosity. Our chemo-mechanical model describes the observed voltage hysteresis phenomena and outperforms the empirical Plett model. In addition to our full model, we present a reduced model to allow for easy voltage profile estimations. The presented results support the mechanical explanation of the silicon voltage hysteresis with a core-shell model and encourage further efforts into the investigation of the silicon anode mechanics.</description>

      <title>Discriminative Addressing of Versatile Nanodiamonds via Physically-Enabled Classifier in Complex Bio-Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers show great potentials for nanoscale bio-sensing and bio-imaging. Nevertheless, their envisioned bio-applications suffer from intrinsic background noise due to unavoidable light scattering and autofluorescence in cells and tissues. Herein, we develop a novel all-optical modulated imaging method via physically-enabled classifier, for on-demand and direct access to NV fluorescence at pixel resolution while effectively filtering out background noise. Specifically, NV fluorescence can be modulated optically to exhibit sinusoid-like variations, providing basis for classification. We validate our method in various complex biological scenarios with fluorescence interference, ranging from cells to organisms. Notably, our classification-based approach achieves almost 10^6 times enhancement of signal-to-background ratio (SBR) for fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) in neural protein imaging. We also demonstrate 4-fold contrast improvement in optically-detected magnetic resonance measurements (ODMR) of FNDs inside stained cells. Our technique offers a generic, explainable and robust solution, applicable for realistic high-fidelity imaging and sensing in challenging noise-laden scenarios.</description>

      <title>GAMBAS -- Fast Beam Arrangement Selection for Proton Therapy using a Nearest Neighbour Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: Beam angle selection is critical in proton therapy treatment planning, yet automated approaches remain underexplored. This study presents and evaluates GAMBAS, a novel, fast machine learning model for automatic beam angle selection.
  Methods: The model extracts a predefined set of anatomical features from a patient's CT and structure contours. Using these features, it identifies the most similar patient from a training database and suggests that patient's beam arrangement. A retrospective study with 19 patients was conducted, comparing this model's suggestions to human planners' choices and randomly selected beam arrangements from the training dataset. An expert treatment planner evaluated the plans on quality (scale 1-5), ranked them, and guessed the method used.
  Results: The number of acceptable (score 4 or 5) plans was comparable between human-chosen 17 (89%) and model-selected 16(84%) beam arrangements. The fully automatic treatment planning took between 4 - 7 min (mean 5 min).
  Conclusion: The model produces beam arrangements of comparable quality to those chosen by human planners, demonstrating its potential as a fast tool for quality assurance and patient selection, although it is not yet ready for clinical use.</description>

      <title>Large Area Near-Field Thermophotovoltaics for Low Temperature Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermophotovoltaics, devices that convert thermal infrared photons to electricity, offer a key pathway for a variety of critical renewable energy technologies including thermal energy storage, waste heat recovery, and direct solar-thermal power generation. However, conventional far-field devices struggle to generate reasonable powers at lower temperatures. Near-field thermophotovoltaics provide a pathway to substantially higher powers by leveraging photon tunneling effects. Here we present a large area near-field thermophotovoltaic device, created with an epitaxial co-fabrication approach, that consists of a self-supported 0.28 cm2 emitter-cell pair with a 150 nm gap. The device generates 1.22 mW at 460 C, a twenty-five-fold increase over the same cell measured in a far-field configuration. Furthermore, the near-field device demonstrates short circuit current densities greater than the far-field photocurrent limit at all the temperatures tested, confirming the role of photon tunneling effects in the performance enhancement. Modeling suggests several practical directions for cell improvements and further increases in power density. These results highlight the promise of near-field thermophotovoltaics, especially for low temperature applications.</description>

      <title>A microcomb-empowered Fourier domain mode-locked LiDAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) has emerged as an indispensable tool in autonomous technology. Among its various techniques, frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) LiDAR stands out due to its capability to operate with ultralow return power, immunity to unwanted light, and simultaneous acquisition of distance and velocity. However, achieving a rapid update rate with sub-micron precision remains a challenge for FMCW LiDARs. Here, we present such a LiDAR with a sub-10 nm precision and a 24.6 kHz update rate by combining a broadband Fourier domain mode-locked (FDML) laser with a silicon nitride soliton microcomb. An ultrahigh frequency chirp rate up to 320 PHz/s is linearized by a 50 GHz microcomb to reach this performance. Our theoretical analysis also contributes to resolving the challenge of FMCW velocity measurements with nonlinear frequency sweeps and enables us to realize velocity measurement with an uncertainty below 0.4 mm/s. Our work shows how nanophotonic microcombs can unlock the potential of ultrafast frequency sweeping lasers for applications including LiDAR, optical coherence tomography and sensing.</description>

      <title>Digitized Phase Change Material Heterostack for Diffractive Optical Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: All-optical and fully reconfigurable diffractive optical neural network (DONN) architectures are promising for high-throughput and energy-efficient machine learning (ML) hardware accelerators for broad applications. However, current device and system implementations have limited performance. This work demonstrates a novel diffractive device architecture, which is named digitized heterostack and consists of multiple layers of nonvolatile phase change materials (PCMs) with different thicknesses. This architecture can both leverage the advantages of PCM optical properties and mitigate challenges associated with implementing multilevel operations in a single PCM layer. Proof-of-concept experiments demonstrate the electrical tuning of one PCM layer in a spatial light modulation device, and thermal analysis guides the design of DONN devices and systems to avoid thermal crosstalk if individual heterostacks are assembled into an array. Further, heterostacks containing three PCM layers are designed to have a large phase modulation range and uniform coverage and the ML performance of DONN systems with designed heterostacks is evaluated. The developed device architecture provides new opportunities for desirable energy-efficient, fast-reconfigured, and compact DONN systems in the future.</description>
