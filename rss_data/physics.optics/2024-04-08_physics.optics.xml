      <title>WGMR Self-Injection Locking Method Based on Enhanced Optical Feedback with Auxiliary Prism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optical feedback intensity is an important parameter for realizing narrow linewidth lasers in Whispering-gallery-mode resonator (WGMR) self-injection locking technology. We proposed an approach that enhances the intensity of intracavity feedback in crystalline WGMR by using only a single coated auxiliary prism. Compared to the Rayleigh scattering, the feedback intensity of the enhanced scheme increased by more than a hundred times. Furthermore, we demonstrated that, with the enhanced approach, the instantaneous linewidth of the laser was suppressed to 7 Hz level, the locking range was expanded up to 8 GHz, and the relative intensity noise (RIN) was reduced to -152 dBc/Hz@10MHz. The feedback enhanced design is compact, easy-to-operated and can be integrated with the WGMR. It provides a miniaturized solution for controlling optical feedback intensity in WGMR self-injection locking technology.</description>

      <title>Photon Transitions in Arbitrary Time-Varying Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general theory for calculating photon transitions in arbitrarily time-varying metamaterials. This theory circumvents the difficulties of conventional approaches in solving such a general problem by exploiting the eigenstates of time-dependent number operators. We demonstrate here the temporal evolution of these operators and the related transition probabilities for the cases of logistic and linear permittivity profiles. The theory is potentially extensible to arbitrary space-time modulations and may hence lead to multiple novel quantum effects and applications.</description>

      <title>Dalton's law of partial optical thermodynamic pressures in highly multimoded nonlinear photonic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that in highly multimoded nonlinear photonic systems, the optical thermodynamic pressures emerging from different species of the optical field obey Dalton's law of partial pressures. In multimode settings, the optical thermodynamic pressure is defined as the conjugate to the extensive variable associated with the system's total number of modes and is directly related to the actual electrodynamic radiation forces exerted at the physical boundaries of the system. Here, we extend this notion to photonic configuration supporting different species of the optical field. Under thermal equilibrium conditions, we formally derive an equation that establishes a direct link between the partial thermodynamic pressures and the electrodynamic radiation pressures exerted by each polarization species. Our theoretical framework provides a straightforward approach for quantifying the total radiation pressures through the system's thermodynamics variables without invoking the Maxwell stress tensor formalism. In essence, we show that the total electrodynamic pressure in such arrangements can be obtained in an effortless manner from initial excitation conditions, thus avoiding time-consuming simulations of the utterly complex multimode dynamics. To illustrate the validity of our results, we carry out numerical simulations in multimoded nonlinear optical structures supporting two polarization species and demonstrate excellent agreement with the Maxwell stress tensor method.</description>

      <title>Self-referencing photothermal common-path interferometry to measure absorption of Si3N4 membranes for laser-light sails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser-light sails are a spacecraft concept wherein lightweight "sails" are propelled to high speeds by lasers with high intensities. The sails must comprise materials with low optical loss, to minimize the risk of laser damage. Stoichiometric silicon nitride (Si$_3$N$_4$) is a candidate material with low loss in the near infrared, but the precise absorption coefficient has not been characterized in the membrane form-factor needed for sails. We use photothermal common-path interferometry (PCI), a sensitive pump-probe technique, to measure the absorption coefficient of stoichiometric and nonstoichiometric silicon nitride. To calibrate PCI measurements of membranes, we developed a self-referencing technique where a measurement is performed twice: once on a bare membrane, and a second time with a monolayer of graphene deposited on the membrane. The absorption of the sample with graphene can be measured by both PCI and more-conventional spectroscopic techniques, enabling the calibration of the PCI measurement. We find that with an absorption coefficient of (2.09 $\pm$ 0.76) $\times$ 10$^{-2}$ cm$^{-1}$ at 1064 nm, Si$_3$N$_4$ is a suitable laser-sail material for laser intensities as high as ~10 GW/m$^{2}$, which have been proposed for some laser-sail missions, while silicon-rich SiN$_x$ (x~1), with an absorption coefficient of 7.94 $\pm$ 0.50 cm$^{-1}$, is unlikely to survive such high laser intensities.</description>

      <title>Incoherent non-Hermitian skin effect in photonic quantum walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect describes the concentration of an extensive number of eigenstates near the boundaries of certain dissipative systems. This phenomenon has raised a huge interest in different areas of physics, including photonics, deeply expanding our understanding of non-Hermitian systems and opening up new avenues in both fundamental and applied aspects of topological phenomena. The skin effect has been associated to a nontrivial point-gap spectral topology and has been experimentally demonstrated in a variety of synthetic matter systems, including photonic lattices. In most of physical models exhibiting the non-Hermitian skin effect full or partial wave coherence is generally assumed. Here we push the concept of skin effect into the fully incoherent regime and show that rather generally (but not universally) the non-Hermitian skin effect persists under dephasing dynamics. The results are illustrated by considering incoherent light dynamics in non-Hermitian photonic quantum walks.</description>

      <title>Robust Anderson transition in non-Hermitian photonic quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anderson localization, i.e. the suppression of diffusion in lattices with random or incommensurate disorder, is a fragile interference phenomenon which is spoiled out in the presence of dephasing effects or fluctuating disorder. As a consequence, Anderson localization-delocalization phase transitions observed in Hermitian systems, such as in one-dimensional quasicrystals when the amplitude of the incommensurate potential is increased above a threshold, are washed out when dephasing effects are included. Here we consider localization-delocalization spectral phase transitions occurring in non-Hermitian quasicrystals with local incommensurate gain and loss, and show that, contrary to the Hermitian case, the non-Hermitian phase transition is robust against dephasing effects. The results are illustrated by considering synthetic quasicrystals in photonic mesh lattices.</description>

      <title>The inverse Faraday effect at Mie resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays, dielectric nanophotonics enables almost lossless resonant interaction between light and matter at the nanoscale. We show both theoretically and by electromagnetic simulations, that the peculiar nature of Mie-resonance induced effective magnetic fields contrasts sharply with the optomagnetism of smooth bulk materials. Mie resonances produce strongly nonuniform effective magnetic fields generated by the inverse Faraday effect. Different orders of optical resonances are characterized by different types of the effective magnetic field patterns. The number of point-like inverse Faraday effect sources can be controlled by adjusting the pump wavelength, allowing for the selective launch of spin waves with submicron wavelengths. A distinguish feature of the Mie-resonance-induced effective magnetic fields is the vortex structure that can be used for the magnetic skyrmion generation. The proposed approach considerably broadens the scope of nanoscale optomagnetism.</description>

      <title>Spectral Tuning of Polarization Selective Reflections Bands in GLAD deposited HfAlN chiral sculptured thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first report on fabrication of Hafnium aluminum nitride chiral sculptured thin films (CSTFs) using reactive magnetron sputtering in a glancing angle deposition configuration, and the analysis of its optical polarization properties. The resulting CSTFs were designed to give interference extrema or so-called circular Bragg (CB) resonances at desired wavelengths in the region from 370 to 690 nm. This was achieved by tailoring the growth of the chiral thin films to obtain a dielectric pitch between 87 and 260.9 nm. The spectral positions of the obtained CB resonances were compared to values from analytical expressions. Contrary to the common case where the dielectric pitch is half of the growth-related rotational pitch due to a 180{\deg} symmetry, this pitch was shown to be the same as the rotational pitch. It is concluded that this is due to the c-axis of the CSTF being tilted about 45{\deg} from the substrate normal. The morphology and crystallographic characterizations were done using scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction, respectively, while the tilt of the crystal lattice was corroborated using X-ray diffraction pole figures. The optical response from the CSTFs was analyzed using Mueller matrix spectroscopic ellipsometry from which the degree of circular polarization at the CB resonances was obtained. In addition, a strong non-reciprocal reflection was observed which could be attributed to the helicoidal morphology and the intrinsic crystal tilt. An optical layered model of the chiral structure including azimuthal twist and using the Cauchy dispersion relations was used to simulate the Mueller matrix elements and compare with the ellipsometry measurements. The correlation between the simulated and experimental data gave information of the morphological parameters of the CSTF and its optical properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optofluidics is dedicated to achieving integrated control of particle and fluid motion, particularly on the micrometer scale, by utilizing light to direct fluid flow and particle motion. The field has seen significant growth recently, driven by the concerted efforts of researchers across various scientific disciplines, notably for its successful applications in biomedical science. In this review, we explore a range of optofluidic architectures developed over the past decade, with a primary focus on mechanisms for precise control of micro and nanoscale biological objects and their applications in sensing. Regarding nanoparticle manipulation, we delve into mechanisms based on optical nanotweezers using nanolocalized light fields and light-based hybrid effects with dramatically improved performance and capabilities. In the context of sensing, we emphasize those works that used optofluidics to aggregate molecules or particles to promote sensing and detection. Additionally, we highlight emerging research directions, encompassing both fundamental principles and practical applications in the field.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast dynamic beam steering with optical frequency comb arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient spatiotemporal control of optical beams is of paramount importance in diverse technological domains. Conventional systems focusing on quasi-static beam control demand precise phase or wavelength tuning for steering. This work presents a time-efficient solution for dynamic beam steering, emphasizing high-duty-cycle operation with fast scan rates, and eliminating the need for active tuning of the beam direction. We achieve 100%-duty-cycle scans at a rate of $\sim$9.8 GHz within an angular range of $\sim$1$^\circ$. Furthermore, leveraging the dispersion characteristics of a virtually imaged phased array (VIPA), we devise a broadband source array that seamlessly transitions from continuous-angular steering to pulsed discrete-angular operation, unlocking possibilities for high-sensitivity angle-, range-, and time-resolved imaging. We also elucidate the adaptability of integrated photonic designs incorporating wavelength-selective switches and spectral dispersers, for enabling a versatile on-chip realization of the proposed beam steering schemes.</description>

      <title>Photonic time crystals: Theory and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This tutorial offers a comprehensive overview of photonic time crystals - artificial materials whose electromagnetic properties are periodically modulated in time at scales comparable to the oscillation period of light while remaining spatially uniform. Being the temporal analogs to traditional photonic crystals, photonic time crystals differ in that they exhibit momentum bandgaps instead of energy bandgaps. The energy is not conserved within momentum bandgaps, and eigenmodes with exponentially growing amplitudes exist in the momentum bandgap. Such properties make photonic time crystals a fascinating novel class of artificial materials from a basic science and applied perspective. This tutorial overviews the fundamental electromagnetic equations governing photonic time crystals and explores the groundbreaking physical phenomena they support. Based on these properties, we also oversee a diverse range of applications they unlock. Different material platforms suitable for creating photonic time crystals are discussed and compared. Furthermore, we elaborate on the connections between wave amplification in photonic time crystals and parametric amplification mechanisms in electrical circuits and nonlinear optics. The tutorial will be helpful for readers with physics or engineering backgrounds. It is designed to serve as an introductory guide for beginners and to establish a reference baseline reflecting the current understanding for researchers in the field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a two-dimensional photonic array featuring a circular shape and an alternating gain and loss pattern. Our analysis revolves around determining the presence and resilience of optical ring modes with varying vorticity values. This investigation is conducted with respect to both the array's length and the strength of the non-Hermitian parameter. For larger values of array's length, we observe a reduction in the stability domain as the non-Hermitian parameter increases. Interestingly, upon an increasing of vorticity of the optical modes full stability windows emerge for shorter lattice sizes regime.</description>

      <title>Quantum and thermal noise in coupled non-Hermitian waveguide systems with different models of gain and loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian (NH) photonic systems leverage gain and loss to open new directions for nanophotonic technologies. However, the quantum and thermal noise intrinsically associated with gain/loss affects the eigenvalue/eigenvector structure of NH systems, as well as its practical noise performance. Here, we present a comparative analysis of the impact of different gain and loss mechanisms on the noise generated in gain-loss compensated NH waveguide systems. Our results highlight important differences in the eigenvalue/eigenvector structure, noise power, photon statistics and squeezing. At the same time, we identify some universal properties such as gain-loss compensation, broken to unbroken phase transitions, coalesce of pairs of eigenvectors, and linear scaling of the noise with the length of the waveguide. We believe that these results provide a more global understanding on the impact of the gain/loss mechanism on the noise generated in NH systems.</description>

      <title>Computing the interaction of light pulses with objects moving at relativistic speeds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction of light with short light pulses is relevant in optical traps, optical tweezers, and many other applications. The theoretical description of such polychromatic light-matter interaction is challenging, and more so when the object is moving with respect to the light source, albeit with constant speed. Light sails are futuristic examples where such speed should reach the relativistic regime. In here, we provide a methodology for the theoretical and numerical analysis of the interaction of light pulses with objects moving with constant speed. The methodology allows one, in particular, to readily compute the transfer of fundamental quantities such as energy and momentum from the light pulse to the object. As an example, we compute the transfer of energy and momentum between a given pulse and a silicon sphere moving at relativistic speeds. The methodology, however, is valid for generic pulses and objects. Particularizing the equations to the case of zero speed allows one to treat static or quasi-static objects. The method is based on the polychromatic T-matrix formalism, which leverages the many publicly available resources for computing T-matrices.</description>

      <title>Out-of-plane orientated self-trapped excitons enabled polarized light guiding in 2D perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active optical waveguides combine light source and waveguides together in an individual component, which are essential for the integrated photonic chips. Although 1D luminescent materials based optical waveguides were extensively investigated, 2D waveguides allow photons to flow within a plane and serve as an ideal component for the ultracompact photonic circuits. Nevertheless, light guiding in 2D planar structures normally relies on the precise control of molecular orientation, which is complicated and low yield. Here, we report a strategy to guide polarized light in 2D microflakes by making use of the out-of-plane (OP) orientation of self-trapped excitons in as-synthesized 2D perovskite microplates. A space confined crystallization method is developed to synthesize 2D perovskite microflakes with dominated broad self-trapped excitons emission at room temperature, which are highly OP orientated with a percentage of the OP component over 85%. Taking advantages of the negligible absorption coefficient and improved coupling efficiency of OP orientated self-trapped exciton emission to the planar waveguide mode of the as-synthesized perovskite microflakes, we have achieved a broadband polarized light guiding with a full width at half maximum over 120 nm. Our findings provide a promising platform for the development of ultracompact photonic circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Letter, Xu et al. reported that edge modes disappear in the expanded structure of Wu-Hu model characterized by Z2 topological index, while appear in the trivial shrunken structure, when the edge cuts through the hexagonal unit cell. They then concluded that these edge modes are defect modes lacking topological protection. Unfortunately, their approach is not justified, rendering the conclusion unsolid.</description>

      <title>Widely-tunable and narrow-linewidth hybrid-integrated diode laser at 637 nm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present hybrid-integrated extended cavity diode lasers tunable around 637 nm, with a gain-wide spectral coverage of 8 nm. This tuning range allows addressing the zero-phonon line of nitrogen vacancy centers and includes the wavelength of HeNe lasers (633 nm). The lasers provide wide mode-hop free tuning up to 97 GHz and a narrow intrinsic linewidth down to 10 kHz. The maximum output power is 2.5 mW in a single-mode fiber, corresponding to an on-chip power of 4.0 mW. Full integration and packaging in a standard housing with fiber pigtails provide high intrinsic stability and will enable integration into complex optical systems.</description>

      <title>Nanomolecular OLED Pixelization Enabling Electroluminescent Metasurfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Miniaturization of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) can enable high-resolution augmented and virtual reality displays and on-chip light sources for ultra-broadband chiplet communication. However, unlike silicon scaling in electronic integrated circuits, patterning of inorganic III-V semiconductors in LEDs considerably compromises device efficiencies at submicrometer scales. Here, we present the scalable fabrication of nanoscale organic LEDs (nano-OLEDs), with the highest array density (&gt;84,000 pixels per inch) and the smallest pixel size (~100 nm) ever reported to date. Direct nanomolecular patterning of organic semiconductors is realized by self-aligned evaporation through nanoapertures fabricated on a free-standing silicon nitride film adhering to the substrate. The average external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) extracted from a nano-OLED device of more than 4 megapixels reach up to 10%. At the subwavelength scale, individual pixels act as electroluminescent meta-atoms forming metasurfaces that directly convert electricity into modulated light. The diffractive coupling between nano-pixels enables control over the far-field emission properties, including directionality and polarization. The results presented here lay the foundation for bright surface light sources of dimension smaller than the Abbe diffraction limit, offering new technological platforms for super-resolution imaging, spectroscopy, sensing, and hybrid integrated photonics.</description>

      <title>Robust Classical and Quantum Polarimetry with a Single Nanostructured Metagrating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a new conceptual approach for one-shot complete polarization state measurement with nanostructured metasurfaces applicable to classical light and multi-photon quantum states, by drawing on the principles of generalized quantum measurements based on positive operator-valued measures (POVMs). Accurate polarization reconstruction from a combination of photon counts or correlations from several diffraction orders is robust with respect to even strong fabrication inaccuracies, requiring only a single classical calibration of metasurface transmission.
  Furthermore, this approach operates with a single metagrating without interleaving, allowing for the metasurface size reduction while preserving the high transmission efficiency and output beam quality. We theoretically obtained original metasurface designs, fabricated the metasurface from amorphous silicon nanostructures deposited on glass, and experimentally confirmed accurate polarization reconstruction for laser beams.
  We also anticipate robust operation under changes in environmental conditions, opening new possibilities for space-based imaging and satellite optics.</description>

      <title>Linear and Nonlinear Coupling of Twin-Resonators with Kerr Nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear effects in microresonators are efficient building blocks for all-optical computing and telecom systems. With the latest advances in microfabrication, coupled microresonators are used in a rapidly growing number of applications. In this work, we investigate the coupling between twin-resonators in the presence of Kerr-nonlinearity. We use an experimental setup with controllable coupling between two high-Q resonators and discuss the effects caused by the simultaneous presence of linear and non-linear coupling between the optical fields. Linear-coupling-induced mode splitting is observed at low input powers, with the controllable coupling leading to a tunable mode splitting. At high input powers, the hybridized resonances show spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) effects, in which the optical power is unevenly distributed between the resonators. Our experimental results are supported by a detailed theoretical model of nonlinear twin-resonators. With the recent interest in coupled resonator systems for neuromorphic computing, quantum systems, and optical frequency comb generation, our work provides important insights into the behavior of these systems at high circulating powers.</description>

      <title>Realization of a three-dimensional photonic higher-order topological insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of photonic higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs) has significantly expanded our understanding of band topology and provided unprecedented lower-dimensional topological boundary states for robust photonic devices. However, due to the vectorial and leaky nature of electromagnetic waves, it is challenging to discover three-dimensional (3D) topological photonic systems and photonic HOTIs have so far still been limited to two dimensions (2D). Here, we report on the first experimental realization of a 3D Wannier-type photonic HOTI in a tight-binding-like metal-cage photonic crystal, whose band structure matches well with that of a 3D tight-binding model due to the confined Mie resonances. By microwave near-field measurements, we directly observe coexisting topological surface, hinge, and corner states in a single 3D photonic HOTI, as predicted by the tight-binding model and simulation results. Moreover, we demonstrate that all-order topological boundary states are self-guided even in the light cone continuum and can be exposed to air without ancillary cladding, making them well-suited for practical applications. Our work thus opens routes to the multi-dimensional robust manipulation of electromagnetic waves at the outer surfaces of 3D cladding-free photonic bandgap materials and may find novel applications in 3D topological integrated photonics devices.</description>

      <title>Waveguide and cavity quantum electrodynamics with topological bowtie modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study on photonic topological crystals whose symmetry is governed by quantum valley-Hall topological insulators and whose propagating edge modes are strongly confined due to bowtie geometries. Dielectric bowtie structures exploit the field discontinuities at boundaries between materials with different refractive indices, and here bowties emerge at the topological interface due to the close proximity of two triangular features in the underlying crystal. The topological bowtie mode features a unit-cell mode volume down to $8\times10^{-4}$ cubic wavelengths at the center of the bowtie bridge of width $10~\text{nm}$, and we show that it is possible to use perturbed versions of the unit cells as building blocks for topological heterostructure bowtie cavities with quality factors exceeding $10^7$. Due to the tightly confined bowtie mode, this implies a strongly enhanced light-matter interaction as quantified by a Purcell factor of $3 \times 10^6$.</description>

Abstract: In the recent work "Non-reciprocal topological solitons in active metamaterials" (see arXiv:2312.03544v1), for an analytical understanding of the system under consideration, the authors derive an ordinary differential equation for the sine-Gordon (anti)soliton velocity, with the perturbation theory in the adiabatic approximation, via the inverse scattering transform formalism, see Eq. (3) in their work. Here we note that the latter equation for the (anti)soliton velocity also follows from an energy balance approach.</description>

      <title>Strong interactions between integrated microresonators and alkali atomic vapors: towards single-atom, single-photon operation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED), the interaction of a two-level system with a high quality factor (Q) cavity, is a foundational building block in different architectures for quantum computation, communication, and metrology. The strong interaction between the atom and the cavity enables single photon operation which is required for quantum gates and sources. Cold atoms, quantum dots, and color centers in crystals are amongst the systems that have shown single photon operations, but they require significant physical infrastructure. Atomic vapors, on the other hand, require limited experimental infrastructure and are hence much easier to deploy outside a laboratory, but they produce an ensemble of moving atoms that results in short interaction times involving multiple atoms, which can hamper quantum operations. A solution to this issue can be found in nanophotonic cavities, where light-matter interaction is enhanced and the volume of operation is small, so that fast single-atom, single-photon operations are enabled. In this work, we study the interaction of an atomically-clad microring resonator (ACMRR) with different-sized ensembles of Rb atoms. We demonstrate strong coupling between an ensemble of ~50 atoms interacting with a high-quality factor (Q &gt; 4 x 10^5) ACMRR, yielding a many-atom cooperativity C ~ 5.5. We continue to observe signatures of atom-photon interaction for a few (&lt; 3) atoms, for which we observe saturation at the level of one intracavity photon. Further development of our platform, which includes integrated thermo-optic heaters to enable cavity tuning and stabilization, should enable the observation of interactions between single photons and single atoms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distortion free negative group velocity pulse propagation is demonstrated in a rare-earth-ion-doped-crystal (RE) through the creation of a carefully designed spectral absorption structure in the inhomogeneous profile of Eu:YSO and subsequently inverting it. The properties of the RE system make it particularly well suited for this since it supports the creation of very sharp, arbitrarily tailored spectral features, which can be coherently inverted by a single pulse thanks to the long coherence time of the transition. All together these properties allow for a large time advancement of pulses without causing distortion. A pulse advancement of 10.9% with respect to the pulse full-width-half-maximum was achieved corresponding to a time-bandwidth product of 0.05. This to our knowledge is the largest time-bandwidth product achieved, with negligible shape distortion and attenuation. Our results show that the rare-earth platform is a powerful test bed for superluminal propagation in particular and dispersion profile programming in general</description>

Abstract: We report on the implementation of quantum entanglement distribution and quantum state teleportation over a 14.4-km urban dark-fiber link, which is partially underground, partially overhead, and patched in several stations. We characterize the link for its use as a quantum channel and realize its active polarization stabilization. Using a type-II cavity-enhanced SPDC photon pair source, a $^{40}$Ca$^{+}$ single-ion quantum memory, and quantum frequency conversion to the telecom C-band, we demonstrate photon-photon entanglement, ion-photon entanglement, and teleportation of a qubit state from the ion onto a remote telecom photon, all realized over the urban fiber link.</description>

      <title>Quantum and Classical Two-photon Interference of Single Photons with Ultralong Coherence Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-photon interference (TPI) is a fundamental phenomenon in quantum optics and plays a crucial role in quantum information science and technology. TPI is commonly considered as quantum interference with an upper bound of $100\%$ for both the TPI visibility and the beat visibility in contrast to its classical counterpart with a maximum visibility of $50\%$. However, this is not always the case. Here we report a simultaneous observation of quantum and classical TPI of single photons with ultralong coherence time which is longer than the photon correlation time by five orders of magnitude. We observe a TPI visibility of $94.3\%\pm 0.2\%$ but a beat visibility of $50\%$. Besides an anti-bunching central dip due to single-photon statistics, we observe two bunching side peaks in cross-correlation curves for indistinguishable photons. Using either classical wave superposition theory or quantum field approach, we derive the same expressions for the cross-correlation functions which reproduce and explain the experiments well. We conclude that quantum TPI with a stream of single photons is equivalent to classical TPI, both of which are the fourth-order interference arising from the second-order interference occurring on the time scale of photon coherence time.</description>

      <title>Probing Plexciton Emission from 2D Materials on Gold Nanotrenches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probing strongly coupled quasiparticle excitations at their intrinsic length scales offers unique insights into their properties and facilitates the design of devices with novel functionalities. In this work, we investigate the formation and emission characteristics of plexcitons, arising from the interaction between surface plasmons in narrow gold nanotrenches and excitons in monolayer WSe2. We study this strong plasmon-exciton coupling in both the far-field and the near-field. Specifically, we observe a Rabi splitting in the far-field reflection spectra of about 80 meV under ambient conditions, consistent with our theoretical modeling. Using a custom-designed near-field probe, we find that plexciton emission originates predominantly from the lower-frequency branch, which we can directly probe and map the local field distribution. We precisely determine the plexciton extension, similar to the trench width, with nanometric precision via collecting spectra at controlled probe locations. Our work opens exciting prospects for nanoscale mapping and engineering of plexcitons in complex nanostructures with potential applications in nanophotonic devices, optoelectronics, and quantum electrodynamics in nanoscale cavities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical orientation of carrier spins by circularly polarized light is the basic concept and tool of spin physics in semiconductors. We study the optical orientation of electrons and holes in a crystal of the FA$_{0.9}$Cs$_{0.1}$PbI$_{2.8}$Br$_{0.2}$ lead halide perovskite by means of polarized photoluminescence, time-resolved differential reflectivity, and time-resolved Kerr rotation. At the cryogenic temperature of 1.6 K the optical orientation degree measured for continuous-wave excitaton reaches 6\% for localized electrons and 2\% for localized holes. Their contributions are distinguished from each other and from exciton optical orientation through the pronounced Hanle effect in transverse magnetic fields and the polarization recovery effect in longitudinal magnetic fields. The optical orientation degree is highly stable against detuning of the laser photon energy from the band gap by up to 0.25 eV, showing then a gradual decrease for detunings up to 0.9 eV. This evidences the inefficiency of spin relaxation mechanisms for free carriers during their energy relaxation. Spin relaxation for localized electrons and holes is provided by the hyperfine interaction with the nuclear spins. Dynamic polarization of nuclear spins is demonstrated by the Overhauser field reaching 4 mT acting on the electrons and $-76$ mT acting on the holes. This confirms the specifics of lead halide perovskite semiconductors, where the hole hyperfine interaction with the nuclei considerably exceeds that of the electron.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Attosecond spectroscopy comprises several techniques to probe matter through electrons and photons. One frontier of attosecond methods is to reveal complex phenomena arising from quantum-mechanical correlations in the matter system, in the photon fields and among them. Recent theories have laid the groundwork for understanding how quantum-optical properties affect high-field photonics, such as strong-field ionization and acceleration of electrons in quantum-optical fields, and how entanglement between the field modes arises during the interaction. Here we demonstrate a new experimental approach that transduces some properties of a quantum-optical state through a strong-field nonlinearity. We perturb high-harmonic emission from a semiconductor with a bright squeezed vacuum field resulting in the emission of sidebands of the high-harmonics with super-Poissonian statistics, indicating that the emitted photons are bunched. Our results suggest that perturbing strong-field dynamics with quantum-optical states is a viable way to coherently control the generation of these states at short wavelengths, such as extreme ultraviolet or soft X-rays. Quantum correlations will be instrumental to advance attosecond spectroscopy and imaging beyond the classical limits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the concept of topological pumping in one-dimensional systems with long-range interactions and apply it to the transport of a photon in quantum optical systems. In our theoretical investigation, we introduce an extended version of the Rice-Mele model with all-to-all exchange interactions. By analyzing its properties, we identify the general conditions for topological pumping and demonstrate the topologically protected and dispersionless transport of a photon on a one-dimensional emitter chain. As concrete examples, we investigate three different popular quantum optics platforms, namely Rydberg atom lattices, dense lattices of atoms excited to low-lying electronic states, and atoms coupled to waveguides, using experimentally relevant parameters. We observe that despite the long-ranged character of the dipole-dipole interactions, topological pumping facilitates the transport of a photon with a fidelity per cycle which can reach 99.9%. Moreover, we find that the photon pumping process remains topologically protected against local disorder in the coupling rates.</description>

      <title>Oblique photons, plasmons, and current-plasmons in relativistic plasmas and their topological implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photons in vacuum are transverse in any inertial frame; longitudinal photons only exist virtually. By developing a manifestly covariant theory for electromagnetic excitations in relativistic plasmas and applying Wigner's little group method for elementary particle classifications, we show that photons in plasmas are neither transverse nor longitudinal; they are oblique. Plasmons are electromagnetic and oblique as well. The Lorentz invariant characteristics that distinguishes photons and plasmons is covariant compressibility. The manifestly covariant theory predicts the existence of the current-plasmon, a third oblique, electromagnetic eigenmode, and it also enables the study of photon topology in plasmas. Plasmas remove the photon's Dirac point in vacuum by giving it an effective mass, but create a tilted Dirac-Weyl point by reviving the virtual longitudinal photon.</description>

      <title>High Fidelity Freeform Manufacturing via Polyspectral Tomographic Reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.13941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A key goal of freeform manufacturing is to achieve speed, precision and design freedom at the same time. Volumetric additive manufacturing via tomographic reconstruction offers high speed but cannot achieve optical resolution at high design freedom. Here we combine polyspectral tomographic reconstruction with pseudo-negative illumination to resolve the trilemma. We used the same units on a digital micromirror device to modulate two colors of illumination simultaneously to control the chemical stability of binary photoinhibition. The methodology enables a typical 4K projector to 3D-print up to 8.9 billion voxels in a 30x30x50 mm vial at two-digit-m-resolution in minutes, with prolonged process window and geometrically fidelous greyscale printing. These results are linked to, and thus can be improved directly upon upgrading, the precision of the optomechanical modality.</description>

      <title>Impact of coordinate frames on mode formation in twisted waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Off-axis twisted waveguides possess unique optical properties such as circular and orbital angular momentum (OAM) birefringence, setting them apart from their straight counterparts. Analyzing mode formation in such helical waveguides relies on the use of specific coordinate frames that follow the twist of the structure, making the waveguide invariant along one of the new coordinates. In this study, the differences between modes forming in high-contrast off-axis twisted waveguides defined in the three most important coordinate systems - the Frenet-Serret, the helicoidal, or the Overfelt frame - are investigated through numerical simulations. We explore modal characteristics up to high twist rates (pitch: 50 $\mu$m) and clarify a transformation allowing to map the modal fields and the effective index back to the laboratory frame.
  In case the waveguide is single-mode, the fundamental modes of the three types of waveguides show significant differences in terms of birefringence, propagation loss, and polarization. Conversely, the modal characteristics of the investigated waveguides are comparable in the multimode domain. Furthermore, our study examines the impact of twisting on spatial mode properties with the results suggesting a potential influence of the photonic spin Hall and orbital Hall effects. Additionally, modes of single-mode helical waveguides were found to exhibit superchiral fields on their surfaces.
  Implementation approaches such as 3D-nanoprinting or fiber-preform twisting open the doors to potential applications of such highly twisted waveguides, including chip-integrated devices for broadband spin- and OAM-preserving optical signal transport, as well as applications in chiral spectroscopy or nonlinear frequency conversion.</description>

Abstract: These notes appeared as a summary during the initial acquaintance with the structure and properties of spatio-temporal optical vortices (STOV), as these are presented in the current literature. The general approach to the STOV description and characterization is based on the model of scalar paraxial Gaussian wave packet. On this ground, the STOV structures of arbitrary orders are considered as superpositions of spatio-temporal Hermite-Gaussian modes. This representation enables the direct and physically meaningful characterization of the STOV amplitude and phase distributions, their evolution upon free propagation and in optical systems, internal energy flows and the orbital angular momentum. The topologically determined asymmetry and the difference between the "energy center" and "probability center" [Phys. Rev. A 107, L031501 (2023)] is discussed and qualitatively interpreted. Methods for the STOV generation and diagnostics are outlined, and the main properties of non-Gaussian (Bessel-type) STOVs are briefly described. The notes may be useful as initial introduction to the STOV-associated ideas and their extraordinary properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atmospheric interaction with light has been an area of fascination for many researchers over the last century. Environmental conditions, such as temperature and wind speed, heavily influence the complex and rapidly varying optical distortions propagating optical fields experience. The continuous random phase fluctuations commonly make deciphering the exact origins of specific optical aberrations challenging. The generation of eddies is a major contributor to atmospheric turbulence, similar in geometric structure to optical vortices that sit at the centre of OAM beams. Decomposing the received optical fields into OAM provides a unique spatial similarity that can be used to analyse turbulent channels. In this work, we present a novel mode decomposition assisted machine learning approach that reveals trainable features in the distortions of vortex beams that allow for effective environmental monitoring. This novel technique can be used reliably with Support Vector Machine regression models to measure temperature variations of 0.49C and wind speed variations of 0.029 m/s over a 36m experimental turbulent free-space channels with controllable and verifiable temperature and wind speed with short 3s measurement. The predictable nature of these findings could indicate the presence of an underlying physical relationship between environmental conditions that lead to specific eddy formation and the OAM spiral spectra.</description>

      <title>Coherent Perfect Absorption of Arbitrary Wavefronts at an Exceptional Point</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Coherent Perfect Absorber (CPA) exploits the interferometric nature of light to deposit all of a light field's incident energy into an otherwise weakly absorbing sample. The downside of this concept is that the necessary destructive interference in CPAs gets easily destroyed both by spectrally or spatially detuning the incoming light field. Each of these two limitations has recently been overcome by insights from exceptional-point physics and by using a degenerate cavity, respectively. Here, we show how these two concepts can be combined into a new type of cavity design, which allows broadband exceptional-point absorption of arbitrary wavefronts. We present two possible implementations of such a Massively Degenerate Exceptional-Point absorber and compare analytical results with numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Microscopic theory of nonlinear phase space filling in polaritonic lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.07968v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a full microscopic theory for a nonlinear phase space filling (NPSF) in strongly coupled two-dimensional polaritonic lattices. Ubiquitous in polaritonic experiments, the theoretical description of NPSF, remains limited to perturbative treatment and homogeneous samples. In this study, we go beyond the existing theoretical description and discover the broad scope of regimes where NPSF crucially modifies the optical response. Studying the quantum effects of non-bosonicity, cooperative light-matter coupling, and Coulomb blockade, we reveal several regimes for observing the nonlinear Rabi splitting quench due to the phase space filling. Unlike prior studies, we derive nonlinear Rabi frequency scaling all the way to the saturation limit and show that the presence of a lattice potential leads to qualitatively distinct nonlinearity. We concentrate on three regimes of NPSF: 1) planar; 2) fractured; and 3) ultralocalized. In planar saturation, the Rabi frequency decreases exponentially as a function of exciton density. For the fractured case, where excitons form a lattice with sites exceeding the exciton size, we discover fast NPSF at low occupation in the lattice. This is followed by slower NPSF as the medium becomes fully saturated. This behavior is particularly pronounced in the presence of Coulomb (or Rydberg) blockade, where regions of fast and slow NPSF depend on the strength of repulsion. For the ultralocalized NPSF, we observe the square-root saturation typical to the collection of two-level systems. Our findings can help describing recent observations of strong nonlinearity in heterobilayers of transition metal dichalcogenides where Moir{\'e} lattices emerge naturally [Nature \textbf{591}, 61 (2021)]. The theory also opens the prospects for engineering strongly nonlinear responses of polaritonic lattices with patterned samples, driving polaritonics into the quantum regime.</description>

Abstract: Diode effects are of great interest for both fundamental physics and modern technologies. Electrical diode effects (nonreciprocal transport) have been observed in Weyl systems. Optical diode effects arising from the Weyl fermions have been theoretically considered but not probed experimentally. Here, we report the observation of a nonlinear optical diode effect (NODE) in the magnetic Weyl semimetal CeAlSi, where the magnetization introduces a pronounced directionality in the nonlinear optical second-harmonic generation (SHG). We show demonstrate a six-fold change of the measured SHG intensity between opposite propagation directions over a bandwidth exceeding 250 meV. Supported by density-functional theory, we establish the linearly dispersive bands emerging from Weyl nodes as the origin of this broadband effect. We further demonstrate current-induced magnetization switching and thus electrical control of the NODE. Our results advance ongoing research to identify novel nonlinear optical/transport phenomena in magnetic topological materials and further opens new pathways for the unidirectional manipulation of light.</description>

Abstract: Controlling interlayer excitons in van der Waals heterostructures holds promise for exploring Bose-Einstein condensates and developing novel optoelectronic applications, such as excitonic integrated circuits. Despite intensive studies, several key fundamental properties of interlayer excitons, such as their binding energies and interactions with charges, remain not well understood. Here we report the formation of momentum-direct interlayer excitons in a high-quality MoSe2/hBN/MoSe2 heterostructure under an electric field, characterized by bright photoluminescence (PL) emission with high quantum yield and a narrow linewidth of less than 4 meV. These interlayer excitons show electrically tunable emission energy spanning ~180 meV through the Stark effect, and exhibit a sizable binding energy of ~81 meV in the intrinsic regime, along with trion binding energies of a few millielectronvolts. Remarkably, we demonstrate the long-range transport of interlayer excitons with a characteristic diffusion length exceeding ten micrometers, which can be attributed, in part, to their dipolar repulsive interactions. Spatially and polarization-resolved spectroscopic studies reveal rich exciton physics in the system, such as valley polarization, local trapping, and the possible existence of dark interlayer excitons. The formation and transport of tightly bound interlayer excitons with narrow linewidth, coupled with the ability to electrically manipulate their properties, open exciting new avenues for exploring quantum many-body physics, including excitonic condensate and superfluidity, and for developing novel optoelectronic devices, such as exciton and photon routers.</description>

Abstract: We provide a systemic theory to entangle excitons with microcavity photons. This is realized by adopting an exciton-optomechanics system and introducing a nonlinear dispersive interaction with a mechanical oscillator. We show that when either the exciton and cavity modes in the weak-coupling regime, or the two exciton-polariton modes in the strong-coupling regime, are respectively resonant with the optomechanical Stokes and anti-Stokes sidebands, entanglement between excitons and cavity photons, or between two exciton polaritons, can be established. The entanglement is in the steady state and can potentially be achievable at room temperature. In both cases, genuine tripartite entanglement is shown to be present.</description>

Abstract: Photonic computing has recently become an interesting paradigm for high-speed calculation of computing processes using light-matter interactions. Here, we propose and study an electromagnetic wave-based structure with the ability to calculate the solution of partial differential equations in the form of the Helmholtz wave equation. To do this, we make use of a network of interconnected waveguides filled with dielectric inserts. In so doing, it is shown how the proposed network can mimic the response of a network of T-circuit elements formed by two series and a parallel impedance, i.e., the waveguide network effectively behaves as a metatronic network. An in-depth theoretical analysis of the proposed metatronic structure is presented showing how the governing equation for the currents and impedances of the metatronic network resembles that of the finite difference representation of the Helmholtz wave equation. Different studies are then discussed including the solution of partial differential equations for Dirichlet and open boundary value problems, demonstrating how the proposed metatronic-based structure has the ability to calculate their solutions.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate a deep-learning-based scatterer density estimator (SDE) that processes local speckle patterns of optical coherence tomography (OCT) images and estimates the scatterer density behind each speckle pattern. The SDE is trained using large quantities of numerically simulated OCT images and their associated scatterer densities. The numerical simulation uses a noise model that incorporates the spatial properties of three types of noise, i.e., shot noise, relative-intensity noise, and non-optical noise. The SDE's performance was evaluated numerically and experimentally using two types of scattering phantom and in vitro tumor spheroids. The results confirmed that the SDE estimates scatterer densities accurately. The estimation accuracy improved significantly when compared with our previous deep-learning-based SDE, which was trained using numerical speckle patterns generated from a noise model that did not account for the spatial properties of noise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The modification of the quantum properties of coherence of photons through their interaction with matter lies at the heart of the quantum theory of light. Indeed, the absorption and emission of photons by atoms can lead to different kinds of light with characteristic quantum statistical properties. As such, different types of light are typically associated with distinct sources. Here, we report on the observation of the modification of quantum coherence of multiphoton systems in free space. This surprising effect is produced by the scattering of thermal multiphoton wavepackets upon propagation. The modification of the excitation mode of a photonic system and its associated quantum fluctuations result in the formation of different light fields with distinct quantum coherence properties. Remarkably, we show that these processes of scattering can lead to multiphoton systems with sub-shot-noise quantum properties. Our observations are validated through the nonclassical formulation of the emblematic van Cittert-Zernike theorem. We believe that the possibility of producing quantum systems with modified properties of coherence, through linear propagation, can have dramatic implications for diverse quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Attosecond Rabi Oscillations in High Harmonic Generation Resonantly Driven by Extreme Ultraviolet Laser Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-order harmonic generation driven by intense extreme ultraviolet (EUV) fields merges quantum optics and attosecond science, giving rise to an appealing route for the generation of coherent EUV and soft X-ray light for high-resolution imaging and spectroscopies. We theoretically investigate ultrafast resonant dynamics during the interaction of He atoms with strong extreme ultraviolet pulses. At high driving intensities, we identify record fast attosecond Rabi oscillations imprinting observable signatures in the high harmonic spectrum. At field strengths suppressing the Coulomb potential barrier for all the bounded states, we demonstrate the survival of the attosecond two-level dynamics for several Rabi cycles. Consequently, this intense EUV laser-atom interaction reveals a new strong-field scenario where the resonant coupling of two-level bound-bound transitions prevails, contrasting with the dominance of bound-continuum transitions in the conventional strong-field infrared regimes. These findings set an interesting perspective for extreme attosecond nonlinear optics with intense short-wavelength fields.</description>
