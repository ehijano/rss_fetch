      <title>Distributed MIMO Measurements for Integrated Communication and Sensing in an Industrial Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many concepts for future generations of wireless communication systems use coherent processing of signals from many distributed antennas. The aim is to improve communication reliability, capacity, and energy efficiency and provide possibilities for new applications through integrated communication and sensing. The large bandwidths available in the higher bands have inspired much work regarding sensing in the mmWave and sub-THz bands; however, the sub-6 GHz cellular bands will still be the main provider of wide cellular coverage due to the more favorable propagation conditions. In this paper, we present a measurement system and results of sub-6 GHz distributed MIMO measurements performed in an industrial environment. From the measurements, we evaluated the diversity for both large-scale and small-scale fading and characterized the link reliability. We also analyzed the possibility of multistatic sensing and positioning of users in the environment, with the initial results showing a mean-square error below 20 cm on the estimated position. Further, the results clearly showed that new channel models are needed that are spatially consistent and deal with the nonstationary channel properties among the antennas.</description>

      <title>Secret-Key Capacity from MIMO Channel Probing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Revealing expressions of secret-key capacity (SKC) based on data sets from Gaussian MIMO channel probing are presented. It is shown that Maurer's upper and lower bounds on SKC coincide when the used data sets are produced from one-way channel probing. As channel coherence time increases, SKC in bits per probing channel use is always lower bounded by a positive value unless eavesdropper's observations are noiseless, which is unlike SKC solely based on reciprocal channels.</description>

      <title>Spatially Non-Stationary XL-MIMO Channel Estimation: A Three-Layer Generalized Approximate Message Passing Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, channel estimation problem for extremely large-scale multi-input multi-output (XL-MIMO) systems is investigated with the considerations of the spherical wavefront effect and the spatially non-stationary (SnS) property. Due to the diversities of SnS characteristics among different propagation paths, the concurrent channel estimation of multiple paths becomes intractable. To address this challenge, we propose a two-phase channel estimation scheme. In the first phase, the angles of departure (AoDs) on the user side are estimated, and a carefully designed pilot transmission scheme enables the decomposition of the received signal from different paths. In the second phase, the subchannel estimation corresponding to different paths is formulated as a three-layer Bayesian inference problem. Specifically, the first layer captures block sparsity in the angular domain, the second layer promotes SnS property in the antenna domain, and the third layer decouples the subchannels from the observed signals. To efficiently facilitate Bayesian inference, we propose a novel three-layer generalized approximate message passing (TL-GAMP) algorithm based on structured variational massage passing and belief propagation rules. Simulation results validate the convergence and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, showcasing its robustness to different channel scenarios.</description>

      <title>Restricted Isometry Property of Rank-One Measurements with Random Unit-Modulus Vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The restricted isometry property (RIP) is essential for the linear map to guarantee the successful recovery of low-rank matrices. The existing works show that the linear map generated by the measurement matrices with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) entries satisfies RIP with high probability. However, when dealing with non-i.i.d. measurement matrices, such as the rank-one measurements, the RIP compliance may not be guaranteed. In this paper, we show that the RIP can still be achieved with high probability, when the rank-one measurement matrix is constructed by the random unit-modulus vectors. Compared to the existing works, we first address the challenge of establishing RIP for the linear map in non-i.i.d. scenarios. As validated in the experiments, this linear map is memory-efficient, and not only satisfies the RIP but also exhibits similar recovery performance of the low-rank matrices to that of conventional i.i.d. measurement matrices.</description>

      <title>Scalable Syndrome-based Neural Decoders for Bit-Interleaved Coded Modulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a framework that enables the use of Syndrome-Based Neural Decoders (SBND) for high-order Bit-Interleaved Coded Modulations (BICM). To this end, we extend the previous results on SBND, for which the validity is limited to Binary Phase-Shift Keying (BPSK), by means of a theoretical channel modeling of the bit Log-Likelihood Ratio (bit-LLR) induced outputs. We implement the proposed SBND system for two polar codes $(64,32)$ and $(128,64)$, using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and a Transformer-based architecture. Both implementations are compared in Bit Error Rate (BER) performance and computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Tensor Decomposition-based Time Varying Channel Estimation for mmWave MIMO-OFDM Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the time-varying channel estimation in millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output MIMO systems with hybrid beamforming architectures. Different from the existing contributions that considered single-carrier mmWave systems with high mobility, the wideband orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system is considered in this work. To solve the channel estimation problem under channel double selectivity, we propose a pilot transmission scheme based on 5G OFDM, and the received signals are formed as a fourth-order tensor, which fits the low-rank CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) model. By further exploring the Vandermonde structure of factor matrix, a tensor-subspace decomposition based channel estimation method is proposed to solve the CP decomposition, where the uniqueness condition is analyzed. Based on the decomposed factor matrices, the channel parameters, including angles of arrival/departure, delays, channel gains and Doppler shifts are estimated, and the Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound (CRB) results are derived as performance metrics. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method over other benchmarks. Furthermore, the channel estimation methods are tested based on the channel parameters generated by Wireless InSites, and simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed method in practical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Opportunistic User Scheduling for Secure RIS-aided Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide expressions for the secrecy outage probability (SOP) for suboptimal and optimal opportunistic scheduling schemes in a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) aided system with multiple eavesdroppers in approximate closed form. A suboptimal scheduling (SS) scheme is analyzed, which is used when the channel state information (CSI) of the eavesdropping links is unavailable, and the optimal scheduling (OS) scheme is also analyzed, which is used when the global CSI is available. For each scheme, we provide a simplified expression for the SOP in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime to demonstrate its behavior as a function of the key system parameters. At high SNR, the SOP saturates to a constant level which decreases exponentially with the number of RIS elements in the SS scheme and with the product of the number of RIS elements and the number of users in the OS scheme. We compare the performance of the opportunistic user scheduling schemes with that of a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) based scheduling scheme which chooses a pair of users in each time slot for scheduling and we show that the opportunistic schemes outperform the NOMA-based scheme. We also derive a closed-form expression for the SOP of a decode-and-forward (DF) relay-aided scheduling scheme in order to compare it with that of the RIS-aided system. It is found that the RIS-aided system outperforms the relay-aided systems when the number of RIS elements is sufficiently large. An increased number of RIS elements is required to outperform the relay-aided system at higher operating frequencies.</description>

      <title>Low Complexity Channel Estimation for RIS-Assisted THz Systems with Beam Split</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To support extremely high data rates, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted terahertz (THz) communication is considered to be a promising technology for future sixth-generation networks. However, due to the typical employment of hybrid beamforming architecture in THz systems, as well as the passive nature of RIS which lacks the capability to process pilot signals, obtaining channel state information (CSI) is facing significant challenges. To accurately estimate the cascaded channel, we propose a novel low-complexity channel estimation scheme, which includes three steps. Specifically, we first estimate full CSI within a small subset of subcarriers (SCs). Then, we acquire angular information at base station and RIS based on the full CSI. Finally, we derive spatial directions and recover full-CSI for the remaining SCs. Theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can achieve superior performance in terms of normalized mean-square-error and exhibit a lower computational complexity compared with the existing algorithms.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Property Testing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Locality is a fundamental feature of many physical time evolutions. Assumptions on locality and related structural properties also underlie recently proposed procedures for learning an unknown Hamiltonian from access to the induced time evolution. However, no protocols to rigorously test whether an unknown Hamiltonian is local were known. We investigate Hamiltonian locality testing as a property testing problem, where the task is to determine whether an unknown $n$-qubit Hamiltonian $H$ is $k$-local or $\varepsilon$-far from all $k$-local Hamiltonians, given access to the time evolution along $H$. First, we emphasize the importance of the chosen distance measure: With respect to the operator norm, a worst-case distance measure, incoherent quantum locality testers require $\tilde{\Omega}(2^n)$ many time evolution queries and an expected total evolution time of $\tilde{\Omega}(2^n / \varepsilon)$, and even coherent testers need $\Omega(2^{n/2})$ many queries and $\Omega(2^{n/2}/\varepsilon)$ total evolution time. In contrast, when distances are measured according to the normalized Frobenius norm, corresponding to an average-case distance, we give a sample-, time-, and computationally efficient incoherent Hamiltonian locality testing algorithm based on randomized measurements. In fact, our procedure can be used to simultaneously test a wide class of Hamiltonian properties beyond locality. Finally, we prove that learning a general Hamiltonian remains exponentially hard with this average-case distance, thereby establishing an exponential separation between Hamiltonian testing and learning. Our work initiates the study of property testing for quantum Hamiltonians, demonstrating that a broad class of Hamiltonian properties is efficiently testable even with limited quantum capabilities, and positioning Hamiltonian testing as an independent area of research alongside Hamiltonian learning.</description>

      <title>Neural Codebook Design for Network Beam Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Obtaining accurate and timely channel state information (CSI) is a fundamental challenge for large antenna systems. Mobile systems like 5G use a beam management framework that joins the initial access, beamforming, CSI acquisition, and data transmission. The design of codebooks for these stages, however, is challenging due to their interrelationships, varying array sizes, and site-specific channel and user distributions. Furthermore, beam management is often focused on single-sector operations while ignoring the overarching network- and system-level optimization. In this paper, we proposed an end-to-end learned codebook design algorithm, network beamspace learning (NBL), that captures and optimizes codebooks to mitigate interference while maximizing the achievable performance with extremely large hybrid arrays. The proposed algorithm requires limited shared information yet designs codebooks that outperform traditional codebooks by over 10dB in beam alignment and achieve more than 25% improvements in network spectral efficiency.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Clustered Federated Learning in NOMA Enhanced Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the benefits of integrating the novel clustered federated learning (CFL) approach with non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) under non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) datasets, where multiple devices participate in the aggregation with time limitations and a finite number of sub-channels. A detailed theoretical analysis of the generalization gap that measures the degree of non-IID in the data distribution is presented. Following that, solutions to address the challenges posed by non-IID conditions are proposed with the analysis of the properties. Specifically, users' data distributions are parameterized as concentration parameters and grouped using spectral clustering, with Dirichlet distribution serving as the prior. The investigation into the generalization gap and convergence rate guides the design of sub-channel assignments through the matching-based algorithm, and the power allocation is achieved by Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions with the derived closed-form solution. The extensive simulation results show that the proposed cluster-based FL framework can outperform FL baselines in terms of both test accuracy and convergence rate. Moreover, jointly optimizing sub-channel and power allocation in NOMA-enhanced networks can lead to a significant improvement.</description>

      <title>Finding Super-spreaders in Network Cascades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Suppose that a cascade (e.g., an epidemic) spreads on an unknown graph, and only the infection times of vertices are observed. What can be learned about the graph from the infection times caused by multiple distinct cascades? Most of the literature on this topic focuses on the task of recovering the entire graph, which requires $\Omega ( \log n)$ cascades for an $n$-vertex bounded degree graph. Here we ask a different question: can the important parts of the graph be estimated from just a few (i.e., constant number) of cascades, even as $n$ grows large?
  In this work, we focus on identifying super-spreaders (i.e., high-degree vertices) from infection times caused by a Susceptible-Infected process on a graph. Our first main result shows that vertices of degree greater than $n^{3/4}$ can indeed be estimated from a constant number of cascades. Our algorithm for doing so leverages a novel connection between vertex degrees and the second derivative of the cumulative infection curve. Conversely, we show that estimating vertices of degree smaller than $n^{1/2}$ requires at least $\log(n) / \log \log (n)$ cascades. Surprisingly, this matches (up to $\log \log n$ factors) the number of cascades needed to learn the \emph{entire} graph if it is a tree.</description>

      <title>Informational Rescaling of PCA Maps with Application to Genetic Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.12654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the inadequacy of covariances/correlations and other measures in L2 as relative distance metrics under some conditions. We propose a computationally simple heuristic to transform a map based on standard principal component analysis (PCA) (when the variables are asymptotically Gaussian) into an entropy-based map where distances are based on mutual information (MI). Rescaling Principal Component based distances using MI allows a representation of relative statistical associations when, as in genetics, it is applied on bit measurements between individuals' genomic mutual information.
  This entropy rescaled PCA, while preserving order relationships (along a dimension), changes the relative distances to make them linear to information. We show the effect on the entire world population and some subsamples, which leads to significant differences with the results of current research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.13119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new nonlinear optical channel equalizer based on Transformers. By leveraging parallel computation and attending directly to the memory across a sequence of symbols, we show that Transformers can be used effectively for nonlinear equalization in coherent long-haul transmission. For this application, we present an implementation of the encoder part of the Transformer and analyze its performance over a wide range of different hyper-parameters. It is shown that by processing blocks of symbols at each iteration and carefully selecting subsets of the encoder's output to be processed together, an efficient nonlinear compensation can be achieved for different complexity constraints. We also propose the use of a physic-informed mask inspired by nonlinear perturbation theory for reducing the computational complexity of the attention mechanism.</description>

      <title>Power Allocation and Beamforming Design for IRS-aided Secure Directional Modulation Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15504v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the aim of boosting the security of the conventional directional modulation (DM) network, a secure DM network assisted by intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is investigated in this paper. To maximize the secrecy rate (SR), we jointly optimize the power allocation (PA) factor, confidential message (CM) beamforming, artificial noise (AN) beamforming, and IRS reflected beamforming. To tackle the formulated problem, a maximizing SR with high-performance (Max-SR-HP) scheme is proposed, where the PA factor, CM beamforming, AN beamforming, and IRS phase shift matrix are derived by the derivative operation, generalized Rayleigh-Ritz, generalized power iteration, and semidefinite relaxation criteria, respectively. Given that the high complexity of the above scheme, a maximizing SR with low-complexity (Max-SR-LC) scheme is proposed, which employs the generalized leakage and successive convex approximation algorithms to derive the variables. Simulation results show that both the proposed schemes can significantly boost the SR performance, and are better than the equal PA, no IRS and random phase shift IRS schemes.</description>

      <title>Quantum advantage in zero-error function computation with side information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of zero-error function computation with side information. Alice has a source $X$ and Bob has correlated source $Y$ and they can communicate via either classical or a quantum channel. Bob wants to calculate $f(X,Y)$ with zero error. We aim to characterize the minimum amount of information that Alice needs to send to Bob for this to happen with zero-error. In the classical setting, this quantity depends on the asymptotic growth of $\chi(G^{(m)})$, the chromatic number of an appropriately defined $m$-instance "confusion graph". In this work we present structural characterizations of $G^{(m)}$ and demonstrate two function computation scenarios that have the same single-instance confusion graph. However, in one case there a strict advantage in using quantum transmission as against classical transmission, whereas there is no such advantage in the other case.</description>

      <title>Improved Syndrome-based Neural Decoder for Linear Block Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13948v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the problem of neural-based error correction decoding, and more specifically, the new so-called syndrome-based decoding technique introduced to tackle scalability in the training phase for larger code sizes. We improve on previous works in terms of allowing full decoding of the message rather than codewords, allowing thus the application to non-systematic codes, and proving that the single-message training property is still viable. The suggested system is implemented and tested on polar codes of sizes (64,32) and (128,64), and a BCH of size (63,51), leading to a significant improvement in both Bit Error Rate (BER) and Frame Error Rate (FER), with gains between 0.3dB and 1dB for the implemented codes in the high Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) regime.</description>

      <title>Codebook-enabled Generative End-to-end Semantic Communication Powered by Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Codebook-based generative semantic communication attracts increasing attention, since only indices are required to be transmitted when the codebook is shared between transmitter and receiver. However, due to the fact that the semantic relations among code vectors are not necessarily related to the distance of the corresponding code indices, the performance of the codebook-enabled semantic communication system is susceptible to the channel noise. Thus, how to improve the system robustness against the noise requires careful design. This paper proposes a robust codebook-assisted image semantic communication system, where semantic codec and codebook are first jointly constructed, and then vector-to-index transformer is designed guided by the codebook to eliminate the effects of channel noise, and achieve image generation. Thanks to the assistance of the high-quality codebook to the Transformer, the generated images at the receiver outperform those of the compared methods in terms of visual perception. In the end, numerical results and generated images demonstrate the advantages of the generative semantic communication method over JPEG+LDPC and traditional joint source channel coding (JSCC) methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A linear block code over a field can be derived from a unit scheme. Looking at codes as structures within a unit scheme greatly extends the availability of linear block and convolutional codes and allows the construction of the codes to required length, rate, distance and type. Properties of a code emanate from properties of the unit from which it was derived. %% can thus be constructed and analysed by designating the units whose properties would give the required codes.
  Orthogonal units, units in group rings, Fourier/Vandermonde units and related units are used to construct and analyse linear block and convolutional codes and to construct these to predefined length, rate, distance and type. Self-dual, dual containing, quantum error-correcting and complementary dual linear block and convolutional codes are constructed.
  Low density parity check linear block and convolutional codes are constructed using group rings and are constructed with no short cycles in the control matrix.
  From a single unit, multiple codes of a required type are derivable.</description>

      <title>Unscrambling Quantum Information with Clifford decoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.11337v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum information scrambling is a unitary process that destroys local correlations and spreads information throughout the system, effectively hiding it in nonlocal degrees of freedom. In principle, unscrambling this information is possible with perfect knowledge of the unitary dynamics [B. Yoshida and A. Kitaev, arXiv:1710.03363.]. However, this Letter demonstrates that even without previous knowledge of the internal dynamics, information can be efficiently decoded from an unknown scrambler by monitoring the outgoing information of a local subsystem. Surprisingly, we show that scramblers with unknown internal dynamics, which are rapidly mixing but not fully chaotic, can be decoded using Clifford decoders. The essential properties of a scrambling unitary can be efficiently recovered, even if the process is exponentially complex. Specifically, we establish that a unitary operator composed of $t$ non-Clifford gates admits a Clifford decoder up to $t\le n$.</description>

      <title>Demystifying Local and Global Fairness Trade-offs in Federated Learning Using Partial Information Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents an information-theoretic perspective to group fairness trade-offs in federated learning (FL) with respect to sensitive attributes, such as gender, race, etc. Existing works often focus on either $\textit{global fairness}$ (overall disparity of the model across all clients) or $\textit{local fairness}$ (disparity of the model at each client), without always considering their trade-offs. There is a lack of understanding regarding the interplay between global and local fairness in FL, particularly under data heterogeneity, and if and when one implies the other. To address this gap, we leverage a body of work in information theory called partial information decomposition (PID), which first identifies three sources of unfairness in FL, namely, $\textit{Unique Disparity}$, $\textit{Redundant Disparity}$, and $\textit{Masked Disparity}$. We demonstrate how these three disparities contribute to global and local fairness using canonical examples. This decomposition helps us derive fundamental limits on the trade-off between global and local fairness, highlighting where they agree or disagree. We introduce the $\textit{Accuracy and Global-Local Fairness Optimality Problem (AGLFOP)}$, a convex optimization that defines the theoretical limits of accuracy and fairness trade-offs, identifying the best possible performance any FL strategy can attain given a dataset and client distribution. We also present experimental results on synthetic datasets and the ADULT dataset to support our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Mean Estimation with User-Level Privacy for Spatio-Temporal IoT Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15906v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of the private release of sample means of speed values from traffic datasets. Our key contribution is the development of user-level differentially private algorithms that incorporate carefully chosen parameter values to ensure low estimation errors on real-world datasets, while ensuring privacy. We test our algorithms on ITMS (Intelligent Traffic Management System) data from an Indian city, where the speeds of different buses are drawn in a potentially non-i.i.d. manner from an unknown distribution, and where the number of speed samples contributed by different buses is potentially different. We then apply our algorithms to large synthetic datasets, generated based on the ITMS data. Here, we provide theoretical justification for the observed performance trends, and also provide recommendations for the choices of algorithm subroutines that result in low estimation errors. Finally, we characterize the best performance of pseudo-user creation-based algorithms on worst-case datasets via a minimax approach; this then gives rise to a novel procedure for the creation of pseudo-users, which optimizes the worst-case total estimation error. The algorithms discussed in the paper are readily applicable to general spatio-temporal IoT datasets for releasing a differentially private mean of a desired value.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02187v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach to the problem of mutual information (MI) estimation via introducing normalizing flows-based estimator. The estimator maps original data to the target distribution with known closed-form expression for MI. We demonstrate that our approach yields MI estimates for the original data. Experiments with high-dimensional data are provided to show the advantages of the proposed estimator.</description>
