      <title>Rewiring Human Brain Networks via Lightweight Dynamic Connectivity Framework: An EEG-Based Stress Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, Electroencephalographic analysis has gained prominence in stress research when combined with AI and Machine Learning models for validation. In this study, a lightweight dynamic brain connectivity framework based on Time Varying Directed Transfer Function is proposed, where TV DTF features were validated through ML based stress classification. TV DTF estimates the directional information flow between brain regions across distinct EEG frequency bands, thereby capturing temporal and causal influences that are often overlooked by static functional connectivity measures. EEG recordings from the 32 channel SAM 40 dataset were employed, focusing on mental arithmetic task trials. The dynamic EEG-based TV-DTF features were validated through ML classifiers such as Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Adaptive Boosting, and Extreme Gradient Boosting. Experimental results show that alpha-TV-DTF provided the strongest discriminative power, with SVM achieving 89.73% accuracy in 3-class classification and with XGBoost achieving 93.69% accuracy in 2 class classification. Relative to absolute power and phase locking based functional connectivity features, alpha TV DTF and beta TV DTF achieved higher performance across the ML models, highlighting the advantages of dynamic over static measures. Feature importance analysis further highlighted dominant long-range frontal parietal and frontal occipital informational influences, emphasizing the regulatory role of frontal regions under stress. These findings validate the lightweight TV-DTF as a robust framework, revealing spatiotemporal brain dynamics and directional influences across different stress levels.</description>

      <title>Stable non-minimal fixed points of threshold-linear networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In threshold-linear networks (TLNs), a fixed point is called minimal if no proper subset of its support is also a fixed point. Curto et al (Advances in Applied Mathematics, 2024) conjectured that every stable fixed point of any TLN must be a minimal fixed point. We provide a counterexample to this conjecture: an explicit competitive TLN on 3 neurons that exhibits a stable fixed point whose support is not minimal (it contains the support of another stable fixed point). We prove that there is no competitive TLN on 2 neurons which contains a stable non-minimal fixed point, so our 3-neuron construction is the smallest such example. By expanding our base example, we show for any positive integers $i, j$ with $i &lt; j-1$ that there exists a competitive TLN with stable fixed point supports $\tau \subsetneq \sigma$ for which $|\tau| = i$ and $|\sigma| = j$. Using a different expansion of our base example, we also show that chains of nested stable fixed points in competitive TLNs can be made arbitrarily long.</description>

      <title>sMRI-based Brain Age Estimation in MCI using Persistent Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we propose the use of persistent homology -- specifically Betti curves for brain age prediction and for distinguishing between healthy and pathological aging. The proposed framework is applied to 100 structural MRI scans from the publicly available ADNI dataset. Our results indicate that Betti curve features, particularly those from dimension-1 (connected components) and dimension-2 (1D holes), effectively capture structural brain alterations associated with aging. Furthermore, clinical features are grouped into three categories based on their correlation, or lack thereof, with (i) predicted brain age and (ii) chronological age. The findings demonstrate that this approach successfully differentiates normal from pathological aging and provides a novel framework for understanding how structural brain changes relate to cognitive impairment. The proposed method serves as a foundation for developing potential biomarkers for early detection and monitoring of cognitive decline.</description>

      <title>Selection and Stability of Functional Connectivity Features for Classification of Brain Disorders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain disorders are an umbrella term for a group of neurological and psychiatric conditions that have a major effect on thinking, feeling, and acting. These conditions encompass a wide range of conditions. The illnesses in question pose significant difficulties not only for individuals, but also for healthcare systems all across the world. In this study, we explore the capability of explainable machine learning for classification of people who suffer from brain disorders. This is accomplished by the utilization of brain connection map, also referred as connectome, derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. In order to analyze features that are based on the connectome, we investigated several different feature selection procedures. These strategies included the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Relief, and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), in addition to a logistic regression (LR) classifier. First and foremost, the purpose was to evaluate and contrast the classification accuracy of different feature selection methods in terms of distinguishing healthy controls from diseased individuals. The evaluation of the stability of the traits that were chosen was the second objective. The identification of the regions of the brain that have an effect on the classification was the third main objective. When applied to the UCLA dataset, the LASSO approach, which is our most effective strategy, produced a classification accuracy of 91.85% and a stability index of 0.74, which is greater than the results obtained by other approaches: Relief and ANOVA. These methods are effective in locating trustworthy biomarkers, which adds to the development of connectome-based classification in the context of issues that impact the brain.</description>

      <title>Gravity-Awareness: Deep Learning Models and LLM Simulation of Human Awareness in Altered Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Earth's gravity has fundamentally shaped human development by guiding the brain's integration of vestibular, visual, and proprioceptive inputs into an internal model of gravity: a dynamic neural representation enabling prediction and interpretation of gravitational forces. This work presents a dual computational framework to quantitatively model these adaptations. The first component is a lightweight Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) that predicts g-load-dependent changes in key electroencephalographic (EEG) frequency bands, representing the brain's cortical state. The second component utilizes a suite of independent Gaussian Processes (GPs) to model the body's broader physiological state, including Heart Rate Variability (HRV), Electrodermal Activity (EDA), and motor behavior. Both models were trained on data derived from a comprehensive review of parabolic flight literature, using published findings as anchor points to construct robust, continuous functions. To complement this quantitative analysis, we simulated subjective human experience under different gravitational loads, ranging from microgravity (0g) and partial gravity (Moon 0.17g, Mars 0.38g) to hypergravity associated with spacecraft launch and re-entry (1.8g), using a large language model (Claude 3.5 Sonnet). The model was prompted with physiological parameters to generate introspective narratives of alertness and self-awareness, which closely aligned with the quantitative findings from both the EEG and physiological models. This combined framework integrates quantitative physiological modeling with generative cognitive simulation, offering a novel approach to understanding and predicting human performance in altered gravity</description>

      <title>ConnectomeBench: Can LLMs Proofread the Connectome?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Connectomics - the mapping of neural connections in an organism's brain - currently requires extraordinary human effort to proofread the data collected from imaging and machine-learning assisted segmentation. With the growing excitement around using AI agents to automate important scientific tasks, we explore whether current AI systems can perform multiple tasks necessary for data proofreading. We introduce ConnectomeBench, a multimodal benchmark evaluating large language model (LLM) capabilities in three critical proofreading tasks: segment type identification, split error correction, and merge error detection. Using expert annotated data from two large open-source datasets - a cubic millimeter of mouse visual cortex and the complete Drosophila brain - we evaluate proprietary multimodal LLMs including Claude 3.7/4 Sonnet, o4-mini, GPT-4.1, GPT-4o, as well as open source models like InternVL-3 and NVLM. Our results demonstrate that current models achieve surprisingly high performance in segment identification (52-82% balanced accuracy vs. 20-25% chance) and binary/multiple choice split error correction (75-85% accuracy vs. 50% chance) while generally struggling on merge error identification tasks. Overall, while the best models still lag behind expert performance, they demonstrate promising capabilities that could eventually enable them to augment and potentially replace human proofreading in connectomics.

      <title>Modeling Causal Interactions Across Brain Functional Subnetworks for Population-specific Disease Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current neuroimaging studies on neurodegenerative diseases and psychological risk factors have been developed predominantly in non Hispanic White cohorts, with other populations markedly underrepresented. In this work, we construct directed hyper connectomes among large scale functional brain systems based on causal influences between brain regions, and examine their links to Alzheimer Disease progression and worry levels across racial groups. By using Health and Aging Brain Study Health Disparities (HABS HD) dataset, our experimental results suggest that neglecting racial variation in brain network architecture may reduce predictive performance in both cognitive and affective phenotypes. Important shared and population-specific hyper-connectome patterns related to both AD progression and worry levels were identified. We further observed distinct closed loop directed circuits across groups, suggesting that different populations may rely on distinct feedback based network regulation strategies when supporting cognition or managing emotional states. Together, these results indicate a common backbone of network vulnerability with population-dependent variations in regulatory coordination, underscoring the importance of population-aware neuroimaging models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complexity of human cognition has meant that psychology makes more use of theory and conceptual models than perhaps any other biomedical field. To enable precise quantitative study of the full breadth of phenomena in psychological and psychiatric medicine as well as cognitive aspects of AI safety, there is a need for a mathematical formulation which is both mathematically precise and equally accessible to experts from numerous fields. In this paper we formalize human psychodynamics via the diagrammatic framework of process theory, describe its key properties, and explain the links between a diagrammatic representation and central concepts in analysis of cognitive processes in contexts such as psychotherapy, neurotechnology, AI alignment, AI agent representation of individuals in autonomous negotiations, developing human-like AI systems, and other aspects of AI safety.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph-theoretical labeling provides a rigorous mathematical framework for characterizing the structural and functional organization of complex networks. This paper investigates the application of cordial labeling and signed product cordial labeling to brain connectivity graphs, emphasizing their relevance to small-world network models in neuroscience. The cordial condition is interpreted as a measure of structural balance between excitatory and inhibitory neuronal interactions, while the signed product cordial labeling reflects the coexistence of cooperative and antagonistic neural dynamics.</description>

      <title>AI-Enhanced High-Density NIRS Patch for Real-Time Brain Layer Oxygenation Monitoring in Neurological Emergencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photon scattering has traditionally limited the ability of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to extract accurate, layer-specific information from the brain. This limitation restricts its clinical utility for precise neurological monitoring. To address this, we introduce an AI-driven, high-density NIRS system optimized to provide real-time, layer-specific oxygenation data from the brain cortex, specifically targeting acute neuro-emergencies. Our system integrates high-density NIRS reflectance data with a neural network trained on MRI-based synthetic datasets. This approach achieves robust cortical oxygenation accuracy across diverse anatomical variations. In simulations, our AI-assisted NIRS demonstrated a strong correlation (R2=0.913) with actual cortical oxygenation, markedly outperforming conventional methods (R2=0.469). Furthermore, biomimetic phantom experiments confirmed its superior anatomical reliability (R2=0.986) compared to standard commercial devices (R2=0.823). In clinical validation with healthy subjects and ischemic stroke patients, the system distinguished between the two groups with an AUC of 0.943. This highlights its potential as an accessible, high-accuracy diagnostic tool for emergency and point-of-care settings. These results underscore the system's capability to advance neuro-monitoring precision through AI, enabling timely, data-driven decisions in critical care environments.</description>

      <title>BrainCSD: A Hierarchical Consistency-Driven MoE Foundation Model for Unified Connectome Synthesis and Multitask Brain Trait Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Functional and structural connectivity (FC/SC) are key multimodal biomarkers for brain analysis, yet their clinical utility is hindered by costly acquisition, complex preprocessing, and frequent missing modalities. Existing foundation models either process single modalities or lack explicit mechanisms for cross-modal and cross-scale consistency. We propose BrainCSD, a hierarchical mixture-of-experts (MoE) foundation model that jointly synthesizes FC/SC biomarkers and supports downstream decoding tasks (diagnosis and prediction). BrainCSD features three neuroanatomically grounded components: (1) a ROI-specific MoE that aligns regional activations from canonical networks (e.g., DMN, FPN) with a global atlas via contrastive consistency; (2) a Encoding-Activation MOE that models dynamic cross-time/gradient dependencies in fMRI/dMRI; and (3) a network-aware refinement MoE that enforces structural priors and symmetry at individual and population levels. Evaluated on the datasets under complete and missing-modality settings, BrainCSD achieves SOTA results: 95.6\% accuracy for MCI vs. CN classification without FC, low synthesis error (FC RMSE: 0.038; SC RMSE: 0.006), brain age prediction (MAE: 4.04 years), and MMSE score estimation (MAE: 1.72 points).

      <title>Topologically Invariant Permutation Test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Functional brain networks exhibit topological structures that reflect neural organization; however, statistical comparison of these networks is challenging for several reasons. This paper introduces a topologically invariant permutation test for detecting topological inequivalence. Under topological equivalence, topological features can be permuted separately between groups without distorting individual network structures. The test statistic uses $2$-Wasserstein distances on persistent diagrams, computed in closed form. To reduce variability in brain connectivities while preserving topology, heat kernel expansion on the Hodge Laplacian is applied with bandwidth $t$ controlling diffusion intensity. Theoretical results guarantee variance reduction through optimal Hilbert space projection. Simulations across diverse network topologies show superior performance compared to conventional two-sample tests and alternative metrics. Applied to resting-state fMRI data from the Multimodal Treatment of ADHD study, the method detects significant topological differences between cannabis users and non-users.</description>

      <title>On the Analogy between Human Brain and LLMs: Spotting Key Neurons in Grammar Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Neural Networks, the building blocks of AI, were inspired by the human brain's network of neurons. Over the years, these networks have evolved to replicate the complex capabilities of the brain, allowing them to handle tasks such as image and language processing. In the realm of Large Language Models, there has been a keen interest in making the language learning process more akin to that of humans. While neuroscientific research has shown that different grammatical categories are processed by different neurons in the brain, we show that LLMs operate in a similar way. Utilizing Llama 3, we identify the most important neurons associated with the prediction of words belonging to different part-of-speech tags. Using the achieved knowledge, we train a classifier on a dataset, which shows that the activation patterns of these key neurons can reliably predict part-of-speech tags on fresh data. The results suggest the presence of a subspace in LLMs focused on capturing part-of-speech tag concepts, resembling patterns observed in lesion studies of the brain in neuroscience.</description>

      <title>A Causal Formulation of Spike-Wave Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the relationship between brain activity and behavior is a central goal of neuroscience. Despite significant advances, a fundamental dichotomy persists: neural activity manifests as both discrete spikes of individual neurons and collective waves of populations. Both neural codes correlate with behavior, yet correlation alone cannot determine whether waves exert a causal influence or merely reflect spiking dynamics without causal efficacy. According to the Causal Hierarchy Theorem, no amount of observational data--however extensive--can settle this question; causal conclusions require explicit structural assumptions or careful experiment designs that directly correspond to the causal effect of interest. We develop a formal framework that makes this limitation precise and constructive. Formalizing epiphenomenality via the invariance of interventional distributions in Structural Causal Models (SCMs), we derive a certificate of sufficiency from Pearl's do-calculus that specifies when variables can be removed from the model without loss of causal explainability and clarifies how interventions should be interpreted under different causal structures of spike-wave duality. The purpose of this work is not to resolve the spike-wave debate, but to reformulate it. We shift the problem from asking which signal matters most to asking under what conditions any signal can be shown to matter at all. This reframing distinguishes prediction from explanation and offers neuroscience a principled route for deciding when waves belong to mechanism and when they constitute a byproduct of underlying coordination</description>

      <title>De-Individualizing fMRI Signals via Mahalanobis Whitening and Bures Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Functional connectivity has been widely investigated to understand brain disease in clinical studies and imaging-based neuroscience, and analyzing changes in functional connectivity has proven to be valuable for understanding and computationally evaluating the effects on brain function caused by diseases or experimental stimuli. By using Mahalanobis data whitening prior to the use of dimensionality reduction algorithms, we are able to distill meaningful information from fMRI signals about subjects and the experimental stimuli used to prompt them. Furthermore, we offer an interpretation of Mahalanobis whitening as a two-stage de-individualization of data which is motivated by similarity as captured by the Bures distance, which is connected to quantum mechanics. These methods have potential to aid discoveries about the mechanisms that link brain function with cognition and behavior and may improve the accuracy and consistency of Alzheimer's diagnosis, especially in the preclinical stage of disease progression.</description>

      <title>Bridging Accuracy and Explainability in EEG-based Graph Attention Network for Depression Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Depression is a major cause of global mental illness and significantly influences suicide rates. Timely and accurate diagnosis is essential for effective intervention. Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a non-invasive and accessible method for examining cerebral activity and identifying disease-associated patterns. We propose a novel graph-based deep learning framework, named Edge-gated, axis-mixed Pooling Attention Network (ExPANet), for differentiating major depressive disorder (MDD) patients from healthy controls (HC). EEG recordings undergo preprocessing to eliminate artifacts and are segmented into short periods of activity. We extract 14 features from each segment, which include time, frequency, fractal, and complexity domains. Electrodes are represented as nodes, whereas edges are determined by the phase-locking value (PLV) to represent functional connectivity. The generated brain graphs are examined utilizing an adapted graph attention network. This architecture acquires both localized electrode characteristics and comprehensive functional connectivity patterns. The proposed framework attains superior performance relative to current EEG-based approaches across two different datasets. A fundamental advantage of our methodology is its explainability. We evaluated the significance of features, channels, and edges, in addition to intrinsic attention weights. These studies highlight features, cerebral areas, and connectivity associations that are especially relevant to MDD, many of which correspond with clinical data. Our findings demonstrate a reliable and transparent method for EEG-based screening of MDD, using deep learning with clinically relevant results.</description>

      <title>Explaining Human Choice Probabilities with Simple Vector Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When people pursue rewards in stochastic environments, they often match their choice frequencies to the observed target frequencies, even when this policy is demonstrably sub-optimal. We used a ``hide and seek'' task to evaluate this behavior under conditions where pursuit (seeking) could be toggled to avoidance (hiding), while leaving the probability distribution fixed, or varying complexity by changing the number of possible choices. We developed a model for participant choice built from choice frequency histograms treated as vectors. We posited the existence of a probability antimatching strategy for avoidance (hiding) rounds, and formalized this as a vector reflection of probability matching. We found that only two basis policies: matching/antimatching and maximizing/minimizing were sufficient to account for participant choices across a range of room numbers and opponent probability distributions. This schema requires only that people have the ability to remember the relative frequency of the different outcomes. With this knowledge simple operations can construct the maximizing and minimizing policies as well as matching and antimatching strategies. A mixture of these two policies captures human choice patterns in a stochastic environment.</description>

      <title>Neural Thermodynamics: Entropic Forces in Deep and Universal Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12387v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid discovery of emergent phenomena in deep learning and large language models, understanding their cause has become an urgent need. Here, we propose a rigorous entropic-force theory for understanding the learning dynamics of neural networks trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants. Building on the theory of parameter symmetries and an entropic loss landscape, we show that representation learning is crucially governed by emergent entropic forces arising from stochasticity and discrete-time updates. These forces systematically break continuous parameter symmetries and preserve discrete ones, leading to a series of gradient balance phenomena that resemble the equipartition property of thermal systems. These phenomena, in turn, (a) explain the universal alignment of neural representations between AI models and lead to a proof of the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, and (b) reconcile the seemingly contradictory observations of sharpness- and flatness-seeking behavior of deep learning optimization. Our theory and experiments demonstrate that a combination of entropic forces and symmetry breaking is key to understanding emergent phenomena in deep learning.</description>
