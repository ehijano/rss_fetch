      <title>Bayesian Projection of Refugee and Asylum Seeker Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimates of future migration patterns are a crucial input to world population projections. Forced migration, including refugee and asylum seekers, plays an important role in overall migration patterns, but is notoriously difficult to forecast. We propose a modeling pipeline based on Bayesian hierarchical time-series modeling for projecting combined refugee and asylum seeker populations by country of origin using data from the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCR). Our approach is based on a conceptual model of refugee crises following growth and decline phases, separated by a peak. The growth and decline phases are modeled by logistic growth and decline through an interrupted logistic process model. We evaluate our method through a set of validation exercises that show it has good performance for forecasts at 1, 5, and 10 year horizons, and we present projections for 35 countries with ongoing refugee crises.</description>

      <title>On the Relation Between Autoencoders and Non-negative Matrix Factorization, and Their Application for Mutational Signature Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this study is to provide a foundation to understand the relationship between non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and non-negative autoencoders enabling proper interpretation and understanding of autoencoder-based alternatives to NMF. Since its introduction, NMF has been a popular tool for extracting interpretable, low-dimensional representations of high-dimensional data. However, recently, several studies have proposed to replace NMF with autoencoders. This increasing popularity of autoencoders warrants an investigation on whether this replacement is in general valid and reasonable. Moreover, the exact relationship between non-negative autoencoders and NMF has not been thoroughly explored. Thus, a main aim of this study is to investigate in detail the relationship between non-negative autoencoders and NMF. We find that the connection between the two models can be established through convex NMF, which is a restricted case of NMF. In particular, convex NMF is a special case of an autoencoder. The performance of NMF and autoencoders is compared within the context of extraction of mutational signatures from cancer genomics data. We find that the reconstructions based on NMF are more accurate compared to autoencoders, while the signatures extracted using both methods show comparable consistencies and values when externally validated. These findings suggest that the non-negative autoencoders investigated in this article do not provide an improvement of NMF in the field of mutational signature extraction.</description>

      <title>Generalization Problems in Experiments Involving Multidimensional Decisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Can the causal effects estimated in experiment be generalized to real-world scenarios? This question lies at the heart of social science studies. External validity primarily assesses whether experimental effects persist across different settings, implicitly presuming the experiment's ecological validity-that is, the consistency of experimental effects with their real-life counterparts. However, we argue that this presumed consistency may not always hold, especially in experiments involving multidimensional decision processes, such as conjoint experiments. We introduce a formal model to elucidate how attention and salience effects lead to three types of inconsistencies between experimental findings and real-world phenomena: amplified effect magnitude, effect sign reversal, and effect importance reversal. We derive testable hypotheses from each theoretical outcome and test these hypotheses using data from various existing conjoint experiments and our own experiments. Drawing on our theoretical framework, we propose several recommendations for experimental design aimed at enhancing the generalizability of survey experiment findings.</description>

      <title>ResSurv: Cancer Survival Analysis Prediction Model Based on Residual Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Survival prediction is an important branch of cancer prognosis analysis. The model that predicts survival risk through TCGA genomics data can discover genes related to cancer and provide diagnosis and treatment recommendations based on patient characteristics. We found that deep learning models based on Cox proportional hazards often suffer from overfitting when dealing with high-throughput data. Moreover, we found that as the number of network layers increases, the experimental results will not get better, and network degradation will occur. Based on this problem, we propose a new framework based on Deep Residual Learning. Combine the ideas of Cox proportional hazards and Residual. And name it ResSurv. First, ResSurv is a feed-forward deep learning network stacked by multiple basic ResNet Blocks. In each ResNet Block, we add a Normalization Layer to prevent gradient disappearance and gradient explosion. Secondly, for the loss function of the neural network, we inherited the Cox proportional hazards methods, applied the semi-parametric of the CPH model to the neural network, combined with the partial likelihood model, established the loss function, and performed backpropagation and gradient update. Finally, we compared ResSurv networks of different depths and found that we can effectively extract high-dimensional features. Ablation experiments and comparative experiments prove that our model has reached SOTA(state of the art) in the field of deep learning, and our network can effectively extract deep information.</description>

      <title>Nested Instrumental Variables Design: Switcher Average Treatment Effect, Identification, Efficient Estimation and Generalizability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Instrumental variables (IV) are a commonly used tool to estimate causal effects from non-randomized data. A prototype of an IV is a randomized trial with non-compliance where the randomized treatment assignment serves as an IV for the non-ignorable treatment received. Under a monotonicity assumption, a valid IV non-parametrically identifies the average treatment effect among a non-identifiable complier subgroup, whose generalizability is often under debate. In many studies, there could exist multiple versions of an IV, for instance, different nudges to take the same treatment in different study sites in a multi-center clinical trial. These different versions of an IV may result in different compliance rates and offer a unique opportunity to study IV estimates' generalizability. In this article, we introduce a novel nested IV assumption and study identification of the average treatment effect among two latent subgroups: always-compliers and switchers, who are defined based on the joint potential treatment received under two versions of a binary IV. We derive the efficient influence function for the SWitcher Average Treatment Effect (SWATE) and propose efficient estimators. We then propose formal statistical tests of the generalizability of IV estimates based on comparing the conditional average treatment effect among the always-compliers and that among the switchers under the nested IV framework. We apply the proposed framework and method to the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial and study the causal effect of colorectal cancer screening and its generalizability.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Spatially Clustered Compositional Regression: Linking intersectoral GDP contributions to Gini Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gini coefficient is an universally used measurement of income inequality. Intersectoral GDP contributions reveal the economic development of different sectors of the national economy. Linking intersectoral GDP contributions to Gini coefficients will provide better understandings of how the Gini coefficient is influenced by different industries. In this paper, a compositional regression with spatially clustered coefficients is proposed to explore heterogeneous effects over spatial locations under nonparametric Bayesian framework. Specifically, a Markov random field constraint mixture of finite mixtures prior is designed for Bayesian log contrast regression with compostional covariates, which allows for both spatially contiguous clusters and discontinous clusters. In addition, an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for posterior sampling that enables simultaneous inference on both cluster configurations and cluster-wise parameters is designed. The compelling empirical performance of the proposed method is demonstrated via extensive simulation studies and an application to 51 states of United States from 2019 Bureau of Economic Analysis.</description>

      <title>On Joint Marginal Expected Shortfall and Associated Contribution Risk Measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Systemic risk is the risk that a company- or industry-level risk could trigger a huge collapse of another or even the whole institution. Various systemic risk measures have been proposed in the literature to quantify the domino and (relative) spillover effects induced by systemic risks such as the well-known CoVaR, CoES, MES and CoD risk measures, and associated contribution measures. This paper proposes another new type of systemic risk measure, called the joint marginal expected shortfall (JMES), to measure whether the MES of one entity's risk-taking adds to another one or the overall risk conditioned on the event that the entity is already in some specified distress level. We further introduce two useful systemic risk contribution measures based on the difference function or relative ratio function of the JMES and the conventional ES, respectively. Some basic properties of these proposed measures are studied such as monotonicity, comonotonic additivity, non-identifiability and non-elicitability. For both risk measures and two different vectors of bivariate risks, we establish sufficient conditions imposed on copula structure, stress levels, and stochastic orders to compare these new measures. We further provide some numerical examples to illustrate our main findings. A real application in analyzing the risk contagion among several stock market indices is implemented to show the performances of our proposed measures compared with other commonly used measures including CoVaR, CoES, MES, and their associated contribution measures.</description>

      <title>Improving prediction models by incorporating external data with weights based on similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In clinical settings, we often face the challenge of building prediction models based on small observational data sets. For example, such a data set might be from a medical center in a multi-center study. Differences between centers might be large, thus requiring specific models based on the data set from the target center. Still, we want to borrow information from the external centers, to deal with small sample sizes. There are approaches that either assign weights to each external data set or each external observation. To incorporate information on differences between data sets and observations, we propose an approach that combines both into weights that can be incorporated into a likelihood for fitting regression models. Specifically, we suggest weights at the data set level that incorporate information on how well the models that provide the observation weights distinguish between data sets. Technically, this takes the form of inverse probability weighting. We explore different scenarios where covariates and outcomes differ among data sets, informing our simulation design for method evaluation. The concept of effective sample size is used for understanding the effectiveness of our subgroup modeling approach. We demonstrate our approach through a clinical application, predicting applied radiotherapy doses for cancer patients. Generally, the proposed approach provides improved prediction performance when external data sets are similar. We thus provide a method for quantifying similarity of external data sets to the target data set and use this similarity to include external observations for improving performance in a target data set prediction modeling task with small data.</description>

      <title>LLM4ED: Large Language Models for Automatic Equation Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Equation discovery is aimed at directly extracting physical laws from data and has emerged as a pivotal research domain. Previous methods based on symbolic mathematics have achieved substantial advancements, but often require the design of implementation of complex algorithms. In this paper, we introduce a new framework that utilizes natural language-based prompts to guide large language models (LLMs) in automatically mining governing equations from data. Specifically, we first utilize the generation capability of LLMs to generate diverse equations in string form, and then evaluate the generated equations based on observations. In the optimization phase, we propose two alternately iterated strategies to optimize generated equations collaboratively. The first strategy is to take LLMs as a black-box optimizer and achieve equation self-improvement based on historical samples and their performance. The second strategy is to instruct LLMs to perform evolutionary operators for global search. Experiments are extensively conducted on both partial differential equations and ordinary differential equations. Results demonstrate that our framework can discover effective equations to reveal the underlying physical laws under various nonlinear dynamic systems. Further comparisons are made with state-of-the-art models, demonstrating good stability and usability. Our framework substantially lowers the barriers to learning and applying equation discovery techniques, demonstrating the application potential of LLMs in the field of knowledge discovery.</description>

Abstract: We propose an active sampling flow, with the use-case of simulating the impact of combined variations on analog circuits. In such a context, given the large number of parameters, it is difficult to fit a surrogate model and to efficiently explore the space of design features.
  By combining a drastic dimension reduction using sensitivity analysis and Bayesian surrogate modeling, we obtain a flexible active sampling flow. On synthetic and real datasets, this flow outperforms the usual Monte-Carlo sampling which often forms the foundation of design space exploration.</description>

      <title>spAbundance: An R package for single-species and multi-species spatially explicit abundance models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerous modeling techniques exist to estimate abundance of plant and wildlife species. These methods seek to estimate abundance while accounting for multiple complexities found in ecological data, such as observational biases, spatial autocorrelation, and species correlations. There is, however, a lack of user-friendly and computationally efficient software to implement the various models, particularly for large data sets. We developed the spAbundance R package for fitting spatially-explicit Bayesian single-species and multi-species hierarchical distance sampling models, N-mixture models, and generalized linear mixed models. The models within the package can account for spatial autocorrelation using Nearest Neighbor Gaussian Processes and accommodate species correlations in multi-species models using a latent factor approach, which enables model fitting for data sets with large numbers of sites and/or species. We provide three vignettes and three case studies that highlight spAbundance functionality. We used spatially-explicit multi-species distance sampling models to estimate density of 16 bird species in Florida, USA, an N-mixture model to estimate Black-throated Blue Warbler (Setophaga caerulescens) abundance in New Hampshire, USA, and a spatial linear mixed model to estimate forest aboveground biomass across the continental USA. spAbundance provides a user-friendly, formula-based interface to fit a variety of univariate and multivariate spatially-explicit abundance models. The package serves as a useful tool for ecologists and conservation practitioners to generate improved inference and predictions on the spatial drivers of populations and communities.</description>

      <title>Calibrating dimension reduction hyperparameters in the presence of noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02946v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of dimension reduction tools is to construct a low-dimensional representation of high-dimensional data. These tools are employed for a variety of reasons such as noise reduction, visualization, and to lower computational costs. However, there is a fundamental issue that is discussed in other modeling problems that is often overlooked in dimension reduction -- overfitting. In the context of other modeling problems, techniques such as feature-selection, cross-validation, and regularization are employed to combat overfitting, but rarely are such precautions taken when applying dimension reduction. Prior applications of the two most popular non-linear dimension reduction methods, t-SNE and UMAP, fail to acknowledge data as a combination of signal and noise when assessing performance. These methods are typically calibrated to capture the entirety of the data, not just the signal. In this paper, we demonstrate the importance of acknowledging noise when calibrating hyperparameters and present a framework that enables users to do so. We use this framework to explore the role hyperparameter calibration plays in overfitting the data when applying t-SNE and UMAP. More specifically, we show previously recommended values for perplexity and n_neighbors are too small and overfit the noise. We also provide a workflow others may use to calibrate hyperparameters in the presence of noise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The time-series data of sea level rise and fall contains crucial information on the variability of sea level patterns. Traditional $k$-means clustering is commonly used for categorizing regional variability of sea level, however, its results are not robust against a number of factors. This study analyzed fourteen datasets of monthly sea level in fourteen shoreline regions of Peninsular Malaysia. We applied a hybridization of clustering technique to analyze data categorization and topological data analysis method to enhance the performance of our clustering analysis. Specifically, our approach utilized the persistent homology and $k$-means/$k$-means++ clustering. The fourteen data sets from fourteen tide gauge stations were categorized in classes based on a prior categorization that was determined by topological information, and the probability of data points that belong to certain groups that is yielded by $k$-means/$k$-means++ clustering. Our results demonstrated that our method significantly improves the performance of traditional clustering techniques.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning in Modern Biostatistics: Constructing Optimal Adaptive Interventions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.02605v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) has acquired a prominent position in health-related sequential decision-making problems, gaining traction as a valuable tool for delivering adaptive interventions (AIs). However, in part due to a poor synergy between the methodological and the applied communities, its real-life application is still limited and its potential is still to be realized. To address this gap, our work provides the first unified technical survey on RL methods, complemented with case studies, for constructing various types of AIs in healthcare. In particular, using the common methodological umbrella of RL, we bridge two seemingly different AI domains, dynamic treatment regimes and just-in-time adaptive interventions in mobile health, highlighting similarities and differences between them and discussing the implications of using RL. Open problems and considerations for future research directions are outlined. Finally, we leverage our experience in designing case studies in both areas to showcase the significant collaborative opportunities between statistical, RL, and healthcare researchers in advancing AIs.</description>

      <title>Fast Bayesian inference for spatial mean-parameterized Conway-Maxwell-Poisson models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.11472v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Count data with complex features arise in many disciplines, including ecology, agriculture, criminology, medicine, and public health. Zero inflation, spatial dependence, and non-equidispersion are common features in count data. There are two classes of models that allow for these features -- he mode-parameterized Conway--Maxwell--Poisson (COMP) distribution and the generalized Poisson model. However both require the use of either constraints on the parameter space or a parameterization that leads to challenges in interpretability. We propose a spatial mean-parameterized COMP model that retains the flexibility of these models while resolving the above issues. We use a Bayesian spatial filtering approach in order to efficiently handle high-dimensional spatial data and we use reversible-jump MCMC to automatically choose the basis vectors for spatial filtering. The COMP distribution poses two additional computational challenges -- an intractable normalizing function in the likelihood and no closed-form expression for the mean. We propose a fast computational approach that addresses these challenges by, respectively, introducing an efficient auxiliary variable algorithm and pre-computing key approximations for fast likelihood evaluation.

Abstract: Within Bayesian nonparametrics, dependent Dirichlet process mixture models provide a highly flexible approach for conducting inference about the conditional density function. However, several formulations of this class make either rather restrictive modelling assumptions or involve intricate algorithms for posterior inference, thus preventing their widespread use. In response to these challenges, we present a flexible, versatile, and computationally tractable model for density regression based on a single-weights dependent Dirichlet process mixture of normal distributions model for univariate continuous responses. We assume an additive structure for the mean of each mixture component and incorporate the effects of continuous covariates through smooth nonlinear functions. The key components of our modelling approach are penalised B-splines and their bivariate tensor product extension. Our proposed method also seamlessly accommodates parametric effects of categorical covariates, linear effects of continuous covariates, interactions between categorical and/or continuous covariates, varying coefficient terms, and random effects, which is why we refer our model as a Dirichlet process mixture of normal structured additive regression models. A noteworthy feature of our method is its efficiency in posterior simulation through Gibbs sampling, as closed-form full conditional distributions for all model parameters are available. Results from a simulation study demonstrate that our approach successfully recovers true conditional densities and other regression functionals in various challenging scenarios. Applications to a toxicology, disease diagnosis, and agricultural study are provided and further underpin the broad applicability of our modelling framework. An R package, DDPstar, implementing the proposed method is publicly available at https://bitbucket.org/mxrodriguez/ddpstar.</description>

      <title>Exploring Convergence in Relation using Association Rules Mining: A Case Study in Collaborative Knowledge Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study delves into the pivotal role played by non-experts in knowledge production on open collaboration platforms, with a particular focus on the intricate process of tag development that culminates in the proposal of new glitch classes. Leveraging the power of Association Rule Mining (ARM), this research endeavors to unravel the underlying dynamics of collaboration among citizen scientists. By meticulously quantifying tag associations and scrutinizing their temporal dynamics, the study provides a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of how non-experts collaborate to generate valuable scientific insights. Furthermore, this investigation extends its purview to examine the phenomenon of ideological convergence within online citizen science knowledge production. To accomplish this, a novel measurement algorithm, based on the Mann-Kendall Trend Test, is introduced. This innovative approach sheds illuminating light on the dynamics of collaborative knowledge production, revealing both the vast opportunities and daunting challenges inherent in leveraging non-expert contributions for scientific research endeavors. Notably, the study uncovers a robust pattern of convergence in ideology, employing both the newly proposed convergence testing method and the traditional approach based on the stationarity of time series data. This groundbreaking discovery holds significant implications for understanding the dynamics of online citizen science communities and underscores the crucial role played by non-experts in shaping the scientific landscape of the digital age. Ultimately, this study contributes significantly to our understanding of online citizen science communities, highlighting their potential to harness collective intelligence for tackling complex scientific tasks and enriching our comprehension of collaborative knowledge production processes in the digital age.</description>
