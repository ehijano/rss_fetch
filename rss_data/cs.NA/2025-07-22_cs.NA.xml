      <title>An inverse moving point source problem in electromagnetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with an inverse moving point source problem in electromagnetics. The aim is to reconstruct the moving orbit from the tangential components of magnetic fields taken at a finite number of observation points. The distance function between each observation point and the moving point source is computed by solving a nonlinear ordinary differential equation with an initial value. This ODE system only involves the measurement data from the tangential trace of the magnetic field at observation points. As a consequence, the dynamical measurement data recorded at four non-coplanar points are sufficient to reconstruct the orbit function. A Lipschitz stability is established for the inverse problem, and numerical experiments are reported to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Numerical examples have shown that the reconstructed error depends linearly on the noise level and that the wave speed is a critical factor affecting the relative error.</description>

      <title>Explicit Runge-Kutta Methods with MQ and IMQ-Radial Basis Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a class of explicit Runge-Kutta methods with multiquadric (MQ) and inverse multiquadric (IMQ) radial basis functions (RBFs) to improve the accuracy of time integration for ordinary differential equations. By introducing RBF-based corrections derived from Taylor series expansions and optimally selecting the shape parameter, the method achieves a one-order increase in accuracy without additional stages. Convergence and stability analyses support the theoretical claims, and numerical experiments in MATLAB confirm the predicted performance.</description>

      <title>Entropy Stable Nodal Discontinuous Galerkin Methods via Quadratic Knapsack Limiting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lin, Chan (High order entropy stable discontinuous Galerkin spectral element methods through subcell limiting, 2024) enforces a cell entropy inequality for nodal discontinuous Galerkin methods by combining flux corrected transport (FCT)-type limiting and a knapsack solver, which determines optimal limiting coefficients that result in a semi-discrete cell entropy inequality while preserving nodal bounds. In this work, we provide a slight modification of this approach, where we utilize a quadratic knapsack problem instead of a standard linear knapsack problem. We prove that this quadratic knapsack problem can be reduced to efficient scalar root-finding. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed quadratic knapsack limiting strategy is efficient and results in a semi-discretization with improved regularity in time compared with linear knapsack limiting, while resulting in fewer adaptive timesteps in shock-type problems.</description>

      <title>Numerical Artifacts in Learning Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many applications, one needs to learn a dynamical system from its solutions sampled at a finite number of time points. The learning problem is often formulated
  as an optimization problem over a chosen function class. However, in the optimization procedure, it is necessary to employ a numerical scheme to integrate candidate dynamical systems and assess how their solutions fit the data.
  This paper reveals potentially serious effects of a chosen numerical scheme on the learning outcome. In particular, our analysis demonstrates that a damped oscillatory system may be incorrectly identified as having "anti-damping" and exhibiting a reversed oscillation direction, despite adequately fitting the given data points.</description>

      <title>Mathematical modeling and simulation of two-phase magnetohydrodynamic flows at low magnetic Reynolds numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel mathematical framework for simulating the two-phase incompressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) problems. Focusing on low magnetic Reynolds number regimes, where induced magnetic fields are negligible compared to applied fields, an intrinsic sharp-interface system is first formulated. Subsequently, we utilize the phase-field approach to characterize the interface and derive a thermodynamically consistent phase-field model through the Onsager's variational principle. The resulting system couples the Abels--Garcke--Gr\"un (AGG) model of two-phase flows with a quasi-static formulation modeling the electromagnetic phenomena. Theoretically, the sharp-interface limit is investigated via asymptotic arguments, deducing that the sharp-interface system can be recovered in the limit of vanishing interface thickness. Consequently, this justifies the reliability of the phase-field approach as an approximated method. In addition, we present some three-dimensional numerical experiments of magnetic damping effects on bubble dynamics, where the observed results demonstrate the validity of the proposed framework in capturing complex MHD phenomena.</description>

      <title>On the vector potential formulation with an energy-based hysteresis model and its numerical solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate modelling and simulation of electric devices involving ferromagnetic materials requires the appropriate consideration of magnetic hysteresis. We discuss the systematic incorporation of the energy-based vector hysteresis model of Henrotte et al. into vector potential formulations for the governing magnetic field equations. The field model describing a single step in a load cycle is phrased as a convex minimization problem which allows us to establish existence and uniqueness of solutions and to obtain accurate approximations by finite element discretization. Consistency of the model with the governing field equations is deduced from the first order optimality conditions. In addition, two globally convergent iterative methods are presented for the solution of the underlying minimization problems. The efficiency of the approach is illustrated by numerical tests for a typical benchmark problem.</description>

      <title>On the convergence analysis of MsFEM with oversampling: Interpolation error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the approximation properties of two types of multiscale finite element methods with oversampling as proposed in [Hou \&amp; Wu, {\textit{J. Comput. Phys.}}, 1997] and [Efendiev, Hou \&amp; Wu, \textit{SIAM J. Numer. Anal.}, 2000] without scale separation. We develop a general interpolation error analysis for elliptic problems with highly oscillatory rough coefficients, under the assumption of the existence of a macroscopic problem with suitable $L^2$-accuracy. The distinct features of the analysis, in the setting of highly oscillatory periodic coefficients, include: (i) The analysis is independent of the first-order corrector or the solutions to the cell problems, and thus independent of their regularity properties; (ii) The analysis only involves the homogenized solution and its minimal regularity. We derive an interpolation error $\mathcal{O}\left(H+\frac{\epsilon}{H}\right)$ with $\epsilon$ and $H$ being the period size and the coarse mesh size, respectively, when the oversampling domain includes one layer of elements from the target coarse element.</description>

      <title>1/2 order convergence rate of Euler-type methods for time-changed stochastic differential equations with super-linearly growing drift and diffusion coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the convergence rates of two Euler-type methods for a class of time-changed stochastic differential equations with super-linearly growing drift and diffusion coefficients. Building upon existing research, we adapt the backward Euler method to time-changed stochastic differential equations where both coefficients exhibit super-linear growth and introduce an explicit counterpart, the projected Euler method. It is shown that both methods achieve the optimal strong convergence rate of order 1/2 in the mean-square sense for this class of equations. Numerical simulations confirm the theoretical findings</description>

      <title>Spectral Analysis of Node- and Cell-Centered Higher-Order Compact Schemes for Fully Discrete One and Two-Dimensional Convection-Dispersion Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we present a comprehensive global spectral analysis of the convection dispersion equation, which is also referred to in specific contexts as the Korteweg de Vries (KdV) equation, to investigate the behaviour of high order numerical schemes across a wide range of nondimensional parameters. The motivation for this analysis stems from the equation's importance in modeling wave propagation and transport phenomena, where accurate resolution of dispersive effects is critical, and traditional numerical schemes often suffer from spurious artifacts. We analyze one sixth order and two eighth order compact spatial discretization schemes, encompassing both node centered and cell centered formulations, combined with a third order strong stability preserving Runge Kutta (SSPRK3) time integrator. The analysis is performed in terms of key nondimensional parameters such as the wavenumber, Courant Friedrichs Lewy number $N_c$, and dispersion number $D_{\alpha}$ over the full spectral plane for both one and two dimensional cases. Key numerical indicators, including the amplification factor, normalized phase speed, and normalized group velocity, are evaluated to characterize stability, dispersion error, errors in energy transport, and directional anisotropy. Critical dispersion thresholds and Courant numbers are identified, beyond which numerical instability and nonphysical phenomena such as spurious q waves and reversed phase or energy transport arise. Theoretical predictions are validated through numerical experiments involving linear and nonlinear one and two dimensional test problems, including cases with exact solutions and established benchmark results. This comprehensive analysis uncovers subtle numerical errors and offers practical guidance for selecting reliable discretization parameters, ensuring accurate and stable simulations of convection dispersion systems.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamically Consistent Modeling and Stable ALE Approximations of Reactive Semi-Permeable Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reactive, semi-permeable interfaces play important roles in key biological processes such as targeted drug delivery, lipid metabolism, and signal transduction. These systems involve coupled surface reactions, transmembrane transport, and interfacial deformation, often triggered by local biochemical signals. The strong mechanochemical couplings complicate the modeling of such interfacial dynamics. We propose a thermodynamically consistent continuum framework that integrates bulk fluid motion, interfacial dynamics, surface chemistry, and selective solute exchange, derived via an energy variation approach to ensure mass conservation and energy dissipation. To efficiently solve the resulting coupled system, we develop a finite element scheme within an Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) framework, incorporating the Barrett-Garcke-Nurnberg (BGN) strategy to maintain mesh regularity and preserve conservation laws. Numerical experiments verify the convergence and conservation properties of the scheme and demonstrate its ability in capturing complex interfacial dynamics. Two biologically inspired examples showcase the model's versatility: cholesterol efflux via the ABCG1 pathway, involving multistage interfacial reactions and HDL uptake; and a self-propelled droplet system with reaction-activated permeability, mimicking drug release in pathological environments. This work provides a unified computational platform for studying strongly coupled biochemical and mechanical interactions at interfaces, offering new insights into reactive transport processes in both biological and industrial contexts.</description>

      <title>An adaptive symplectic integrator for gravitational dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an adaptive symplectic integrator, SQQ-PTQ, developed on the basis of the fixed-step symplectic integrator SQQ. To mitigate the Runge phenomenon, SQQ-PTQ employs Chebyshev interpolation for approximating the action, enhancing both the precision and stability of the interpolation. In addition, to reduce the computational cost of evaluating interpolation functions, SQQ-PTQ introduces a projection method that improves the efficiency of these computations. A key feature of SQQ-PTQ is its use of the time transformation to implement an adaptive time step. To address the challenge of computing complicated Jacobian matrices attributed to the time transformation, SQQ-PTQ adopts a quasi-Newton method based on Broyden's method. This strategy accelerates the solution of nonlinear equations, thereby improving the overall computational performance. The effectiveness and robustness of SQQ-PTQ are demonstrated via three numerical experiments. In particular, SQQ-PTQ demonstrates adaptability in handling close-encounter problems. Moreover, during long-term integrations, SQQ-PTQ maintains the energy conservation, further confirming its advantages as a symplectic algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov (Fisher-KPP) equation is a classical reaction-diffusion equation with broad applications such as biology, chemistry and physics. In this paper, an alternative second-order scheme is proposed by employing a shifted BDF2 method to approximate the two-dimensional (modified) Fisher-KPP equation. We both consider an uniform and a nonuniform time steps of such the scheme. The stability of the uniform discretization scheme is proved. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our uniform and non-uniform schemes are robust and accurate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that quadrature formulas in many different applications can be derived from rational approximation of the Cauchy transform of a weight function. Since rational approximation is now a routine technology, this provides an easy new method to derive all kinds of quadrature formulas as well as fundamental insight into the mathematics of quadrature. Intervals or curves of quadrature nodes correspond to near-optimal branch cuts of the Cauchy transform.</description>

      <title>$\textit{A Priori}$ Error Analysis for the $p$-Stokes Equations with Slip Boundary Conditions: A Discrete Leray Projection Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an $\textit{a priori}$ error analysis for the kinematic pressure in a fully-discrete finite-differences/-elements discretization of the unsteady $p$-Stokes equations, modelling non-Newtonian fluids. This system is subject to both impermeability and perfect Navier slip boundary conditions, which are incorporated either weakly via Lagrange multipliers or strongly in the discrete velocity space. A central aspect of the $\textit{a priori}$ error analysis is the discrete Leray projection, constructed to quantitatively approximate its continuous counterpart. The discrete Leray projection enables a Helmholtz-type decomposition at the discrete level and plays a key role in deriving error decay rates for the kinematic pressure. We derive (in some cases optimal) error decay rates for both the velocity vector field and kinematic pressure, with the error for the kinematic pressure measured in an $\textit{ad hoc}$ norm informed by the projection framework. The $\textit{a priori}$ error analysis remains robust even under reduced regularity of the velocity vector field and the kinematic pressure, and illustrates how the interplay of boundary conditions and projection stability governs the accuracy of pressure approximations.</description>

      <title>Analysis of fully discrete Crank-Nicolson finite element methods for a stochastic Keller-Segel chemotaxis system with gradient-type multiplicative noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop and analyze numerical methods for a stochastic Keller-Segel system perturbed by Stratonovich noise, which models chemotactic behavior under randomly fluctuating environmental conditions. The proposed fully discrete scheme couples a Crank-Nicolson time discretization with a splitting mixed finite element method in space. We rigorously prove the stability of the numerical scheme and establish strong convergence rates of order $O(k^{1/2} + k^{-1/2}h^2)$, where $k$ and $h$ denote the time and spatial step sizes, respectively. Notably, the presence of stochastic forcing leads to an inverse dependence on $k$ in the error estimates, distinguishing the convergence behavior from that of the deterministic case. Numerical experiments are presented to validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Extending Data to Improve Stability and Error Estimates Using Asymmetric Kansa-like Methods to Solve PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a theoretical framework is presented
  for the use of a Kansa-like method to numerically solve elliptic
  partial differential equations on spheres and other manifolds. The
  theory addresses both the stability of the method and provides error
  estimates for two different approximation methods. A Kansa-like
  matrix is obtained by replacing the test point set $X$, used in the
  traditional Kansa method, by a larger set $Y$, which is a norming
  set for the underlying trial space. This gives rise to a rectangular
  matrix. In addition, if a basis of Lagrange (or local Lagrange)
  functions is used for the trial space, then it is shown
  that the stability of the matrix is comparable to the stability of
  the elliptic operator acting on the trial space. Finally, two
  different types of error estimates are given. Discrete least squares
  estimates of very high accuracy are obtained for solutions that are
  sufficiently smooth. The second method, giving similar error
  estimates, uses a rank revealing factorization to create a
  ``thinning algorithm'' that reduces $\#Y$ to $\#X$. In practice,
  this algorithm doesn't need $Y$ to be a norming set.</description>

      <title>On Subsample Size of Quantile-Based Randomized Kaczmarz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantile-based randomized Kaczmarz (QRK) was recently introduced to efficiently solve sparsely corrupted linear systems $\mathbf{A} \mathbf{x}^*+\mathbf{\epsilon} = \mathbf{b}$ [SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl., 43(2), 605-637], where $\mathbf{A}\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ and $\mathbf{\epsilon}$ is an arbitrary $(\beta m)$-sparse corruption. However, all existing theoretical guarantees for QRK require quantiles to be computed using all $m$ samples (or a subsample of the same order), thus negating the computational advantage of Kaczmarz-type methods. This paper overcomes the bottleneck. We analyze a subsampling QRK, which computes quantiles from $D$ uniformly chosen samples at each iteration. Under some standard scaling assumptions on the coefficient matrix, we show that QRK with subsample size $D\ge\frac{C\log (T)}{\log(1/\beta)}$ linearly converges over the first $T$ iterations with high probability, where $C$ is some absolute constant. This subsample size is a substantial reduction from $O(m)$ in prior results. For instance, it translates into $O(\log(n))$ even if an approximation error of $\exp(-n^2)$ is desired. Intriguingly, our subsample size is also tight up to a multiplicative constant: if $D\le \frac{c\log(T)}{\log(1/\beta)}$ for some constant $c$, the error of the $T$-th iterate could be arbitrarily large with high probability. Numerical results are provided to corroborate our theory.</description>

      <title>On the stability of the low-rank projector-splitting integrator for hyperbolic and parabolic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stability of a class of dynamical low-rank methods--the projector-splitting integrator (PSI)--applied to linear hyperbolic and parabolic equations. Using a von Neumann-type analysis, we investigate the stability of such low-rank time integrator coupled with standard spatial discretizations, including upwind and central finite difference schemes, under two commonly used formulations: discretize-then-project (DtP) and project-then-discretize (PtD). For hyperbolic equations, we show that the stability conditions for DtP and PtD are the same under Lie-Trotter splitting, and that the stability region can be significantly enlarged by using Strang splitting. For parabolic equations, despite the presence of a negative S-step, unconditional stability can still be achieved by employing Crank-Nicolson or a hybrid forward-backward Euler scheme in time stepping. While our analysis focuses on simplified model problems, it offers insight into the stability behavior of PSI for more complex systems, such as those arising in kinetic theory.</description>

      <title>Efficient evaluation of forward and inverse energy-based magnetic hysteresis operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy-based vector hysteresis model of Francois-Lavet et al. establishes an implicit relation between magnetic fields and fluxes via internal magnetic polarizations which are determined by convex but non-smooth minimization problems. The systematic solution of these problems for every material point is a key ingredient for the efficient implementation of the model into standard magnetic field solvers. We propose to approximate the non-smooth terms via regularization which allows to employ standard Newton methods for the evaluation of the local material models while being in control of the error in this approximation. We further derive the inverse of the regularized hysteresis operator which amounts to a regularized version of the inverse hysteresis model. The magnetic polarizations in this model are again determined by local minimization problems which here are coupled across the different pinning forces. An efficient algorithm for solving the Newton systems is proposed which allows evaluation of the inverse hysteresis operator at the same cost as the forward model. Numerical tests on standard benchmark problems are presented for illustration of our results.</description>

      <title>Convergence analysis of Anderson acceleration for nonlinear equations with H\"older continuous derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the local convergence behavior of Anderson acceleration in solving nonlinear systems. We establish local R-linear convergence results for Anderson acceleration with general depth $m$ under the assumptions that the Jacobian of the nonlinear operator is H\"older continuous and the corresponding fixed-point function is contractive. In the Lipschitz continuous case, we obtain a sharper R-linear convergence factor. We also derive a refined residual bound for the depth $m = 1$ under the same assumptions used for the general depth results. Applications to a nonsymmetric Riccati equation from transport theory demonstrate that Anderson acceleration yields comparable results to several existing fixed-point methods for the regular cases, and that it brings significant reductions in both the number of iterations and computation time, even in challenging cases involving nearly singular or large-scale problems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15345v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a numerical analysis of the Field-Noyes reaction-diffusion model with nonsmooth initial data, employing a linear Galerkin finite element method for spatial discretization and a second-order exponential Runge-Kutta scheme for temporal integration. The initial data are assumed to reside in the fractional Sobolev space H^gamma with 0 &lt; gamma &lt; 2, where classical regularity conditions are violated, necessitating specialized error analysis. By integrating semigroup techniques and fractional Sobolev space theory, sharp fully discrete error estimates are derived in both L2 and H1 norms. This demonstrates that the convergence order adapts to the smoothness of initial data, a key advancement over traditional approaches that assume higher regularity. Numerical examples are provided to support the theoretical analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hermite spectral method plays an important role in the numerical simulation of various partial differential equations (PDEs) on unbounded domains. In this work, we study the superconvergence properties of Hermite spectral interpolation, i.e., interpolation at the zeros of Hermite polynomials in the space spanned by Hermite functions. We identify the points at which the convergence rates of the first- and second-order derivatives of the interpolant converge faster. We further extend the analysis to the Hermite spectral collocation method in solving differential equations and identify the superconvergence points both for function and derivative values. Numerical examples are provided to confirm the analysis of superconvergence points.</description>

      <title>PDEformer-2: A Versatile Foundation Model for Two-Dimensional Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) play a central role in describing many physical phenomena. Various scientific and engineering applications demand a versatile and differentiable PDE solver that can quickly generate solutions with adequate accuracy, and limitations of the traditional solvers and specialized neural operators motivate the development of foundation models for solving PDEs. This paper introduces PDEformer-2, a versatile foundation model for two-dimensional PDEs. Based on our previous one-dimensional PDEformer-1 model, PDEformer-2 receives the PDE form as network input via computational graph representation, which has the flexibility to encode most common PDEs. The mesh-free predicted solutions can be directly queried at arbitrary spatio-temporal coordinates. A large (40TB) diverse dataset is employed to pretrain the current model, making it capable of simultaneously addressing PDEs with different symbolic forms, domain shapes, boundary conditions, number of variables, and time-dependency. Accurate zero-shot prediction is allowed for PDEs that resemble the pretraining ones. When adapted to new unseen PDEs, PDEformer-2 demonstrates faster learning than many specialized models, and has smaller errors given limited (less than 100) samples. Additionally, PDEformer-2 can be employed in the inverse problems thanks to its fast and differentiable nature and produces reasonable results in our experiments to recover coefficient scalars and fields of a PDE.</description>

      <title>Neural Preconditioning via Krylov Subspace Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a geometry-aware strategy for training neural preconditioners tailored to parametrized linear systems arising from the discretization of mixed-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs). These systems are typically ill-conditioned because of the presence of embedded lower-dimensional structures and are solved using Krylov subspace methods. Our approach yields an approximation of the inverse operator employing a learning algorithm consisting of a two-stage training framework: an initial static pre-training phase, based on residual minimization, followed by a dynamic fine-tuning phase that incorporates solver convergence dynamics into training via a novel loss functional. This dynamic loss is defined by the principal angles between the residuals and the Krylov subspaces. It is evaluated using a differentiable implementation of the Flexible GMRES algorithm, which enables backpropagation through both the Arnoldi process and Givens rotations. The resulting neural preconditioner is explicitly optimized to improve early-stage convergence and reduce iteration counts in a family of 3D-1D mixed-dimensional problems with geometric variability of the 1D domain. Numerical experiments show that our solver-aligned approach significantly improves convergence rate, robustness, and generalization.</description>

      <title>Solving nonconvex Hamilton--Jacobi--Isaacs equations with PINN-based policy iteration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a mesh-free policy iteration framework that combines classical dynamic programming with physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to solve high-dimensional, nonconvex Hamilton--Jacobi--Isaacs (HJI) equations arising in stochastic differential games and robust control. The method alternates between solving linear second-order PDEs under fixed feedback policies and updating the controls via pointwise minimax optimization using automatic differentiation. Under standard Lipschitz and uniform ellipticity assumptions, we prove that the value function iterates converge locally uniformly to the unique viscosity solution of the HJI equation. The analysis establishes equi-Lipschitz regularity of the iterates, enabling provable stability and convergence without requiring convexity of the Hamiltonian. Numerical experiments demonstrate the accuracy and scalability of the method. In a two-dimensional stochastic path-planning game with a moving obstacle, our method matches finite-difference benchmarks with relative $L^2$-errors below %10^{-2}%. In five- and ten-dimensional publisher-subscriber differential games with anisotropic noise, the proposed approach consistently outperforms direct PINN solvers, yielding smoother value functions and lower residuals. Our results suggest that integrating PINNs with policy iteration is a practical and theoretically grounded method for solving high-dimensional, nonconvex HJI equations, with potential applications in robotics, finance, and multi-agent reinforcement learning.</description>

      <title>tiDAS: a time invariant approximation of the Delay and Sum algorithm for biomedical ultrasound PSF reconstructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrasound imaging is a real-time diagnostic modality that reconstructs acoustic signals into visual representations of internal body structures. A key component in this process is beamforming, with the Delay and Sum (DAS) algorithm being a standard due to its balance between simplicity and effectiveness. However, the computational cost of DAS can be a limiting factor, especially in real-time scenarios where fast frame reconstruction is essential. In this work, we introduce a time-invariant approximation of the DAS algorithm (tiDAS), designed to accelerate the reconstruction process without compromising image quality. By adopting a one-dimensional, row-wise convolutional formulation, tiDAS significantly reduces computational complexity while preserving the core properties of the original model. This approach not only enables faster image reconstruction but also provides a structured foundation for the application of deconvolution methods aimed at enhancing resolution. Synthetic experiments demonstrate that tiDAS achieves a favorable trade-off between speed and accuracy, making it a promising tool for improving the efficiency of real-time ultrasound imaging.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hypoxia-activated prodrugs offer a promising strategy for targeting oxygen-deficient regions in solid tumors, which are often resistant to conventional therapies. However, modeling their behavior is challenging because of the complex interplay between oxygen availability, drug activation, and cell survival. In this work, we develop a multiscale and mixed-dimensional model that couples spatially resolved drug and oxygen transport with pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics to simulate the cellular response. The model integrates blood flow, oxygen diffusion and consumption, drug delivery, and metabolism. To reduce computational cost, we mitigate the global nonlinearity through a one-way coupling of the multiscale and mixed/dimensional models with a reduced 0D model for the drug metabolism. The global sensitivity analysis is then used to identify key parameters influencing drug activation and therapeutic outcome. This approach enables efficient simulation and supports the design of optimized hypoxia-targeted therapies.</description>

Abstract: We consider optimal interpolation of functions analytic in simply connected domains in the complex plane. By choosing a specific structure for the approximant, we show that the resulting first order optimality conditions can be interpreted as optimal $\mathcal{H}_2$ interpolation conditions for discrete-time dynamical systems. Connections to the implicit Euler method, the midpoint method, and backward differentiation methods are also established. A data-driven algorithm is developed to compute a (locally) optimal approximant. Our method is tested on three numerical experiments.</description>

Abstract: We develop time integration methods in low-rank representation that can adaptively adjust approximation ranks to achieve a prescribed accuracy, while ensuring that these ranks remain proportional to the corresponding best approximation ranks. Our approach relies on an iterative scheme combined with soft thresholding of the iterates. A model case of a time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation with low-rank matrix approximation is analyzed in detail, and the required modifications for second-order parabolic problems are described. Numerical tests illustrate the results for both cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to understand the training solution, which is obtained by the back-propagation algorithm, of two-layer neural networks whose hidden layer is composed of the units with smooth activation functions, including the usual sigmoid type most commonly used before the advent of ReLUs. The mechanism contains four main principles: construction of Taylor series expansions, strict partial order of knots, smooth-spline implementation and smooth-continuity restriction. The universal approximation for arbitrary input dimensionality is proved and experimental verification is given, through which the mystery of ``black box'' of the solution space is largely revealed. The new proofs employed also enrich approximation theory.</description>

      <title>A Recursive Lie-Group Formulation for the Second-Order Time Derivatives of the Inverse Dynamics of parallel Kinematic Manipulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Series elastic actuators (SEA) were introduced for serial robotic arms. Their model-based trajectory tracking control requires the second time derivatives of the inverse dynamics solution, for which algorithms were proposed. Trajectory control of parallel kinematics manipulators (PKM) equipped with SEAs has not yet been pursued. Key element for this is the computationally efficient evaluation of the second time derivative of the inverse dynamics solution. This has not been presented in the literature, and is addressed in the present paper for the first time. The special topology of PKM is exploited reusing the recursive algorithms for evaluating the inverse dynamics of serial robots. A Lie group formulation is used and all relations are derived within this framework. Numerical results are presented for a 6-DOF Gough-Stewart platform (as part of an exoskeleton), and for a planar PKM when a flatness-based control scheme is applied.</description>

Abstract: The reawakened era of lunar exploration is defined by a strategic shift from temporary visits to a sustained international and commercial presence, resulting in an unprecedented demand for a robust and continuously available communication infrastructure. The conventional direct-to-Earth communication architecture relies on limited and oversubscribed deep space networks, which are further challenged by the radiative environment and insufficient visibility in certain areas of the cislunar domain. We address these issues by proposing a foundational move toward inter-domain space network cooperation by introducing architectures based on near space networks. They can directly service lunar surface users or, via cislunar relays, by forming a resilient and multi-layered communication backbone. First, we establish a unified link analysis framework incorporating frequently disregarded environmental factors, such as the Moon's variable illumination, to provide a high-fidelity performance evaluation. Second, we assess architectures' reliability based on the outage risk, essential for quantifying the operational robustness of communication links. Finally, to manage the inherent dynamism of architectures, we propose an inter-domain space digital twin$-$a dynamic decision-making engine that performs real-time analysis to autonomously select the best communication path, ensuring high and stable reliability while simultaneously optimizing power consumption. Overall, our paper provides a holistic architectural and conceptual management framework, emphasizing the necessity of lunar communications to support a permanent human and economic foothold on the Moon.</description>

      <title>Sensor network localization has a benign landscape after low-dimensional relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the sensor network localization problem, also known as multidimensional scaling or Euclidean distance matrix completion. Given a ground truth configuration of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^\ell$, we observe a subset of the pairwise distances and aim to recover the underlying configuration (up to rigid transformations). We show with a simple counterexample that the associated optimization problem is nonconvex and may admit spurious local minimizers, even when all distances are known. Yet, inspired by numerical experiments, we argue that all second-order critical points become global minimizers when the problem is relaxed by optimizing over configurations in dimension $k &gt; \ell$. Specifically, we show this for two settings, both when all pairwise distances are known: (1) for arbitrary ground truth points, and $k= O(\sqrt{\ell n})$, and: (2) for isotropic random ground truth points, and $k = O(\ell + \log n)$. To prove these results, we identify and exploit key properties of the linear map which sends inner products to squared distances.</description>

      <title>Minimal horizontal triods: Analysis and computation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we investigate the question of finding a network configuration of minimal length connecting three given points in the Heisenberg group. After proving existence of (possibly degenerate) minimal horizontal triods, we investigate their characterization. We then formulate a horizontal curve shortening flow that deforms any given suitable initial triod into a critical point for the length functional. Numerical experiments based on a stable fully discrete finite element scheme provide useful insights into the rich landscape of this sub-Riemannian geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we consider generic coalescing of eigenvalues of smooth complex valued matrix functions depending on 2 parameters. We call generic cuspidal points the parameter values where eigenvalues coalesce and we discuss the relation between cuspidal points and the closely related exceptional points studied in the literature. By considering loops in parameter space enclosing the cuspidal points, we rigorously prove when there is a phase accumulation for the eigenvectors and further detail how, by looking at the periodicity of the eigenvalues along the loop, and/or by looking at the aforementioned phase accumulation, one may be able to localize generic cuspidal points.</description>

      <title>Identifying Solution Constraints for ODE Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work develops a framework to discover relations between the components of the solution to a given initial-value problem for a first-order system of ordinary differential equations. This is done by using sparse identification techniques on the data represented by the numerical solution of the initial-value problem at hand. The only assumption is that there are only a few terms that connects the components, so that the mathematical relations to be discovered are sparse in the set of possible functions. We illustrate the method through examples of applications.</description>

      <title>Polynomial argmin for recovery and approximation of multivariate discontinuous functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.06945v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose to approximate a (possibly discontinuous) multivariate function f (x) on a compact set by the partial minimizer arg miny p(x, y) of an appropriate polynomial p whose construction can be cast in a univariate sum of squares (SOS) framework, resulting in a highly structured convex semidefinite program. In a number of non-trivial cases (e.g. when f is a piecewise polynomial) we prove that the approximation is exact with a low-degree polynomial p. Our approach has three distinguishing features: (i) It is mesh-free and does not require the knowledge of the discontinuity locations. (ii) It is model-free in the sense that we only assume that the function to be approximated is available through samples (point evaluations). (iii) The size of the semidefinite program is independent of the ambient dimension and depends linearly on the number of samples. We also analyze the sample complexity of the approach, proving a generalization error bound in a probabilistic setting. This allows for a comparison with machine learning approaches.</description>

      <title>An A Posteriori Error Estimator for Electrically Coupled Liquid Crystal Equilibrium Configurations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.02062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper derives an a posteriori error estimator for the nonlinear first-order optimality conditions associated with the electrically and flexoelectrically coupled Frank-Oseen model of liquid crystals, building on previous results for elastic systems. The estimator is proposed for a penalty approach to imposing the unit-length constraint required by the model. Moreover, theory is proven establishing that the estimator provides a reliable estimate of global approximation error and an efficient measure of local error, suitable for use in adaptive refinement. Numerical experiments demonstrate significant improvements in efficiency with adaptive refinement guided by the proposed estimator in a multilevel, nested-iteration framework and superior physical properties for challenging electrically coupled systems.</description>

      <title>Improved parameter selection strategy for the iterated Arnoldi-Tikhonov method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The iterated Arnoldi-Tikhonov (iAT) method is a regularization technique particularly suited for solving large-scale ill-posed linear inverse problems. Indeed, it reduces the computational complexity through the projection of the discretized problem into a lower-dimensional Krylov subspace, where the problem is then solved.
  This paper studies iAT under an additional hypothesis on the discretized operator. It presents a theoretical analysis of the approximation errors, leading to an a posteriori rule for choosing the regularization parameter. Our proposed rule results in more accurate computed approximate solutions compared to the a posteriori rule recently proposed in arXiv:2311.11823. The numerical results confirm the theoretical analysis, providing accurate computed solutions even when the new assumption is not satisfied.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19707v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This research introduces an extended application of neural networks for solving nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). A neural network, combined with a pseudo-arclength continuation, is proposed to construct bifurcation diagrams from parameterized nonlinear PDEs. Additionally, a neural network approach is also presented for solving eigenvalue problems to analyze solution linear stability, focusing on identifying the largest eigenvalue. The effectiveness of the proposed neural network is examined through experiments on the Bratu equation and the Burgers equation. Results from a finite difference method are also presented as comparison. Varying numbers of grid points are employed in each case to assess the behavior and accuracy of both the neural network and the finite difference method. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed neural network produces better solutions, generates more accurate bifurcation diagrams, has reasonable computational times, and proves effective for linear stability analysis.</description>

      <title>Robust Augmented Mixed Finite Element Methods for Stoke Interface Problems with Discontinuous Viscosity in Multiple Subdomains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A stationary Stokes problem with a piecewise constant viscosity coefficient in multiple subdomains is considered in the paper. For standard finite element pairs, a robust inf-sup condition is required to show the robustness of the discretization error with respect to the discontinuous viscosity, which has only been proven for the two-subdomain case in the paper [Numer. Math. (2006) 103: 129--149]. To avoid the robust inf-sup condition of a discrete finite element pair for multiple subdomains, we propose an ultra-weak augmented mixed finite element formulation. By adopting a Galerkin-least-squares method, the augmented mixed formulation can achieve stability without relying on the inf-sup condition in both continuous and discrete settings. The key step to having a robust priori error estimate is to use two norms, one energy norm and one full norm, in robust continuity. The robust coercivity is proved for the energy norm. A robust a priori error estimate in the energy norm is then derived with the best approximation property in the full norm for the case of multiple subdomains. Additionally, the paper introduces a singular Kellogg-type example with exact solutions for the first time. Extensive numerical tests are conducted to validate the robust error estimate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The outer inverse of tensors plays increasingly significant roles in computational mathematics, numerical analysis, and other generalized inverses of tensors. In this paper, we compute outer inverses with prescribed ranges and kernels of a given tensor through tensor QR decomposition and hyperpower iterative method under the M-product structure, which is a family of tensor-tensor products, generalization of the t-product and c-product, allows us to suit the physical interpretations across those different modes. We discuss a theoretical analysis of the nineteen-order convergence of the proposed tensor-based iterative method. Further, we design effective tensor-based algorithms for computing outer inverses using M-QR decomposition and hyperpower iterative method. The theoretical results are validated with numerical examples demonstrating the appropriateness of the proposed methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a numerical investigation of acoustic wave propagation in an obstacle with periodically time-modulated material parameters. We focus on the numerical construction of Floquet$-$Bloch solutions, which are quasi-periodic kernel elements of the hyperbolic operator appearing on the left-hand side of the acoustic wave equation. Using the temporal Fourier expansion yields a system of coupled harmonics, which can be truncated. Rewriting this system then provides different (generally nonlinear) eigenvalue formulations for discretized Floquet$-$Bloch solutions. Deriving energy estimates and the necessary conditions for Riesz$-$Schauder theory show basic properties of the occurring Floquet exponents. To derive fully discrete schemes, we employ a general Galerkin space discretization. Under assumptions on the relation of the temporal Fourier truncation and the Galerkin space discretization, we prove that the approximated Floquet exponents exhibit the same limitations as their continuous counterparts. Moreover, the approximated modes are shown to satisfy the defining properties of Floquet$-$Bloch solutions, with a defect that tends to zero as the number of harmonics approaches infinity. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and illustrate the theoretical findings.</description>

Abstract: We consider the Stokes-Darcy coupled problem, which models the interaction between free-flow and porous medium flow. By enforcing the normal flux continuity interface condition directly within the finite-element spaces, we establish unified well-posedness results for the coupled system under various boundary condition scenarios. Using the operator preconditioning framework, we develop a parameter-robust preconditioner that avoids the use of fractional operators. Numerical experiments employing both $H(\operatorname{div})$-conforming and nonconforming finite-element methods are presented to confirm the theoretical findings and demonstrate the robustness of the proposed block preconditioners with respect to the physical parameters and mesh size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents an aposteriori error analysis of adaptive finite element approximations of parabolic boundary control problems with bilateral box constraints that act on a Neumann boundary. The control problem is discretized using the symmetric interior penalty Galerkin (SIPG) technique. We derive both reliable and efficient type residual-based error estimators coupling with the data oscillations. The implementation of these error estimators serves as a guide for the adaptive mesh refinement process, indicating whether or not more refinement is required. Although the control error estimator effectively captured control approximation errors, it had limitations in guiding refinement localization in critical cases. To overcome this, an alternative control indicator was used in numerical tests. The results demonstrated the clear superiority of adaptive refinements over uniform refinements, confirming the proposed approach's effectiveness in achieving accurate solutions while optimizing computational efficiency. numerical experiment showcases the effectiveness of the derived error estimators.</description>

      <title>Compact implicit high resolution numerical method for solving transport problems with sorption isotherms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates numerical methods to solve nonlinear transport problems characterized by various sorption isotherms with a focus on the Freundlich type of isotherms. We describe and compare second order accurate numerical schemes, focusing on implicit methods, to effectively model transport phenomena without stability restriction on the choice of time steps. Furthermore, a high resolution form of the method is proposed that limits a priori the second order accurate scheme towards first order accuracy to keep the values of numerical solutions in a physically acceptable range. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of high resolution methods in minimizing oscillations near discontinuities, thereby enhancing solution plausibility. The observed convergence rates confirm that the second order accurate schemes achieve expected accuracy for smooth solutions and that they yield significant improvements when compared with the results of the first order scheme. As the computational cost of the compact implicit method seems to be comparable to similar explicit ones with a clear profit of unconditional stability, this research provides a practical tool toward numerical simulations of nonlinear transport phenomena applicable in various fields such as contaminant transport in porous media or column liquid chromatography.</description>

Abstract: We present a numerical analysis of a higher order unfitted space-time Finite Element method applied to a convection-diffusion model problem posed on a moving bulk domain. The method uses isoparametric space-time mappings for the geometry approximation of level set domains and has been presented and investigated computationally in [Heimann, Lehrenfeld, Preu{\ss}, SIAM J. Sci. Comp. 45(2), 2023, B139 - B165]. Recently, in [Heimann, Lehrenfeld, IMA J. Numer. Anal., 2025] error bounds for the geometry approximation have been proven. In this paper we prove stability and accuracy including the influence of the geometry approximation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a numerical method for the approximation of the inverse of the fractional Laplacian $(-\Delta)^{s}$, based on its spectral definition, using rational functions to approximate the fractional power $A^{-s}$ of a matrix $A$, for $0&lt;s&lt;1$. The proposed numerical method is fast and accurate, benefiting from the fact that the matrix $A$ arises from a finite element approximation of the Laplacian $-\Delta$, which makes it applicable to a wide range of domains with potentially irregular shapes. We make use of state-of-the-art software to compute the best rational approximation of a fractional power. We analyze the convergence rate of our method and validate our findings through a series of numerical experiments with a range of exponents $s \in (0,1)$. Additionally, we apply the proposed numerical method to different evolution problems that involve the fractional Laplacian through an interaction potential: the fractional porous medium equation and the fractional Keller-Segel equation. We then investigate the accuracy of the resulting numerical method, focusing in particular on the accurate reproduction of qualitative properties of the associated analytical solutions to these partial differential equations.</description>

      <title>Learning-Enhanced Variational Regularization for Electrical Impedance Tomography via Calder\'on's Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper aims to numerically solve the two-dimensional electrical impedance tomography (EIT) with Cauchy data. This inverse problem is highly challenging due to its severe ill-posed nature and strong nonlinearity, which necessitates appropriate regularization strategies. Choosing a regularization approach that effectively incorporates the \textit{a priori} information of the conductivity distribution (or its contrast) is therefore essential. In this work, we propose a deep learning-based method to capture the \textit{a priori} information about the shape and location of the unknown contrast using Calder\'on's method. The learned \textit{a priori} information is then used to construct the regularization functional of the variational regularization method for solving the inverse problem. The resulting regularized variational problem for EIT reconstruction is then solved using the Gauss-Newton method. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed inversion algorithm achieves accurate reconstruction results, even in high-contrast cases, and exhibits strong generalization capabilities. Additionally, some stability and convergence analysis of the variational regularization method underscores the importance of incorporating \textit{a priori} information about the support of the unknown contrast.</description>

      <title>Refinement of the theory and convergence of the Sinc convolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Sinc convolution is an approximate formula for indefinite convolutions proposed by Stenger. The formula was derived based on the Sinc indefinite integration formula combined with the single-exponential transformation. Although its efficiency has been confirmed in various fields, several theoretical issues remain unresolved. The first contribution of this study is to resolve those issues by refining the underlying theory of the Sinc convolution. This contribution includes an essential resolution of Stenger's conjecture. The second contribution of this study is to improve the convergence rate by replacing the single-exponential transformation with the double-exponential transformation. Theoretical analysis and numerical experiments confirm that the modified formula achieves superior convergence compared to Stenger's original formula.</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework for Efficient Kernel and Polynomial Interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12629v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a unified interpolation scheme that combines compactly-supported positive-definite kernels and multivariate polynomials. This unified framework generalizes interpolation with compactly-supported kernels and also classical polynomial least squares approximation. To facilitate the efficient use of this unified interpolation scheme, we present specialized numerical linear algebra procedures that leverage standard matrix factorizations. These procedures allow for efficient computation and storage of the unified interpolant. We also present a modification to the numerical linear algebra that allows us to generalize the application of the unified framework to target functions on manifolds with and without boundary. Our numerical experiments on both Euclidean domains and manifolds indicate that the unified interpolant is superior to polynomial least squares for the interpolation of target functions in settings with boundaries.</description>

      <title>A Structure-Guided Gauss-Newton Method for Shallow ReLU Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a structure-guided Gauss-Newton (SgGN) method for solving least squares problems using a shallow ReLU neural network. The method effectively takes advantage of both the least squares structure and the neural network structure of the objective function. By categorizing the weights and biases of the hidden and output layers of the network as nonlinear and linear parameters, respectively, the method iterates back and forth between the nonlinear and linear parameters. The nonlinear parameters are updated by a damped Gauss-Newton method and the linear ones are updated by a linear solver. Moreover, at the Gauss-Newton step, a special form of the Gauss-Newton matrix is derived for the shallow ReLU neural network and is used for efficient iterations. It is shown that the corresponding mass and Gauss-Newton matrices in the respective linear and nonlinear steps are symmetric and positive definite under reasonable assumptions. Thus, the SgGN method naturally produces an effective search direction without the need of additional techniques like shifting in the Levenberg-Marquardt method to achieve invertibility of the Gauss-Newton matrix. The convergence and accuracy of the method are demonstrated numerically for several challenging function approximation problems, especially those with discontinuities or sharp transition layers that pose significant challenges for commonly used training algorithms in machine learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14816v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equation with a potential, also known as Gross-Pitaevskii equation. By introducing a suitable spectral localization, we prove low regularity error estimates for the time discretization corresponding to an adapted Lie-Trotter splitting scheme. The proof is based on tools from spectral theory and pseudodifferential calculus in order to obtain various estimates on the spectral localization, including discrete Strichartz estimates which support the nonlinear analysis.</description>

      <title>Differential estimates for fast first-order multilevel nonconvex optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With a view on bilevel and PDE-constrained optimisation, we develop iterative estimates $\widetilde{F'}(x^k)$ of $F'(x^k)$ for composite functions $F :=J \circ S$, where $S$ is the solution mapping of the inner optimisation problem or PDE. The idea is to form a single-loop method by interweaving updates of the iterate $x^k$ by an outer optimisation method, with updates of the estimate by single steps of standard optimisation methods and linear system solvers. When the inner methods satisfy simple tracking inequalities, the differential estimates can almost directly be employed in standard convergence proofs for general forward-backward type methods. We adapt those proofs to a general inexact setting in normed spaces, that, besides our differential estimates, also covers mismatched adjoints and unreachable optimality conditions in measure spaces. As a side product of these efforts, we provide improved convergence results for nonconvex Primal-Dual Proximal Splitting (PDPS).</description>

      <title>Spectral Properties of Positive Definite Matrices over Symmetrized Tropical Algebras and Valued Ordered fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10602v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of positive definite and positive semi-definite symmetric matrices within the framework of symmetrized tropical algebra, an extension of tropical algebra adapted to ordered valued fields.
  We focus on the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of these matrices. We
  prove that the eigenvalues of a positive (semi)-definite matrix in the tropical symmetrized setting coincide with its diagonal entries. Then, we show that the images by the valuation of the eigenvalues of a positive definite matrix over a valued nonarchimedean ordered field coincide with the eigenvalues of an associated matrix in the symmetrized tropical algebra. Moreover, under a genericity condition, we characterize the images of the eigenvectors under the map keeping track both of the nonarchimedean valuation and sign, showing that they coincide with tropical eigenvectors in the symmetrized algebra. These results offer new insights into the spectral theory of matrices over tropical semirings, and provide combinatorial formul\ae\ for log-limits of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of parametric families of real positive definite matrices.</description>

      <title>Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator for the Helmholtz problem with general wavenumbers on the $n$-sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the Helmholtz problem in the exterior of a ball with Dirichlet boundary conditions and radiation conditions imposed at infinity. The differential Helmholtz operator depends on the complex wavenumber with non-negative real part and is formulated for general spatial dimension. We prove wavenumber explicit continuity estimates of the corresponding Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) operator which are valid for all wavenumbers under consideration and do not deteriorate as they tend to zero.
  The exterior Helmholtz problem can be equivalently reformulated on a bounded domain with DtN boundary conditions on the artificial boundary of a ball. We derive wavenumber independent trace and Friedrichs-type inequalities for the solution space in wavenumber-indexed norms.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Monte Carlo with one categorical variable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study randomized quasi-Monte Carlo (RQMC) estimation of a multivariate integral where one of the variables takes only a finite number of values. This problem arises when the variable of integration is drawn from a mixture distribution as is common in importance sampling and also arises in some recent work on transport maps. We find that when integration error decreases at an RQMC rate that it is then beneficial to oversample the smallest mixture components instead of using a proportional allocation. The optimal allocations depend on the possibly unknown convergence rates. Designing the sample with an incorrect assumption on the rate still attains that convergence rate, with an inferior implied constant. The penalty for using a pessimistic rate is typically higher than for using an optimistic one. We also find that for the most accurate RQMC sampling methods, it is advantageous to arrange that our $n=2^m$ randomized Sobol' points split into subsample sizes that are also powers of $2$.</description>
