      <title>Chord: Chain of Rendering Decomposition for PBR Material Estimation from Generated Texture Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Material creation and reconstruction are crucial for appearance modeling but traditionally require significant time and expertise from artists. While recent methods leverage visual foundation models to synthesize PBR materials from user-provided inputs, they often fall short in quality, flexibility, and user control. We propose a novel two-stage generate-and-estimate framework for PBR material generation. In the generation stage, a fine-tuned diffusion model synthesizes shaded, tileable texture images aligned with user input. In the estimation stage, we introduce a chained decomposition scheme that sequentially predicts SVBRDF channels by passing previously extracted representation as input into a single-step image-conditional diffusion model. Our method is efficient, high quality, and enables flexible user control. We evaluate our approach against existing material generation and estimation methods, demonstrating superior performance. Our material estimation method shows strong robustness on both generated textures and in-the-wild photographs. Furthermore, we highlight the flexibility of our framework across diverse applications, including text-to-material, image-to-material, structure-guided generation, and material editing.</description>

      <title>GASP: A Gradient-Aware Shortest Path Algorithm for Boundary-Confined Visualization of 2-Manifold Reeb Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reeb graphs are an important tool for abstracting and representing the topological structure of a function defined on a manifold. We have identified three properties for faithfully representing Reeb graphs in a visualization: they should be constrained to the boundary, compact, and aligned with the function gradient. Existing algorithms for drawing Reeb graphs are agnostic to or violate these properties. In this paper, we introduce an algorithm to generate Reeb graph visualizations, called GASP, that is cognizant of these properties, thereby producing visualizations that are more representative of the underlying data. To demonstrate the improvements, the resulting Reeb graphs are evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively against the geometric barycenter algorithm, using its implementation available in the Topology ToolKit (TTK), a widely adopted tool for calculating and visualizing Reeb graphs.</description>
