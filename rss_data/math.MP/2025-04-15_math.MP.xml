      <title>On distances among Slater Determinant States and Determinantal Point Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determinantal processes provide mathematical modeling of repulsion among points. In quantum mechanics, Slater determinant states generate such processes, reflecting Fermionic behavior. This note exploits the connections between the former and the latter structures by establishing quantitative bounds in terms of trace/total variation and Wasserstein distances.</description>

      <title>Quantum Phase diagrams and transitions for Chern topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological invariants such as Chern classes are by now a standard way to classify topological phases. Varying systems in a family leads to phase diagrams, where the Chern classes may jump when crossingn a critical locus. These systems appear naturally when considering slicing of higher dimensional systems or when considering systems with parameters.
  As the Chern classes are topological invariants, they can only change if the ``topology breaks down''. We give a precise mathematical formulation of this phenomenon and show that synthetically any phase diagram of Chern topological phases can be designed and realized by a physical system, using covering, aka.\ winding maps. Here we provide explicit families realizing arbitrary Chern jumps. The critical locus of these maps is described by the classical rose curves. These give a lower bond on the number of Dirac points in general that is sharp for 2-level systems. In the process, we treat several concrete models.
  In particular, we treat the lattices and tight--binding models, and show that effective winding maps can be achieved using $k$--th nearest neighbors. We give explicit formulas for a family of 2D lattices using imaginary quadratic field extensions and their norms. This includes the square, triangular, honeycomb and Kagome lattices</description>

      <title>Lagrangian averaging of singular stochastic actions for fluid dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct sub-grid scale models of incompressible fluids by considering expectations of semi-martingale Lagrangian particle trajectories. Our construction is based on the Lagrangian decomposition of flow maps into mean and fluctuation parts, and it is separated into the following steps. First, through Magnus expansion, the fluid velocity field is expressed in terms of fluctuation vector fields whose dynamics are assumed to be stochastic. Second, we use Malliavin calculus to give a regularised interpretation of the product of white noise when inserting the stochastic velocity field into the Lagrangian for Euler's fluid. Lastly, we consider closures of the mean velocity by making stochastic analogues of Talyor's frozen-in turbulence hypothesis to derive a version of the anisotropic Lagrangian averaged Euler equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend Hintz's cosmological black hole gluing result to the Einstein-Maxwell system with positive cosmological constant by gluing multiple Reissner-Nordstr\"om or Kerr--Newman--de Sitter black holes into neighbourhoods of points in the conformal boundary of de Sitter space. We determine necessary and sufficient conditions on the black hole parameters -- related to Friedrich's conformal constraint equations -- for this gluing to be possible. We also improve the original gluing method slightly by showing that the construction of a solution in Taylor series may be accomplished using an exactness argument, eliminating the need for an early gauge-fixing.</description>

      <title>Planar quantum low-density parity-check codes with open boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct high-performance planar quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes with open boundaries, demonstrating substantially improved resource efficiency compared to the surface code. We present planar code families with logical dimensions ranging from $k=6$ to $k=13$ (e.g., $[[79, 6, 6]]$, $[[107, 7, 7]]$, $[[173, 8, 9]]$, $[[268, 8, 12]]$, $[[405, 9, 15]]$, $[[374, 10, 13]]$, $[[409, 11, 13]]$, $[[386, 12, 12]]$, $[[362, 13, 11]]$), all using local stabilizers of weight 6 or lower. These codes achieve an efficiency metric ($kd^2/n$) that is an order of magnitude greater than that of the surface code. They can be interpreted as planar bivariate bicycle codes, adapted from the original design based on a torus that is challenging to implement physically. Our construction method, which combines boundary anyon condensation with a novel "lattice grafting" optimization, circumvents this difficulty and produces codes featuring only local low-weight stabilizers suitable for 2D planar hardware architectures. Furthermore, we observe fractal logical operators in the form of Sierpinski triangles, with the code distances scaling proportionally to the area of the truncated fractal in finite systems. We anticipate that our codes and construction methods offer a promising pathway toward realizing near-term fault-tolerant quantum computers.</description>

      <title>On quadratic Novikov algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quadratic Novikov algebra is a Novikov algebra $(A, \circ)$ with a symmetric and nondegenerate bilinear form $B(\cdot,\cdot)$ satisfying $B(a\circ b, c)=-B(b, a\circ c+c\circ a)$ for all $a$, $b$, $c\in A$. This notion appeared in the theory of Novikov bialgebras. In this paper, we first investigate some properties of quadratic Novikov algebras and give a decomposition theorem of quadratic Novikov algebras. Then we present a classification of quadratic Novikov algebras of dimensions $2$ and $3$ over $\mathbb{C}$ up to isomorphism. Finally, a construction of quadratic Novikov algebras called double extension is presented and we show that any quadratic Novikov algebra containing a nonzero isotropic ideal can be obtained by double extensions. Based on double extension, an example of quadratic Novikov algebras of dimension 4 is given.</description>

      <title>An index for unitarizable $\mathfrak{sl}(m\vert n)$-supermodules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The "superconformal index" is a character-valued invariant attached by theoretical physics to unitary representations of Lie superalgebras, such as $\mathfrak{su}(2,2\vert n)$, that govern certain quantum field theories. The index can be calculated as a supertrace over Hilbert space, and is constant in families induced by variation of physical parameters. This is because the index receives contributions only from "short" irreducible representations such that it is invariant under recombination at the boundary of the region of unitarity.
  The purpose of this paper is to develop these notions for unitarizable supermodules over the special linear Lie superalgebras $\mathfrak{sl}(m\vert n)$ with $m\ge 2$, $n\ge 1$. To keep it self-contained, we include a fair amount of background material on structure theory, unitarizable supermodules, the Duflo-Serganova functor, and elements of Harish-Chandra theory. Along the way, we provide a precise dictionary between various notions from theoretical physics and mathematical terminology. Our final result is a kind of "index theorem" that relates the counting of atypical constituents in a general unitarizable $\mathfrak{sl}(m\vert n)$-supermodule to the character-valued $Q$-Witten index, expressed as a supertrace over the full supermodule. The formal superdimension of holomorphic discrete series $\mathfrak{sl}(m\vert n)$-supermodules can also be formulated in this framework.</description>

      <title>On Cauchy problem to the modified Camassa-Holm equation: Painlev\'{e} asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Painlev\'{e} asymptotics for the Cauchy problem of the modified Camassa-Holm (mCH) equation with zero boundary conditions \begin{align*}\nonumber &amp;m_t+\left((u^2-u_x^2)m\right)_x=0, \ (x,t)\in\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}^+,\\ &amp;u(x,0)=u_0(x), \lim_{x\to\pm\infty} u_0(x)=0, \end{align*} where $u_0(x)\in H^{4,2}(\mathbb{R})$. Recently, Yang and Fan (Adv. Math. 402, 108340 (2022)) reported the long-time asymptotic result for the mCH equation in the solitonic regions. The main purpose of our work is to study the long-time asymptotic behavior in two transition regions. The key to proving this result is to establish and analyze the Riemann-Hilbert problem on a new plane $(y;t)$ related to the Cauchy problem of the mCH equation. With the $\bar{\partial}$-generalization of the Deift-Zhou nonlinear steepest descent method and double scaling limit technique, in two transition regions defined by \begin{align}\nonumber \mathcal{P}_{I}:=\{(x,t):0\leqslant |\frac{x}{t}-2|t^{2/3}\leqslant C\},~~~~\mathcal{P}_{II}:=\{(x,t):0\leqslant |\frac{x}{t}+1/4|t^{2/3}\leqslant C\}, \end{align} where $C&gt;0$ is a constant, we find that the leading order approximation to the solution of the mCH equation can be expressed in terms of the Painlev\'{e} II equation.</description>

      <title>Arnold diffusion in the full three-body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show the existence of Arnold diffusion in the planar full three-body problem, which is expressed as a perturbation of a Kepler problem and a planar circular restricted three-body problem, with the perturbation parameter being the mass of the smallest body. In this context, we obtain Arnold diffusion in terms of a transfer of energy, in an amount independent of the perturbation parameter, between the Kepler problem and the restricted three-body problem. Our argument is based on a topological method based on correctly aligned windows which is implemented into a computer assisted proof. This approach can be applied to physically relevant masses of the bodies, such as those in a Neptune-Triton-asteroid system. In this case, we obtain explicit estimates for the range of the perturbation parameter and for the diffusion time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive full asymptotic expansions for the Humbert function $\Phi_1$ in different limiting regimes of its variables. Our derivation employs various asymptotic methods and relies on key transformation formulae established by Erd\'elyi (1940), and Tuan and Kalla (1987). The efficiency of our asymptotic results are also illustrated through two applications: (1) analytic continuations of Saran's function $F_M$, and (2) two limits arising in the study of the $1D$ Glauber-Ising model. Finally, some promising directions for future research are highlighted.</description>

Abstract: We propose the algorithm for creating an arbitrary pure quantum superposition state with required accuracy of encoding the amplitudes and phases of this state. The algorithm uses controlled measurement of the ancilla state to avoid the problem of small probability of detecting the required ancilla state. This algorithm can be a subroutine generating the required input state in various algorithms, in particular, in matrix-manipulation algorithms developed earlier.</description>

      <title>Time-of-Flow Distribution in Discrete Quantum Systems: From Experimental Protocol to Optimization and Decoherence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we propose to quantify the timing of quantum state transitions in discrete systems via the time-of-flow (TF) distribution. Derived from the rate of change of state occupation probability, the TF distribution is experimentally accessible via projective measurements at discrete time steps on independently prepared systems, avoiding Zeno inhibition. In monotonic regimes and limiting cases, it admits a clear interpretation as a time-of-arrival or time-of-departure distribution. We show how this framework can be used in the optimization of quantum control protocols and in diagnostic tools for assessing decoherence in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Tropical sampling from Feynman measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an algorithm that samples a set of loop momenta distributed as a given Feynman integrand. The algorithm uses the tropical sampling method and can be applied to evaluate phase-space-type integrals efficiently. We provide an implementation, momtrop, and apply it to a series of relevant integrals from the loop-tree duality framework. Compared to naive sampling methods, we observe convergence speedups by factors of more than $10^6$.</description>

      <title>Unitary transform diagonalizing the Confluent Hypergeometric kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the image of the operator, inducing the determinantal point process with the confluent hypergeometric kernel. The space is described as the image of $L_2[0, 1]$ under a unitary transform, which generalizes the Fourier transform. For the derived transform we prove a counterpart of the Paley-Wiener theorem. We use the theorem to prove that the corresponding analogue of the Wiener-Hopf operator is a unitary equivalent of the usual Wiener-Hopf operator, which implies that it shares the same factorization properties and Widom's trace formula. Finally, using the introduced transform we give explicit formulae for the hierarchical decomposition of the image of the operator, induced by the confluent hypergeometric kernel.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider classical theories described by Hamiltonians $H(p,q)$ that have a non-degenerate minimum at the point where generalized momenta $p$ and generalized coordinates $q$ vanish. We assume that the sum of squares of generalized momenta and generalized coordinates is an integral of motion. In this situation, in the neighborhood of the point $p=0, q=0$ quadratic part of a Hamiltonian plays a dominant role. We suppose that a classical observer can observe only physical quantities corresponding to quadratic Hamiltonians and show that in this case, he should conclude that the laws of quantum theory govern his world.</description>

      <title>Creation of chaos for interacting Brownian particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a system of $N$ Brownian particles, with or without inertia, interacting in the mean-field regime via a weak, smooth, long-range potential, and starting initially from an arbitrary exchangeable $N$-particle distribution. In this model framework, we establish a fine version of the so-called creation-of-chaos phenomenon: in weak norms, the mean-field approximation for a typical particle is shown to hold with an accuracy $O(N^{-1})$ up to an error due solely to initial pair correlations, which is damped exponentially over time. The novelty is that the initial information appears in our estimates only through pair correlations, which currently seems inaccessible to other methods. This is complemented by corresponding results on higher-order creation of chaos in the form of higher-order correlation estimates.</description>

      <title>Cohomology ring of unitary $N=(2,2)$ full vertex algebra and mirror symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mirror symmetry among Calabi-Yau manifolds is mysterious, however, the mirror operation in 2d N=(2,2) supersymmetric conformal field theory (SCFT) is an elementary operation. In this paper, we mathematically formulate SCFTs using unitary full vertex operator superalgebras (full VOAs) and develop a cohomology theory of unitary SCFTs (aka holomorphic / topological twists). In particular, we introduce cohomology rings, Hodge numbers, and the Witten index of a unitary $N=(2,2)$ full VOA, and prove that the cohomology rings determine 2d topological field theories and give relations between them (Hodge duality and T-duality).
  Based on this, we propose a possible approach to prove the existence of mirror Calabi-Yau manifolds for the Hodge numbers using SCFTs. For the proof, one need a construction of sigma models connecting Calabi-Yau manifolds and SCFTs which is still not rigorous, but expected properties are tested for the case of Abelian varieties and a special K3 surface based on some unitary $N=(2,2)$ full VOAs.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the reduced density matrices obtained for the quantum states in the context of 3d Chern-Simons theory with gauge group SU(2) and Chern-Simons level $k$. We focus on the quantum states associated with the $T_{p,p}$ torus link complements, which is a $p$-party pure quantum state. The reduced density matrices are obtained by taking the $(1|p-1)$ bi-partition of the total system. We show that the characteristic polynomials of these reduced density matrices are monic polynomials with rational coefficients.</description>

      <title>Regularization of Functional Determinants of Radial Operators via Heat Kernel Coefficients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an efficient regularization method for functional determinants of radial operators using heat kernel coefficients. Our key finding is a systematic way to identify heat kernel coefficients in the angular momentum space. We explicitly obtain the formulas up to sixth order in the heat kernel expansion, which suffice to regularize functional determinants in up to 13 dimensions. We find that the heat kernel coefficients accurately approximate the large angular momentum dependence of functional determinants, and make numerical computations more efficient. In the limit of a large angular momentum, our formulas reduce to the WKB formulas in previous studies, but extended to higher orders. All the results are available in both the zeta function regularization and the dimensional regularization.</description>

      <title>SEMPO - Retrieving poles, residues and zeros in the complex frequency plane from an arbitrary spectral response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Singularity Expansion Method Parameter Optimizer - SEMPO - is a toolbox to extract the complex poles, zeros and residues of an arbitrary response function acquired along the real frequency axis. SEMPO allows to determine this full set of complex parameters of linear physical systems from their spectral responses only, without prior information about the system. The method leverages on the Singularity Expansion Method of the physical signal. This analytical expansion of the meromorphic function in the complex frequency plane motivates the use of the Cauchy method and auto-differentiation-based optimization approach to retrieve the complex poles, zeros and residues from the knowledge of the spectrum over a finite and real spectral range. Both approaches can be sequentially associated to provide highly accurate reconstructions of physical signals in large spectral windows. The performances of SEMPO are assessed and analysed in several configurations that include the dielectric permittivity of materials and the optical response spectra of various optical metasurfaces.</description>

      <title>Extended-BMS Anomalies and Flat Space Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We classify the Lagrangians and anomalies of an extended BMS field theory using BRST methods. To do so, we establish an intrinsic gauge-fixing procedure for the geometric data, which allows us to derive the extended BMS symmetries and the correct transformation law of the shear, encoded in the connection. Our analysis reveals that the invariant Lagrangians are always topological, thereby reducing the 4d bulk to a 2d boundary theory. Moreover, we find that supertranslations are anomaly-free, while superrotations exhibit independent central charges. This BMS field theory is dual to Einstein gravity in asymptotically flat spacetimes when the superrotation anomalies coincide and are dictated by the bulk. Meanwhile, the absence of supertranslation anomalies aligns with Weinberg's soft graviton theorem being tree-level exact. This work provides a first-principle derivation of the structure of the null boundary field theory, intrinsic and independent of bulk considerations, offering further evidence for the holographic principle in flat space, and its dimensional reduction.</description>

      <title>Global existence of measure-valued solutions to the multicomponent Smoluchowski coagulation equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Global solutions to the multicomponent Smoluchowski coagulation equation are constructed for measure-valued initial data with minimal assumptions on the moments. The framework is based on an abstract formulation of the Arzel\`a-Ascoli theorem for uniform spaces. The result holds for a large class of coagulation rate kernels, satisfying a power-law upper bound with possibly different singularities at small-small, small-large and large-large coalescence pairs. This includes in particular both mass-conserving and gelling kernels, as well as interpolation kernels used in applications. We also provide short proofs of mass-conservation and gelation results for any weak solution, which extends previous results for one-component systems.</description>

      <title>The diagonal and Hadamard grade of hypergeometric functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diagonals of rational functions are an important class of functions arising in number theory, algebraic geometry, combinatorics, and physics. In this paper we study the diagonal grade of a function $f$, which is defined to be the smallest $n$ such that $f$ is the diagonal of a rational function in variables $x_0,\dots, x_n$. We relate the diagonal grade of a function to the nilpotence of the associated differential equation. This allows us to determine the diagonal grade of many hypergeometric functions and answer affirmatively the outstanding question on the existence of functions with diagonal grade greater than $2$. In particular, we show that $\prescript{}{n}F_{n-1}(\frac{1}{2},\dots, \frac{1}{2};1\dots,1 \mid x)$ has diagonal grade $n$ for each $n\geq 1$. Our method also applies to the generating function of the Ap\'ery sequence, which we find to have diagonal grade $3$. We also answer related questions on Hadamard grades posed by Allouche and Mend\`es France. For example, we show that $\prescript{}{n}F_{n-1}(\frac{1}{2},\dots, \frac{1}{2};1\dots,1 \mid x)$ has Hadamard grade $n$ for all $n\geq 1$.</description>

      <title>Minimal surfaces in strongly correlated random environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A minimal surface in a random environment (MSRE) is a $d$-dimensional surface in $(d+n)$-dimensional space which minimizes the sum of its elastic energy and its environment potential energy, subject to prescribed boundary values. Apart from their intrinsic interest, such surfaces are further motivated by connections with disordered spin systems and first-passage percolation models. In this work, we consider the case of strongly correlated environments, realized by the model of harmonic MSRE in a fractional Brownian environment of Hurst parameter $H\in(0,1)$. This includes the case of Brownian environment ($H=1/2$ and $n=1$), which is commonly used to approximate the domain walls of the $(d+1)$-dimensional random-field Ising model.
  We prove that surfaces of dimension $d\in\{1,2,3\}$ delocalize with power-law fluctuations, and determine their precise transversal and minimal energy fluctuation exponents, as well as the stretched exponential exponents governing the tail decay of their distributions. These exponents are found to be the same in all codimensions $n$, depending only on $d$ and $H$. The transversal and minimal energy fluctuation exponents are specified by two scaling relations.
  We further show that surfaces of dimension $d=4$ delocalize with sub-power-law fluctuations, with their height and minimal energy fluctuations tied by a scaling relation. Lastly, we prove that surfaces of dimensions $d\ge 5$ localize.
  These results put several predictions from the physics literature on mathematically rigorous ground.</description>

      <title>Lorentzian Gromov-Hausdorff convergence and pre-compactness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To goal of the paper is to introduce a convergence \`a la Gromov-Hausdorff for Lorentzian spaces, building on $\epsilon$-nets consisting of causal diamonds and relying only on the time separation function. This yields a geometric notion of convergence, which can be applied to synthetic Lorentzian spaces (Lorentzian pre-length spaces) or smooth spacetimes. Among the main results, we prove a Lorentzian counterpart of the celebrated Gromov's pre-compactness theorem for metric spaces, where controlled covers by balls are replaced by controlled covers by diamonds. This yields a geometric pre-compactness result for classes of globally hyperbolic spacetimes, satisfying a uniform doubling property on Cauchy hypersurfaces and a suitable control on the causality. The final part of the paper establishes several applications: we show that Chru\'sciel-Grant approximations are an instance of the Lorentzian Gromov-Hausdorff convergence here introduced, we prove that timelike sectional curvature bounds are stable under such a convergence, we introduce timelike blow-up tangents and discuss connections with the main conjecture of causal set theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce "quantum barcodes," a theoretical framework that applies persistent homology to classify topological phases in quantum many-body systems. By mapping quantum states to classical data points through strategic observable measurements, we create a "quantum state cloud" analyzable via persistent homology techniques. Our framework establishes that quantum systems in the same topological phase exhibit consistent barcode representations with shared persistent homology groups over characteristic intervals. We prove that quantum phase transitions manifest as significant changes in these persistent homology features, detectable through discontinuities in the persistent Dirac operator spectrum. Using the SSH model as a demonstrative example, we show how our approach successfully identifies the topological phase transition and distinguishes between trivial and topological phases. While primarily developed for symmetry-protected topological phases, our framework provides a mathematical connection between persistent homology and quantum topology, offering new methods for phase classification that complement traditional invariant-based approaches.</description>

Abstract: The Thouless theory of quantum pumps establishes the conditions for quantized particle transport per cycle, and determines its value. When describing the pump from a moving reference frame, transported and existing charges transform, though not independently. This transformation is inherent to Galilean space and time, but it is underpinned by a transformation of vector bundles. Different formalisms can be used to describe this transformation, including one based on Bloch theory. Depending on the chosen formalism, the two types of charges will be realized as indices of either the same or different kinds. Finally, we apply the bulk-edge correspondence principle, so as to implement the transformation law within B\"uttiker's scattering theory of quantum pumps.</description>

      <title>Euler's original derivation of elastica equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09227v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Euler derived the differential equations of elastica by the variational method in 1744, but his original derivation has never been properly interpreted or explained in terms of modern mathematics. We elaborate Euler's original derivation of elastica and show that Euler used Noether's theorem concerning the translational symmetry of elastica, although Noether published her theorem in 1918. It is also shown that his equation is essentially the static modified KdV equation which is obtained by the isometric and isoenergy conditions, known as the Goldstein-Petrich scheme.</description>

      <title>Law of Large Numbers and Central Limit Theorem for random sets of solitons of the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17036v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a random configuration of $N$ soliton solutions $\psi_N(x,t;\boldsymbol{\lambda})$ of the cubic focusing Nonlinear Schr\"odinger (fNLS) equation in one space dimension. The $N$ soliton solutions are parametrized by a $N$-dimension complex vector $\boldsymbol{\lambda}$ whose entries are the eigenvalues of the Zakharov-Shabat linear spectral problem and by $N$ nonzero complex norming constants. The randomness is obtained by choosing the complex eigenvalues i.i.d. random variables sampled from a probability distribution with compact support on the complex plane. The corresponding norming constants are interpolated by a smooth function of the eigenvalues. Then we consider the Zakharov-Shabat linear problem for the expectation of the random measure associated to the spectral data. We denote the corresponding solution of the fNLS equation by $\psi_\infty(x,t)$. This solution can be interpreted as a soliton gas solution. We prove a Law of Large Numbers and a Central Limit Theorem for the differences $\psi_N(x,t;\boldsymbol{\lambda})-\psi_\infty(x,t)$ and $|\psi_N(x,t;\boldsymbol{\lambda})|^2-|\psi_\infty(x,t)|^2$ when $(x,t)$ are in a compact set of $\mathbb R \times \mathbb R^+$; we additionally compute the correlation functions.</description>

Abstract: Hodograph equations for the Euler equation in curved spaces with constant pressure are discussed. It is shown that the use of known results concerning geodesics and associated integrals allows to construct several types of hodograph equations. These hodograph equations provide us with various classes of solutions of the Euler equation, including stationary solutions. Particular cases of cone and sphere in the 3-dimensional Eulidean space are analysed in detail. Euler equation on the sphere in the 4-dimensional Euclidean space is considered too.</description>

      <title>On the generalized Langevin equation and the Mori projection operator technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In statistical physics, the Mori-Zwanzig projection operator formalism (also called Nakajima-Zwanzig projection operator formalism) is used to derive a linear integro-differential equation for observables in Hilbert space, the generalized Langevin equation (GLE). This technique relies on the splitting of the dynamics into a projected and an orthogonal part. We prove that the GLE together with the second fluctuation dissipation theorem (2FDT) uniquely define the fluctuating forces as well as the memory kernel. The GLE and 2FDT are an immediate consequence of the existence and uniqueness of solutions of linear Volterra equations. They neither rely on the Dyson identity nor on the concept of orthogonal dynamics. This holds true for autonomous as well as non-autonomous systems. Further results are obtained for the Mori projection for autonomous systems, for which the fluctuating forces are orthogonal to the observable of interest. In particular, we prove that the orthogonal dynamics is a strongly continuous semigroup generated by $\overline{\mathcal{QL}}Q$, where $\mathcal{L}$ is the generator of the time evolution operator, and $\mathcal{P}=1-\mathcal{Q}$ is the Mori projection operator. As a consequence, the corresponding orbit maps (e.g. the fluctuating forces) are the unique mild solutions of the associated abstract Cauchy problem. Furthermore, we show that the orthogonal dynamics is a unitary group, if $\mathcal{L}$ is skew-adjoint. In this case, the fluctuating forces are stationary. In addition, we present a proof of the GLE by means of semigroup theory, and we retrieve the commonly used definitions for the fluctuating forces, memory kernel, and orthogonal dynamics. Our results apply to general autonomous dynamical systems, whose time evolution is given by a strongly continuous semigroup. This includes large classes of systems in classical statistical mechanics.</description>

      <title>On a gap in the proof of the generalised quantum Stein's lemma and its consequences for the reversibility of quantum resources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.02813v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the proof of the generalised quantum Stein's lemma [Brand\~ao &amp; Plenio, Commun. Math. Phys. 295, 791 (2010)] is not correct due to a gap in the argument leading to Lemma III.9. Hence, the main achievability result of Brand\~ao &amp; Plenio is not known to hold. This puts into question a number of established results in the literature, in particular the reversibility of quantum entanglement [Brand\~ao &amp; Plenio, Commun. Math. Phys. 295, 829 (2010); Nat. Phys. 4, 873 (2008)] and of general quantum resources [Brand\~ao &amp; Gour, Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 070503 (2015)] under asymptotically resource non-generating operations. We discuss potential ways to recover variants of the newly unsettled results using other approaches.</description>

      <title>Ladder costs for random walks in L\'evy random media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.02271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.02271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a random walk $Y$ moving on a L\'evy random medium, namely a one-dimensional renewal point process with inter-distances between points that are in the domain of attraction of a stable law. The focus is on the characterization of the law of the first-ladder height $Y_{\mathcal{T}}$ and length $L_{\mathcal{T}}(Y)$, where $\mathcal{T}$ is the first-passage time of $Y$ in $\mathbb{R}^+$. The study relies on the construction of a broader class of processes, denoted Random Walks in Random Scenery on Bonds (RWRSB) that we briefly describe. The scenery is constructed by associating two random variables with each bond of $\mathbb{Z}$, corresponding to the two possible crossing directions of that bond. A random walk $S$ on $\mathbb{Z}$ with i.i.d increments collects the scenery values of the bond it traverses: we denote this composite process the RWRSB. Under suitable assumptions, we characterize the tail distribution of the sum of scenery values collected up to the first exit time $\mathcal{T}$. This setting will be applied to obtain results for the laws of the first-ladder length and height of $Y$. The main tools of investigation are a generalized Spitzer-Baxter identity, that we derive along the proof, and a suitable representation of the RWRSB in terms of local times of the random walk $S$. All these results are easily generalized to the entire sequence of ladder variables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.13216v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is a contribution to the algebraic study of contextuality in quantum theory. As an algebraic analogue of Kochen and Specker's no-hidden-variables result, we investigate rational subrings over which the partial ring of $d \times d$ symmetric matrices ($d \geq 3$) admits no morphism to a commutative ring, which we view as an "algebraic hidden state." For $d = 3$, the minimal such ring is shown to be $\mathbb{Z}[1/6]$, while for $d \geq 6$ the minimal subring is $\mathbb{Z}$ itself. The proofs rely on the construction of new sets of integer vectors in dimensions 3 and 6 that have no Kochen-Specker coloring.</description>

      <title>The radius of a self-repelling star polymer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.01537v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the effective radius of weakly self-avoiding star polymers in one, two, and three dimensions. Our model includes $N$ Brownian motions up to time $T$, started at the origin and subject to exponential penalization based on the amount of time they spend close to each other, or close to themselves. The effective radius measures the typical distance from the origin. Our main result gives estimates for the effective radius where in two and three dimensions we impose the restriction that $T \leq N$. One of the highlights of our results is that in two dimensions, we find that the radius is proportional to $T^{3/4}$, up to logarithmic corrections. Our result may shed light on the well-known conjecture that for a single self-avoiding random walk in two dimensions, the end-to-end distance up to time $T$ is roughly $T^{3/4}$.</description>

      <title>A method of approximation of discrete Schr\"odinger equation with the normalized Laplacian by discrete-time quantum walk on graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a class of continuous-time quantum walk models on graphs induced by a certain class of discrete-time quantum walk models with the parameter $\epsilon\in [0,1]$. Here the graph treated in this paper can be applied both finite and infinite cases. The induced continuous-time quantum walk is an extended version of the (free) discrete-Schr\"odinger equation driven by the normalized Laplacian: the element of the weighted Hermitian takes not only a scalar value but also a matrix value depending on the underlying discrete-time quantum walk. We show that each discrete-time quantum walk with an appropriate setting of the parameter $\epsilon$ in the long time limit identifies with its induced continuous-time quantum walk and give the running time for the discrete-time to approximate the induced continuous-time quantum walk with a small error $\delta$. We also investigate the detailed spectral information on the induced continuous-time quantum walk.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Bernstein inequalities and spectral inequality on thick sets for the Landau operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14902v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a spectral inequality for the Landau operator. This means that for all $f$ in the spectral subspace corresponding to energies up to $E$, the $L^2$-integral over suitable $S \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ can be lower bounded by an explicit constant times the $L^2$-norm of $f$ itself. We identify the class of all measurable sets $S \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ for which such an inequality can hold, namely so-called thick or relatively dense sets, and deduce an asymptotically optimal expression for the constant in terms of the energy, the magnetic field strength and in terms of parameters determining the thick set $S$. Our proofs rely on so-called magnetic Bernstein inequalities. As a consequence, we obtain the first proof of null-controllability for the magnetic heat equation (with sharp bound on the control cost), and can relax assumptions in existing proofs of Anderson localization in the continuum alloy-type model.</description>

      <title>Hopf algebras for the shuffle algebra and fractions from multiple zeta values</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The algebra of multiple zeta values (MZVs) is encoded as a stuffle (quasi-shuffle) algebra and a shuffle algebra. The MZV stuffle algebra has a natural Hopf algebra structure. This paper equips a Hopf algebra structure to the MZV shuffle algebra. The needed coproduct is defined by a recursion through a family of weight-increasing linear operators. To verify the Hopf algebra axioms, we make use of a family of fractions, called Chen fractions, that have been used to study MZVs and also serve as the function model for the MZV shuffle algebra. Applying natural derivations on functions and working in the context of locality, a locality Hopf algebra structure is established on the linear span of Chen fractions. This locality Hopf algebra is then shown to descend to a Hopf algebra on the MZV shuffle algebra, whose coproduct satisfies the same recursion as the first-defined coproduct. Thus the two coproducts coincide, establishing the needed Hopf algebra axioms on the MZV shuffle algebra.</description>

Abstract: In dimensions 3 or larger, it is a classical fact that the directed polymer model has two phases: Brownian behavior at high temperature, and non-Brownian behavior at low temperature. We consider the response of the polymer to an external field or tilt, and show that at fixed temperature, the polymer has Brownian behavior for some fields and non-Brownian behavior for others. In other words, the external field can induce the phase transition in the directed polymer model.</description>

      <title>A generalized Liouville equation and magnetic stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09332v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work considers two related families of nonlinear and nonlocal problems in the plane $\mathbb{R}^2$. The first main result derives the general integrable solution to a generalized Liouville equation using the Wronskian of two coprime complex polynomials. The second main result concerns an application to a generalized Ladyzhenskaya-Gagliardo-Nirenberg interpolation inequality, with a single real parameter $\beta$ interpreted as the strength of a magnetic self-interaction. The optimal constant of the inequality and the corresponding minimizers of the quotient are studied and it is proved that for $\beta \ge 2$, for which the constant equals $2\pi\beta$, such minimizers only exist at quantized $\beta \in 2\mathbb{N}$ corresponding to nonlinear generalizations of Landau levels with densities solving the generalized Liouville equation. This latter problem originates from the study of self-dual vortex solitons in the abelian Chern-Simons-Higgs theory and from the average-field-Pauli effective theory of anyons, i.e. quantum particles with statistics intermediate to bosons and fermions. An immediate application is given to Keller-Lieb-Thirring stability bounds for a gas of such anyons which self-interact magnetically (vector nonlocal repulsion) as well as electrostatically (scalar local/point attraction), thus generalizing the stability theory of the 2D cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a random quantum channel obtained by taking a selection of $d$ independent and Haar distributed $N$ dimensional unitaries. We follow the argument of Hastings to bound the spectral gap in terms of eigenvalues and adapt it to give an exact estimate of the spectral gap in terms of singular values \cite{hastings2007random,harrow2007quantum}. This shows that we have constructed a random quantum expander in terms of both singular values and eigenvalues. The lower bound is an analog of the Alon-Boppana bound for $d$-regular graphs. The upper bound is obtained using Schwinger-Dyson equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Partially ordered sets (posets) play a universal role as an abstract structure in many areas of mathematics. For finite posets, an explicit enumeration of distinct partial orders on a set of unlabelled elements is known only up to a cardinality of 16 (listed as sequence A000112 in the OEIS), but closed expressions are unknown. By considering the automorphisms of (finite) posets, I introduce a formulation of local symmetries. These symmetries give rise to a division operation on the set of posets and lead to the construction of symmetry classes that are easier to characterise and enumerate. Furthermore, we consider polynomial expressions that count certain subsets of posets with a large number of layers (a large height). As an application in physics, local symmetries or rather their absence helps to distinguish causal sets (locally finite posets) that serve as discrete spacetime models from generic causal sets.</description>

Abstract: Cell motility is connected to the spontaneous symmetry breaking of a circular shape. In https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.110.078102, Blanch-Mercader and Casademunt perfomed a nonlinear analysis of the minimal model proposed by Callan and Jones https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.100.258106 and numerically conjectured the existence of traveling solutions once that symmetry is broken. In this work, we prove analytically that conjecture by means of nonlinear bifurcation techniques.</description>

      <title>The power of the anomaly consistency condition for the Master Ward Identity: Conservation of the non-Abelian gauge current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extending local gauge tansformations in a suitable way to Faddeev-Popov ghost fields, one obtains a symmetry of the total action, i.e., the Yang-Mills action plus a gauge fixing term (in a lambda-gauge) plus the ghost action. The anomalous Master Ward Identity (for this action and this extended, local gauge transformation) states that the pertinent Noether current -- the interacting ``gauge current'' -- is conserved up to anomalies.
  It is proved that, apart from terms being easily removable (by finite renormalization), all possible anomalies are excluded by the consistency condition for the anomaly of the Master Ward Identity, recently derived in refenrence [8].</description>

      <title>Regularized stress tensor of vector fields in de Sitter space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03961v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Stueckelberg field in de Sitter space, which is a massive vector field with the gauge fixing (GF) term $\frac{1}{2\zeta} (A^\mu\,_{;\, \mu})^2$. We obtain the vacuum stress tensor, which consists of the transverse, longitudinal, temporal, and GF parts, and each contains various UV divergences. By the minimal subtraction rule, we regularize each part of the stress tensor to its pertinent adiabatic order. The transverse stress tensor is regularized to the 0th adiabatic order, the longitudinal, temporal, and GF stress tensors are regularized to the 2nd adiabatic order. The resulting total regularized vacuum stress tensor is convergent and maximally-symmetric, has a positive energy density, and respects the covariant conservation, and thus can be identified as the cosmological constant that drives the de Sitter inflation. Under the Lorenz condition $A^\mu\,_{;\, \mu}=0$, the regularized Stueckelberg stress tensor reduces to the regularized Proca stress tensor that contains only the transverse and longitudinal modes. In the massless limit, the regularized Stueckelberg stress tensor becomes zero, and is the same as that of the Maxwell field with the GF term, and no trace anomaly exists. If the order of adiabatic regularization were lower than our prescription, some divergences would remain. If the order were higher, say, under the conventional 4th-order regularization, more terms than necessary would be subtracted off, leading to an unphysical negative energy density and the trace anomaly simultaneously.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a class of particular solutions of the Ishimori equation is found. This equation is known as the spatially two-dimensional version of the Heisenberg equation, which has important applications in the theory of ferromagnets. It is shown that the two-dimensional Toda-type lattice found earlier by Ferapontov, Shabat and Yamilov is a dressing chain for this equation. Using the integrable reductions of the dressing chain, the authors found an essentially new class of solutions to the Ishimori equation.</description>

      <title>Electrical networks and data analysis in phylogenetics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A classic problem in data analysis is studying the systems of subsets defined by either a similarity or a dissimilarity function on $X$ which is either observed directly or derived from a data set. For an electrical network there are two functions on the set of the nodes defined by the resistance matrix and the response matrix either of which defines the network completely. We argue that these functions should be viewed as a similarity and a dissimilarity function on the set of the nodes moreover they are related via the covariance mapping also known as the Farris transform or the Gromov product. We will explore the properties of electrical networks from this point of view. It has been known for a while that the resistance matrix defines a metric on the nodes of the electrical networks. Moreover for a circular electrical network this metric obeys the Kalmanson property as it was shown recently. We will call such a metric an electrical Kalmanson metric. The main results of this paper is a complete description of the electrical Kalmanson metrics in the set of all Kalmanson metrics in terms of the geometry of the positive Isotropic Grassmannian whose connection to the theory of electrical networks was discovered earlier. One important area of applications where Kalmanson metrics are actively used is the theory of phylogenetic networks which are a generalization of phylogenetic trees. Our results allow us to use in phylogenetics the powerful methods of reconstruction of the minimal graphs of electrical networks and possibly open the door into data analysis for the methods of the theory of cluster algebras.</description>

      <title>Delocalization of a general class of random block Schr\"odinger operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08608v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a natural class of extensions of the Anderson model on $\mathbb Z^d$, called random block Schr\"odinger operators (RBSOs), defined on the $d$-dimensional torus $(\mathbb Z/L\mathbb Z)^d$. These operators take the form $H=V+\lambda\Psi$, where $V$ is a diagonal block matrix whose diagonal blocks are i.i.d. $W^d\times W^d$ GUE, representing a random block potential, $\Psi$ describes interactions between neighboring blocks, and $\lambda\ll 1$ is a small coupling parameter (making $H$ a perturbation of $V$). We focus on three specific RBSOs: (1) the block Anderson model, where $\Psi$ is the discrete Laplacian on $(\mathbb Z/L\mathbb Z)^d$; (2) the Anderson orbital model, where $\Psi$ is a block Laplacian operator; (3) the Wegner orbital model, where the nearest-neighbor blocks of $\Psi$ are themselves random matrices. Assuming $d\ge 7$ and $W\ge L^\varepsilon$ for a small constant $\varepsilon&gt;0$, and under a certain lower bound on $\lambda$, we establish delocalization and quantum unique ergodicity for bulk eigenvectors, along with quantum diffusion estimates for the Green's function. Combined with the localization results of arXiv:1608.02922, our results rigorously demonstrate the existence of an Anderson localization-delocalization transition for RBSOs as $\lambda$ varies. Our proof is based on the $T$-expansion method and the concept of self-energy renormalization, originally developed in the study of random band matrices in arXiv:2104.12048. In addition, we introduce a conceptually novel idea, called coupling renormalization, which extends the notion of self-energy renormalization. While this phenomenon is well-known in quantum field theory, it is identified here for the first time in the context of random Schr\"odinger operators. We expect that our methods can be extended to models with real or non-Gaussian block potentials, as well as more general forms of interactions.</description>

      <title>Higher-order chiral scalar from boundary reduction of 3d higher-spin gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16463v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use a recently proposed covariant procedure to reduce the Chern-Simons action of three-dimensional higher-spin gravity to the boundary, resulting in a Lorentz covariant action for higher-order chiral scalars. After gauge-fixing, we obtain a higher-derivative action generalizing the $s=1$ Floreanini-Jackiw and $s=2$ Alekseev-Shatashvili actions to arbitrary spin $s$. For simplicity, we treat the case of general spin at the linearized level, while the full non-linear asymptotic boundary conditions are presented in component form for the $SL(3,\mathbb R)$ case. Finally, we extend the spin-3 linearized analysis to a background with non-trivial higher-spin charge and show that it has a richer structure of zero modes.</description>

      <title>Rigorous Test for Quantum Integrability and Nonintegrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18400v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integrability of a quantum many-body system, which is characterized by the presence or absence of local conserved quantities, drastically impacts the dynamics of isolated systems, including thermalization. Nevertheless, a rigorous and comprehensive method for determining integrability or nonintegrability has remained elusive. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing rigorously provable tests for integrability and nonintegrability of quantum spin systems with finite-range interactions. Our results significantly simplify existing proofs of nonintegrability, such as those for the $S=1/2$ Heisenberg chain with nearest-and next-nearest-neighbor interactions, the $S=1$ bilinear-biquadratic chain and the $S=1/2$ XYZ model in two or higher dimensions. Moreover, our results also yield the first proof of nonintegrability for models such as the $S=1/2$ Heisenberg chain with a non-uniform magnetic field, the $S=1/2$ XYZ model on the triangular lattice, and the general spin XYZ model. This work also offers a partial resolution to the long-standing conjecture that integrability is governed by the existence of local conserved quantities with small support. Our framework ensures that the nonintegrability of one-dimensional spin systems with translational symmetry can be verified algorithmically, independently of system size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00776v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The electronic and emission properties of correlated multi-particle states are studied theoretically using ${\bf k}\cdot{\bf p}$ and the configuration interaction methods on a well-known and measured GaAs/AlGaAs quantum dots as a test system. The convergence of the calculated energies and radiative lifetimes of Coulomb correlated exciton, biexciton, positive and negative trions to experimentally observed values is reached when the electron-electron and hole-hole exchange interactions are neglected. That unexpected and striking result uncovers a rich structure of multi-particle states in the studied system, which is further quantitatively compared to published measurements in the literature, obtaining astonishingly good agreement. It is proposed that in real experiments the neglected electron-electron and hole-hole exchange interactions are emitted as acoustic phonons during the radiative recombination of the ground state of complexes, leading to the observation of polaronic multi-particle states. Analysis of their energy spectra provides a direct and measurable insight into the Coulomb correlation, being interesting both on the fundamental level and as possible experimentally tunable property in a wide variety of solid-state systems, in particular associated with quantum computing.</description>

Abstract: The triad refers to embedding of two systems of polynomials, symmetric ones and those of the Baker-Akhiezer type into a power series of the Noumi-Shiraishi type. It provides an alternative definition of Macdonald theory and its extensions. The basic triad is associated with the vector representation of the Ding-Iohara-Miki (DIM) algebra. We discuss lifting this triad to two elliptic generalizations and further to the bi-elliptic triad. At the algebraic level, it corresponds to elliptic and bi-elliptic DIM algebras. This completes the list of polynomials associated with Seiberg-Witten theory with adjoint matter in various dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate strong gravitational lensing by a marginally unstable photon sphere in a Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m naked singularity spacetime. Using the Picard-Fuchs equation, we derive full-order power series expressions for the deflection angle in various regimes, including the strong deflection limits from both outside and inside the photon sphere. We show that the deflection angle diverges non-logarithmically in both cases, refining existing asymptotic formulae. Comparing truncated approximations with numerical results, we find that higher-order corrections are essential to achieve comparable accuracy to logarithmic divergence cases. Using these improved formulae, we also derive precise approximations for image positions that are not restricted to the almost perfectly aligned cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is long known that quantum Calogero models feature intertwining operators, which increase or decrease the coupling constant by an integer amount, for any fixed number of particles. We name these as ``horizontal'' and construct new ``vertical'' intertwiners, which \emph{change the number of interacting particles} for a fixed but integer value of the coupling constant. The emerging structure of a grid of intertwiners exists only in the algebraically integrable situation (integer coupling) and allows one to obtain each Liouville charge from the free power sum in the particle momenta by iterated intertwining either horizontally or vertically. We present recursion formul\ae\ for the intertwiners as a factorization problem for partial differential operators and prove their existence for small values of particle number and coupling. As a byproduct, a new basis of non-symmetric Liouville integrals appears, algebraically related to the standard symmetric one.</description>

Abstract: We consider unitary cocycle deformations of covariant $\ast$-differential calculi. We prove that complex structures, holomorphic bimodules and Chern connections can be deformed to their noncommutative counterparts under such deformations. If we start with a K\"ahler manifold, then the Levi-Civita connection on the space of one forms of the deformed calculus can be expressed as a direct sum of the Chern connections on the twisted holomorphic and the anti-holomorphic bimodules. Our class of examples include toric deformations considered by Mesland and Rennie as well as cocycle deformations of the Heckenberger-Kolb calculi.</description>

Abstract: We investigate non-local conserved charges in perturbed two-dimensional conformal field theories from the point of view of the 3d SymTFT of the unperturbed theory. In the SymTFT we state a simple commutation condition which results in a pair of compatible bulk and defect perturbations, such that the perturbed line defects are conserved in the perturbed CFT. In other words, the perturbed defects are rigidly translation invariant, and such defects form a monoidal category which extends the topological symmetries. As examples we study the A-type Virasoro minimal models $M(p,q)$. Our formalism provides one-parameter families of commuting non-local conserved charges for perturbations by a primary bulk field with Kac label $(1,2)$, $(1,3)$, or $(1,5)$, which are the standard integrable perturbations of minimal models. We find solutions to the commutation condition also for other bulk perturbations, such as $(1,7)$, and we contrast this with the existence of local conserved charges. There has been recent interest in the possibility that in certain cases perturbations by fields such as $(1,7)$ can be integrable, and our construction provides a new way in which integrability can be found without the need for local conserved charges.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the properties of the sequence of coefficients $(\b_n)_{n\geq0}$ in the recurrence relation satisfied by the sequence of monic symmetric polynomials, orthogonal with respect to the symmetric sextic Freud weight \[ \omega(x; \tau, t) = \exp(-x^6 + \tau x^4 + t x^2), \qquad x \in \Real, \] with real parameters $\tau$ and $t$. We derive a fourth-order nonlinear discrete equation satisfied by $\beta_n$, which is shown to be a special case of {the second} member of the discrete Painlev\'{e} I hierarchy. Further, we analyse differential and differential-difference equations satisfied by the recurrence coefficients. The emphasis is to offer a comprehensive study of the intricate evolution in the behaviour of these recurrence coefficients as the pair of parameters $(\tau,t)$ change. A comprehensive numerical and computational analysis is carried out for critical parameter ranges, and graphical plots are presented to illustrate the behaviour of the recurrence coefficients as well as the complexity of the associated Volterra lattice hierarchy. The corresponding symmetric sextic Freud polynomials are shown to satisfy a second-order differential equation with rational coefficients. The moments of the weight are examined in detail, including their integral representations, differential equations, and recursive structure. Closed-form expressions for moments are obtained in several special cases, and asymptotic expansions for the recurrence coefficients are provided. The results highlight rich algebraic and analytic structures underlying the symmetric sextic Freud weight and its connections to integrable systems.</description>
