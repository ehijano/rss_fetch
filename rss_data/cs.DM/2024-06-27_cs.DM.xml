      <title>Symmetric Splendor: Unraveling Universally Closest Refinements and Fisher Market Equilibrium through Density-Friendly Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive framework that unifies several research areas within the context of vertex-weighted bipartite graphs, providing deeper insights and improved solutions. The fundamental solution concept for each problem involves refinement, where vertex weights on one side are distributed among incident edges. The primary objective is to identify a refinement pair with specific optimality conditions that can be verified locally. This framework connects existing and new problems that are traditionally studied in different contexts.
  We explore three main problems: (1) density-friendly hypergraph decomposition, (2) universally closest distribution refinements problem, and (3) symmetric Fisher Market equilibrium.
  Our framework presents a symmetric view of density-friendly hypergraph decomposition, wherein hyperedges and nodes play symmetric roles. This symmetric decomposition serves as a tool for deriving precise characterizations of optimal solutions for other problems and enables the application of algorithms from one problem to another.</description>

      <title>The Repetition Threshold for Rote Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider Rote words, which are infinite binary words with factor complexity $2n$. We prove that the repetition threshold for this class is $5/2$. Our technique is purely computational, using the Walnut theorem prover and a new technique for generating automata from morphisms due to the first author and his co-authors.</description>

      <title>How to Reduce Temporal Cliques to Find Sparse Spanners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many real-world networks, such as transportation or trade networks, are dynamic in the sense that the edge set may change over time, but these changes are known in advance. This behavior is captured by the temporal graphs model, which has recently become a trending topic in theoretical computer science. A core open problem in the field is to prove the existence of linear-size temporal spanners in temporal cliques, i.e., sparse subgraphs of complete temporal graphs that ensure all-pairs reachability via temporal paths. So far, the best known result is the existence of temporal spanners with $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$ many edges. We present significant progress towards proving that linear-size temporal spanners exist in all temporal cliques.
  We adapt techniques used in previous works and heavily expand and generalize them to provide a simpler and more intuitive proof of the $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$ bound. Moreover, we use our novel approach to show that a large class of temporal cliques, called edge-pivot graphs, admit linear-size temporal spanners. To contrast this, we investigate other classes of temporal cliques that do not belong to the class of edge-pivot graphs. We introduce two such graph classes and we develop novel techniques for establishing the existence of linear temporal spanners in these graph classes as well.</description>
