      <title>Initialization with a Fock State Cavity Mode in Real-Time Nuclear--Electronic Orbital Polariton Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular polaritons have drawn great interest in recent years as a possible avenue for providing optical control over chemical dynamics. A central challenge in the field is to identify physical phenomena that require a quantum rather than a classical treatment of electrodynamics. In this work, we use our recently developed mean-field quantum (mfq) and full-quantum (fq) real-time nuclear--electronic orbital (RT-NEO) time-dependent density functional theory methods to simulate polaritonic dynamics for a molecule under vibrational strong coupling when a quantized cavity mode is initialized in a Fock state rather than a coherent state. Our previous work showed that a coherent state initial condition for the cavity mode leads to polariton formation for both the mfq-RT-NEO and fq-RT-NEO methods. Herein, we show that the mfq-RT-NEO method, which does not allow light--matter entanglement, does not predict polariton formation for a Fock state initial condition. Similar to the mfq-RT-NEO method, the fq-RT-NEO method does not predict oscillations of the cavity mode coordinate and molecular dipole operator expectation values for a Fock state initial condition. However, the fq-RT-NEO method does predict oscillations of the expectation values of even powers of these operators as well as light--matter entanglement, implicating polariton formation with a Fock state initial condition. All these observations can be explained with model systems. These results suggest that using a quantized cavity mode initial condition that does not have a direct analogy to an initial condition in classical electrodynamics can lead to physical phenomena that can only be described by a quantum treatment of the cavity mode.</description>

      <title>Vibrational Quantum-State-Controlled Reactivity in the O2+ + C3H4 Reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum-state-controlled reactivity is a long-standing goal in the field of physical chemistry. In this work, we explore the vibrational-state-dependent behavior of the ion-molecule reaction between O2+ in distinct vibrational states and two isomers of C3H4, allene (H2C3H2) and propyne (H3C3H). While most products are formed regardless of the vibrational state of O2+, the branching ratios are influenced by vibrational excitation, and a new product, C2O+, appears exclusively in the excited-state reactions. This selective formation of C2O+ demonstrates that vibrational excitation can effectively activate a reaction pathway, providing direct evidence of quantum-state control in reactivity. These results represent an important step towards the goal of quantum-state-controlled chemistry in molecular systems.</description>

      <title>A Hardware-Native Realisation of Semi-Empirical Electronic Structure Theory on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-throughput quantum-chemical calculations underpin modern molecular modelling, materials discovery, and machine-learning workflows, yet even semi-empirical methods become restrictive when many molecules must be evaluated. Here we report the first hardware-native realisation of semi-empirical electronic structure theory on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), implementing as a proof of principle Extended H\"uckel Theory (EHT) and non-self-consistent Density Functional Tight Binding (DFTB0). Our design performs Hamiltonian construction and diagonalisation on the FPGA device through a streaming dataflow, enabling deterministic execution without host intervention. On a mid-range Artix-7 FPGA, the DFTB0 Hamiltonian generator delivers a throughput over fourfold higher than that of a contemporary server-class CPU. Improvements in eigensolver design, memory capacity, and extensions to nuclear gradients and excited states could further expand capability. Combined with the inherent energy efficiency of FPGA dataflow, this work opens a pathway towards sustainable, hardware-native acceleration of electronic-structure simulation and direct hardware implementations of a broad class of methods.</description>

      <title>Harmonic-to-anharmonic thermodynamic integration made simple using REG TI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard harmonic-to-anharmonic thermodynamic integration (TI) is known to develop a near singularity in the integrand for solids exhibiting diffusive degrees of freedom, such as rotating functional groups or migrating defects. This pathology results in numerical challenges for estimating absolute free energies within a single thermodynamic cycle. In this work, we introduce a simple regularization that removes this singularity and yields a well-behaved integrand that can be accurately evaluated on a uniform grid. The approach -- termed Regularized End-point Gradient (REG) TI -- is demonstrated on a model system and on predicting the relative stability of paracetamol polymorphs for which quasi-free methyl rotations lead to a near singularity in standard TI. We expect REG TI to simplify anharmonic free energy calculations for solids and to potentially enable their automation.</description>

      <title>Quantum Spin-1/2 Rings Built from [2]Triangulene Molecular Units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum spin rings represent fundamental model systems that exhibit distinctive quantum phenomena-such as quantum critical behavior and quasiparticle excitations-arising from their periodic boundary conditions and enhanced quantum fluctuations. Here, we report the on-surface synthesis and atomic-scale characterization of antiferromagnetic S=1/2 quantum spin rings composed of pristine and unmodified [2]triangulene units on a Au(111) surface. Using stepwise on-surface synthesis followed by STM tip-induced dehydrogenation, we precisely constructed cyclic five- and six-membered spin rings and investigated their spin states via scanning probe microscopy and multireference calculations. Nc-AFM imaging reveals that the six-membered ring retains a planar geometry, whereas the five-membered ring exhibits pronounced structural distortion. The six-membered ring hosts a uniform excitation gap that can be accurately described by a Heisenberg spin model and multireference CASCI calculations. In contrast, the distorted five-membered ring displays spin ground states with asymmetric spatial distributions due to degeneracy lifting induced by structural distortion. Our findings establish a versatile molecular platform for exploring correlated magnetism and quantum spin phenomena in cyclic organic magnetic architectures with disorder.</description>

      <title>Rapid Dissipative Ground State Preparation at Chemical Transition States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating chemical reactions is a central challenge in computational chemistry, characterized by an uneven difficulty profile: while equilibrium reactant and product geometries are often classically tractable, intermediate transition states frequently exhibit strong correlation that defies standard approximations. We present a protocol for dissipative ground state preparation that exploits this structure by treating the reaction path itself as a computational primitive. Our protocol uses an approach where a state prepared at a tractable geometry is propagated along a discretized reaction coordinate using Procrustes-aligned orbital rotations and stabilized by engineered dissipative cooling. We show that for reaction paths satisfying a localized Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) drift condition in the strongly correlated regime, the algorithm prepares ground states of chemical systems with $N_o$ orbitals to an energy error $\epsilon_E$ with a total gate complexity scaling as $\widetilde{O}(N_o^{3}/\epsilon_E)$. We provide logical resource estimates for benchmark systems including FeMoco, Cytochrome P450, and Ru-based carbon capture catalysts.</description>

      <title>ArGEnT: Arbitrary Geometry-encoded Transformer for Operator Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning solution operators for systems with complex, varying geometries and parametric physical settings is a central challenge in scientific machine learning. In many-query regimes such as design optimization, control and inverse problems, surrogate modeling must generalize across geometries while allowing flexible evaluation at arbitrary spatial locations. In this work, we propose Arbitrary Geometry-encoded Transformer (ArGEnT), a geometry-aware attention-based architecture for operator learning on arbitrary domains. ArGEnT employs Transformer attention mechanisms to encode geometric information directly from point-cloud representations with three variants-self-attention, cross-attention, and hybrid-attention-that incorporates different strategies for incorporating geometric features. By integrating ArGEnT into DeepONet as the trunk network, we develop a surrogate modeling framework capable of learning operator mappings that depend on both geometric and non-geometric inputs without the need to explicitly parametrize geometry as a branch network input. Evaluation on benchmark problems spanning fluid dynamics, solid mechanics and electrochemical systems, we demonstrate significantly improved prediction accuracy and generalization performance compared with the standard DeepONet and other existing geometry-aware saurrogates. In particular, the cross-attention transformer variant enables accurate geometry-conditioned predictions with reduced reliance on signed distance functions. By combining flexible geometry encoding with operator-learning capabilities, ArGEnT provides a scalable surrogate modeling framework for optimization, uncertainty quantification, and data-driven modeling of complex physical systems.</description>

      <title>Experimental challenges and prospects for quantum-enhanced energy conversion: Stationary Fano coherence in V-type qutrits interacting with polarized incoherent radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum coherence offers potential for energy conversion technologies. It influences light absorption and emission, affecting energy conversion limits and efficiency. As a result, quantum coherence is being harnessed to boost performance in quantum heat engines, photocells, and photosynthetic-inspired platforms. Of particular interest in this context is the generation of Fano coherences, i.e., the formation of quantum coherences due to the interaction with the continuum of modes characterizing an incoherent process. We aim to formalize mathematically the possibility of achieving steady-state Fano coherence in a V-type three-level quantum system using polarized incoherent radiation, without requiring the energy difference between the excited levels to tend to zero. We perform this analysis by deriving the Bloch-Redfield equation from first-principles by quantizing the incoherent radiation. The resulting reduced dynamics of the system are analysed, so as to determine the lifetime of Fano coherence and identify the conditions under which it becomes stationary. We characterise distinct dynamical regimes, ranging from weak to strong pumping, in which steady-state Fano coherence emerges, and we quantitatively determine its magnitude. For each regime, we analyse the generation of Fano coherence as a function of both the intensity of the incoherent pumping and the energy splitting between the excited levels. We also assess how obtaining Fano coherence is modified by symmetric or asymmetric decay rates. These findings indicate that a three-level quantum system driven by polarized incoherent light can act as a robust resource for coherence-assisted energy conversion and storage. Finally, we discuss the experimental challenges associated with the implementation of the proposed model using an ensemble of Rubidium atoms.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Stability and Hydrogen Bonds in Mixed Halide Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stability of mixed halide perovskites against phase separation is crucial for their optoelectronic applications, yet difficult to rationalize due to the interplay of enthalpic, configurational, and dynamical effects. Here we present a simple thermodynamic framework for multicomponent halide perovskites of composition FA$_{1-x}$MA$_{x-y}$Cs$_y$Pb(I$_{1-z}$Br$_z$)$_3$, based on \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics. By decomposing the free energy of mixing into enthalpic, configurational, and rotational entropic contributions, we show that although the enthalpy of mixing is generally positive, the solid solutions are thermodynamically stable against phase separation due to the large configurational entropy associated with random substitution on cation and halide sublattices. Mixing reduces the rotational entropy of the organic cations, partially offsetting the configurational stabilization. However, within our model, this rotational penalty is not sufficient to overcome the configurational driving force, and a curvature analysis within a regular-solution model does not predict a miscibility gap for any of the mixing channels considered. Analysis of hydrogen-bond dynamics shows that MA--Y (Y = I, Br) interactions are more persistent than FA--Y interactions, while the dominant FA-donated N$-$H$\cdots$I hydrogen bonds remain nearly composition-invariant. Cs-containing mixtures, in which Cs$^{+}$ forms no hydrogen bonds, can nevertheless be thermodynamically stable. These results demonstrate that hydrogen bonding does not control thermodynamic stability in mixed halide perovskites. Instead, phase stability is governed by the balance between strong configurational entropy and a smaller, systematically destabilizing rotational-entropy correction.</description>

      <title>Markov State Models for Tracking Reaction Dynamics on Catalytic Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Markov state models (MSMs) are a powerful tool to analyze and coarse-grain complex dynamical data into interpretable kinetic processes. This capability is particularly important in heterogeneous catalysis, where a medley of reactants and intermediates interact on surfaces that might simultaneously experience structural fluctuations. For these very complex systems, standard transition state theory (TST) approaches are no longer appropriate, motivating alternative approaches that can retain dynamical complexity while providing physical insight. With machine learned interatomic potentials being more and more ubiquitous, directly simulating complex catalytic systems with molecular dynamics (MD) is becoming increasingly feasible. Extending MSMs to dynamically coarse grain MD simulation data of catalytic processes, we analyze hydrogen dynamics on rhodium catalysts with slab and nanoparticle geometries over a range of hydrogen surface concentrations. Somewhat counterintuitively, nanoparticle features, such as corners and edges, effectively slow down the association/dissociation process, and the cooperative behavior of hydrogen-hydrogen interactions leads to a non-monotonic concentration dependence of the rates, which would not be predicted with standard TST.</description>

      <title>A critical assessment of bonding descriptors for predicting materials properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most machine learning models for materials science rely on descriptors based on materials compositions and structures, even though the chemical bond has been proven to be a valuable concept for predicting materials properties. Over the years, various theoretical frameworks have been developed to characterize bonding in solid-state materials. However, integrating bonding information from these frameworks into machine learning pipelines at scale has been limited by the lack of a systematically generated and validated database. Recent advances in high-throughput bonding analysis workflows have addressed this issue, and our previously computed Quantum-Chemical Bonding Database for Solid-State Materials was extended to include approximately 13,000 materials. This database is then used to derive a new set of quantum-chemical bonding descriptors. A systematic assessment is performed using statistical significance tests to evaluate how the inclusion of these descriptors influences the performance of machine-learning models that otherwise rely solely on structure- and composition-derived features. Models are built to predict elastic, vibrational, and thermodynamic properties typically associated with chemical bonding in materials. The results demonstrate that incorporating quantum-chemical bonding descriptors not only improves predictive performance but also helps identify intuitive expressions for properties such as the projected force constant and lattice thermal conductivity via symbolic regression.</description>

      <title>Stoichiometrically-informed symbolic regression for extracting chemical reaction mechanisms from data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A data-driven computational method is introduced to extract chemical reaction mechanisms from time series chemical concentration data. It is realized through the use of dynamic symbolic regression in which a sparse analytical form for a dynamical system is discoverable from the underlying data. We specifically develop the stoichiometrically-informed symbolic regression (SISR) method to address a standing challenge in complex chemical reaction networks: Given a time-series dataset of concentrations of several components, what is the mechanism and the associated rate constants? SISR finds the optimal mechanism, kinetic equations and rate constants by combining differential optimization with a genetic optimization approach that searches a symbolic space of possible reaction mechanisms. Use of SISR in several paradigmatic examples spanning linear and nonlinear reaction schemes results in excellent agreement between true and predicted mechanisms, including when the method is applied to noisy data. The advantages of a stoichiometrically-informed approach such as SISR to address reaction discovery is illustrated through comparison with the use of generic state-of-the-art data-driven approaches.</description>

      <title>Extension of the CIPSI-Driven CC($P$;$Q$) Approach to Excited Electronic States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the CIPSI-driven CC($P$;$Q$) methodology [K. Gururangan et al., J. Chem. Phys. 155 (2021) 174114], in which the leading higher-than-doubly excited determinants are identified using the selected configuration interaction (CI) approach abbreviated as CIPSI, to excited electronic states via the equation-of-motion (EOM) coupled-cluster (CC) formalism. By examining vertical excitations in CH+ at equilibrium and stretched geometries, adiabatic excitations in CH, and ground- and excited-state potential cuts of water, we demonstrate that the CIPSI-driven CC($P$;$Q$) method converges parent CC/EOMCC singles, doubles, and triples energetics from relatively inexpensive Hamiltonian diagonalizations in CI spaces smaller than the corresponding triples manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a generalized extension of the recently developed electron/hole-transfer Dynamically-weighted State-Averaged Constrained CASSCF (eDSC/hDSC) method to model charge transfer in the presence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) for systems containing an odd number of electrons. Our approach incorporates complex-valued spinor orbitals and incorporates four electronic configurations in describing ground-excited state curve crossings between Kramers-restricted doublet states. The method achieves smooth potential energy surfaces and rapid self-consistent field (SCF) convergence across a wide range of spin-orbit coupling strengths, providing an efficient framework for investigating charge transfer processes in the presence of nontrivial spin degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Charge Transfer with a Spin. II: A Framework for Diabatization which Localizes Charge and Spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a diabatization procedure that localizes charges (in real space) and localizes spins (in spin space) for open-shell systems that exhibit charge transfer in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. The procedure is applied to a two-state crossing between pairs of Kramers-restricted doublet states (which can also be considered effectively a four-state crossing). To generate the relevant electronic states, we employ the recently developed electron/hole-transfer Dynamically-weighted State-Averaged Constrained CASSCF (eDSC/hDSC) method that treats systems with an odd number of electrons. To generate the relevant diabatic states, we employ a two-step optimization over complex-unitary rotations that sequentially maximizes dipole and spin moments through iterative Jacobi sweeps; the resulting update rules are effectively equivalent to those of approximate joint diagonalization (AJD) applied to charge and spin. The method converges rapidly and yields smooth diabatic potential energy surfaces that preserve dipole and spin properties (e.g., a slowly varying pseudospin texture) along the reaction coordinate while maintaining time-reversal symmetry.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic Spin-Orbit Interaction through Strong-Field Pumping of Inhomogeneously Aligned Molecular Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the strong-field interaction of a helical bi-chromatic pump with an anisotropic and inhomogeneous molecular system in the form of planar distribution of radially aligned molecular ensemble. This setting gives rise to macroscopic spin-orbit interaction where High Harmonic radiation is emitted while imbued with Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM) whose sign is directly dictated by the helicity of the pump field. We demonstrate this phenomenon in ensembles of $H_2^+$ and $N_2$ molecules with Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TDDFT) simulations.</description>

      <title>Magnetic dipole-dipole transition for scintillation quenching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11361v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A magnetic dipole-dipole interaction is proposed as a scintillation quenching mechanism. The interaction rate follows $R^{-6}$ as the electric dipole-dipole interaction in F$\mathrm{\ddot{o}}$ster resonance energy transfer theory. The proposed mechanism causes a long-range resonance energy transfer, and the resonance condition is that the spins of donor and acceptor electrons both flip, and the energy level differences are the same. The new mechanism is distinct to the known spin-orbit coupling induced intersystem crossing, and it can enhance the overall intersystem crossing rate. When oxygen or organic molecules including heavy elements are dissolved in a liquid scintillator, these requirements are possible to be satisfied. The proposal in the paper adds a new approach for scintillation quenching in liquid scintillators.</description>

      <title>Transition Metal Dichalcogenide MoS${}_2$: oxygen and fluorine functionalization for selective plasma processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-temperature plasma processing is a promising technique for tailoring the properties of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) because it allows for precise control of radical and ion energies and fluxes. For chalcogen substitution, a key challenge is to identify the ion energy window that enables selective chalcogen removal while preserving the metal lattice. Using ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD), we demonstrate that oxygen and fluorine functionalization through thermal chemisorption significantly lowers the sputtering energy threshold ($E_{sputt}$) of MoS${}_2$ from $\sim 35$ eV to $\sim 10$ eV. In addition, we find that a non-orthogonal impact angle $\sim 30{}^{\circ}$ reduces the sputtering energy threshold, while cryogenic-range TMD temperatures may increase. To explain the observed trends, a multi-step sputtering mechanism is proposed. Our results show that oxygen/fluorine functionalization, impact angle, and material temperature are key control parameters for selective, damage-free chalcogen removal in TMD processing.</description>
