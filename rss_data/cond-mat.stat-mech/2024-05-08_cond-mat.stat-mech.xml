      <title>Hyperuniformity Classes of Quasiperiodic Tilings via Diffusion Spreadability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperuniform point patterns can be classified by the hyperuniformity scaling exponent $\alpha &gt; 0$, that characterizes the power-law scaling behavior of the structure factor $S(\mathbf{k})$ as a function of wavenumber $k\equiv|\mathbf{k}|$ in the vicinity of the origin, e.g., $S(\mathbf{k})\sim|\mathbf{k}|^{\alpha}$ in cases where $S(\mathbf{k})$ varies continuously with $k$ as $k\rightarrow0$. In this paper, we show that the spreadability is an effective method for determining $\alpha$ for quasiperiodic systems where $S(\mathbf{k})$ is discontinuous and consists of a dense set of Bragg peaks. We first transform quasiperiodic and limit-periodic point patterns into two-phase media by mapping them onto packings of identical nonoverlapping disks, where space interior to the disks represents one phase and the space in exterior to them represents the second phase. We then compute the spectral density of the packings, and finally compute and fit the long-time behavior of their excess spreadabilities. Specifically, we show that the excess spreadability can be used to accurately extract $\alpha$ for the 1D limit-periodic period doubling chain and the 1D quasicrystalline Fibonacci chain to within $0.02\%$ of the analytically known exact results. Moreover, we obtain a value of $\alpha = 5.97\pm0.06$ for the 2D Penrose tiling, which had not been computed previously. We also show that one can truncate the small-$k$ region of the scattering information used to compute the spreadability and still obtain an accurate value of $\alpha$. The methods described here offer a simple way to characterize the large-scale translational order present in quasicrystalline and limit-periodic media in any space dimension that are self-similar. Moreover, the scattering information extracted from these two-phase media encoded in the spectral density can be used to estimate their physical properties. (abridged)</description>

      <title>Fractional Brownian motion with fluctuating diffusivities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the success of fractional Brownian motion (fBm) in modeling systems that exhibit anomalous diffusion due to temporal correlations, recent experimental and theoretical studies highlight the necessity for a more comprehensive approach of a generalization that incorporates heterogeneities in either the tracers or the environment. This work presents a modification of Levy's representation of fBm for the case in which the generalized diffusion coefficient is a stochastic process. We derive analytical expressions for the autocovariance function and both ensemble- and time-averaged mean squared displacements. Further, we validate the efficacy of the developed framework in two-state systems, comparing analytical asymptotic expressions with numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Kinetic Monte Carlo Algorithms for Time-dependent Processes: from open-loop control to feedback control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating stochastic systems with feedback control is challenging due to the complex interplay between the system's dynamics and the feedback-dependent control protocols. We present a single-step-trajectory probability analysis to time-dependent stochastic systems. Based on this analysis, we revisit several time-dependent kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) algorithms designed for systems under open-loop-control protocols. Our analysis provides an unified alternative proof to these algorithms, summarized into a pedagogical tutorial. Moreover, with the trajectory probability analysis, we present a novel feedback-controlled KMC algorithm that accurately captures the dynamics systems controlled by external signal based on measurements of the system's state. Our method correctly captures the system dynamics and avoids the artificial Zeno effect that arises from incorrectly applying the direct Gillespie algorithm to feedback-controlled systems. This work provides a unified perspective on existing open-loop-control KMC algorithms and also offers a powerful and accurate tool for simulating stochastic systems with feedback control.</description>

      <title>Nonperturbative thermodynamic extrinsic curvature of the anyon gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermodynamic extrinsic curvature is a new mathematical tool in thermodynamic geometry. By using the thermodynamic extrinsic curvature, one may obtain a more complete geometric representation of the critical phenomena and thermodynamics. We introduce nonperturbative thermodynamic extrinsic curvature of an ideal two dimensional gas of anyons. Using extrinsic curvature, we find new fixed points in nonperturbative thermodynamics of the anyon gas that particles behave as semions. Here, we investigate the critical behavior of thermodynamic extrinsic curvature of two-dimensional Kagome Ising model near the critical point $ \beta_{c} =({{k_{B} T_{c}}})^{-1}$ in a constant magnetic field and show that it behaves as $ \left| {\beta- \beta_{c} } \right|^{\alpha} $ with $ \alpha=0 $, where $ \alpha $ denotes the critical exponent of the specific heat. Then, we consider the three dimensional spherical model and show that the scaling behavior is $ \left| {\beta- \beta_{c} } \right|^{\alpha} $ , where $ \alpha =-1 $. Finally, using a general argument, we show that extrinsic curvature $ K $ have two different scaling behaviors for positive and negative $ \alpha $. For $\alpha&gt; 0$, our results indicate that $ K \sim \left|{\beta- \beta_{c} } \right|^{{\frac{1}{2}} (\alpha-2)} $. However, for $ \alpha &lt;0$, we found a different scaling behavior, where $ K\sim \left| {\beta- \beta_{c} } \right|^{\alpha} $.</description>

      <title>Exact calculation of the probabilities of rare events in cluster-cluster aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an action formalism to calculate probabilities of rare events in cluster-cluster aggregation for arbitrary collision kernels and establish a pathwise large deviation principle with total mass being the rate. As an application, the rate function for the number of surviving particles as well as the optimal evolution trajectory are calculated exactly for the constant, sum and product kernels. For the product kernel, we argue that the second derivative of the rate function has a discontinuity. The theoretical results agree with simulations tailored to the calculation of rare events.</description>

      <title>Interplay between short-range and critical long-range fluctuations in the out-of-equilibrium behavior of the particle density at quantum transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium behavior of the particle density in many-body systems undergoing quantum transitions driven by the chemical potential $\mu$. They originate from a nontrivial interplay between noncritical short-range and critical long-range quantum fluctuations. As a paradigmatic model we consider the one-dimensional fermionic Kitaev chain, for which very accurate numerical checks of our scaling ansatz can be performed up to $O(10^4)$ sites. The search for dynamic scaling behaviors of the particle density is complicated by the fact that its equilibrium (ground state) behavior is dominated by short-range fluctuations, giving rise to regular background terms and peculiar logarithmic terms from resonances between renormalization-group perturbations associated with the energy and identity operator families within the conformal field theory. To study these issues, we focus on two dynamic protocols, either instantaneous quenches or quasi-adiabatic changes of $\mu$ to the critical value $\mu_c$, unveiling out-of-equilibrium scaling behaviors of the particle density, which arise from the critical modes, within a dynamic finite-size scaling framework.</description>

      <title>Limits to positional information in boundary-driven systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemical gradients can be used by a particle to determine its position. This \textit{positional information} is of crucial importance, for example in developmental biology in the formation of patterns in an embryo. The central goal of this paper is to study the fundamental physical limits on how much positional information can be stored inside a system. To achieve this, we study positional information for general boundary-driven systems, and derive, in the near-equilibrium regime, a universal expression involving only the chemical potential and density gradients of the system. We also conjecture that this expression serves as an upper bound on the positional information of boundary driven systems beyond linear response. To support this claim, we test it on a broad range of solvable boundary-driven systems.</description>

      <title>Multiple crossing during dynamical symmetry restoration and implications for the quantum Mpemba effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local relaxation after a quench in 1-D quantum many-body systems is a well known and very active problem with rich phenomenology. Except for pathological cases, the local relaxation is accompanied by the local restoration of the symmetries broken by the initial state that are preserved by the unitary evolution. Recently, the entanglement asymmetry has been introduced as a probe to study the interplay between symmetry breaking and relaxation in an extended quantum system. In particular, using the asymmetry, it has been shown that the more a symmetry is initially broken, the faster it may be restored. This surprising effect, which has been also observed in trapped-ion experiments, can be seen as a quantum version of the Mpemba effect and is manifested by the crossing at a finite time of the entanglement asymmetry curves of two different initial symmetry breaking configurations. In this paper we show, how, by tuning the initial state, the symmetry dynamics in free fermionic systems can display much richer behaviour than seen previously. In particular, for certain classes of initial states, including ground states of free fermionic models with long-range couplings, the entanglement asymmetry can exhibit multiple crossings. This illustrates that the existence of the quantum Mpemba effect can only be inferred by examining the late time behaviour of the entanglement asymmetry.</description>

      <title>Mitigating errors in logical qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum error correcting codes protect quantum information, allowing for large quantum computations provided that physical error rates are sufficiently low. We combine post-selection with surface code error correction through the use of a parameterized family of exclusive decoders, which are able to abort on decoding instances that are deemed too difficult. We develop new numerical sampling methods to quantify logical failure rates with exclusive decoders as well as the trade-off in terms of the amount of post-selection required. For the most discriminating of exclusive decoders, we demonstrate a threshold of 50\% under depolarizing noise for the surface code (or $32(1)\%$ for the fault-tolerant case with phenomenological measurement errors), and up to a quadratic improvement in logical failure rates below threshold. Furthermore, surprisingly, with a modest exclusion criterion, we identify a regime at low error rates where the exclusion rate decays with code distance, providing a pathway for scalable and time-efficient quantum computing with post-selection. We apply our exclusive decoder to the 15-to-1 magic state distillation protocol, and report a $75\%$ reduction in the number of physical qubits required, and a $60\%$ reduction in the total spacetime volume required, including accounting for repetitions required for post-selection. We also consider other applications, as an error mitigation technique, and in concatenated schemes. Our work highlights the importance of post-selection as a powerful tool in quantum error correction.</description>

      <title>Bipartite OTOC in open quantum systems: information scrambling and irreversibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The field of information scrambling has seen significant growth over the last decade, where the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) has emerged as a prominent tool to probe it. In this work, we use bipartite OTOC, a particular form of OTOC, to study information scrambling in the atom-field interaction models and the model of the Ising spin chain interacting with a tilted magnetic field. This is done considering the effects of open quantum systems. A relationship between information scrambling, using bipartite OTOC, and irreversibility, using entropy production, is probed under unitary dynamics. The equivalence of bipartite OTOC with operator entanglement is explicitly shown for the Ising model.</description>

      <title>Generalized Langevin dynamics for single beads in linear elastic network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive generalized Langevin equations (GLEs) for single beads in linear elastic networks. In particular, the derivations of the GLEs are conducted without employing normal modes, resulting in two distinct representations in terms of resistance and mobility kernels. The fluctuation-dissipation relations are also confirmed for both GLEs. Subsequently, we demonstrate that these two representations are interconnected via Laplace transforms. Furthermore, another GLE is derived by utilizing a projection operator method, and it is shown that the equation obtained through the projection scheme is consistent with the GLE with the resistance kernel. Finally, as the simplest example, the present framework is applied to the Rouse model, and the GLEs with the resistance and mobility kernels are explicitly derived for arbitrary positions of the tagged bead in the Rouse chain.</description>

      <title>Maxwell relation between entropy and atom-atom pair correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For many-particle systems with short range interactions the local (same point) particle-particle pair correlation function represents a thermodynamic quantity that can be calculated using the Hellmann-Feynman theorem. Here we exploit this property to derive a thermodynamic Maxwell relation between the local pair correlation and the entropy of an ultracold Bose gas in one dimension (1D). To demonstrate the utility of this Maxwell relation, we apply it to the computational formalism of the stochastic projected Gross-Pitaevski equation (SPGPE) to determine the entropy of a finite-temperature 1D Bose gas from its atom-atom pair correlation function. Such a correlation function is easy to compute numerically within the SPGPE and other formalisms, which is unlike computing the entropy itself. Our calculations can be viewed as a numerical experiment that serves as a proof-of-principle demonstration of an experimental method to deduce the entropy of a quantum gas from the measured atom-atom correlations.</description>

      <title>Third density and acoustic virial coefficients of helium isotopologues from ab initio calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Improved two-body and three-body potentials for helium have been used to calculate from first principles the third density and acoustic virial coefficients for both $^4$He and $^3$He. For the third density virial coefficient $C(T)$, uncertainties have been reduced by a factor of 4--5 compared to the previous state of the art; the accuracy of first-principles $C(T)$ now exceeds that of the best experiments by more than two orders of magnitude. The range of calculations has been extended to temperatures as low as 0.5~K. For the third acoustic virial coefficient $\gamma_a(T)$, we applied the Schlessinger Point Method, which can calculate $\gamma_a$ and its uncertainty based on the $C(T)$ data, overcoming some limitations of direct path-integral calculation. The resulting $\gamma_a$ are calculated at temperatures down to 0.5~K; they are consistent with available experimental data but have much smaller uncertainties. The first-principles data presented here will enable improvement of primary temperature and pressure metrology based on gas properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the emptiness formation probability (EFP) in the six-vertex model with domain wall boundary conditions. We present a conjecture according to which at the ice point, i.e., when all the Boltzmann weights are equal, the known multiple integral representation (MIR) for the EFP can be given as a finite-size matrix determinant of Fredholm type. Our conjecture is based on the explicit evaluation of the MIR for particular values of geometric parameters and on two kinds of identities for the boundary correlation function. The obtained representation can be further written as the Fredholm determinant of some linear integral operator. We show that as the geometric parameters of the EFP are tuned to the vicinity of the arctic curve arising in the scaling limit, the conjectured determinant turns into the GUE Tracy--Widom distribution.</description>

      <title>Exact solution of long-range stabilizer R\'enyi entropy in the dual-unitary XXZ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum systems can not be efficiently simulated classically due to the presence of entanglement and nonstabilizerness, also known as quantum magic. Here we study the generation of magic under evolution by a quantum circuit. To be able to provide exact solutions, we focus on the dual-unitary XXZ model and a measure of magic called stabilizer R\'enyi entropy (SRE). Moreover, we focus also on long-range SRE, which cannot be removed by short-depth quantum circuits. To obtain exact solutions we use a ZX-calculus representation and graphical rules for the evaluation of the required expressions. We obtain exact results for SRE after short-time evolution in the thermodynamic limit and for long-range SRE for all times and all R\'enyi parameters for a particular partition of the state. Since the numerical evaluation of these quantities is exponentially costly in the R\'enyi parameter, we verify this numerically for low R\'enyi parameters and accessible system sizes and provide numerical results for the long-range SRE in other bipartitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the recent work of [Michelen, Perkins, Comm. Math. Phys. 399:1 (2023)], a new lower bound of $eC_{\phi}(\beta)^{-1}$ is obtained for the positive activity up to which the pressure of a classical system of particles with repulsive pair interactions is analytic. In this paper, we extend their method to the class of radially symmetric, locally stable, and tempered pair potentials. Our main result is that the pressure of such systems is analytic for positive activities up to $e^{2(1-W(eA_{\phi}(\beta)/C_{\phi}(\beta)))}C_{\phi}(\beta)^{-1}e^{-(\beta C+1)}$, where $C&gt;0$ is the local stability constant, $W(\cdot)$ the Lambert $W$-function, and $A_{\phi}(\beta)$ the contribution from the attractive part of the pair potential to the temperedness constant. In the high-temperature limit, our result improves the classical Penrose-Ruelle bound of $C_{\phi}(\beta)^{-1}e^{-(\beta C+1)}$ by a factor of $e^{2}$. This proves the absence of phase transitions in these systems in the Lee-Yang sense for activities up to the above threshold.</description>

      <title>Competition between self- and other-regarding preferences in resolving social dilemmas</title>

Abstract: Evolutionary game theory assumes that individuals maximize their benefits when choosing strategies. However, an alternative perspective proposes that individuals seek to maximize the benefits of others. To explore the relationship between these perspectives, we develop a model where self- and other-regarding preferences compete in public goods games. We find that other-regarding preferences are more effective in promoting cooperation, even when self-regarding preferences are more productive. Cooperators with different preferences can coexist in a new phase where two classic solutions invade each other, resulting in a dynamical equilibrium. As a consequence, a lower productivity of self-regarding cooperation can provide a higher cooperation level. Our results, which are also valid in a well-mixed population, may explain why other-regarding preferences could be a viable and frequently observed attitude in human society.</description>

Abstract: Close to equilibrium, the excess heat governs the static fluctuations. We study the heat capacity in that McLennan regime, i.e., in linear order around equilibrium, using an expression in terms of the average energy that extends the equilibrium formula in the canonical ensemble. It is derivable from an entropy and it always vanishes at zero temperature. Any violation of an extended Third Law is, therefore, a nonlinear effect.</description>

      <title>Field-Theory of Active Chiral Hard Disks: A First-Principles Approach to Steric Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A first-principles approach for active chiral hard disks is presented, that explicitly accounts for steric interactions on the two-body level. We derive an effective one-body equation for the joint probability distribution of ositions and angles of the particles. By projecting onto the angular modes, we write a hierarchy for the lowest hydrodynamic modes, i.e. particle density, polarisation, and nematic tensor. Introducing dimensionless variables in the equations, we highlight the assumptions, which - though inherent - are often included implicit in typical closure schemes of the hierarchy. By considering different regimes of the P{\'e}clet number, the well-known models in active matter can be obtained through our consideration. Explicitly, we derive an effective diffusive description and by going to higher orders in the closure scheme, we show that this first-principles approach results in the recently introduced Active Model B +, a natural extension of the Model B for active processes. Remarkably, here we find that chirality can change the sign of the phenomenological activity parameters.</description>

      <title>Active particle in one dimension subjected to resetting with memory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of diffusion with preferential returns to places visited in the past has attracted an increased attention in recent years. In these highly non-Markov processes, a standard diffusive particle intermittently resets at a given rate to previously visited positions. At each reset, a position to be revisited is randomly chosen with a probability proportional to the accumulated amount of time spent by the particle at that position. These preferential revisits typically generate a very slow diffusion, logarithmic in time, but still with a Gaussian position distribution at late times. Here we consider an active version of this model, where between resets the particle is self-propelled with constant speed and switches direction in one dimension according to a telegraphic noise. Hence there are two sources of non-Markovianity in the problem. We exactly derive the position distribution in Fourier space, as well as the variance of the position at all times. The crossover from the short-time ballistic regime, dominated by activity, to the large-time anomalous logarithmic growth induced by memory is studied. We also analytically derive a large deviation principle for the position, which exhibits a logarithmic time-scaling instead of the usual algebraic form. Interestingly, at large distances, the large deviations become independent of time and match the non-equilibrium steady state of a particle under resetting to its starting position only.</description>

      <title>No-exclaves percolation on random networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: No-exclaves percolation (NExP) is a nonlocal percolation process in which the components are formed not only by the connected occupied nodes but also by the agglomeration of empty nodes completely surrounded by the occupied nodes. It has been studied in low dimensions, displaying such novel phenomena as the discontinuous transition to complete percolation. However, its characteristics in complex networks are still unexplored. In this paper, we study the NExP on random networks by developing mean-field solutions using the generating function formalism. Our theory allows us to determine the size of the giant no-exclaves component as well as the percolation threshold, which are in excellent agreements with Monte Carlo simulations on random networks and some real-world networks. We show that on random networks NExP exhibits three phases and two transitions between them: the phases are characterized by the presence or absence of not only the giant NExP component but also the giant unoccupied component, which is the giant connected component composed solely of unoccupied nodes. This work offers theoretical understanding on the anatomy of phase transitions in the NExP process.</description>

      <title>Convergence, and lack of convergence, of phase space distributions to microcanonical equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the manner in which classical phase space distribution functions converge to the microcanonical distribution, proving a theorem about their lack of convergence, then generalizing the coarse-graining procedure that leads to convergence. We prove that the time evolution of phase space distributions is an isometry for a broad class of statistical distance metrics, implying that ensembles do not get any closer to (or farther from) equilibrium, according to these metrics. This extends the known result that strong convergence of phase space distributions to the microcanonical distribution does not occur. However, it has long been known that weak convergence can occur, such that coarse-grained distributions--defined by partitioning phase space into a finite number of cells--converge pointwise to the microcanonical distribution. We define a generalization of coarse-graining that removes the need for partitioning phase space into cells. We prove that our generalized coarse-grained distribution converges pointwise to the microcanonical distribution if the dynamics are strong mixing. As an example, we study an ensemble of triangular billiard systems.</description>

      <title>Microscopic origin of twist-dependent electron transfer rate in bilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using molecular simulation and continuum dielectric theory, we consider how electrochemical kinetics are modulated as a function of twist angle in bilayer graphene electrodes. By establishing an effective connection between twist angle and the screening length of charge carriers within the electrode, we investigate how tunable metallicity can result in modified statistics of the electron transfer energy gap. Constant potential molecular simulations show that the activation free energy for electron transfer is an increasing function of the screening length, or decreasing function the density of states at the Fermi energy in the electrode, and subsequently a non-monotonic function of twist angle. We find the twist angle alters the density of states, which tunes the number of thermally-accessible channels for electron transfer, as well as the reorganization energy by altering the stability of the vertically excited state through attenuated image charge interactions. Understanding these effects allows us to cast the Marcus rate of interfacial electron transfer as a function of twist angle, in a manner consistent with a growing body of experimental observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider classical, interacting particles coupled to a thermal reservoir and subject to a local, time-varying potential while undergoing hops on a lattice. We impose detailed balance on the hopping rates and map the dynamics to the Fock space Doi representation, from which we derive the Jarzynski and Crooks relations. Here the local potential serves to drive the system far from equilibrium and to provide the work. Next, we utilize the coherent state representation to map the system to a Doi-Peliti field theory and take the continuum limit. We demonstrate that time reversal in this field theory takes the form of a gauge-like transformation which leaves the action invariant up to a generated work term. The time-reversal symmetry leads to a fundamental identity, from which we are able to derive the Jarzynski and Crooks relations, as well as a far-from-equilibrium generalization of the fluctuation-dissipation relation.</description>

      <title>The Role of Pseudo-labels in Self-training Linear Classifiers on High-dimensional Gaussian Mixture Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.07739v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-training (ST) is a simple yet effective semi-supervised learning method. However, why and how ST improves generalization performance by using potentially erroneous pseudo-labels is still not well understood. To deepen the understanding of ST, we derive and analyze a sharp characterization of the behavior of iterative ST when training a linear classifier by minimizing the ridge-regularized convex loss on binary Gaussian mixtures, in the asymptotic limit where input dimension and data size diverge proportionally. The results show that ST improves generalization in different ways depending on the number of iterations. When the number of iterations is small, ST improves generalization performance by fitting the model to relatively reliable pseudo-labels and updating the model parameters by a large amount at each iteration. This suggests that ST works intuitively. On the other hand, with many iterations, ST can gradually improve the direction of the classification plane by updating the model parameters incrementally, using soft labels and small regularization. It is argued that this is because the small update of ST can extract information from the data in an almost noiseless way. However, in the presence of label imbalance, the generalization performance of ST underperforms supervised learning with true labels. To overcome this, two heuristics are proposed to enable ST to achieve nearly compatible performance with supervised learning even with significant label imbalance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.04829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The in-in formalism and its influence functional generalization are widely used to describe the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of unitary and open quantum systems, respectively. In this paper, we build on these techniques to develop an effective theory of a quantum damped harmonic oscillator and use it to study initial state-dependence, decoherence, and thermalization. We first consider a Gaussian initial state and quadratic influence functional and obtain general equations for the Green's functions of the oscillator. We solve the equations in the specific case of time-local dissipation and use the resulting Green's functions to obtain the purity and unequal-time two-point correlations of the oscillator. We find that the dynamics must include a non-vanishing noise term to yield physical results for the purity and that the oscillator decoheres in time such that the late-time density operator is thermal. We show that the frequency spectrum or unequal-time correlations can, however, distinguish between the damped oscillator and an isolated oscillator in thermal equilibrium, and obtain a generalized fluctuation-dissipation relation for the damped oscillator. We briefly consider time-nonlocal dissipation as well, to show that the fluctuation-dissipation relation is satisfied for a specific choice of dissipation kernels. Lastly, we develop a double in-out path integral approach to go beyond Gaussian initial states and show that our equal-time results for time-local dissipation are in fact non-perturbative in the initial state.</description>

Abstract: Time-translation symmetry breaking is a mechanism for the emergence of non-stationary many-body phases, so-called time-crystals, in Markovian open quantum systems. Dynamical aspects of time-crystals have been extensively explored over the recent years. However, much less is known about their thermodynamic properties, also due to the intrinsic nonequilibrium nature of these phases. Here, we consider the paradigmatic boundary time-crystal system, in a finite-temperature environment, and demonstrate the persistence of the time-crystalline phase at any temperature. Furthermore, we analyze thermodynamic aspects of the model investigating, in particular, heat currents, power exchange and irreversible entropy production. Our work sheds light on the thermodynamic cost of sustaining nonequilibrium time-crystalline phases and provides a framework for characterizing time-crystals as possible resources for, e.g., quantum sensing. Our results may be verified in experiments, for example with trapped ions or superconducting circuits, since we connect thermodynamic quantities with mean value and covariance of collective (magnetization) operators.</description>

Abstract: We consider adiabatic quantum pumping through a resonant level model, a single-level quantum dot connected to two fermionic leads. Using the tools of adiabatic expansion, we develop a consistent thermodynamic description of this model accounting for the variation of the energy level of the dot and the tunnelling rates with the thermal baths. This enables us to study various examples of pumping cycles computing the relevant thermodynamic quantities, such as the entropy produced and the dissipated power. These quantities are compared with the transport properties of the system, i.e. the pumped charge and the charge noise. Among other results, we find that the entropy production rate vanishes in the charge quantization limit while the dissipated power is quantized in the same limit.</description>

Abstract: Detecting recurrent weather patterns and understanding the transitions between such regimes are key to advancing our knowledge on the low-frequency variability of the atmosphere and have important implications in terms of weather and climate-related risks. We adapt an analysis pipeline inspired by Markov State Modelling and detect in an unsupervised manner the dominant winter mid-latitude Northern Hemisphere weather patterns in the Atlantic and Pacific sectors. The daily 500 hPa geopotential height fields are first classified in $\sim 200$ microstates. The weather dynamics is then represented in the basis of these microstates and the slowest decaying modes are identified from the spectral properties of the transition probability matrix. These modes are defined on the basis of the nonlinear dynamical processes of the system and not as tentative metastable states as often done in Markov state analysis. In the Atlantic and Pacific sectors slow relaxation processes are mainly related to transitions between blocked regimes and zonal flow. We also find strong evidence of a dynamical regime associated with the simultaneous Atlantic-Pacific blocking. When the analysis is performed in a broader geographical region of the Atlantic sector, we discover that the slowest relaxation modes of the system are associated with transitions between dynamical regimes that resemble teleconnection patterns like the North Atlantic Oscillation and weather regimes like the Scandinavian and Greenland blocking, yet have a much stronger dynamical foundation than classical methods based e.g. on EOF analysis. Our method clarifies that, as a result of the lack of a time-scale separation in the atmospheric variability of the mid-latitudes, there is no clear-cut way to represent the atmospheric dynamics in terms of few, well-defined modes of variability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss how quantum jumps affect localized regimes in driven-dissipative disordered many-body systems featuring a localization transition. We introduce a deformation of the Lindblad master equation that interpolates between the standard Lindblad and the no-jump non-Hermitian dynamics of open quantum systems. As a platform, we use a disordered chain of hard-core bosons with nearest-neighbor interactions and subject to incoherent drive and dissipation at alternate sites. We probe both the statistics of complex eigenvalues of the deformed Liouvillian and dynamical observables of physical relevance. We show that reducing the number of quantum jumps, achievable through realistic postselection protocols, can promote the emergence of the localized phase. Our findings are based on exact diagonalization and time-dependent matrix-product states techniques.</description>

      <title>Phase space path integral approach to the kinetics of black hole phase transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02260v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ the approach of path integral in the phase space to study the kinetics of state switching associated with black hole phase transitions. Under the assumption that the state switching process of the black hole is described by the stochastic Langevin equation based on the free energy landscape, we derived the Martin-Siggia-Rose-Janssen-de Dominicis (MSRJD) functional and obtained the path integral expression of the transition probability. The MSRJD functional inherently represents the path integral in the phase space, allowing us to extract the effective Hamiltonian for the dynamics of state switching process. By solving the Hamiltonian equations of motion, we obtain the kinetic path in the phase space using an example of the RNAdS black hole. Furthermore, the dominant kinetic path within the configuration space is calculated. We also discuss the kinetic rate by using the functional formalism. Finally, we examine two further examples: Hawking-Page phase transition and Gauss-Bonnet black hole phase transition at the triple point. Our analysis demonstrates that, concerning the Hawking-Page phase transition, while a dominant kinetic path in the phase space from the large SAdS black hole to the thermal AdS space is present, there is no kinetic path for the inverse process.

      <title>Gradient Properties of Perturbative Multiscalar RG Flows to Six Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gradient property of the renormalisation group (RG) flow of multiscalar theories is examined perturbatively in $d=4$ and $d=4-\varepsilon$ dimensions. Such theories undergo RG flows in the space of quartic couplings $\lambda^I$. Starting at five loops, the relevant vector field that determines the physical RG flow is not the beta function traditionally computed in a minimal subtraction scheme in dimensional regularisation, but a suitable modification of it, the $B$ function. It is found that up to five loops the $B$ vector field is gradient, i.e. $B^I=G^{IJ}\partial A / \partial\lambda^J$ with $A$ a scalar and $G_{IJ}$ a rank-two symmetric tensor of the couplings. Up to five loops the beta function is also gradient, but it fails to be so at six loops. The conditions under which the $B$ function (and hence the RG flow) is gradient at six loops are specified, but their verification rests on a separate six-loop computation that remains to be performed.</description>

      <title>Phase diagram of the $J_1$-$J_2$ quantum Heisenberg model for arbitrary spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the spin functional renormalization group to investigate the $J_1$-$J_2$ quantum Heisenberg model on a square lattice. By incorporating sum rules associated with the fixed length of the spin operators as well as the nontrivial quantum dynamics implied by the spin algebra, we are able to compute the ground state phase diagram for arbitrary spin $S$, including the quantum paramagnetic phase at strong frustration. Our prediction for the extent of this paramagnetic region for $ S = 1/2 $ agrees well with other approaches that are computationally more expensive. We find that the quantum paramagnetic phase disappears for $ S \gtrsim 5 $ due to the suppression of quantum fluctuations with increasing $S$.</description>

      <title>Typical thermalization of low-entanglement states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18007v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Proving thermalization from the unitary evolution of a closed quantum system is one of the oldest questions that is still nowadays only partially resolved. Several efforts have led to various formulations of what is called the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, which leads to thermalization under certain conditions on the initial states. These conditions, however, are sensitive to the precise formulation of the hypothesis. In this work, we focus on the important case of low entanglement initial states, which are operationally accessible in many natural physical settings, including experimental schemes for testing thermalization and for quantum simulation. We prove thermalization of these states under precise conditions that have operational significance. More specifically, motivated by arguments of unavoidable finite resolution, we define a random energy smoothing on local Hamiltonians that leads to local thermalization when the initial state has low entanglement. Finally we show that such a transformation affects neither the Gibbs state locally nor, under generic smoothness conditions on the spectrum, the short-time dynamics.</description>

      <title>The Overlap Gap Property limits limit swapping in QAOA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06087v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a quantum algorithm designed for Combinatorial Optimization Problem (COP). We show that if a COP with an underlying Erd\"os--R\'enyi hypergraph exhibits the Overlap Gap Property (OGP), then a random regular hypergraph exhibits it as well. Given that Max-$q$-XORSAT on an Erd\"os--R\'enyi hypergraph is known to exhibit the OGP, and since the performance of QAOA for the pure $q$-spin model matches asymptotically for Max-$q$-XORSAT on large-girth regular hypergraph, we show that the average-case value obtained by QAOA for the pure $q$-spin model for even $q\ge 4$ is bounded away from optimality even when the algorithm runs indefinitely. This suggests that a necessary condition for the validity of limit swapping in QAOA is the absence of OGP in a given combinatorial optimization problem. Furthermore, the results suggests that even when sub-optimised, the performance of QAOA on spin glass is equal in performance to classical algorithms in solving the mean field spin glass problem providing further evidence that the conjecture of getting the exact solution under limit swapping for the Sherrington--Kirkpatrick model to be true.</description>

      <title>Quantum entropy couples matter with geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a theory for coupling matter fields with discrete geometry on higher-order networks, i.e. cell complexes. The key idea of the approach is to associate to a higher-order network the quantum entropy of its metric. Specifically we propose an action given by the quantum relative entropy between the metric of the higher-order network and the metric induced by the matter and gauge fields. The induced metric is defined in terms of the topological spinors and the discrete Dirac operators. The topological spinors, defined on nodes, edges and higher-dimensional cells, encode for the matter fields. The discrete Dirac operators act on topological spinors, and depend on the metric of the higher-order network as well as on the gauge fields via a discrete version of the minimal substitution. We derive the coupled dynamical equations for the metric, the matter and the gauge fields, providing an information theory principle to obtain the field theory equations in discrete curved space.</description>

      <title>Stable Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases in Systems with Heralded Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a family of local quantum channels whose steady-states exhibit stable mixed-state symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order. Motivated by recent experimental progress on "erasure conversion" techniques that allow one to identify (\emph{herald}) decoherence processes, we consider open systems with biased erasure noise, which leads to strongly symmetric heralded errors. We utilize this heralding to construct a local correction protocol that effectively confines errors into short-ranged pairs in the steady-state. Using a combination of numerical simulations and mean-field analysis, we show that our protocol stabilizes SPT order against a sufficiently low rate of decoherence. As the rate of heralded noise increases, SPT order is eventually lost through a directed percolation transition. We further find that while introducing unheralded errors destroys SPT order in the limit of long length- and time-scales, the correction protocol is sufficient for ensuring that local SPT order persists, with a correlation length that diverges as $\xi \sim (1-f_e)^{-1/2}$, where $f_e$ is the fraction of errors that are heralded.</description>

      <title>Pinning Disfavors Nucleation in Colloidal Vapor Deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vapor deposition, known for precise structural control, is inevitably influenced by impurities. These impurities, often distinct from the depositing material, can significantly impact material properties, including local structure. Interestingly, the effect of immobilizing some of the depositing particles themselves, which would still preserve local structural symmetry, remains largely unexplored. By introducing a small fraction of pinned sites during colloidal vapor deposition and employing a combination of thermodynamic and kinematic measurements, we demonstrate that pinned sites, termed as "mobility impurities," are disfavored as nucleation centers. Moreover, tuning the mobility of mobile colloids can adjust nucleation likelihood. In later stages of growth, pinning induces mode localization, altering the thin film's vibrational spectrum. Our research thus underscores the potential of strategically incorporating mobility impurities to engineer material properties.</description>
