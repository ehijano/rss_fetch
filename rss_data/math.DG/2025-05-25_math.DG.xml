      <title>Instability of the fundamental group for non-collapsed Ricci-limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct two sequences of closed $4$-dimensional manifolds with non-negative Ricci curvature, diameter bounded from above by $1$, and volume bounded from below by $v&gt;0$, with different fundamental groups but with the same Gromov-Hausdorff limit. This provides a negative answer to the question posed in [J. Pan. Ricci Curvature and Fundamental Groups of Effective Regular Sets. Journal of Mathematical Study, 58(1):3--21, 2025].</description>

      <title>Critical Exponent Rigidity for $\Theta-$positive Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove for a $\Theta-$positive representation from a discrete subgroup $\Gamma\subset \mathsf{PSL}(2,\mathbb{R})$, the critical exponent for any $\alpha\in \Theta$ is not greater than one. When $\Gamma$ is geometrically finite, the equality holds if and only if $\Gamma$ is a lattice.</description>

      <title>Geometric Interpretations and Applications of the Berger-Ebin and York $L^2$-Orthogonal Decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Berger-Ebin and York $L^2$-orthogonal decompositions of the vector space of symmetric bilinear differential two-forms are fundamental tools in global Riemannian geometry. In this paper, we investigate the structure of Ricci tensors on compact Riemannian manifolds, with a particular focus on compact Ricci almost solitons, utilizing both the Berger-Ebin and York $L^2$-orthogonal decompositions. In addition, we explore applications of the York $L^2$-orthogonal decomposition to the theory of submanifolds and to the study of harmonic maps between Riemannian manifolds.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of Lie foliations with locally symmetric leaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that if the leaves of a minimal Lie foliation are locally isometric to a symmetric space of non-compact type without a Poincare disk factor, then the foliation is smoothly conjugate to a homogeneous Lie foliation up to finite covering. This result generalizes and strengthens Zimmer's theorem, which characterizes minimal Lie foliations with leaves isometric to a symmetric space of non-compact type without real rank one factors as pullbacks of homogeneous foliations. As applications, we extend Zimmer's arithmeticity theorem for holonomy groups and establish a rigidity theorem for Riemannian foliations with locally symmetric leaves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given two closed, oriented Riemannian four-manifolds $(M,g_M)$ and $(Z,g_Z)$, which are not locally conformally flat and not both self-dual or both anti-self-dual, we prove that there exists a metric $g_Y$ on the connected sum $Y\cong M\#Z$ such that the Weyl energy of $g_Y$ is strictly smaller than the sum of Weyl energies of $g_M$ and $g_Z$.</description>

      <title>On ratios of Chern numbers for complex hyperbolic branched covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove that, at least in even complex dimensions, the ratio of Chern numbers for a closed complex hyperbolic branched cover manifold are not all equal to the corresponding ratio of Chern numbers for a closed complex hyperbolic manifold. This leads to an answer for a question posed by Deraux and Seshadri, and proves that an almost $1/4$-pinched metric constructed by the author in a previous article is not K\"{a}hler.</description>

      <title>The mean curvature flow of subgroups on Lie groups of dimension three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study the existence of solutions to the Mean Curvature Flow for which the initial condition has the structure of a two-dimensional Lie subgroup within a Lie group of dimension three. We consider Lie groups with a fixed left-invariant metric and first observe that if the Lie group is unimodular, then every Lie subgroup is a minimal surface (hence a trivial solution). For this reason we focus on non-unimodular Lie groups, finding the evolution of every Lie subgroup of dimension 2 (within a 3 dimensional Lie group). These evolutions are self-similar for abelian subgroups (i.e. evolve by isometries), but not self-similar in the other cases.</description>

      <title>Finite element spaces of double forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tensor product of two differential forms of degree $p$ and $q$ is a multilinear form that is alternating in its first $p$ arguments and alternating in its last $q$ arguments. These forms, which are known as double forms or $(p,q)$-forms, play a central role in certain differential complexes that arise when studying partial differential equations. We construct piecewise polynomial finite element spaces for all of the natural subspaces of the space of $(p,q)$-forms, excluding one subspace which fails to admit a piecewise constant discretization. As special cases, our construction recovers known finite element spaces for symmetric matrices with tangential-tangential continuity (the Regge finite elements), symmetric matrices with normal-normal continuity, and trace-free matrices with normal-tangential continuity. It also gives rise to new spaces, like a finite element space for tensors possessing the symmetries of the Riemann curvature tensor.</description>

      <title>Normal Singular Geodesics of a Conformally Generic Sub-Riemannian Metric</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that a Ma\~n\'e generic real-analytic $D$-Hamiltonian H, subjected to a totally non-holonomic real-analytic distribution $D$, has no non-trivial normal $D$-singular orbits of minimal rank. If $D$ has co-rank 1, this implies that $H + u$, where $u$ is a generic real-analytic potential, does not admit non-trivial normal $D$-singular orbits.</description>

      <title>Conformal foliations, K\"ahler twists and the Weinstein construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.11499</link>
      <description>arXiv:1909.11499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We classify both local and global K\"ahler structures admitting totally geodesic homothetic foliations with complex leaves. The main building blocks are related to Swann's twists and are obtained by applying Weinstein's method of constructing symplectic bundles to K\"ahler data. As a byproduct we obtain new classes of: holomorphic harmonic morphisms with fibres of arbitrary dimension from compact K\"ahler manifolds; non-K\"ahler balanced metrics conformal to K\"ahler ones (but compatible with different complex structures). Some classes of non-Einstein constant scalar curvature K\"ahler metrics are also obtained in this way.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.11642v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a new proof of the Riemannian Penrose inequality for time-symmetric asymptotically flat initial data with a single black-hole horizon. The proof proceeds through a newly established monotonicity formula holding along the level sets of the $p$-capacitary potential of the horizon boundary, in any asymptotically flat $3$-manifold with nonnegative scalar curvature.</description>

      <title>Score-based Pullback Riemannian Geometry: Extracting the Data Manifold Geometry using Anisotropic Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data-driven Riemannian geometry has emerged as a powerful tool for interpretable representation learning, offering improved efficiency in downstream tasks. Moving forward, it is crucial to balance cheap manifold mappings with efficient training algorithms. In this work, we integrate concepts from pullback Riemannian geometry and generative models to propose a framework for data-driven Riemannian geometry that is scalable in both geometry and learning: score-based pullback Riemannian geometry. Focusing on unimodal distributions as a first step, we propose a score-based Riemannian structure with closed-form geodesics that pass through the data probability density. With this structure, we construct a Riemannian autoencoder (RAE) with error bounds for discovering the correct data manifold dimension. This framework can naturally be used with anisotropic normalizing flows by adopting isometry regularization during training. Through numerical experiments on diverse datasets, including image data, we demonstrate that the proposed framework produces high-quality geodesics passing through the data support, reliably estimates the intrinsic dimension of the data manifold, and provides a global chart of the manifold. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first scalable framework for extracting the complete geometry of the data manifold.</description>
