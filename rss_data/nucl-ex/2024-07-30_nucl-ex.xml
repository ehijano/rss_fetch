      <title>Magicity versus superfluidity around $^{28}$O viewed from the study of $^{30}$F</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The neutron-rich unbound fluorine isotope $^{30}$F$_{21}$ has been observed for the first time by measuring its neutron decay at the SAMURAI spectrometer (RIBF, RIKEN) in the quasi-free proton knockout reaction of $^{31}$Ne nuclei at 235 MeV/nucleon. The mass and thus one-neutron-separation energy of $^{30}$F has been determined to be $S_n = -472\pm 58 \mathrm{(stat.)} \pm 33 \mathrm{(sys.)}$ keV from the measurement of its invariant-mass spectrum. The absence of a sharp drop in $S_n$($^{30}$F) shows that the ``magic'' $N=20$ shell gap is not restored close to $^{28}$O, which is in agreement with our shell-model calculations that predict a near degeneracy between the neutron $d$ and $fp$ orbitals, with the $1p_{3/2}$ and $1p_{1/2}$ orbitals becoming more bound than the $0f_{7/2}$ one. This degeneracy and reordering of orbitals has two potential consequences: $^{28}$O behaves like a strongly superfluid nucleus with neutron pairs scattering across shells, and both $^{29,31}$F appear to be good two-neutron halo-nucleus candidates.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the Sequential $3\alpha$ Process in the Photodissociation of $^{12}\mathrm{C}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cross sections for the $^{12}\mathrm{C}(\gamma,\alpha)^{8}\mathrm{Be}\rightarrow 3\alpha$ reaction have been successfully measured using exclusive coincidence between three $\alpha$ particles, minimizing Compton background. Sequential breakup kinematics are evident, and the cross sections are presented as locally averaged histogram values. Theoretical \textsc{Fresco} CDCC-CRC calculations reproduce the experimental data, showing that the process involves electromagnetic coupling to both $^{8}\mathrm{Be}^{0^+}$ and $^{8}\mathrm{Be}^{2^+}$ states. This study confirms that the $^{12}\mathrm{C}(\gamma,\alpha)^{8}\mathrm{Be}\rightarrow 3\alpha$ reaction proceeds via a sequential mechanism, crucial for understanding its significance in radiotherapy dosimetry.</description>

      <title>Study of one-step and two-step neutron transfer in the reaction $^{6}$Li + $^{9}$Be</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents the results of experiments on measuring the cross sections for elastic scattering and nucleon transfer channels in the $^{6}$Li + $^{9}$Be reaction at an incident energy of 68 MeV: $^{9}$Be($^{6}$Li,$^{6}$Li)$^{9}$Be, $^{9}$Be($^{6}$Li,$^{7}$Li)$^{8}$Be, $^{9}$Be($^{6}$Li,$^{7}$Li)$^{8}$Be$_{2+}$, $^{9}$Be($^{6}$Li,$^{8}$Li)$^{7}$Be, $^{9}$Be($^{6}$Li,$^{7}$Be)$^{8}$Li. The aim is to reveal the manifestation of the cluster structure of $^{9}$Be. Theoretical analysis of the contributions of one-step and two-step neutron transfer mechanisms is performed using the distorted wave Born approximation method with the Fresco code. Good agreement between the calculations and the experimental data was obtained for the channels of elastic scattering $^{9}$Be($^{6}$Li,$^{6}$Li)$^{9}$Be, neutron $^{9}$Be($^{6}$Li,$^{7}$Li)$^{8}$Be and proton transfer $^{9}$Be($^{6}$Li,$^{7}$Be)$^{8}$Li, as well as the transfer of two neutrons $^{9}$Be($^{6}$Li,$^{8}$Li)$^{7}$Be. It is shown that the dineutron cluster transfer mechanism makes a dominant contribution to the $^{9}$Be($^{6}$Li,$^{8}$Li)$^{7}$Be reaction channel at forward angles.</description>

      <title>Comparative studies of plastic scintillator strips with high technical attenuation length for the total-body J-PET scanner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plastic scintillator strips are considered as one of the promising solutions for the cost-effective construction of total-body positron emission tomography, (PET) system. The purpose of the performed measurements is to compare the transparency of long plastic scintillators with dimensions 6 mm x 24 mm x 1000 mm and with all surfaces polished. Six different types of commercial, general purpose, blue-emitting plastic scintillators with low attenuation of visible light were tested, namely: polyvinyl toluene-based BC-408, EJ-200, RP-408, and polystyrene-based Epic, SP32 and UPS-923A. For determination of the best type of plastic scintillator for totalbody Jagiellonian positron emission tomograph (TB-J-PET) construction, emission and transmission spectra, and technical attenuation length (TAL) of blue light-emitting by the scintillators were measured and compared. The TAL values were determined with the use of UV lamp as excitation source, and photodiode as light detector. Emission spectra of investigated scintillators have maxima in the range from 420 nm to 429 nm. The BC-408 and EJ-200 have the highest transmittance values of about 90% at the maximum emission wavelength measured through a 6 mm thick scintillator strip and the highest technical attenuation length reaching about 2000 mm, allowing assembly of long detection modules for time-of-flight (TOF) J-PET scanners. Influence of the 6 mm x 6 mm, 12 mm x 6 mm, 24 mm x 6 mm cross-sections of the 1000 mm long EJ-200 plastic scintillator on the TAL and signal intensity was measured. The highest TAL value was determined for samples with 24 mm x 6 mm cross-section.</description>

      <title>Investigation of kaonic atom optical potential by the high precision data of kaonic $^3$He and $^4$He atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate kaonic atom states based on the latest high precision data of the $2p$ states of the kaonic atoms in $^3$He and $^4$He (J-PARC E62). We consider the phenomenological form for the optical potential proportional to the nuclear density distributions and determine the potential parameters by the latest data. We find two sets of potential parameters for each of $K^--^3$He and $K^--^4$He that reproduce the data. We then extract the potential parameters consistent with the data of $^3$He and $^4$He atoms simultaneously. Using the potential, we investigate the structure of the kaonic atoms and kaonic nuclei for various nuclei up to Sn. We also report the optical potential parameters suited for the global description of the atomic data, the possible strong isospin dependence of the potential, and the different strength of the data of $K^--^3$He and $K^--^4$He in the restrictions on the potential parameters. In addition, we find that the study of the $1s$ states of the kaonic helium atom is very interesting as a next step, and the determination of the orbital angular momenta of the kaonic nuclear states is helpful for the unified understandings of the atomic and nuclear bound states of kaon because of the mutual influence between the atomic and the nuclear states of kaon with the same orbital angular momentum.</description>

      <title>Likely existence of bound states and the Efimov effect in the triple-$J/\psi$ system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ground-breaking discovery of the first fully charmed tetraquark state $X(6900)$ in the $J/\psi J/\psi$ invariant mass distribution by the LHCb collaboration has inspired intensive theoretical studies. Various interpretations, such as molecular states, compact tetraquark states, and coupled-channel effects, have been proposed for these states. Of particular interest is the ongoing search for the triple-$J/\psi$ state--a fully-charmed hexaquark state. To deepen our understanding of the triple-$J/\psi$ state and to guide future experimental searches, we study the triple-$J/\psi$ system in this work employing the Gaussian expansion method and the $J/\psi J/\psi$ potential parameterized to yield a shallow bound state, as suggested in several theoretical works. Our results support a triple-$J/\psi$ bound state, even in cases where the attractive interaction between the two $J/\psi$ mesons is very weak. Moreover, our analysis implies the Efimov effect in the triple-$J/\psi$ system. In addition, we extend our investigation to the triple-$\Upsilon (1S)$ system and obtain results similar to those for the triple-$J/\psi$ system.</description>

      <title>Particle production as a function of charged-particle flattenicity in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper reports the first measurement of the transverse momentum ($p_{\mathrm{T}}$) spectra of primary charged pions, kaons, (anti)protons, and unidentified particles as a function of the charged-particle flattenicity in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV. Flattenicity is a novel event shape observable that is measured in the pseudorapidity intervals covered by the V0 detector, $2.8&lt;\eta&lt;5.1$ and $-3.7&lt;\eta&lt;-1.7$. According to QCD-inspired phenomenological models, it shows sensitivity to multiparton interactions and is less affected by biases towards larger $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ due to local multiplicity fluctuations in the V0 acceptance than multiplicity. The analysis is performed in minimum-bias (MB) as well as in high-multiplicity events up to $p_{\mathrm{T}}=20$ GeV/$c$. The event selection requires at least one charged particle produced in the pseudorapidity interval $|\eta|&lt;1$. The measured $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ distributions, average $p_{\mathrm{T}}$, kaon-to-pion and proton-to-pion particle ratios, presented in this paper, are compared to model calculations using PYTHIA 8 based on color strings and EPOS LHC. The modification of the $p_{\mathrm{T}}$-spectral shapes in low-flattenicity events that have large event activity with respect to those measured in MB events develops a pronounced peak at intermediate $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ ($2&lt;p_{\mathrm{T}}&lt;8$ GeV/$c$), and approaches the vicinity of unity at higher $p_{\mathrm{T}}$. The results are qualitatively described by PYTHIA, and they show different behavior than those measured as a function of charged-particle multiplicity based on the V0M estimator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Beta-delayed proton and gamma emission in the decay of $^{21}$Mg has been measured at ISOLDE, CERN with the ISOLDE Decay Station (IDS) set-up. The existing decay scheme is updated, in particular what concerns proton transitions to excited states in $^{20}$Ne. Signatures of interference in several parts of the spectrum are used to settle spin and parity assignments to highly excited states in $^{21}$Na. The previously reported $\beta$p$\alpha$ branch is confirmed. A half-life of 120.5(4) ms is extracted for $^{21}$Mg. The revised decay scheme is employed to test mirror symmetry in the decay and to extract the beta strength distribution of $^{21}$Mg that is compared with theory.</description>

      <title>Prevailing Triaxial Shapes in Atomic Nuclei and a Quantum Theory of Rotation of Composite Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.11299v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the traditional view, heavy deformed nuclei are like axially-symmetric prolate ellipsoids, rotating about one of the short axes. In the present picture, their shapes may be triaxial. The triaxial shape yields complex rotations, which actually well reproduce experimental data, as confirmed by state-of-the-art Configuration Interaction calculations. Two origins are suggested for the triaxiality: (i) binding-energy gain by the symmetry restoration for triaxial shapes, and (ii) another gain by specific components of the nuclear force, like tensor force and high-multipole (e.g. hexadecupole) central force. While the origin (i) produces basic modest triaxiality for virtually all deformed nuclei, the origin (ii) produces more prominent triaxiality for a certain class of nuclei. An example of the former is 154Sm, a typical showcase of axial symmetry but is now suggested to depict a modest yet finite triaxiality. The latter, prominent triaxiality, is discussed from various viewpoints for some exemplified nuclei including 166Er, and experimental findings. Many-body structures of the gamma band and the double-gamma band are clarified. Regarding the general features of rotational states of deformed many-body systems including triaxial ones, the well-known J(J+1) rule of rotational excitation energies is derived, within the quantum mechanical many-body theory, without resorting to the quantization of a rotating classical rigid body. This derivation is extended to finite K. The present picture of the rotation is robust and can be applied to various shapes or configurations, including clusters and molecules. Thus, two long-standing open problems, (i) occurrence and origins of triaxiality and (ii) quantum many-body derivation of rotational energy, are resolved. Their possible relations to Davydov's rigid-triaxial-rotor model are mentioned.</description>

      <title>In-medium changes of nucleon cross sections tested in neutrino-induced reactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05921v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Historically studied in the context of heavy-ion collisions, the extent to which free nucleon-nucleon cross sections are modified in-medium remains undetermined by these data sets. Therefore, we investigate the impact of NN in-medium modifications on neutrino-nucleus cross section predictions using the GiBUU transport model. We find that including an in-medium lowering of the NN cross section and density dependence on $\Delta$ excitation improves agreement with MicroBooNE neutrino-argon scattering data. This is observed for both proton and neutral pion spectra in charged-current muon neutrino and neutral-current single pion production datasets. The impact of collision broadening of the $\Delta$ resonance is also investigated. The absence of $\Delta$ broadening is slightly favored, but the larger uncertainties on the pion production data prevent definitive conclusions.</description>

      <title>Random close packing of binary hard spheres favors the stability of neutron-rich atomic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11268v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In spite of the success of the Bethe-Weizs\"acker mass formula in its modern numerical and predictive implementations, the common-knowledge principle that it is electrostatics which, ultimately, favors neutron-rich nuclei still presents unclear aspects. For example, while it is true that the Coulomb interaction promotes the tendency towards neutron-rich nuclei, the opposite effects of Majorana exchange forces and Pauli exclusion are known to counteract this tendency. We show that a recent analytical progress in the mathematical description of random close packing of spheres with different sizes provides a missing contribution to the theoretical description of the $Z$ versus $N$ slope in the nuclides chart. In particular, the theory predicts, on purely geometric grounds, that the most stable nuclei are those with ratio $Z/N \approx 0.75$. This new "geometric" random-packing contribution to the semi-empirical mass formula may be the missing aspect of nuclear structure that tilts the balance towards neutron-rich nuclei in the Segr\`e stability chart.</description>
