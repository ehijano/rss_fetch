      <title>Can AI with High Reasoning Ability Replicate Human-like Decision Making in Economic Experiments?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Economic experiments offer a controlled setting for researchers to observe human decision-making and test diverse theories and hypotheses; however, substantial costs and efforts are incurred to gather many individuals as experimental participants. To address this, with the development of large language models (LLMs), some researchers have recently attempted to develop simulated economic experiments using LLMs-driven agents, called generative agents. If generative agents can replicate human-like decision-making in economic experiments, the cost problem of economic experiments can be alleviated. However, such a simulation framework has not been yet established. Considering the previous research and the current evolutionary stage of LLMs, this study focuses on the reasoning ability of generative agents as a key factor toward establishing a framework for such a new methodology. A multi-agent simulation, designed to improve the reasoning ability of generative agents through prompting methods, was developed to reproduce the result of an actual economic experiment on the ultimatum game. The results demonstrated that the higher the reasoning ability of the agents, the closer the results were to the theoretical solution than to the real experimental result. The results also suggest that setting the personas of the generative agents may be important for reproducing the results of real economic experiments. These findings are valuable for the future definition of a framework for replacing human participants with generative agents in economic experiments when LLMs are further developed.</description>

      <title>Estimating Digital Product Trade through Corporate Revenue Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02253v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite global efforts to harmonize international trade statistics, our understanding of digital trade and its implications remains limited. Here, we introduce a method to estimate bilateral exports and imports for dozens of sectors starting from the corporate revenue data of large digital firms. This method allows us to provide estimates for digitally ordered and delivered trade involving digital goods (e.g. video games), productized services (e.g. digital advertising), and digital intermediation fees (e.g. hotel rental), which together we call digital products. We use these estimates to study five key aspects of digital trade. We find that, compared to trade in physical goods, digital product exports are more spatially concentrated, have been growing faster, and can offset trade balance estimates, like the United States trade deficit on physical goods. We also find that countries that have decoupled economic growth from greenhouse gas emissions tend to have larger digital exports and that digital products exports contribute positively to the complexity of economies. This method, dataset, and findings provide a new lens to understand the impact of international trade in digital products.</description>

      <title>A Model of Enclosures: Coordination, Conflict, and Efficiency in the Transformation of Land Property Rights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Historians and political economists have long debated the processes that led land in frontier regions, managed commons, and a variety of customary landholding regimes to be enclosed and transformed into more exclusive forms of private property. Using the framework of aggregative games, we examine land-holding regimes where access to land is established via possession and use, and then explore the factors that may initiate decentralized privatization processes. Factors including population density, potential for technology improvement, enclosure costs, shifts in group cohesion and bargaining power, or the policy and institutional environment determine the equilibrium mix of property regimes. While decentralized processes yield efficient enclosure and technological transformation in some circumstances, in others, the outcomes fall short of second-best. This stems from the interaction of different spillover effects, leading to inefficiently low rates of enclosure and technological transformation in some cases and excessive enclosure in others. Implementing policies to strengthen customary governance, compensate displaced stakeholders, or subsidize/tax enclosure can realign incentives. However, addressing one market failure while overlooking others can worsen outcomes. Our analysis offers a unified framework for evaluating claimed mechanisms and processes across Neoclassical, neo-institutional, and Marxian interpretations of enclosure processes.</description>

      <title>Exploitation Business: Leveraging Information Asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the "Exploitation Business" model, which capitalizes on information asymmetry to exploit vulnerable populations. It focuses on businesses targeting non-experts or fraudsters who capitalize on information asymmetry to sell their products or services to desperate individuals. This phenomenon, also described as "profit-making activities based on informational exploitation," thrives on individuals' limited access to information, lack of expertise, and Fear of Missing Out (FOMO).
  The recent advancement of social media and the rising trend of fandom business have accelerated the proliferation of such exploitation business models. Discussions on the empowerment and exploitation of fans in the digital media era present a restructuring of relationships between fans and media creators, highlighting the necessity of not overlooking the exploitation of fans' free labor.
  This paper analyzes the various facets and impacts of exploitation business models, enriched by real-world examples from sectors like cryptocurrency and GenAI, thereby discussing their social, economic, and ethical implications. Moreover, through theoretical backgrounds and research, it explores similar themes like existing exploitation theories, commercial exploitation, and financial exploitation to gain a deeper understanding of the "Exploitation Business" subject.</description>

      <title>Social Environment Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14090v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds promise as a technology that can be used to improve government and economic policy-making. This paper proposes a new research agenda towards this end by introducing Social Environment Design, a general framework for the use of AI for automated policy-making that connects with the Reinforcement Learning, EconCS, and Computational Social Choice communities. The framework seeks to capture general economic environments, includes voting on policy objectives, and gives a direction for the systematic analysis of government and economic policy through AI simulation. We highlight key open problems for future research in AI-based policy-making. By solving these challenges, we hope to achieve various social welfare objectives, thereby promoting more ethical and responsible decision making.</description>
