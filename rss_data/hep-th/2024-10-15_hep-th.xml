      <title>Melonic limits of the quartic Yukawa model and general features of melonic CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a set of large-$N$ tensor field theories with a rich structure of fixed points, encompassing both the melonic and prismatic CFTs observed previously in the conformal limits of other tensor theories and in the generalised Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. The tensor fields interact via an $O(N)^3$-invariant generalisation of the quartic Yukawa model, $\phi^2\bar{\psi}\psi+\phi^6$. To understand the structure of IR/UV fixed points, we perform a partial four-loop perturbative analysis in $D=3-\epsilon$. We identify the flows between the melonic and prismatic fixed points in the bosonic and fermionic sectors, finding an apparent line of fixed points in both. We reproduce these fixed points non-perturbatively using the Schwinger-Dyson equations, and in addition identify the supersymmetric fixed points in general dimension. Selecting a particular fermionic fixed point, we study its conformal spectrum non-perturbatively, comparing it to the sextic prismatic model. In particular, we establish the dimensional windows in which this theory remains stable. We comment on the structure of large-$N$ melonic CFTs across various dimensions, noting a number of features which we expect to be common to any such theory.</description>

      <title>The complex Liouville string: worldsheet boundaries and non-perturbative effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate general observables of the complex Liouville string with worldsheet boundaries. We develop a universal formalism that reduces such observables to ordinary closed string amplitudes without boundaries, applicable to any worldsheet string theory, but particularly simple in the context of 2d or minimal string theories. We apply this formalism to the duality of the complex Liouville string with the matrix integral proposed in arXiv:2409.18759 and arXiv:2410.07345 and showcase the formalism by finding appropriate boundary conditions for various matrix model quantities of interest, such as the resolvent or the partition function. We also apply this formalism towards the computation of non-perturbative effects on the worldsheet mediated by ZZ-instantons. These are known to be plagued by extra subtleties which need input from string field theory to resolve. These computations probe and uncover the duality between the complex Liouville string and the matrix model at the non-perturbative level.</description>

      <title>Bound States and Particle Production by Breather-Type Background Field Configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the interaction of fermion fields with oscillating domain walls, inspired by breather-type solutions of the sine-Gordon equation. Our study focuses on the fermionic bound states and particle production induced by a time-dependent scalar background field. The fermions couple to two domain walls undergoing harmonic motion, and we explore the resulting dynamics of the fermionic wave functions. We demonstrate that while fermions initially form bound states around the domain walls, the energy provided by the oscillatory motion of the scalar field induces an outward flux of fermions and antifermions, leading to particle production and eventual flux propagation toward spatial infinity. Through numerical simulations, we observe that the fermion density exhibits quasiperiodic behavior, with partial recurrences of the bound state configurations after each oscillation period. However, the fermion wave functions do not remain localized, and over time, the density decreases as more particles escape the vicinity of the domain walls. Our results highlight that the sine-Gordon-like breather background, when coupled to fermions, does not preserve integrability or stability, with the oscillations driving a continuous energy transfer into the fermionic modes. This study sheds light on the challenges of maintaining steady-state fermion solutions in time-dependent topological backgrounds and offers insights into particle production mechanisms in oscillating soliton systems.</description>

      <title>Mass spectrum and linear perturbations of ghost-free multi-spin-2 theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the spin-2 nature of gravity, we consider a theory of N interacting spin-2 fields, formulated in terms of vielbeins which have been argued to be free of the Boulware-Deser ghost. This is the only known such theory with nontrivial multi-field interactions. We develop an all-order expansion of the vielbein in terms of the metric and Lorentz field perturbations, enabling an expansion of the action in arbitrary backgrounds to any order. The mass matrix is then analysed around proportional vielbein solutions corresponding to vacuum Einstein spacetimes. It is shown that the theory exhibits a non-tachyonic spectrum with one massless and N-1 massive spin-2 modes, regardless of the sign of the cosmological constant. While the massless mode is universal, the non-zero masses cannot generally be determined analytically, but we obtain the lower and upper bounds on each mass eigenvalue in terms of the parameters of the theory.</description>

      <title>Exact WKB in all sectors I: Potentials with degenerate saddles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the exact-WKB (EWKB) method through the analysis of Airy and Weber types, with an emphasis on the exact quantization of locally harmonic potentials in multiple sectors. The core innovation of our work lies in introducing a novel complexification approach to the energy parameter $u$, distinct from the common complexification of the (semi-classical) expansion parameter used in Borel summability. This new technique allows for continuous analytical continuation across different sectors of a potential while maintaining the exact quantization condition, even before median summation. By redefining the $A$-cycle above the potential barrier top, we ensure the quantization condition remains real and, by use of the Stokes automorphism and the median resummation, show that the resurgence structure is preserved across transitions between sectors. Furthermore, we extend the Weber-type exact-WKB method, offering exact estimates for quantum actions around all types of saddle points, generalizing previous results. Through the analysis of these quantum actions, we reveal the presence of $S$-duality, facilitating the exchange between perturbative and non-perturbative behaviors, and we conjecture the mapping of the P-NP relations between dual theories. Our study encompasses periodic and symmetric double-well potentials, demonstrating that the exact-WKB method captures intricate structures in quantum systems in all sectors, including multi-instanton contributions and the resurgence of quantum actions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a precise correspondence between points of momentum amplituhedra and origami crease patterns. As an application, we prove that the BCFW cells triangulate the momentum amplituhedron when all Mandelstam variables are nonnegative. As another application, we show that every weighted planar bipartite graph $\Gamma$ admits a t-embedding, i.e., an embedding of the planar dual of $\Gamma$ such that the sum of angles of white (equivalently, black) faces around each vertex is equal to $\pi$.</description>

      <title>LREE of a Dressed D$p$-brane with Transverse Motion in the Partially Compact Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of the type IIA/IIB superstring theories, we derive the left-right entanglement entropy (LREE) of a BPS D$p$-brane with transverse motion in the presence of a $U(1)$ gauge potential and the Kalb-Ramond field in the partially compact spacetime $\mathbf{T}^n \otimes \mathbb R^{1,9-n}$. At first we employ the replica trick to compute the R\'{e}nyi entropy and then we obtain the entanglement entropy. We examine the results for the special case, i.e. for the D6-brane. Besides, we investigate the thermodynamical entropy, associated with the LREE. This demonstrates that the LREE is precisely equivalent to its thermodynamic counterpart.</description>

      <title>Positivity Bounds on parity-violating scalar-tensor EFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using dispersion relations of the scattering amplitudes and semi-definite programming, we calculate causality bounds on the Wilson coefficients in scalar-tensor effective field theories that include parity-violating operators. Particular attention has been paid to the dynamical-Chern-Simons (dCS) and scalar-Gauss-Bonnet (sGB) couplings, along with higher order coefficients, and the interplay between them. For the leading terms, the bounds on the parity-conserving and -violating coefficients are simply projections of the complex coefficients. Some parity-violating coefficients are found to be upper bounded by the the parity-conserving counterparts, or the higher order parity-conserving coefficients. While the observational constraints on parity-violating coefficients are weaker than the parity-conserving counterparts, the causality bounds are of comparable strength and thus may play a more prominent role in constraining strong gravity effects in upcoming observations.</description>

      <title>Exact Solutions to the Nonlinear Governing Equations of the Born-Infeld Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exact finite-energy solutions to the nonlinear governing equations of the Born-Infeld theory of electrodynamics, describing continuous distributions of electric, magnetic, and dyonic charge sources, in both classical and generalized settings, are constructed explicitly. In particular, it is shown that, the finiteness of the total prescribed charges leads to the finiteness of the total energy, of the electromagnetic field system. As a by-product, this result resolves a puzzle arising in the dyonic point charge distribution situation where energy divergence inevitably occurs.</description>

      <title>The Cusp Limit of Correlators and A New Graphical Bootstrap for Correlators/Amplitudes to Eleven Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the universal behavior of half-BPS correlators in $\mathcal N=4$ super-Yang-Mills in the cusp limit where two consecutive separations $x_{12}^2,x_{23}^2$ become lightlike. Through the Lagrangian insertion procedure, the Sudakov double-logarithmic divergence of the $n$-point correlator is related to the $(n+1)$-point correlator where the inserted Lagrangian ``pinches'' to the soft-collinear region of the cusp. We formulate this constraint as a new {\it graphical rule} for the $f$-graphs of the four-point correlator, which turns out to be the most constraining rule known so far. By exploiting this single graphical rule, we bootstrap the planar integrand of the four-point correlator up to ten loops ($n=14$) and fix all 22024902 but one coefficient at eleven loops ($n=15$); the remaining coefficient is then fixed using the triangle rule. We comment on the breakdown of a ``Catalan conjecture" for the coefficients of the family of $f$-graphs known as ``anti-prisms" where the coefficient of the twelve-loop ($n=16$) anti-prism is found to be $-38$ (as opposed to $-42$ if the conjecture should hold) by a local analysis of the bootstrap equations. We also comment on the implication of our graphical rule for the non-planar contributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We remind the definition and main properties of the Krichever quasiclassical tau-function, and turn to the application of these formulas for recent studies of two-dimensional quantum gravity. We show, that in the case of minimal gravity it turns to be directly related with the Verlinde formula for minimal models, giving in particular case its one more direct proof. Generalizations for continuous "complex Liouville" theory are also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Web of Four-Dimensional Dualities and Symmetry Topological Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study one-form $\mathbb{Z}_N$ center symmetries in four-dimensional gauge theories using the symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT). In this context, the associated TFT in the five-dimensional bulk is the BF model. We revisit its canonical quantization and construct topological boundary states on several important classes of four manifolds that are spin, non-spin and torsional. We highlight a web of four-dimensional dualities, which can be naturally interpreted within the SymTFT framework. We also point out an intriguing class of four-dimensional gauge theories that exhibit mixed 't Hooft anomaly between one-form symmetries. In the second part of this work, we extend the SymTFT to account for various quantities protected by supersymmetry (SUSY) in SUSY gauge theories. We proposed that their behaviour under various symmetry operations are entirely captured by the topological boundary of the SymTFT, resulting in strong constraints. Concrete examples are considered, including the Witten index, the lens space index and the Donaldson-Witten and Vafa-Witten partition functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the shear viscoelasticity in a simple holographic axion model with broken translational symmetry and rotational symmetry in space via the perturbation computation. We find that, in the case of spontaneous symmetry breaking, the broken translations and anisotropy both enhance the shear elasticity of the system. While in all cases, they introduce a double suppression on the shear viscosity, which is in contrast to the result from the study of the p-wave holographic superfluid where the shear viscosity is enhanced when the rotational symmetry is broken spontaneously.</description>

      <title>A Lagrangian relationship between the PST and the Sen formulations of chiral forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we show the equivalence between the PST and Sen formulations for chiral forms at the Lagrangian level. This is by discussing how an action in the Sen formulation for chiral forms can be separated into two PST actions, one with the correct sign the other has the wrong sign, reflecting the feature of the Sen formulation that it contains two chiral form fields, one physical the other unphysical, decoupled from each other. The key idea is to add extra terms to the Sen action such that the modified action contains a PST scalar and is also equivalent with the original one. Then after eliminating a self-dual field $Q$ and making appropriate field redefinitions, we obtain a sum of two PST actions. We also consider alternative actions in which extra terms are added to the Sen action to either eliminate the physical or unphysical degrees of freedom and such that the resulting action is identified with the PST action either with correct or incorrect sign. Generalisation to non-linear theories coupling to external source is discussed. The realisation of the Sen M5-brane action as containing the PST M5-brane action is also explicitly shown.</description>

      <title>Scattering of sine-Gordon kinks with internal structure in an extended nonlinear $O(3)$ sigma model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present topological defects in $(1,1)$ dimensions, described by an extended nonlinear $O(3)$ sigma model. We consider spherical coordinates $(\phi,\chi)$ in the $S^2$ isotopic space and a potential $V(\phi,\chi)$. For specific forms of the potential, it is possible to apply the Bogomol'nyi method, resulting in first-order equations of motion with solutions that minimize energy. We study a model with an explicit solution for the field $\phi$ that resembles the ubiquitous sine-Gordon kink/antikink, but with an internal structure given by the field $\chi$ with a form antilump/lump that depends on a constant $C$. The soliton-antisoliton scattering process depends on $C$ and on the initial velocity of the pair. Some results are reported, such as: one-bounce scattering for $\phi$, or strong emission of radiation for $\phi$, followed by i) annihilation of $\chi$; ii) same pattern antilump-antilump or lump-antilump for $\chi$; iii) inversion antilump-antilump to lump-lump for $\chi$; iv) inversion antilump-lump to lump-antilump for $\chi$. Other findings are: v) annihilation of the pair soliton-antisoliton with the emission of scalar radiation; vi) emission of pairs of oscillations around the vacuum for $\phi$ and $\chi$. The energy density shows that the defect has an internal structure as a nested defect of an antilump inside a kink. The lump core of the defect is responsible for the emission of radiation. The changing of structure of the defects during the scattering is analyzed not only with the field profiles in the physical $(1,1)$ space, but also in the internal $S^2$ space, which gives some new insight into the process.</description>

Abstract: Marino's conjecture remains underexplored within the framework of $SO(N )$ string dualities. In this article, we investigated the reformulated invariants of a one-parameter family of knots $\left[ K\right]_p$ derived from tangle surgery on Manolescu's quasi-alternating knot diagrams. Within topological string dualities, we have verified Marino's integrality conjecture for these families of knots up to the Young diagram representation ${\bf R}$, with ${|\bf R|}\leq 2$. Furthermore, through our analysis, we have conjectured the closed structure of extremal refined BPS integers for the torus knots $ \left[{\bf 3_1}\right]_{2p+1}$ and $ \left[{\bf 8_{20}}\right]_{2p+1}$, $p \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$. As the parameter $p$ of the knot diagram increases, the total crossing number of a knot exceeds $16$, which we describe as a complex knot. Interestingly, we discovered a maximum number of gaps in the BPS spectra associated with complex knot families. Moreover, our observations indicated that as $p$ increases, the size of these gaps also expands.</description>

      <title>Records from the S-Matrix Marathon: Schwinger-Keldysh Formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These notes provide an overview of real-time techniques in quantum field theories and holography. We outline the general rationale and principles underlying the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism and its out-of-time-order generalizations. To illustrate its broad utility we frame our discussion in the language of open quantum dynamics. As a specific application we describe how such real-time observables help in understanding scrambling dynamics. We also describe the holographic prescription for computing thermal Schwinger-Keldysh observables. These notes are based on a series of lectures held during the S-Matrix Marathon workshop at the Institute for Advanced Study on 11-22 March 2024.</description>

      <title>On Chalykh's approach to eigenfunctions of DIM-induced integrable Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quite some years ago, Oleg Chalykh has built a nice theory from the observation that the Macdonald polynomial reduces at $t=q^{-m}$ to a sum over permutations of simpler polynomials called Baker-Akhiezer functions, which can be unambiguously constructed from a system of linear difference equations. Moreover, he also proposed a generalization of these polynomials to the twisted Baker-Akhiezer functions. Recently, in a private communication Oleg suggested that these twisted Baker-Akhiezer functions could provide eigenfunctions of the commuting Hamiltonians associated with the $(-1,a)$ rays of the Ding-Iohara-Miki algebra. In the paper, we discuss this suggestion and some evidence in its support.</description>

      <title>The primordial non-Gaussianities for non-singular Horndeski cosmologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have acquired and analyzed the bispectrum of primordial scalar perturbations and the corresponding non-Gaussianities in the particular model of the contracting Universe with strong gravity in the past within the framework of the Horndeski theory. The found shape function of the bispectrum did not correspond to the widely used local, equilateral, orthogonal or enfolded shapes. We also evaluate non-Gaussianity parameter $f_{\text{NL}}$ for different wave numbers $\vec{k}_1$, $\vec{k}_2$, $\vec{k}_3$ configurations. The convenient ones in our case are: (i) $k_1=k_2$, $k_3\to 0$ (local configuration of wave numbers); (ii) $k_1=k_2=k_3$ (equilateral configuration); (iii) the enfolded one, where $k_1=k_2+k_3$, what is a linear combination of the equilateral and orthogonal configurations. For each configuration it is possible to satisfy the current observational bounds for non-linear parameter $f_{\text{NL}}$ even under the restrictions of the applicability of regime, where the background evolution and perturbations are legitimately described within classical field theory and weakly coupled quantum theory at all times. However, the region of healthy parameters in our model is arranged so that one can not satisfy experimental constraints for all different non-linear parameters $f_{\text{NL}}^{\text{local}}$, $f_{\text{NL}}^{\text{equil}}$, and $f_{\text{NL}}^{\text{enfold}}$ at once.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10755v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that various dynamical gauge theories in two, three and four dimensions, which are obtained as Manin deformations of topological Alexandrov-Kontsevich-Schwarz-Zaboronsky theories, are equivalent to gravitational theories. Since gravity is topological in two and three dimension, this equivalence requires a diffeomorphism breaking background source term. In four dimensions, however, the MacDowell-Mansouri formulation of Einstein gravity with a cosmological constant is obtained identically via the Manin deformation of a particular Alexandrov-Kontsevich-Schwarz-Zaboronsky theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a bulk plus boundary extension of Jackiw-Teitelboim Gravity (JT) coupled with Yang-Mills fields. The generalization is performed in the Poisson Sigma Model formulation. We discuss the role of boundary conditions in relation to the symmetries of the boundary dynamics and we show that the boundary action can be written in terms of coadjoint orbits of an appropriate Virasoro-Kac-Moody group. We obtain a Schwarzian action and interaction terms with additional edge modes that matches the effective low energy action of recent SYK-like tensor models. Finally, we discuss the duality relations also from a three dimensional perspective.</description>

      <title>Holography and the internal structure of charmonium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Holographic models that consider classical vector fields in a 5-d background provide successful effective descriptions for heavy vector meson spectra. This holds both in the vacuum and in a thermal medium, like the quark gluon plasma. However, it is somehow mysterious the way that these phenomenological models work. In particular, what is the role of the fifth dimension and what is the relation between the holographic 5-d background and the physical (4-d) heavy mesons. Hadrons, in contrast to leptons, are composite particles with some internal structure, that depends on the energy at which they are observed. In this work, a static meson is represented by a heavy quark-antiquark pair with an interaction described by a Nambu Goto string living in the same 5-d background that provides field solutions leading to masses and decay constants of charmonium states. The interaction potential that shows up is linear for large distances with a string tension consistent with the effective Cornell potential. Introducing temperature $T$ in the background it is found, for the $J/\psi$ case, that there is a deconfining transition at some critical value of $T$. The results obtained indicate that the 5-d background is effectively representing the internal structure of the (static) charmonium (quasi) states.</description>

      <title>Susy breaking soft terms in the supersymmetric Pati-Salam landscape from Intersecting D6-Branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the supersymmetry breaking soft terms for all the viable models in the complete landscape of three-family supersymmetric Pati-Salam models arising from intersecting D6-branes on a $\mathbb{T}^6/(\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2)$ orientifold in type IIA string theory. The calculations are performed in the general scenario of $u$-moduli dominance with the $s$-moduli turned on, where the soft terms remain independent of the Yukawa couplings and the Wilson lines. The results for the trilinear coupling, gaugino-masses, squared-mass parameters of squarks, sleptons and Higgs depend on the brane wrapping numbers and the susy breaking parameters. We find that unlike the Yukawa couplings which remain unchanged for the models dual under the exchange of two SU(2) sectors, the corresponding soft term parameters only match for the trilinear coupling and the mass of the gluino. This can be explained by the internal geometry where the Yukawa interactions depend only on the triangular areas of the worldsheet instantons while the soft terms have an additional dependence on the orientation-angles of D6-branes in the three two-tori. In the special limit of parameter space we find universal masses for the Higgs and the gauginos.</description>

Abstract: This manuscript investigates a Schwarzschild black hole surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter embedded in a cloud of strings. The effects of its surroundings on thermodynamics, timelike and null geodesics, shadows, and quasinormal modes are analyzed. It is demonstrated that changes in spacetime, induced by the surrounding environment, significantly influence the stability, thermal phases, energy dynamics, particle trajectories, and observable features of the black hole's shadow, as well as the oscillation frequency and decay rate.</description>

      <title>Geometry and periods of $G_2$-moduli spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the geometry the moduli space $\mathscr{M}$ of torsion-free $G_2$-structures on a compact $G_2$-manifold $M$, equipped with the volume-normalised $L^2$-metric $\mathscr{G}$. When $b^1(M) = 0$, this metric is known to be of Hessian type and to admit a global potential. Here we give a new description of the geometry of $\mathscr{M}$, based on the observation that there is a natural way to immerse the moduli space into a homogeneous space $D$ diffeomorphic to $GL(n+1)/ (\{\pm 1\} \times O(n))$, where $n = b^3(M) - 1$. We point out that the formal properties of this immersion $\Phi : \mathscr{M} \rightarrow D$ are very similar to those of the period map defined on the moduli spaces of Calabi--Yau threefolds. With a view to understand the curvatures of $\mathscr{G}$, we also derive a new formula for the fourth derivative of the potential and relate it to the second fundamental form of $\Phi(\mathscr{M}) \subset D$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the stability of weak symmetry-protected topological phases (SPTs) in the presence of short-range interactions, focusing on the tenfold way classification. Using Atiyah's Real $\mathit{KR}$-theory and Anderson-dualized bordism, we classify free and interacting weak phases across all Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes in low dimensions. Extending the free-to-interacting map of Freed-Hopkins, we mathematically compute how the behavior of free weak SPTs changes when interactions are introduced as well as predict intrinsically-interacting weak phases in certain classes. Our mathematical techniques involve T-duality and the James splitting of the torus. Our results provide a mathematical framework for understanding the persistence of weak SPTs under interactions, with potential implications for experimental and theoretical studies of these phases.</description>

      <title>All-loop renormalization group invariants for MSSM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For MSSM from the gauge couplings, Yukawa couplings, and the coefficient $\mu$ in the part of superpotential quadratic in the Higgs superfields we construct combinations which (for certain renormalization prescriptions) do not depend on the renormalization point in all loops. In other words, these combinations are the renormalization group invariants. Similar invariants are also constructed for NMSSM. The derivation is based on the nonrenormalization of the superpotential and the NSVZ equations. We argue that the scale invariance of the considered combinations takes place in the class of the HD+MSL schemes. This fact has been verified in the lowest orders, up to and including the one in which the dependence on the renormalization prescription becomes essential. It is also demonstrated that in the $\overline{\mbox{DR}}$ scheme the renormalization group invariance does not take place starting from the approximation, where the scheme dependence manifests itself.</description>

      <title>Constraints on primordial black holes from $N_{\text{eff}}$ : scalar induced gravitational waves as an extra radiation component</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In June 2023, multiple pulsar timing array collaborations provided evidence for the existence of a stochastic gravitational wave background. Scalar induced gravitational waves (SIGWs), as one of the most likely sources of stochastic gravitational waves, have received widespread attention. When primordial curvature perturbations on small scales are sufficiently large, \acp{PBH} inevitably form, concurrently producing SIGWs with significant observable effects. These SIGWs can serve as an additional radiation component, influencing the relativistic degrees of freedom $N_{\text{eff}}$. Taking into account primordial non-Gaussianity, we study the energy density spectrum of SIGWs up to the third order and use the current observational data of $N_{\text{eff}}$ to constrain small-scale primordial curvature perturbations and the abundance of \acp{PBH}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory of random non-Hermitian action that, after quantization, describes the stochastic nonlinear dynamics of quantum states in Hilbert space. Focusing on fermionic fields, we propose both canonical quantization and path integral quantization, demonstrating that these two approaches are equivalent. Using this formalism, we investigate the evolution of a single-particle Gaussian wave packet under the influence of non-Hermiticity and randomness. Our results show that specific types of non-Hermiticity lead to wave packet localization, while randomness affects the central position of the wave packet, causing the variance of its distribution to increase with the strength of the randomness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, metrics that describe regular black holes, extreme black holes, or traversable wormholes have been widely discussed. These spacetimes, appearing in scenarios such as the brane world, are contingent on the values of the parameters, with each metric encompassing all three objects. We are considering various known models for these black hole/wormhole interpolating spacetimes and showing that, starting from the macroscopic black holes, all of them must evaporate into macroscopic wormholes, thus avoiding existential problems related to the final stages of black hole evaporation and issues of quantum gravity and black hole remnants. For this purpose, we are calculating the energy emission rates of black holes and the appropriate lifetimes. We argue that some of our conclusions should hold regardless of the specific model, as long as it permits an extremal black hole state with zero temperature at a particular value of the coupling constant.</description>

      <title>Scale-dependence in $\Lambda$CDM parameters inferred from the CMB: a possible sign of Early Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The early dark energy (EDE) model is one of the promising solutions to the Hubble tension. One of the successes of the EDE model is that it can provide a similar fit to the $\Lambda$CDM model for the CMB power spectrum. In this work, I analyze the phenomenology of the EDE and $\Lambda$CDM parameters on the CMB temperature power spectrum and notice that this cannot hold on all scales. Thus, if the real cosmology is as described by the EDE model, the $\Lambda$CDM parameters will be scale-dependent when fitting the CMB power spectrum with the $\Lambda$CDM model, which can be hints for the EDE model. I examine CMB-S4-like observations through mock data analysis and find that parameter shifts are notable. As observations include smaller scales, I find lower $H_0$, $n_s$, $\omega_b$ and higher $\omega_m$, $A_s e^{-2\tau}$, which will also constitute new tensions with other observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.02190v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study various aspects of global symmetries in five-dimensional superconformal field theories. Whenever a supersymmetry-preserving relevant deformation is available, the infrared gauge theory description might exhibit a finite order mixed 't Hooft anomaly between a $1$-form symmetry and the instantonic symmetry. This anomaly constrains the flavor symmetry group acting faithfully on the SCFT and the consistency of certain RG flows. As an additional example, we consider the instructive case of three-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=4$ SQED. Finally, we discuss the compatibility between conformal invariance and the presence of $1$-form and $2$-group global symmetries.</description>

      <title>Eternal black holes and temporal quantum correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.00982v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent works suggest that quantum theory may support a unification of the notions of space and time, thus treating the spatial and temporal quantum correlations equally. Specifically, the partial transposition of the maximally entangled state of two quantum systems at one time exactly matches the temporal quantum correlations of one quantum system that evolves unitary between two distinct moments of time. In this work we consider this equivalence of spatial and temporal quantum correlations in the context of AdS/CFT duality. We show that in the high temperature limit the thermofield double state is equivalent to the temporal quantum correlations of a quantum theory evolving unitary between two times. Thus, on the gravity side, we argue that the temporal correlations correspond to a black hole at one time connected behind the horizon by an Einstein-Rosen bridge to the same black hole at another time. Moreover, we construct the spacetime corresponding to this temporal wormholes and find that the spacetime is consistent with the interior solution of the BTZ black hole. We conclude suggesting that the BTZ interior solution could have an interpretation in the dS/CFT correspondence framework.</description>

      <title>A Chern-Simons approach to self-dual gravity in (2+1)-dimensions and quantisation of Poisson structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The (2+1)-dimensional analog self-dual gravity which is obtained via spacetime dimension reduction of the (3+1)-dimensional Holst action without reducing the internal gauge group is studied. A Chern-Simons formulation for this theory is constructed based on the gauge group $SL(2,\CC)_\RR\rcross \Rsix$ and maps the 3d complex self-dual dynamical variable and connection to 6d real variables which combines into a 12d Cartan connection. The Chern-Simons approach leads to a real analogue for the self-dual action based on a larger symmetry group. The quantization process follows the combinatorial quantization method outlined for Chern-Simons theory. In the combinatorial quantization of the phase space the Poisson structure governing the moduli space of flat connections which emerges is obtained using the classical $r$-matrix for the quantum double $D(SL(2,\CC)_\RR)$ viewed as the double of a double $ D(SL(2,\RR)\dcross AN(2))$. This quantum double gives the structure for quantum symmetries within the quantum theory for the model.</description>

      <title>Modular Calabi-Yau Fourfolds and Connections to M-Theory Fluxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07611v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the local zeta functions of Calabi-Yau fourfolds. This is done by developing arithmetic deformation techniques to compute the factor of the zeta function that is attributed to the horizontal four-form cohomology. This, in turn, is sensitive to the complex structure of the fourfold. Focusing mainly on examples of fourfolds with a single complex structure parameter, it is demonstrated that the proposed arithmetic techniques are both applicable and consistent. We present a Calabi-Yau fourfold for which a factor of the horizontal four-form cohomology further splits into two pieces of Hodge type $(4,0)+(2,2)+(0,4)$ and $(3,1)+(1,3)$. The latter factor corresponds to a weight-3 modular form, which allows expressing the value of the periods in terms of critical values of the L-function of this modular form, in accordance with Deligne's conjecture. The arithmetic considerations are related to M-theory Calabi-Yau fourfold compactifications with background four-form fluxes. We classify such background fluxes according to their Hodge type. For those fluxes associated to modular forms, we express their couplings in the low-energy effective action in terms of L-function values.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Holographic Entropy Cone via Cycle Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10137v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by bit threads, we introduce a new prescription for computing entropy vectors outside the holographic entropy cone. By utilizing cycle flows on directed graphs, we show that the maximum cycle flow associated to any subset of vertices, which corresponds to a subsystem, manifestly obeys purification symmetry. Furthermore, by restricting ourselves to a subclass of directed graphs, we prove that the maximum cycle flow obeys both subadditivity and strong subadditivity, thereby establishing it as a viable candidate for the entropy associated to the subsystem. Finally, we demonstrate how our model generalizes the entropy vectors obtainable via conventional flows in undirected graphs, as well as conjecture that our model similarly generalizes the entropy vectors arising from hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>Kodaira-Spencer Anomalies with Stora-Zumino Method</title>

Abstract: Holomorphic diffeomorphism anomalies of $2\,n$-dimensional gravitational theories in Beltrami parametrisation (Kodaira-Spencer anomalies) are computed in the BRST framework, using an extension of the Stora-Zumino method. This method, which allows to compute anomalies in a very concise way, makes manifest the topological origin of anomalies. They have a clear geometric interpretation, since they are expressed in terms of Chern polynomials and Pontryagin invariants. The key ingredient is the formulation of the BRST transformations in terms of polyforms, whose total degree is the sum of the form degree and of the ghost number. This approach simplifies significantly the analysis available in literature and it allows to compute many other solutions. Namely, an anomaly, which was computed using different methods, is proved to be a consistent BRST anomaly, thereby supplementing a conclusion in a previous analysis.</description>

      <title>Schr\"odinger symmetry: a historical review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper reviews the history of the conformal extension of Galilean symmetry, now called Schr\"odinger symmetry. In the physics literature, its discovery is commonly attributed to Jackiw, Niederer and Hagen (1972). However, Schr\"odinger symmetry has a much older ancestry: the associated conserved quantities were known to Jacobi in 1842/43 and its euclidean counterpart was discovered by Sophus Lie in 1881 in his studies of the heat equation. A convenient way to study Schr\"odinger symmetry is provided by a non-relativistic Kaluza-Klein-type "Bargmann" framework, first proposed by Eisenhart (1929), but then forgotten and re-discovered by Duval {\it et al.} only in 1984. Representations of Schr\"odinger symmetry differ by the value $z=2$ of the dynamical exponent from the value $z=1$ found in representations of relativistic conformal invariance. For generic values of $z$, whole families of new algebras exist, which for $z=2/\ell$ include the $\ell$-conformal galilean algebras. We also review the non-relativistic limit of conformal algebras and that this limit leads to the $1$-conformal galilean algebra and not to the Schr\"odinger algebra. The latter can be recovered in the Bargmann framework through reduction. A distinctive feature of Galilean and Schr\"odinger symmetries are the Bargmann super-selection rules, algebraically related to a central extension. An empirical consequence of this was known as "mass conservation" already to Lavoisier. As an illustration of these concepts, some applications to physical ageing in simple model systems are reviewed.</description>

      <title>Warped CFT duals of the Pleba\'nski-Demia\'nski family of solutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10061v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the symmetry properties of the complete family of type D spacetimes generalized form the Pleba\'nski-Demia\'nski solution in four dimensions holographically in terms of a warped CFT. The generalized Pleba\'nski-Demia\'nski solutions are black hole-like spacetimes characterized by seven physical parameters. Most of the black holes in four dimensions are included within this family. Generically consider a solution with horizon in this family, we figure out the possible warped conformal symmetry attached to the horizon. The horizon can be either extremal or non-extremal. In the extremal case, the near horizon region can be mapped to an infinite spacetime with geometry given by a warped and twist product of AdS$_2$ and S$^2$. The new boundary conditions for AdS$_2$ as well as their higher dimensional uplifts are applied here to manifest the asymptotic symmetry as the warped conformal symmetry. In the non-extremal case, the global warped conformal symmetry is singled out by analyzing the scalar wave equation with constant frequency. The local warped conformal symmetries are represented by the charge algebra associated to the vector fields which preserve the scalar wave equation as well as its frequency. In defining the variation of the covariant charges, a proper counterterm is introduced for consistency conditions which is supposed to be suitable for all the solutions within the family. As a consistency check, the horizon entropy is reproduced by the entropy formula of the warped CFT by using its modular covariance and the central terms derived in the bulk spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a coordinate-free background space construction of Euclidean Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity. It is written as a gauge theory that utilizes the Killing vectors and conformal Killing vectors of a hyperboloid embedded in a three dimensional background. A novel feature of the gauge theory is that vanishing field strength does not necessarily imply that the gauge potentials are pure gauges, not even locally. As is usual, metric tensors are dynamically generated from the classical solutions of the theory, which here do not rely on coordinate charts on the two-dimensional surface. We find a special class of solutions whereby the derived metric tensor on the surface is the induced metric from the background space. The gauge theory construction given here has a natural generalization to a non-commutative space, which does not require the use of coordinates, symbols or a star product.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that quantum circuit complexity for the unitary time evolution operator of any time-independent Hamiltonian is bounded by linear growth at early times, independent of any choices of the fundamental gates or cost metric. Deviations from linear early-time growth arise from the commutation algebra of the gates and are manifestly negative for any circuit, decreasing the linear growth rate and leading to a bound on the growth rate of complexity of a circuit at early times. We illustrate this general result by applying it to qubit and harmonic oscillator systems, including the coupled and anharmonic oscillator. By discretizing free and interacting scalar field theories on a lattice, we are also able to extract the early-time behavior and dependence on the lattice spacing of complexity of these field theories in the continuum limit, demonstrating how this approach applies to systems that have been previously difficult to study using existing techniques for quantum circuit complexity.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the weak cosmic censorship conjecture (WCCC) for the Reissner-Nordstrom (R-N) AdS black hole in a restricted phase space thermodynamics (RPST). Also here, we consider energy flux and equivalence mass-energy principle and examine the weak gravity conjecture (WGC) and the weak cosmic censorship conjecture. The incoming and outgoing energy flux leads to changes in the black hole. In that case, by applying the first law, we examined whether the second law of thermodynamics is valid. And also one can say that, in the case where absorption and superradiance are in the saturated to an equilibrium. Also, by using the thermodynamics of black holes in the restricted phase space, we show that if the black hole is in an extreme or close to an extreme state with radiation and particle absorption, the weak cosmic censorship conjecture is established. In addition, with the help of equivalence mass and energy principle and second-order approximation, in the near extremity, we find that when the black hole radiates and its central charge is greater than the scaled electric charge, the superradiance particles obey the weak gravity conjecture, and this causes the black hole to move further away from its extreme state. But when the particles that obey the weak gravity conjecture are attracted to the black hole when the black hole is very small. Then, in this case, we note that the black hole becomes closer to its extreme state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04781v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The double-cone geometry is a saddle of the gravitational path integral, which explains the chaotic statistics of the spectrum of black hole microstates. This geometry is the usual AdS-Schwarzschild black hole, but with a periodic identification of the time coordinate; the resulting singularity at the black hole horizon is regulated by making the geometry slightly complex. Here, we consider generalizations of the double-cone geometry which include the Lorentzian cosmology that sits between the event horizon and the black hole singularity. We analyze this in two and three dimensions, where the cosmology has compact spatial sections and big bang/crunch singularities. These singularities are regulated in the same way by slightly complexifying the metric. We show that this is possible while satisfying the Kontsevich-Segal criterion, implying that these geometries can be interpreted as perturbatively stable saddle points in general relativity. This procedure leads to a novel description of the cosmology in terms of standard observables in the dual boundary CFT. In three dimensions, the cosmological solution gives a new contribution to the two-point function of the density of states in the boundary CFT. Unlike the usual double cone, it describes correlations between black hole microstates with different masses, and in a limit describes correlations between the statistics of heavy states and states near the BTZ threshold.</description>

      <title>Quantizing Carrollian field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Carrollian field theories have recently emerged as a candidate dual to flat space quantum gravity. We carefully quantize simple two-derivative Carrollian theories, revealing a strong sensitivity to the ultraviolet. They can be regulated upon being placed on a spatial lattice and working at finite inverse temperature. Unlike in conventional field theories, the details of the lattice-regulated Carrollian theories remain important at long distances even in the limit that the lattice spacing is sent to zero. We use that limit to define interacting continuum models with a tractable perturbative expansion. The ensuing theories are those of generalized free fields, with non-Gaussian correlations suppressed by positive powers of the lattice spacing, and an unbroken supertranslation symmetry.</description>

      <title>Kink-antikink collisions in hyper-massive models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study topological kinks and their interactions in a family of scalar field models with a double well potential parametrized by the mass of small perturbations around the vacua, ranging from the mass of the $\phi^4$ Klein-Gordon model all the way to the limit of infinite mass, which is identified with a non-analytic potential. In particular, we look at the problem of kink-antikink collisions and analyze the windows of capture and escape of the soliton pair as a function of collision velocity and model mass. We observe a disappearance of the capture cases for intermediary masses between the $\phi^4$ and non-analytic cases. The main features of the kink-antikink scattering are reproduced in a collective coordinates model, including the disappearance of the capture cases.</description>

      <title>Manifestly Covariant Worldline Actions from Coadjoint Orbits. Part II: Twistorial Descriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Worldline actions for various twistor particles in AdS spacetimes are constructed from the coadjoint orbits of $Sp(4,\mathbb R)$, $SU(2,2)$ and $O^*(8)$ as constrained Hamiltonian systems. The constraints are associated with the coadjoint orbits of the dual groups, respectively identified as $O(p,M-p)$, $U(p, M-p)$ and $Sp(p, M-p)$. These actions are presented in a universal form by making use of the twistor variables taking value in $\mathbb R$, $\mathbb C$ and $\mathbb H$, respectively. We find that the massless, massive and the conformal particles (namely the singletons) of any spins appear for the compact dual groups with $p=0$ reproducing many of the results in earlier literature, whereas more exotic particle species, such as various tachyons, continuous spin particles and BdS particles appear for the non-compact dual groups.</description>

      <title>A note on defect stability in $d=4-\varepsilon$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the space of scalar line, surface and interface defect field theories in $d=4-\varepsilon$ by examining their stability properties under generic deformations. Examples are known of multiple stable line defect Conformal Field Theories (dCFTs) existing simultaneously, unlike the case of normal multiscalar field theories where a theorem by Michel guarantees that the stable fixed point is the unique global minimum of a so-called $A$-function. We prove that a suitable modification of Michel's theorem survives for line defect theories, with fixed points locally rather than globally minimizing an $A$-function along a specified surface in coupling space and provide a novel classification of the fixed points in the hypertetrahedral line defect model. For surface defects Michel's theorem survives almost untouched, and we explore bulk models for which the symmetry preserving defect is the unique stable point. In the case of interface theories, we prove that for any critical bulk model there can exist no fixed points stable under generic deformations for $N\geq 6$.</description>

      <title>Analytic two-Loop four-point form factor of the stress-tensor supermultiplet in ${\cal N}=4$ SYM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the two-loop four-point MHV form factor of the stress-tensor supermultiplet in planar ${\cal N}=4$ super Yang-Mills (SYM). This form factor is analogous to the Higgs plus four-gluon amplitudes in the heavy-top limit of QCD when translated to the ${\cal N}=4$ SYM context. We obtain the full $D$-dimensional integrands up to two loops via unitarity-cut methods. Subsequently, we utilize IBP reduction to express the result in terms of a set of uniformly transcendental basis integrals, incorporating the two-loop non-planar five-point one-mass integrals recently given by Abreu et al. [PRL 132 (2024) 14]. We obtain the two-loop finite remainder in the functional form in terms of the pentagon functions. The symbol of our remainder confirms the bootstrap results reported by Dixon et al. [PRL 130 (2023) 11]. We perform various non-trivial checks of our results, including the triple-collinear limit, which recovers the two-loop six-gluon remainder. We also show that the form factor has a directional dual conformal symmetry at the integrand level. Our results are expected to shed further light on the study of antipodal dualities and the computation of Higgs plus four-parton amplitudes in QCD.</description>

      <title>Pauli equation and charged spin-1/2 particle in a weak gravitational field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.10848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the nonrelativistic approximation in the curved-space Dirac equation, the analog of the Pauli equation is derived for a weak gravitational field with a gauge fixing condition related to the synchronous gauge, in the presence of an electromagnetic field. Different from the previous works which were employing either the exact or conventional Foldy-Wouthuysen transformations, here we perform calculations by directly performing nonrelativistic approximation which reduced in the power series expansion in the inverse mass of the spinning particle. On top of that, the equations of motion for the massive spin-$1/2$ charged particle are obtained. The two particular cases of the previously explored backgrounds, namely a) plane gravitational wave and b) homogeneous static gravitational field are considered for control. In the case a) we meet correspondence with the previous results. On the other hand, in case b), there is no correspondence with neither perturbative nor with exact Foldy-Wouthuysen transformations, which we also recalculate and agree with the previous works. The disagreement is a kind of a theoretical challenge and most likely occurs because the potential energy, in the particular case of Newtonian approximation, is proportional to the mass of the particle.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Early Galaxy Formation in JWST from Axion Dark Matter?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that enhanced early galaxy formation can generically arise in axion-like particle (ALP) dark matter (DM) models with a delayed onset of axion field oscillation. In these models, the formation of localized massive objects enhances structure formation, potentially addressing the excess recently observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), while remaining consistent with existing constraints. We identify viable parameter space with the ALP mass in the range of $10^{-22}~{\rm eV}&lt;m_a&lt;10^{-19}~\rm eV$. In addition, we show that the ALP parameter regions of interest can lead to intriguing complementary signatures in the small-scale structure of DM halos and existing experimental searches for ALPs.</description>

      <title>Dynamical tidal Love numbers of Kerr-like compact objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a framework to compute the tidal response of a Kerr-like compact object in terms of its reflectivity, compactness, and spin, both in the static and the frequency-dependent case. Here we focus on the low-frequency regime, which can be solved fully analytically. We highlight some remarkable novel features, in particular: i) Even in the zero-frequency limit, the tidal Love numbers (TLNs) depend on the linear-in-frequency dependence of the object's reflectivity in a nontrivial way. ii) Intriguingly, the static limit of the frequency-dependent TLNs is discontinuous, therefore the static TLNs differ from the static limit of the (phenomenologically more interesting) frequency-dependent TLNs. This shows that earlier findings regarding the static TLNs of ultracompact objects correspond to a measure-zero region in the parameter space, though the logarithmic behavior of the TLNs in the black hole limit is retained. iii) In the non-rotating case, the TLNs generically vanish in the zero-frequency limit (just like for a black hole), except when the reflectivity is ${\cal R}=1+{\cal O}(M\omega)$, in which case they vanish with a model-dependent scaling, which is generically logarithmic, in the black-hole limit. The TLNs initially grow with frequency, for any nonzero reflectivity, and then display oscillations and resonances tied up with the quasi-normal modes of the object. iv) For rotating compact objects, the TLNs decrease when the reflectivity decreases or the rotation parameter increases. Our results lay the theoretical groundwork to develop model-independent tests of the nature of compact objects using tidal effects in gravitational-wave signals.</description>

      <title>The Principle of Maximum Conformality Correctly Resolves the Renormalization-Scheme-Dependence Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we clarify a serious misinterpretation and consequent misuse of the Principle of Maximum Conformality (PMC). In a recently published article~\cite{Stevenson:2023isz}, P.~M. Stevenson has claimed that ``the PMC is ineffective and does nothing to resolve the renormalization-scheme-dependence problem", concluding incorrectly that the success of PMC predictions is due to the PMC being a ``laborious, \emph{ad hoc}, back-door" version of the principle of minimum sensitivity (PMS). We show that such conclusions are incorrect, deriving from a misinterpretation of the PMC and overestimation of the applicability of the PMS. The purpose of the PMC is to achieve precise fixed-order pQCD predictions, free from conventional renormalization-scheme and renormalization-scale ambiguities. We demonstrate that the PMC predictions satisfy all of the self-consistency conditions of the renormalization group and standard renormalization-group invariance; the PMC predictions are thus independent of any initial choice of renormalization scheme and scale. The scheme independence of the PMC is also ensured by Commensurate Scale Relations which relate different observables to each other. Owing to the elimination of the factorially-divergent renormalon terms, the PMC series has better convergence behavior than the conventional series; it substantially suppresses any residual scale dependence due to unknown higher-order terms; and it thus provides a reliable basis for estimating the contributions of unknown higher-order terms. Thus, the PMC, based on the standard renormalization group invariance, has a rigorous foundation, eliminates the factorially divergent renormalon contributions, as well as eliminating unnecessary systematic errors which underly high-precision pQCD predictions. The PMC can thus be rigorously applied to virtually all high-energy hadronic processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06095v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss rapidly rotating states of a superfluid. We concentrate on the Giant-Vortex (GV) state, which is a coherent rotating solution with a macroscopic hole at the center. We show that, for any trap, the fluctuations obey an approximately chiral dispersion relation, describing arbitrary shape deformations moving with the speed of the ambient superfluid. This dispersion relation is a consequence of a peculiar infinite symmetry group that emerges at large angular velocity and implies an infinite ground-state degeneracy. The degeneracy is lifted by small corrections which we determine both for smooth traps and the hard trap.</description>

      <title>Effects of gravity rainbow on scalar bosonic and oscillator fields in Bonnor-Melvin space-time with a cosmological constant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the relativistic quantum motion of spin-zero scalar charge-free particles influenced by rainbow gravity's (RG's) in Bonnor-Melvin magnetic space-time, a four-dimensional solution featuring a positive cosmological constant. We solve the Klein-Gordon equation in this scenario by using two sets of rainbow function: (i) $f(\chi)=\frac{1}{(1-\beta\,\chi)}$,\,\, $h(\chi)=1$ and (ii) $f(\chi)=\frac{1}{(1-\beta\,\chi)}=h(\chi)$, where $0 &lt; \chi\left(=\frac{|E|}{E_p}\right) \leq 1$ with $E_p$ being the Planck's energy, $E$ is the particle's energy, and $\beta$ is the rainbow parameter. Furthermore, we study the relativistic quantum oscillator through the Klein-Gordon oscillator equation in the same Bonnor-Melvin magnetic space-time under RG effects. Employing the first pair of rainbow function, we obtain an approximate eigenvalue solution of the quantum oscillator fields. Notably, we demonstrate that the relativistic energy profile of scalar and oscillator particles are influenced by the topology of the geometry and the cosmological constant which is related with the magnetic field strength lies along the symmetry axis. Additionally, we see the impact of rainbow parameter on these approximate relativistic energy profiles in both quantum systems.</description>

Abstract: We perform observational confrontation and cosmographic analysis of $f(T,T_G)$ gravity and cosmology. This higher-order torsional gravity is based on both the torsion scalar, as well as on the teleparallel equivalent of the Gauss--Bonnet combination, and gives rise to an effective dark-energy sector which depends on the extra torsion contributions. We employ observational data from the Hubble function and supernova Type Ia Pantheon datasets, applying a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling technique, and we provide the iso-likelihood contours, as well as the best-fit values for the parameters of the power-law model, an ansatz which is expected to be a good approximation of most realistic deviations from general relativity. Additionally, we reconstruct the effective dark-energy equation-of-state parameter, which exhibits a quintessence-like behavior, while in the future the Universe enters into the phantom regime, before it tends asymptotically to the cosmological constant value. Furthermore, we perform a detailed cosmographic analysis, examining the deceleration, jerk, snap, and lerk parameters, showing that the transition to acceleration occurs in the redshift range $ 0.52 \leq z_{tr} \leq 0.89 $, as well as the preference of the scenario for quintessence-like behavior. Finally, we apply the Om</description>

      <title>Existence and absence of Killing horizons in static solutions with symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Without specifying a matter field nor imposing energy conditions, we study Killing horizons in $n(\ge 3)$-dimensional static solutions in general relativity with an $(n-2)$-dimensional Einstein base manifold. Assuming linear relations $p_{\rm r}\simeq\chi_{\rm r} \rho$ and $p_2\simeq\chi_{\rm t} \rho$ near a Killing horizon between the energy density $\rho$, radial pressure $p_{\rm r}$, and tangential pressure $p_2$ of the matter field, we prove that any non-vacuum solution satisfying $\chi_{\rm r}&lt;-1/3$ ($\chi_{\rm r}\ne -1$) or $\chi_{\rm r}&gt;0$ does not admit a horizon as it becomes a curvature singularity. For $\chi_{\rm r}=-1$ and $\chi_{\rm r}\in[-1/3,0)$, non-vacuum solutions admit Killing horizons, on which there exists a matter field only for $\chi_{\rm r}=-1$ and $-1/3$, which are of the Hawking-Ellis type~I and type~II, respectively. Differentiability of the metric on the horizon depends on the value of $\chi_{\rm r}$, and non-analytic extensions beyond the horizon are allowed for $\chi_{\rm r}\in[-1/3,0)$. In particular, solutions can be attached to the Schwarzschild-Tangherlini-type vacuum solution at the Killing horizon in at least a $C^{1,1}$ regular manner without a lightlike thin shell. We generalize some of those results in Lovelock gravity with a maximally symmetric base manifold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relaxing the postulates of an axiomatic theory is a natural way to find more general theories, and historically, the discovery of non-Euclidean geometry is a famous example of this procedure. Here, we use this way to extend quantum mechanics by ignoring the heart of Heisenberg's quantum mechanics -- We do not assume the existence of a position operator that satisfies the Heisenberg commutation relation, $[\hat x,\hat p]=i\hbar$. The remaining axioms of quantum theory, besides Galilean symmetry, lead to a more general quantum theory with a free parameter $l_0$ of length dimension, such that as $l_0 \to 0$ the theory reduces to standard quantum theory. Perhaps surprisingly, this non-Heisenberg quantum theory, without a priori assumption of the non-commutation relation, leads to a modified Heisenberg uncertainty relation, $\Delta x \Delta p\geq \sqrt{\hbar^2/4+l_0^2(\Delta p)^2}$, which ensures the existence of a minimal position uncertainty, $l_0$, as expected from various quantum gravity studies. By comparing the results of this framework with some observed data, which includes the first longitudinal normal modes of the bar gravitational wave detector AURIGA and the $1S-2S$ transition in the hydrogen atom, we obtain upper bounds on the $l_0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15276v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unitary operators are employed to investigate the violation of the Bell-CHSH inequality. The ensuing modifications affecting both classical and quantum bounds are elucidated. The relevance of a particular class of unitary operators whose expectation values are real is pointed out. For these operators, the classical and quantum bounds remain unaltered, being given, respectively, by $2$ and $2\sqrt{2}$. As an example, the Weyl unitary operators for a real scalar field in relativistic Quantum Field Theory are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15921v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain the gravitational emission from particles scattering via the Yukawa interaction, presenting both classical and approximate quantum results. We also estimate the contribution from the tensor part of the internucleon interaction. This emission is the main source of a very-high frequency component to the stochastic background in the Solar System and in neutron stars. The emission from the Sun (allowing for Debye screening) and from a typical neutron star are obtained. The gravitational wave luminosity of the Sun is $41 \pm 10$ MW.</description>

      <title>Testing the standardizability of, and deriving cosmological constraints from, a new Amati-correlated gamma-ray burst data compilation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By using gamma-ray burst (GRB) data to simultaneously constrain Amati correlation parameters and cosmological parameters in six spatially-flat and nonflat dark energy cosmological models, we show that an updated 220 GRB version of the Jia et al. [Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc. 516, 2575 (2022)] GRB data compilation are standardizable through the Amati correlation and so can be used for cosmological analyses. However, the resulting GRB data constraints on the current value of the nonrelativistic matter density parameter, $\Omega_{m0}$, are in $&gt;2\sigma$ tension with those from a joint analysis of better-established Hubble parameter [$H(z)$] and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data for most of the cosmological models we consider, indicating that these GRB data cannot be jointly used with better-established $H(z)$ + BAO data to constrain cosmological parameters.</description>

      <title>Gross-Neveu-Yukawa theory of $\text{SO}(2N)\rightarrow \text{SO}(N) \times \text{SO}(N)$ spontaneous symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01681v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct and study the relativistic Gross-Neveu-Yukawa field theory for the $\text{SO}(2N)$ real symmetric second-rank tensor order parameter coupled to $N_f$ flavors of $4N$-component Majorana fermions in 2+1 dimensions. Such a tensor order parameter unifies all Lorentz-invariant mass-gap orders for $N$ two-component Dirac fermions in two dimensions except for the $\text{SO}(2N)$-singlet anomalous quantum Hall state. The value $N_f=1$ corresponds to the canonical Gross-Neveu model. Within the leading-order $\epsilon$-expansion around the upper critical dimension of $3+1$ the field theory exhibits a critical fixed point in its renormalization group flow which describes spontaneous symmetry breaking to $\text{SO}(N)\times \text{SO}(N)$ for the number of flavors of Majorana fermions higher than a critical value $N_{f,c2}\approx 2N$. For $N_{f, c1}&lt; N_f &lt; N_{f,c2}$ , with $N_{f,c1} \approx N$ the critical fixed point resides in the unstable region of the theory where the effective potential is unbounded from below, whereas for $N_f &lt; N_{f,c1}$ there is no real critical fixed point, and the flow runs away. In either case, for $N_f &lt; N_{f,c2}$ the transition should become fluctuation-induced first-order, and we discuss the dependence of its size on the parameters $N$ and $N_{f}$ in the theory. One-loop critical exponents for the universality class at $N_{f, c2}&lt; N_f $ are computed and the flow diagram in various regimes is discussed.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the influence of graviton fluctuations on the inflationary spectrum with a Kucha\v{r}-Torre clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the search for a coherent and consistent formulation to describe quantum gravity corrections to Quantum Field Theory. We implement two fundamental ingredients discussed in previous analyses: on one hand, the construction of the Wentzel-Kramer-Brillouin and Born-Oppenheimer picture for the Wheeler-DeWitt theory of gravity and matter by using a reference fluid as physical clock; on the other hand, we explicitly separate in the metric field its own purely classical contribution from the quantum graviton degrees of freedom. This allows to derive, by the expansion in a Planckian parameter, a unitary theory properly evaluating the Quantum Field Theory modifications in the considered regime. More specifically, we recover at zero order the standard theory on curved space-time after averaging over the graviton sector. The physical corrections are induced at first order by (quantum) gravitons, thought as the slow-varying component of the system, as opposed to the fast quantum matter and reference fluid. The genuine contribution due to gravitons, non-factorizable into an independent phase, provides a coherent quantum gravity modification on Quantum Field Theory. We show this by determining the predicted inflationary spectrum during an exact de Sitter phase of the primordial Universe, finding a breaking of the scale invariant morphology even when the inflation potential is modelled by a cosmological constant term. Remarkably, the behavior of such non-scale-invariant spectrum overlaps predictions previously obtained in literature by neglecting non-unitary terms emerging in those formulations. In this respect, the present model provides a satisfactory regularization of such approaches, by virtue of a more realistic construction of the physical clock for the total (gravity + matter) quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Spectrum-preserving deformations of integrable spin chains with open boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17171v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discover a family of local deformations that leave part of the spectrum intact for strongly interacting and exactly solvable quantum many-body systems. Since the deformation preserves the Bethe Ansatz equations (BAE), it is dubbed the iso-BAE flow. Although all theories on the flow share the same BAE, the spectra are different. Part of the spectrum remains intact along the whole flow. Such states are protected by an emergent symmetry. The remaining parts of the spectrum change continuously along the flow and are doubly degenerate for even length spin chains. For odd length chains, the deformed spectrum also comprises doubly degenerate pairs apart from the sector with magnon number $(L+1)/2$, where $L$ is the length of the spin chain. We discuss the iso-BAE flow for the ${\rm XXX}_{1/2}$ model in detail and show that the iso-BAE flows exist for more general models including $q$-deformed XXZ as well as higher spin ${\rm XXX}_{s}$ spin chains.</description>

Abstract: We study closed string evolution in the pp-wave spacetime assuming different pulse shapes (square and sech-squared) in the exact gravitational wave metric. It is shown that the shape of a circular closed string deforms permanently, after the pulse has departed. The worldsheet geometry also displays characteristic permanent changes caused by the gravitational wave pulse. The above effects collectively demonstrate features akin to what is known as `memory' in gravitational wave physics.</description>

      <title>Is the type-D NUT C-metric really "missing" from the most general Pleba\'nski-Demia\'nski solution?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06733v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It remains a long-standing problem, unsettled for almost two decades in General Relativity (GR) community, ever since Griffiths and Podolsky demonstrated in Ref. [J.B. Griffiths and J. Podolsky, Class. Quant. Grav. 22, 3467 (2005)] that the type-D NUT C-metric seems to be absent from the most general family of the type-D Pleba\'nski-Demia\'nski (P-D) solution. However, Astorino [Phys. Rev. D 109, 084038 (2024)] presented a different form of rotating and accelerating black holes and showed that all known four-dimensional type-D accelerating black holes (without the NUT charge) can be recovered via various different limits in a definitive fashion. In particular, he provided, for the first time, the correct expressions for the type-D static accelerating black holes with a nonzero NUT charge, which was previously impossible using the traditional parametrization of the familiar P-D solution. Nevertheless, it still remains elusive that how these two different forms of the four-dimensional rotating and accelerating solutions are related. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by finding the obvious coordinate transformations and parameter identifications between the vacuum metrics after two different parameterizations of the generated solution via the inverse scattering method from the seed metric -- the Rindler vacuum background. We then resolve this ``missing" puzzle by providing another M\"{o}bius transformation and linear combinations of the Killing coordinates, which clearly cast the type-D NUT C-metric into the familiar form of the P-D solution. Additionally, we propose an alternative new routine for the normalization of the obtained metric derived via the inverse scattering method from the vacuum seed solution, which could be potentially useful for the construction of higher-dimensional solutions using the trivial vacuum background as the seed metric.</description>

      <title>Algebraic classification of the gravitational field in general metric-affine geometries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the algebraic classification of the gravitational field in four-dimensional general metric-affine geometries, thus extending the current results of the literature in the particular framework of Weyl-Cartan geometry by the presence of the traceless nonmetricity tensor. This quantity switches on four of the eleven fundamental parts of the irreducible representation of the curvature tensor under the pseudo-orthogonal group, in such a way that three of them present similar algebraic types as the ones obtained in Weyl-Cartan geometry, whereas the remaining one includes thirty independent components and gives rise to a new algebraic classification. The latter is derived by means of its principal null directions and their levels of alignment, obtaining a total number of sixteen main algebraic types, which can be split into many subtypes. As an immediate application, we determine the algebraic types of the broadest family of static and spherically symmetric black hole solutions with spin, dilation and shear charges in Metric-Affine Gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study the properties of charged gravastars in torsion-based $f(\mathbb{T})$ gravity in the presence of noncommutative geometry. We have taken the interior from noncommutative motivated space-time, noting that why, from a physical point of view, such a choice is justified, then we have taken the thin shell as stiff matter and taken three different exterior metrics (Reissner-Nordstrom (R-N), Bardeen and Ayon-Beato-Garcia (ABG) metric) to construct the gravastar model. We have studied the physical properties like proper length, entropy, energy, and EoS for these models, and we have also used Israel junction conditions to study the effective pressure, energy density, and potential of the thin shell. Finally, we comment on the stability of such a thin shell and the deflection angle caused by such a thin shell, which could, in principle, be tested by future radio telescopes like the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT).</description>

      <title>Mpemba Meets Quantum Chaos: Anomalous Relaxation and Mpemba Crossings in Dissipative Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06669v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Mpemba effect (MPE), named after a student who first observed the phenomenon, has intrigued scientists for decades by showing that hot liquid can freeze faster than cold under certain conditions. Recently, analogous effects have been identified in integrable quantum systems. However, a key distinction between the classical MPE and its quantum analog is that the latter relies predominantly on the of the properties of the initial states rather than the cooling rate. In this paper, we explore the quench dynamics of Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) systems coupled to thermal baths. We investigate three scenarios--SYK systems coupled to SYK thermal baths, SYK systems coupled to two thermal baths at different temperatures, and dissipative SYKs modeled by the Lindblad equation. In the regimes where the system and the baths are strongly coupled, we observe effective temperature oscillations and Mpemba crossings (MPCs)--the effect of temperature crossings which are absent in quasi-equilibrium thermodynamic analysis--when the system is strongly coupled to SYK thermal baths. These effects are not observed in the Liouvillian formalism. The emergence of MPCs in quantum chaotic systems exhibits strong parallels with the classical MPE.</description>

      <title>A New-Old Approach to Composite Scalars with Chiral Fermion Constituents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a dynamical, Lorentz invariant theory of composite scalars in configuration space consisting of chiral fermions, interacting by the perturbative exchange of a massive "gluon" of coupling $g_0$ and mass $M_0^2$ (the coloron model). The formalism is inspired by, but goes beyond, old ideas of Yukawa and the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. It yields a non-pointlike internal wave-function of the bound state, $\phi(r)$, which satisfies a Schr\"odinger-Klein-Gordon (SKG) equation with eigenvalue $\mu^2$. For super-critical coupling, $g_0 &gt;g_{0c}$, we have $\mu^2&lt; 0$ leading to spontaneous symmetry breaking. The binding of chiral fermions is semiclassical, and not loop-level as in NJL. The mass scale is determined by the interaction as in NJL. We mainly focus on the short-distance, large $M_0^2$ limit, yielding an NJL pointlike interaction, but the bound state internal wave-function, $\phi(r)$, remains spatially extended and dilutes $\phi(0)$. This leads to power-law suppression of the induced Yukawa and quartic couplings and requires radically less fine-tuning of a hierarchy than does the NJL model. We include a discussion of loop corrections of the theory. A realistic top--condensation model appears possible.</description>

      <title>Validity of black hole complementarity in an accelerating Schwarzschild black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Black hole complementarity has been well understood in spherically symmetric black holes. To study its validity for an accelerating Schwarzschild black hole, which has a preferred direction, we perform the thought experiment proposed by Susskind and Thorlacius and further investigate the criteria set by Hayden and Preskill. First, we derive thermodynamic quantities that satisfy the first law of thermodynamics. Using these quantities, we conduct thought experiments based on the Page time and the scrambling time, which show that black hole complementarity remains valid, although the energy required for the duplication of information depends on the angle due to the axisymmetric metric.</description>
