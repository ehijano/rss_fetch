      <title>High-Efficiency Urban 3D Radio Map Estimation Based on Sparse Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent widespread applications for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) -- from infrastructure inspection to urban logistics -- have prompted an urgent need for high-accuracy three-dimensional (3D) radio maps. However, existing methods designed for two-dimensional radio maps face challenges of high measurement costs and limited data availability when extended to 3D scenarios. To tackle these challenges, we first build a real-world large-scale 3D radio map dataset, covering over 4.2 million m^3 and over 4 thousand data points in complex urban environments. We propose a Gaussian Process Regression-based scheme for 3D radio map estimation, allowing us to realize more accurate map recovery with a lower RMSE than state-of-the-art schemes by over 2.5 dB. To further enhance data efficiency, we propose two methods for training point selection, including an offline clustering-based method and an online maximum a posterior (MAP)-based method. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed scheme not only achieves full-map recovery with only 2% of UAV measurements, but also sheds light on future studies on 3D radio maps.</description>

      <title>On many-to-one mappings over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The definition of many-to-one mapping, or $m$-to-$1$ mapping for short, between two finite sets is introduced in this paper, which unifies and generalizes the definitions of $2$-to-$1$ mappings and $n$-to-$1$ mappings. A generalized local criterion is given, which is an abstract criterion for a mapping to be $m$-to-$1$. By employing the generalized local criterion, three constructions of $m$-to-$1$ mapping are proposed, which unify and generalize all the previous constructions of $2$-to-$1$ mappings and $n$-to-$1$ mappings. Then the $m$-to-$1$ property of polynomials $f(x) = x^r h(x^s)$ on $\mathbb{F}_{q}^{*}$ is studied by using these three constructions. A series of explicit conditions for~$f$ to be an $m$-to-$1$ mapping on $\mathbb{F}_{q}^{*}$ are found through the detailed discussion of the parameters $m$, $s$, $q$ and the polynomial $h$. These results extend many conclusions in the literature.</description>

      <title>Transforming Time-Varying to Static Channels: The Power of Fluid Antenna Mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the mobility problem with the assistance of fluid antenna (FA) on the user equipment (UE) side. We propose a matrix pencil-based moving port (MPMP) prediction method, which may transform the time-varying channel to a static channel by timely sliding the liquid. Different from the existing channel prediction method, we design a moving port selection method, which is the first attempt to transform the channel prediction to the port prediction by exploiting the movability of FA. Theoretical analysis shows that for the line-ofsight (LoS) channel, the prediction error of our proposed MPMP method may converge to zero, as the number of BS antennas and the port density of the FA are large enough. For a multi-path channel, we also derive the upper and lower bounds of the prediction error when the number of paths is large enough. When the UEs move at a speed of 60 or 120 km/h, simulation results show that, with the assistance of FA, our proposed MPMP method performs better than the existing channel prediction method.</description>

      <title>Feedback Design with VQ-VAE for Robust Precoding in Multi-User FDD Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we propose a vector quantized-variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE)-based feedback scheme for robust precoder design in multi-user frequency division duplex (FDD) systems. We demonstrate how the VQ-VAE can be tailored to specific propagation environments, focusing on systems with low pilot overhead, which is crucial in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO). Extensive simulations with real-world measurement data show that our proposed feedback scheme outperforms state-of-the-art autoencoder (AE)-based compression schemes and conventional Discrete Fourier transform (DFT) codebook-based schemes. These improvements enable the deployment of systems with fewer feedback bits or pilots.</description>

      <title>GNN-Based Joint Channel and Power Allocation in Heterogeneous Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optimal allocation of channels and power resources plays a crucial role in ensuring minimal interference, maximal data rates, and efficient energy utilisation. As a successful approach for tackling resource management problems in wireless networks, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have attracted a lot of attention. This article proposes a GNN-based algorithm to address the joint resource allocation problem in heterogeneous wireless networks. Concretely, we model the heterogeneous wireless network as a heterogeneous graph and then propose a graph neural network structure intending to allocate the available channels and transmit power to maximise the network throughput. Our proposed joint channel and power allocation graph neural network (JCPGNN) comprises a shared message computation layer and two task-specific layers, with a dedicated focus on channel and power allocation tasks, respectively. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves satisfactory performance but with higher computational efficiency compared to traditional optimisation algorithms.</description>

      <title>pyBregMan: A Python library for Bregman Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Bregman manifold is a synonym for a dually flat space in information geometry which admits as a canonical divergence a Bregman divergence. Bregman manifolds are induced by smooth strictly convex functions like the cumulant or partition functions of regular exponential families, the negative entropy of mixture families, or the characteristic functions of regular cones just to list a few such convex Bregman generators. We describe the design of pyBregMan, a library which implements generic operations on Bregman manifolds and instantiate several common Bregman manifolds used in information sciences. At the core of the library is the notion of Legendre-Fenchel duality inducing a canonical pair of dual potential functions and dual Bregman divergences. The library also implements the Fisher-Rao manifolds of categorical/multinomial distributions and multivariate normal distributions. To demonstrate the use of the pyBregMan kernel manipulating those Bregman and Fisher-Rao manifolds, the library also provides several core algorithms for various applications in statistics, machine learning, information fusion, and so on.</description>

      <title>On the Generalization for Transfer Learning: An Information-Theoretic Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.05377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transfer learning, or domain adaptation, is concerned with machine learning problems in which training and testing data come from possibly different probability distributions. In this work, we give an information-theoretic analysis of the generalization error and excess risk of transfer learning algorithms. Our results suggest, perhaps as expected, that the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence $D(\mu\|\mu')$ plays an important role in the characterizations where $\mu$ and $\mu'$ denote the distribution of the training data and the testing data, respectively. Specifically, we provide generalization error and excess risk upper bounds for learning algorithms where data from both distributions are available in the training phase. Recognizing that the bounds could be sub-optimal in general, we provide improved excess risk upper bounds for a certain class of algorithms, including the empirical risk minimization (ERM) algorithm, by making stronger assumptions through the \textit{central condition}. To demonstrate the usefulness of the bounds, we further extend the analysis to the Gibbs algorithm and the noisy stochastic gradient descent method. We then generalize the mutual information bound with other divergences such as $\phi$-divergence and Wasserstein distance, which may lead to tighter bounds and can handle the case when $\mu$ is not absolutely continuous with respect to $\mu'$. Several numerical results are provided to demonstrate our theoretical findings. Lastly, to address the problem that the bounds are often not directly applicable in practice due to the absence of the distributional knowledge of the data, we develop an algorithm (called InfoBoost) that dynamically adjusts the importance weights for both source and target data based on certain information measures. The empirical results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Linearity of $\mathbb{Z}_{2^L}$-Linear Codes via Schur Product</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12291v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an innovative approach to investigating the linearity of $\mathbb{Z}_{2^L}$-linear codes derived from $\mathbb{Z}_{2^L}$-additive codes using the generalized Gray map. To achieve this, we define two related binary codes: the associated and the decomposition codes. By considering the Schur product between codewords, we can determine the linearity of the respective $\mathbb{Z}_{2^L}$-linear code. As a result, we establish a connection between the linearity of the $\mathbb{Z}_{2^L}$-linear codes with the linearity of the decomposition code for $\mathbb{Z}_4$ and $\mathbb{Z}_8$-additive codes. Furthermore, we construct $\mathbb{Z}_{2^L}$-additive codes from nested binary codes, resulting in linear $\mathbb{Z}_{2^L}$-linear codes. This construction involves multiple layers of binary codes, where a code in one layer is the square of the code in the previous layer. We also employ our arguments to check the linearity of well-known $\mathbb{Z}_{2^L}$-linear code constructions, including the Hadamard, simplex, and MacDonald codes.</description>

      <title>Sampling to Achieve the Goal: An Age-aware Remote Markov Decision Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02042v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Age of Information (AoI) has been recognized as an important metric to measure the freshness of information. Central to this consensus is that minimizing AoI can enhance the freshness of information, thereby facilitating the accuracy of subsequent decision-making processes. However, to date the direct causal relationship that links AoI to the utility of the decision-making process is unexplored. To fill this gap, this paper provides a sampling-control co-design problem, referred to as an age-aware remote Markov Decision Process (MDP) problem, to explore this unexplored relationship. Our framework revisits the sampling problem in [1] with a refined focus: moving from AoI penalty minimization to directly optimizing goal-oriented remote decision-making process under random delay. We derive that the age-aware remote MDP problem can be reduced to a standard MDP problem without delays, and reveal that treating AoI solely as a metric for optimization is not optimal in achieving remote decision making. Instead, AoI can serve as important side information to facilitate remote decision making.</description>

      <title>Movable Antenna Empowered Downlink NOMA Systems: Power Allocation and Antenna Position Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18692v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates a novel communication paradigm employing movable antennas (MAs) within a multiple-input single-output (MISO) non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) downlink framework, where users are equipped with MAs. Initially, leveraging the far-field response, we delineate the channel characteristics concerning both the power allocation coefficient and positions of MAs. Subsequently, we endeavor to maximize the channel capacity by jointly optimizing power allocation and antenna positions. To tackle the resultant non-convex problem, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) scheme underpinned by successive convex approximation (SCA) to converge towards a stationary point. Through numerical simulations, our findings substantiate the superiority of the MA-assisted NOMA system over both orthogonal multiple access (OMA) and conventional NOMA configurations in terms of average sum rate and outage probability.</description>

In particular, we prove MacWilliams identities for finite chain rings relating the sequences of $q$-binomial moments of a code and its dual and for Gabidulin analogues of free codes over Galois rings we prove the corresponding MacWilliams identity as a functional expression relating the weight enumerator of the dual with the MacWilliams transform of the weight enumerator of the original code plus one extra term attached to the zero divisors.</description>

      <title>Codes for entanglement-assisted classical communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement-assisted classical communication (EACC) aims to enhance communication systems using entanglement as an additional resource. However, there is a scarcity of explicit protocols designed for finite transmission scenarios, which presents a challenge for real-world implementation. In response we introduce a new EACC scheme capable of correcting a fixed number of erasures/errors. It can be adjusted to the available amount of entanglement and sends classical information over a quantum channel. We establish a general framework to accomplish such a task by reducing it to a classical problem. Comparing with specific bounds we identify optimal parameter ranges. The scheme requires only the implementation of super-dense coding which has been demonstrated successfully in experiments. Furthermore, our results shows that an adaptable entanglement use confers a communication advantage. Overall, our work sheds light on how entanglement can elevate various finite-length communication protocols, opening new avenues for exploration in the field.</description>

      <title>Improving the Privacy Loss Under User-Level DP Composition for Fixed Estimation Error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06261v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the private release of statistics of several disjoint subsets of a datasets. In particular, we consider the $\epsilon$-user-level differentially private release of sample means and variances of sample values in disjoint subsets of a dataset, in a potentially sequential manner. Traditional analysis of the privacy loss under user-level privacy due to the composition of queries to the disjoint subsets necessitates a privacy loss degradation by the total number of disjoint subsets. Our main contribution is an iterative algorithm, based on suppressing user contributions, which seeks to reduce the overall privacy loss degradation under a canonical Laplace mechanism, while not increasing the worst estimation error among the subsets. Important components of this analysis are our exact, analytical characterizations of the sensitivities and the worst-case bias errors of estimators of the sample mean and variance, which are obtained by clipping or suppressing user contributions. We test the performance of our algorithm on real-world and synthetic datasets and demonstrate improvements in the privacy loss degradation factor, for fixed estimation error. We also show improvements in the worst-case error across subsets, via a natural optimization procedure, for fixed numbers of users contributing to each subset.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Structure in Quantum Relative Entropy Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum relative entropy programs are convex optimization problems which minimize a linear functional over an affine section of the epigraph of the quantum relative entropy function. Recently, the self-concordance of a natural barrier function was proved for this set. This has opened up the opportunity to use interior-point methods for nonsymmetric cone programs to solve these optimization problems. In this paper, we show how common structures arising from applications in quantum information theory can be exploited to improve the efficiency of solving quantum relative entropy programs using interior-point methods. First, we show that the natural barrier function for the epigraph of the quantum relative entropy composed with positive linear operators is optimally self-concordant, even when these linear operators map to singular matrices. Compared to modelling problems using the full quantum relative entropy cone, this allows us to remove redundant log determinant expressions from the barrier function and reduce the overall barrier parameter. Second, we show how certain slices of the quantum relative entropy cone exhibit useful properties which should be exploited whenever possible to perform certain key steps of interior-point methods more efficiently. We demonstrate how these methods can be applied to applications in quantum information theory, including quantifying quantum key rates, quantum rate-distortion functions, quantum channel capacities, and the ground state energy of Hamiltonians. Our numerical results show that these techniques improve computation times by up to several orders of magnitude, and allow previously intractable problems to be solved.</description>

      <title>Movable Antenna-Enhanced Wireless Communications: General Architectures and Implementation Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Movable antennas (MAs), traditionally explored in antenna design, have recently garnered significant attention in wireless communications due to their ability to dynamically adjust the antenna positions to changes in the propagation environment. However, previous research has primarily focused on characterizing the performance limits of various MA-assisted wireless communication systems, with less emphasis on their practical implementation. To address this gap, in this article, we propose several general MA architectures that extend existing designs by varying several key aspects to cater to different application scenarios and tradeoffs between cost and performance. Additionally, we draw from fields such as antenna design and mechanical control to provide an overview of candidate implementation methods for the proposed MA architectures, utilizing either direct mechanical or equivalent electronic control. Simulation results are finally presented to support our discussion.</description>
