      <title>Wave Interference in Self-Interacting Fuzzy Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) scenario, the dark matter is composed of an ultra-light scalar field with coherence length and wave interference on astrophysical scales. Scalar fields generically have quartic self-interactions that modify their dispersion relation and the associated evolution of density perturbations. We perform the first dedicated analysis of the role of wave interference on this evolution due to self-interactions in FDM and vice versa, developing a perturbative treatment applicable at early times and then comparing against a suite of fully nonlinear benchmark simulations, varying the dark matter density, interaction strength, and fiducial momentum scale. We explicitly simulate the limit where this momentum scale is relatively high compared with the scale of the simulation volume, applicable to cases where the dark matter is initially ``warm" due to causal constraints on a post-inflationary production or in virialized halos and other ``thermalized" cases with initially cold production. We find that in such scenarios, density perturbations are unable to grow on the expected self interaction time scale because of interference effects, instead saturating on the much shorter de Broglie crossing time, with a dependence on the sign of the interaction. Finally, we comment on the implications of our results for astrophysical systems such as high-density ultra-faint dwarf galaxies where wave interference plays an important role.</description>

      <title>CHEX-MATE: Multi-probe analysis of Abell 1689</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of the elusive dark matter can be probed by comparing the predictions of the cold dark matter framework with the gravitational field of massive galaxy clusters. However, a robust test of dark matter can only be achieved if the systematic uncertainties in the reconstruction of the gravitational potential are minimized. Techniques based on the properties of intracluster gas rely on the assumption that the gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium within the potential well, whereas gravitational lensing is sensitive to projection effects. Here we attempt to minimize systematics in galaxy cluster mass reconstructions by jointly exploiting the weak gravitational lensing signal and the properties of the hot intracluster gas determined from X-ray and millimeter (Sunyaev-Zel'dovich) observations. We construct a model to fit the multi-probe information within a common framework, accounting for non-thermal pressure support and elongation of the dark matter halo along the line of sight. We then apply our framework to the massive cluster Abell 1689, which features unparalleled multi-wavelength data. In accordance with previous works, we find that the cluster is significantly elongated along the line of sight. Accounting for line-of-sight projections, we require a non-thermal pressure support of $30\text{-}40\%$ at $r_{500}$ to match the gas and weak lensing observables. The joint model retrieves a concentration $c_{200}\sim7$, which is lower and more realistic than the high concentration retrieved from weak lensing data alone under the assumption of spherical symmetry ($c_{200}\sim15$). Application of our method to a larger sample will allow us to study at the same time the shape of dark matter mass profiles and the level of non-thermal pressure support in galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>LiteBIRD Science Goals and Forecasts: constraining isotropic cosmic birefringence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic birefringence (CB) is the rotation of the photons' linear polarisation plane during propagation. Such an effect is a tracer of parity-violating extensions of standard electromagnetism and would probe the existence of a new cosmological field acting as dark matter or dark energy. It has become customary to employ cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarised data to probe such a phenomenon. Recent analyses on Planck and WMAP data provide a hint of detection of the isotropic CB angle with an amplitude of around $0.3^\circ$ at the level of $2.4$ to $3.6\sigma$. In this work, we explore the LiteBIRD capabilities in constraining such an effect, accounting for the impact of the more relevant systematic effects, namely foreground emission and instrumental polarisation angles. We build five semi-independent pipelines and test these against four different simulation sets with increasing complexity in terms of non-idealities. All the pipelines are shown to be robust and capable of returning the expected values of the CB angle within statistical fluctuations for all the cases considered. We find that the uncertainties in the CB estimates increase with more complex simulations. However, the trend is less pronounced for pipelines that account for the instrumental polarisation angles. For the most complex case analysed, we find that LiteBIRD will be able to detect a CB angle of $0.3^\circ$ with a statistical significance ranging from $5$ to $13 \, \sigma$, depending on the pipeline employed, where the latter uncertainty corresponds to a total error budget of the order of $0.02^\circ$.</description>

      <title>Probing stellar-mass primordial black holes with type Ia supernova microlensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitationally lensed quasars have served as a powerful tool for studying the composition of dark matter (DM) in lensing galaxies. In this work, we propose a novel method to investigate stellar-mass primordial black holes (PBHs) by using the microlensing effect of strongly lensed Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). Using the parameters of the lensed quasar system PG 1115+80, such as convergence, shear, and stellar/dark matter fractions, we generate microlensing magnification maps. A uniform brightness disk model is applied to these maps to evaluate the microlensing amplitude at different stages of the supernova explosion. We extend this analysis by employing the strong lensing parameters derived from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) to create extensive image datasets of lensed SNe Ia. Utilizing these datasets and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test, we compare two models: (1) the fiducial model, where galaxies are composed of stars and smooth DM, and (2) the alternative model, where galaxies consist of stars and compact DM, specifically PBHs. Our preliminary analysis predicts that at least 60 image datasets are required to distinguish these two scenarios at a 95 percent confidence level. Additionally, by incorporating the Strong Lensing Halo model-based mock catalogs (SL-Hammocks), which provide more realistic and precise image data, we refine our prediction to assess the data requirements for distinguishing cases where PBHs constitute fractions x of the total dark matter mass. Our findings indicate that 50, 55, and 65 image datasets, corresponding to compact dark matter fractions of 100 percent, 50 percent, and 25 percent (denoted by x), are necessary to distinguish between the specific models.</description>

      <title>Missing Components in {\Lambda}CDM from DESI Y1 BAO Measurements: Insights from Redshift Remapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore transformations of the Friedman-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric and cosmological parameters that align with observational data, aiming to gain insights into potential extensions of standard cosmological models.
  We modify the FLRW metric by introducing a scaling factor, $e^{2\Theta(a)}$ (the cosmological scaling function, CSF), which alters the standard relationship between cosmological redshift and the cosmic scale factor without affecting angular measurements or Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies. Using data from DESI Year 1, Pantheon+ supernovae, and the Planck CMB temperature power spectrum, we constrain both the CSF and cosmological parameters through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach.
  Our results indicate that the CSF model fits observational data with a lower Hubble constant (although it is compatible with the value given by Planck 2018 within 1$\sigma$) and is predominantly dark-matter-dominated. Additionally, the CSF model produces temperature and lensing power spectra similar to those predicted by the standard model, though with lower values in the CSF model at large scales. We have also checked that when fitting a CSF model without dark energy to the data, we obtain a more negative conformal function. This suggests that the CSF model may offer hints about missing elements and opens up a new avenue for exploring physical interpretations of cosmic acceleration.</description>

      <title>To CPL, or not to CPL? What we have not learned about the dark energy equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that using a Taylor expansion for the dark energy equation-of-state parameter and limiting it to the zeroth and first-order terms, i.e., the so-called Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization, instead of allowing for higher-order terms and then marginalizing over them, adds extra information not present in the data and leads to markedly different and potentially misleading conclusions. Fixing the higher-order terms to zero, one concludes that vacuum energy that is currently non-dynamical (e.g., the cosmological constant) is excluded at several $\sigma$ significance as the explanation of cosmic acceleration, even in Dark Energy Spectroscopic Survey (DESI) DR1 data. Meanwhile, instead marginalizing over the higher-order terms shows that we know neither the current dark energy equation of state nor its current rate of change well enough to make such a claim. This issue has become more prominent now with the recent release of high-quality Stage IV galaxy survey data. The results of analyses using simple Taylor expansions should be interpreted with great care.</description>

      <title>Cosmology with Cosmic Voids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic voids are low-mass-density regions on intergalactic scales. They are where cosmic expansion and acceleration are most dominant, important places to understand and analyse for cosmology. This entry summarises theoretical underpinnings of cosmic voids, and explores several observational aspects, statistics and applications of voids. The density profiles, velocity profiles, evolution history and the abundances of voids are shown to encode information about cosmology, including the sum of neutrino masses and the law of gravity. These properties manifest themselves into a wide range of observables, including the void distribution function, redshift-space distortions, gravitational lensing and their imprints on the cosmic-microwave background. We explain how each of these observables work, and summarise their applications in observations. We also comment on the possible impact of a local void on the interpretations of the expansion of the Universe, and discuss opportunities and challenges for the research subject of cosmic voids.</description>

      <title>On the effects of parameters on galaxy properties in CAMELS and the predictability of $\Omega_{\rm m}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent analyses of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations from CAMELS have shown that machine learning models can predict the parameter describing the total matter content of the universe, $\Omega_{\rm m}$, from the features of a single galaxy. We investigate the statistical properties of two of these simulation suites, IllustrisTNG and ASTRID, confirming that $\Omega_{\rm m}$ induces a strong displacement on the distribution of galaxy features. We also observe that most other parameters have little to no effect on the distribution, except for the stellar-feedback parameter $A_{SN1}$, which introduces some near-degeneracies that can be broken with specific features. These two properties explain the predictability of $\Omega_{\rm m}$. We use Optimal Transport to further measure the effect of parameters on the distribution of galaxy properties, which is found to be consistent with physical expectations. However, we observe discrepancies between the two simulation suites, both in the effect of $\Omega_{\rm m}$ on the galaxy properties and in the distributions themselves at identical parameter values. Thus, although $\Omega_{\rm m}$'s signature can be easily detected within a given simulation suite using just a single galaxy, applying this result to real observational data may prove significantly more challenging.</description>

      <title>A follow-up strategy enabling discovery of electromagnetic counterparts to highly-magnified gravitationally-lensed gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Making an unambiguous detection of lensed gravitational waves is challenging with current generation detectors due to large uncertainties in sky localisations and other inferred parameter distributions. However, in the case of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers this challenge can be overcome by detecting multiple images of its lensed kilonova counterpart, simultaneously confirming the lensing nature of the event and locating it precisely - further enabling a wealth of lensed multimessenger science. Such a strategy demands answers to two key problems: 1) How can candidate lensed BNS events be identified fast enough to ensure the lensed kilonova is still detectable? 2) What is the most economical observing strategy on telescope time for following up candidate lensed events to discover lensed kilonovae? This article will discuss solutions to both points, specifically: how GW detections of progenitors in the $\sim$ 2.5 to 5 $M_\odot$ black hole "mass gap" can be interpreted as candidate lensed BNS events, giving evidence for lensing from just a single detection, and will present a strategy that can actively be employed for follow-up of such events in the O4 run of LVK and beyond.</description>

      <title>Microlensing of long-duration gravitational wave signals originating from Galactic sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detection of quasi-monochromatic, long-duration (continuous) gravitational wave radiation emitted by, e.g., asymmetric rotating neutron stars in our Galaxy requires a long observation time to distinguish it from the detector's noise. If this signal is additionally microlensed by a lensing object located in the Galaxy, its magnitude would be temporarily magnified, which may lead to its discovery and allow probing of the physical nature of the lensing object and the source. We study the observational feasibility of Galactic microlensing of continuous gravitational wave signals in the point mass lens approximation by discussing the parameter space of the problem as well as by applying a gravitational wave detection method, the Time Domain F-statistic search, to ground-based detectors in the simulated data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider and compare the Bondi and Novikov-Thorne accretion mechanisms in spherically symmetric regular black holes. To do so, we model the dark matter distribution adopting two main approaches. The first takes into account a cosmologically-inspired dark fluid, whose pressure turns out to be constant, whereas the density and equation of state depend on the radial coordinate. The second case employs an exponential dark matter energy distribution that describes the dark matter cloud in the accretion process. Accordingly, we quantify the mass accreted by regular solutions with the above information on the energy-momentum tensor and their luminosity and thermal properties, derived from the background models. Numerical simulations of the accretion processes are then reported, comparing regular black holes with Schwarzschild and Schwarzschild-de Sitter metrics. In so doing, we consider the Hayward, Bardeen, Dymnikova and Fang-Wang solutions, where the addiction of a further parameter determines regularity. Implications and physical consequences of using the Novikov-Thorne and Bondi accretion backgrounds are thus critically discussed in varying the free parameters of each spacetime.</description>

      <title>Hints of an Anomalous Lens Population towards the Galactic Bulge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dark and dynamic parts of the Galaxy, including the bulk shape and movement of the Galactic Bulge and characteristics of dark compact object populations, such as a hypothetical population of primordial black holes (PBHs), are difficult to study directly by their very nature, but are critical to our understanding of the universe. Fortunately, all of these mysteries can be uniquely studied via gravitational microlensing, a method of astronomical detection that traces mass and dynamics as opposed to light. Using the OGLE-IV microlensing survey bulge fields, we apply a Bayesian hierarchical model to jointly infer properties of the Galaxy, the characteristics of compact objects, and and test PBHs with an extended mass distribution as a test PBHs as a viable explanation of dark matter, extending work focused on the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds, both with much lower event-rates. We infer a preference within the data for a lower patternspeed in the galactic model and a wider mass spectrum for compact objects. When adding a PBH component to the favored astrophysical model from our initial investigations, we find a Bayes factor of $\ln\mathcal{B} = 20.23$ preferring the PBH model. Upon further investigation of these results, we find the critical feature in the PBH model to be the velocity distribution, which is fundamentally different than the velocity distribution of astrophysical objects and uniquely able to explain a large number of low parallax, low timescale microlensing events. Noting that this effect is not unique to PBHs, we consider the implications of these results as applied to a hypothetical population of PBHs and discuss alternative explanations, including a variety of other possible astrophysical and survey or analysis systematics.</description>

      <title>Conformal Phase Transition in Supersymmetric QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a four-dimensional supersymmetric QCD in conformal window with a marginally relevant deformation which triggers the spontaneous breaking of (approximate) scale invariance and the subsequent confinement, generating a mass gap, at an energy scale hierarchically smaller than the Planck scale without fine-tuning. We analyze the finite temperature system and show that the phase transition associated with the breaking of conformal invariance is of the strong first order. When such a phase transition takes place at a temperature of the Universe around the electroweak scale, it generates a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background probed by future space-based interferometers, while a conformal phase transition in a dark sector at $\mathcal{O}(1)$ GeV generates GWs to explain the reported pulsar timing array signal.</description>

      <title>Casimir pressure with dissipation and quantum corrections from axion dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effects of the oscillating axion field present in our environment on the Casimir pressure between two metallic plates. We take into account the finite conductivity of the boundary plates and model the interactions between matter and photons in the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism. This allows us to take into account dissipation in the quantum field description of this open quantum system and retrieve the Lifschitz results for the Casimir interaction between two metallic plates. We then compute the leading correction to the Lifschitz theory in inverse powers of the axion suppression scale and show that the Casimir pressure receives oscillating corrections depending on the product of the axion mass and the distance between the plates. This contribution is repulsive at large distance compared to the axion Compton wavelength as a consequence of the breaking of parity invariance by the axion dark matter background.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Origin of the KM3-230213A event and associated Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel cosmological scenario to explain the exceptional KM3-230213A neutrino event reported at an energy scale of $\mathcal{O}(100)$~PeV by the KM3NeT collaboration, along with its associated gravitational wave (GW) signatures. In our framework, ultra high energy neutrinos originate from the decay of a super-heavy sterile neutrino produced via the Hawking evaporation of primordial black holes (PBHs) in the early Universe. Employing an ultraviolet complete type-I seesaw model, we demonstrate that while two sterile neutrinos are responsible for light neutrino masses as required by oscillation data, one sterile neutrino can have an exceedingly feeble coupling, allowing its lifetime to be tuned so that its decay yields a neutrino flux consistent with the observed event. Furthermore, our scenario predicts two distinct GW signatures: one arising from gravitons emitted during PBH evaporation and another from the Bremsstrahlung process during the decay of the sterile neutrino. These complementary signals provide a multi-messenger probe of the underlying physics. Our results thus offer a compelling explanation for the KM3-230213A event and open new avenues for investigating the interplay between high-energy neutrino astronomy and gravitational wave cosmology.</description>

      <title>NEC violation and "beyond Horndeski'' physics in light of DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent DESI DR2 results provide compelling evidence that the dark energy equation of state evolves from $w&lt;-1$ at high redshift to $w&gt;-1$ today, reinforcing interest in null energy condition (NEC) violation. While NEC violation may be crucial for dark energy and solving the cosmological singularity problem, it generically leads to ghost or gradient instabilities. It is well established in the study of nonsingular cosmology that the effective field theory (EFT) operator $\delta g^{00} R^{(3)}$ enables fully stable NEC violation and represents ``beyond Horndeski'' physics. We investigate its implications in the observable Universe and confirm within the EFT framework that $\delta g^{00} R^{(3)}$ can also stabilize NEC violation in dark energy, as indicated by the latest DESI DR2 BAO observations. Furthermore, our results show that current data already impose a nontrivial constraint on the EFT coefficient $\tilde{m}^2_4$ associated with $\delta g^{00} R^{(3)}$, indicating $\tilde{m}^2_4 \neq 0$ at approximately $2\sigma$. This finding suggests an unexpected possible connection between the primordial Universe and the late observable Universe.</description>

      <title>StAGE: Stellar Archaeology-driven Galaxy Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We build a semi-empirical framework of galaxy evolution (dubbed StAGE) firmly grounded on stellar archaeology. The latter provides data-driven prescriptions that, on a population statistical ground, allow to define the age and the star formation history for the progenitors of quiescent galaxies (QGs). We exploit StAGE to compute the cosmic star formation rate (SFR) density contributed by the progenitors of local QGs, and show it to remarkably agree with that estimated for high-$z$ dusty star-forming galaxies which are faint/dark in the NIR, so pointing toward a direct progenitor-descendant connection among these galaxy populations. Furthermore, we argue that by appropriately correcting the observed stellar mass density by the contribution of such NIR-dark progenitors, StAGE recovers a SFR density which is consistent with direct determinations from UV/IR/radio surveys, so substantially alleviating a longstanding tension. Relatedly, we also show how StAGE can provide the average mass and metal assembly history of QGs, and their redshift-dependent statistics. Focusing on the supermassive black holes (BHs) hosted by massive QGs, we exploit StAGE to reconstruct the average BH mass assembly history, the cosmic BH accretion rate density as a function of redshift, and the evolution of the Magorrian-like relationship between the relic stellar and BH masses. All in all, StAGE may constitute a valuable tool to understand via a data-driven, easily expandable, and computationally low-cost approach the co-evolution of QGs and of their hosted supermassive BHs across cosmic times.</description>

      <title>Diffraction around caustics in gravitational wave lensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing magnification is maximal around caustics. At these source locations, an incoming wave from a point source would formally experience an infinite amplification in the high-frequency or geometric optics limit. This divergence reflects the break-down of the mathematical formalism, which is regularized by either the finite size of the source or its wavelength. We explore diffraction around caustics and their implications for the distortion of waveforms from point sources, focusing on three types of caustics: point singularities, folds, and cusps. We derive analytical results for the amplitude and phase of the diffracted waves, and compare those against the stationary phase approximation. We then study the observational signatures and detectability of these distortions on gravitational waves. We find that the lensing distortions could be detectable, but that the stationary phase approximation is still a good description of the system even close to the caustic, when the repeated gravitational wave chirps interfere with each other. We also quantify the possibility of distinguishing lensed signals from different caustics by performing Bayesian parameter estimation on simulated signals. Our results demonstrate that the universal distortions due to diffraction around caustics could be used to single out a gravitational wave event as lensed.</description>

      <title>dolphin: A fully automated forward modeling pipeline powered by artificial intelligence for galaxy-scale strong lenses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing is a powerful tool for probing the internal structure and evolution of galaxies, the nature of dark matter, and the expansion history of the Universe, among many other scientific applications. For almost all of these science cases, modeling the lensing mass distribution is essential. For that, forward modeling of imaging data to the pixel level is the standard method used for galaxy-scale lenses. However, the traditional workflow of forward lens modeling necessitates a significant amount of human investigator time, requiring iterative tweaking and tuning of the model settings through trial and error. An automated lens modeling pipeline can substantially reduce the need for human investigator time. In this paper, we present \textsc{dolphin}, an automated lens modeling pipeline that combines artificial intelligence with the traditional forward modeling framework to enable full automation of the modeling workflow. \textsc{dolphin} uses a neural network model to perform visual recognition of the strong lens components, then autonomously sets up a lens model with appropriate complexity, and fits the model with the modeling engine, lenstronomy. Thanks to the versatility of lenstronomy, dolphin can autonomously model both galaxy-galaxy and galaxy-quasar strong lenses.</description>

      <title>Revised bounds on local cosmic strings from NANOGrav observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02705v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent paper, the NANOGrav collaboration studied new physics explanations of the observed pulsar timing residuals consistent with a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB), including cosmic strings in the Nambu-Goto (NG) approximation. Analysing one of current models for the loop distribution, it was found that the cosmic string model is disfavored compared to other sources, for example, super massive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). When both SMBHB and cosmic string models are included in the analysis, an upper bound on a string tension $G\mu \lesssim 10^{-10}$ was derived. However, the analysis did not accommodate results from cosmic string simulations in an underlying field theory, which indicate that at most a small fraction of string loops survive long enough to emit GW. Following and extending our previous study, we suppose that a fraction $f_{\rm NG}$ of string loops follow NG dynamics and emit only GWs, and study the three different models of the loop distribution discussed in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration analyses. We re-analyze the NANOGrav 15yrs data with our signal models by using the NANOGrav $\texttt{ENTERPRISE}$ analysis code via the wrapper $\texttt{PTArcade}$. We find that loop distributions similar to LVK Model B and C yield higher Bayes factor than Model A analyzed in the NANOGrav paper, as they can more easily accommodate a blue-tilted spectrum of the observed amplitude. Furthermore, because of the degeneracy of $G\mu$ and $f_{\rm NG}$ in determining the signal amplitude, our posterior distribution extends to higher values of $G\mu$, and in some cases the uppermost value of credible intervals is close to the Cosmic Microwave Background limit $G\mu \lesssim 10^{-7}$. Hence, in addition to the pulsar timing array data, further information about the fraction of long-lived loops in a cosmic string network is required to constrain the string tension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and polarization observations indicate that in the best-fit $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter model of the Universe, the local geometry is consistent with at most a small amount of positive or negative curvature, i.e., $\vert\Omega_K\vert\ll1$. However, whether the geometry is flat ($E^3$), positively curved ($S^3$) or negatively curved ($H^3$), there are many possible topologies. Among the topologies of $S^3$ geometry, the lens spaces $L(p,q)$, where $p$ and $q$ ($p&gt;1$ and $0&lt;q&lt;p$) are positive integers, are quotients of the covering space of $S^3$ (the three-sphere) by ${\mathbb{Z}}_p$, the cyclic group of order $p$. We use the absence of any pair of circles on the CMB sky with matching patterns of temperature fluctuations to establish constraints on $p$ and $q$ as a function of the curvature scale that are considerably stronger than those previously asserted for most values of $p$ and $q$. The smaller the value of $\vert\Omega_K\vert$, i.e., the larger the curvature radius, the larger the maximum allowed value of $p$. For example, if $\vert\Omega_K\vert\simeq 0.05$ then $p\leq 9 $, while if $\vert\Omega_K\vert\simeq 0.02$, $p$ can be as high as 24. Future work will extend these constraints to a wider set of $S^{3}$ topologies.</description>

Abstract: Precise and accurate predictions of the halo mass function for cluster mass scales in $w\nu{\rm CDM}$ cosmologies are crucial for extracting robust and unbiased cosmological information from upcoming galaxy cluster surveys. Here, we present a halo mass function emulator for cluster mass scales ($\gtrsim 10^{13}M_\odot /h$) up to redshift $z=2$ with comprehensive support for the parameter space of $w\nu{\rm CDM}$ cosmologies allowed by current data. Based on the Aemulus $\nu$ suite of simulations, the emulator marks a significant improvement in the precision of halo mass function predictions by incorporating both massive neutrinos and non-standard dark energy equation of state models. This allows for accurate modeling of the cosmology dependence in large-scale structure and galaxy cluster studies. We show that the emulator, designed using Gaussian Process Regression, has negligible theoretical uncertainties compared to dominant sources of error in future cluster abundance studies. Our emulator is publicly available, providing the community with a crucial tool for upcoming cosmological surveys such as LSST and Euclid.</description>

      <title>$\Lambda$CDM and early dark energy in latent space: a data-driven parametrization of the CMB temperature power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finding the best parametrization for cosmological models in the absence of first-principle theories is an open question. We propose a data-driven parametrization of cosmological models given by the disentangled 'latent' representation of a variational autoencoder (VAE) trained to compress cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature power spectra. We consider a broad range of $\Lambda$CDM and beyond-$\Lambda$CDM cosmologies with an additional early dark energy (EDE) component. We show that these spectra can be compressed into 5 ($\Lambda$CDM) or 8 (EDE) independent latent parameters, as expected when using temperature power spectra alone, and which reconstruct spectra at an accuracy well within the Planck errors. These latent parameters have a physical interpretation in terms of well-known features of the CMB temperature spectrum: these include the position, height and even-odd modulation of the acoustic peaks, as well as the gravitational lensing effect. The VAE also discovers one latent parameter which entirely isolates the EDE effects from those related to $\Lambda$CDM parameters, thus revealing a previously unknown degree of freedom in the CMB temperature power spectrum. We further showcase how to place constraints on the latent parameters using Planck data as typically done for cosmological parameters, obtaining latent values consistent with previous $\Lambda$CDM and EDE cosmological constraints. Our work demonstrates the potential of a data-driven reformulation of current beyond-$\Lambda$CDM phenomenological models into the independent degrees of freedom to which the data observables are sensitive.</description>

Abstract: The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) data release 2 (DR2) galaxy and quasar clustering data represents a significant expansion of data from DR1, providing improved statistical precision in BAO constraints across multiple tracers, including bright galaxies (BGS), luminous red galaxies (LRGs), emission line galaxies (ELGs), and quasars (QSOs). In this paper, we validate the BAO analysis of DR2. We present the results of robustness tests on the blinded DR2 data and, after unblinding, consistency checks on the unblinded DR2 data. All results are compared to those obtained from a suite of mock catalogs that replicate the selection and clustering properties of the DR2 sample. We confirm the consistency of DR2 BAO measurements with DR1 while achieving a reduction in statistical uncertainties due to the increased survey volume and completeness. We assess the impact of analysis choices, including different data vectors (correlation function vs. power spectrum), modeling approaches and systematics treatments, and an assumption of the Gaussian likelihood, finding that our BAO constraints are stable across these variations and assumptions with a few minor refinements to the baseline setup of the DR1 BAO analysis. We summarize a series of pre-unblinding tests that confirmed the readiness of our analysis pipeline, the final systematic errors, and the DR2 BAO analysis baseline. The successful completion of these tests led to the unblinding of the DR2 BAO measurements, ultimately leading to the DESI DR2 cosmological analysis, with their implications for the expansion history of the Universe and the nature of dark energy presented in the DESI key paper.</description>

      <title>The Radio and Microwave Sky as Seen by Juno on its Mission to Jupiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present six nearly full-sky maps made from data taken by radiometers on the Juno satellite during its 5-year flight to Jupiter. The maps represent integrated emission over $\sim 4\%$ passbands spaced approximately in octaves between 600 MHz and 21.9 GHz. Long time-scale offset drifts are removed in all bands, and, for the two lowest frequency bands, gain drifts are also removed from the maps via a self-calibration algorithm similar to the NPIPE pipeline used by the Planck collaboration. We show that, after this solution is applied, statistical noise in the maps is consistent with thermal radiometer noise and expected levels of correlated noise on the gain and noise drift solutions. We verify our map solutions with several consistency tests and end-to-end simulations. We also estimate the level of systematic pixelization noise and polarization leakage via simulations.</description>

      <title>Gravitational effects on fluid dynamics in cosmological first-order phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10770v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological first-order phase transition (FOPT) sources the stochastic gravitational wave background (SWGB) through bubble collisions, sound waves, and turbulence. So far, most studies on the fluid profile of an expanding bubble are limited to transitions that complete in a much shorter time scale than the cosmic expansion. In this study, we investigate gravitational effects on the fluid profile beyond the self-similar regime. For this purpose we combine a hydrodynamic scheme in the presence of gravity with a fluid computation scheme under energy injection from the bubble wall. By performing (1+1)d simulations of spherical bubble for constant wall velocities, we find that the fluid generally develops a thinner shell in our cosmological setup, which qualitatively agrees with previous studies discussing the late-time behavior of fluid in expanding spacetime. We also observe reduction in the energy budget for the fluid kinetic energy. Furthermore, we find that the fluid profile develops sub-structure for accelerating bubble walls. We also comment on the possible broadening of the SGWB spectral plateau.</description>

      <title>Effective Actions for Domain Wall Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a systematic method to derive the effective action for domain walls directly from the scalar field theory that gives rise to their solitonic solutions. The effective action for the Goldstone mode, which characterizes the soliton's position, is shown to consist of the Nambu-Goto action supplemented by higher-order curvature invariants associated to its worldvolume metric. Our approach constrains the corrections to a finite set of Galileon terms, specifying both their functional forms and the procedure to compute their coefficients. We do a collection of tests across various models in $2+1$ and $3+1$ dimensions that confirm the validity of this framework. Additionally, the method is extended to include bound scalar fields living on the worldsheet, along with their couplings to the Goldstone mode. These interactions reveal a universal non-minimal coupling of these scalar fields to the Ricci scalar on the worldsheet. A significant consequence of this coupling is the emergence of a parametric instability, driven by interactions between the bound states and the Goldstone mode.</description>
