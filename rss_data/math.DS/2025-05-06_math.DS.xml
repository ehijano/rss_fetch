      <description>arXiv:2505.01839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let G be an infinite discrete countable amenable group acting continuously on a Lebesgue space X. In this article, using partition and factor-space, the conditional entropy of the action G is defined. We introduction some properties of conditional entropy for amenable group actions and the corresponding decomposition theorem is obtained.</description>

      <title>A study of braids arising from simple choreographies of the planar Newtonian N-body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study periodic solutions of the planar Newtonian $N$-body problem with equal masses. Each periodic solution traces out a braid with $N$ strands in 3-dimensional space. When the braid is of pseudo-Anosov type, it has an associated stretch factor greater than 1, which reflects the complexity of the corresponding periodic solution. For each $N \ge 3$, Guowei Yu established the existence of a family of simple choreographies to the planar Newtonian $N$-body problem. We prove that braids arising from Yu's periodic solutions are of pseudo-Anosov types, except in the special case where all particles move along a circle. We also identify the simple choreographies whose braid types have the largest and smallest stretch factors, respectively.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Diseased-Impacted Prey Populations: Defense and Allee Effect Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces an innovative framework for merging ecological and epidemiological modeling via the formulation of a sophisticated predator-prey model that addresses the intricacies of disease dynamics, the Allee effect, and defensive mechanisms through prey aggregation. Employing rigorous stability and bifurcation analyses, we identify multiple feasible equilibria and establish critical thresholds that influence population survival and extinction. Our mathematical model reveals that the intensity of the Allee effect plays a crucial role in shaping population recovery and disease persistence, offering pivotal insights into finite time extinction mechanisms. We further illustrate, through extensive numerical simulations, that adjusting susceptible prey aggregation strategically can substantially reduce disease transmission, emphasizing the applicability of our findings for practical conservation interventions. The combined modulation of the aggregation constant and Allee effect determined three primary ecological outcomes: stable coexistence, elimination of infected prey, and complete population extinction. Moreover, these results have significant implications for wildlife management and ecosystem resilience, providing a solid theoretical framework for interdisciplinary strategies aimed at protecting endangered species.</description>

      <title>General multi-steps variable-coefficient formulation for computing quasi-periodic solutions with multiple base frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic solutions with multiple base frequencies exhibit the feature of $2\pi$-periodicity with respect to each of the hyper-time variables. However, it remains a challenge work, due to the lack of effective solution methods, to solve and track the quasi-periodic solutions with multiple base frequencies until now. In this work, a multi-steps variable-coefficient formulation (m-VCF) is proposed, which provides a unified framework to enable either harmonic balance method (HB) or collocation method (CO) or finite difference method (FD) to solve quasi-periodic solutions with multiple base frequencies. For this purpose, a method of alternating U and S domain (AUS) is also developed to efficiently evaluate the nonlinear force terms. Furthermore, a new robust phase condition is presented for all of the three methods to make them track the quasi-periodic solutions with prior unknown multiple base frequencies, while the stability of the quasi-periodic solutions is assessed by mean of Lyapunov exponents. The feasibility of the constructed methods under the above framework is verified by application to three nonlinear systems.</description>

      <title>Uniformization of tongues in Double Standard Map family and variation of maximal chaotic sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study hyperbolic components, also known as tongues, in the Double Standard Map family comprising circle maps of the form:
  \begin{align*}
  f_{a,b}(x)=\left(2x+a+\dfrac{b}{\pi} \sin(2\pi x)\right) \mod 1,\ a \in \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z},\ 0 \leq b \leq 1. \end{align*} We prove simple connectedness of tongues by providing a dynamically natural real-analytic uniformization for each tongue. For maps in a tongue, we characterize the unique maximal subset of the circle on which $f_{a,b}$ is Devaney chaotic. We also show that the Hausdorff dimension of this maximal chaotic set varies real-analytically inside a tongue.</description>

      <title>Feedback control of the Kuramoto model defined on uniform graphs I: Deterministic natural frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study feedback control of the Kuramoto model (KM) with uniformly spaced natural frequencies defined on uniform graphs which may be complete, random dense or random sparse, so that each node is desired to exhibit a constant rotational motion. We assume that the node number $n\ge 3$ and prove that in the controlled Kuramoto model (CKM) on complete graphs a synchronized solution that converges to the desired motion suffers a saddle-node ifurcation where a pair of stable and unstable ones born and that the corresponding solution is always asymptotically stable in the continuous limit (CL) if it exists. They are also proved to be the only synchronized solutions that are or can be stable in the CKM and CL, respectively, when the feedback gain is positive and the coupling constant is small enough for synchronized motions not to exist in the uncontrolled case. Moreover, we show based on the previous results that the asymptotically stable solution to the CL behaves as if it is an asymptotically stable one in the CKM when the node number is sufficiently large, even if the graphs are random dense or sparse, when the node number is sufficiently large. We demonstrate the theoretical results by numerical simulations for the CKM on complete simple, and uniform random dense and sparse graphs.</description>

      <title>Open dynamical systems with a moving hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an integer $b\ge 3$, let $T_b: [0,1)\to [0,1); x\mapsto bx\pmod 1$ be the expanding map on the unit circle. For any $m\in\mathbb{N}$ and $\omega=\omega^0\omega^1\ldots\in(\left\{0,1,\ldots,b-1\right\}^m)^\mathbb{N}$ let \[ K^\omega=\left\{x\in[0,1): T_b^n(x)\notin I_{\omega^n}~\forall n\geq 0\right\},\] where $I_{\omega^n}$ is the $b$-adic basic interval generated by $\omega^n$. Then $K^\omega$ is called the survivor set of the open dynamical system $([0,1),T_b,I_\omega)$ with respect to the sequence of holes $I_\omega=\left\{I_{\omega^n}: n\geq 0\right\}$. We show that the Hausdorff and lower box dimensions of $K^\omega$ always conincide, and the packing and upper box dimensions of $K^\omega$ also coincide. Moreover, we give sharp lower and upper bounds for the dimensions of $K^\omega$, which can be calculated explicitly. For any admissible $\alpha\leq \beta$ there exist infinitely many $\omega$ such that $\dim_H K^\omega=\alpha$ and $\dim_P K^\omega=\beta$. As applications we study badly approximable numbers in Diophantine approximation. For an arbitrary sequence of balls $\left\{B_n\right\}$, let $K\left(\left\{B_n\right\}\right)$ be the set of $x\in[0,1)$ such that $T_b^n(x)\notin B_n$ for all but finitely many $n\geq 0$. Assuming $\lim_{n\to\infty}\operatorname{diam} \left(B_n\right)$ exists, we show that $\dim_H K\left(\left\{B_n\right\}\right)=1$ if and only if $\lim_{n\to\infty}\operatorname{diam} \left(B_n\right)=0$. For any positive function $\phi$ on $\mathbb{N}$, let $E\left(\phi\right)$ be the set of $x\in[0,1)$ satisfying $|T_b^n (x)-x|\geq \phi(n)$ for all but finitely many $n$. If $\lim_{n\to\infty}\phi(n)$ exists, then $\dim_H E(\phi)=1$ if and only if $\lim_{n\to\infty}\phi(n)=0$. Our results can be applied to study joint spectral radius of matrices. We show that the finiteness property for the joint spectral radius of associated adjacency matrices holds true.</description>

      <title>Limits of sequences of volume preserving homeomorphisms in $W^{1,p}$, for $0&lt;p&lt;1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Douady referred in a personal communication to Peetre that, if $0&lt;p&lt;1$, the canonical mapping from $W^{1,p}(\mathbb{R})$ to $L^p(\mathbb{R})$ is not injective. Peetre \cite{peetre} went further, proving that the continuous and linear function $\pi=(\pi_1,\pi_2):W^{1,p}(\mathbb{R})\rightarrow L^p(\mathbb{R})\times L^p(\mathbb{R})$ such that, for $f\in C^\infty(\mathbb{R})$, $\Phi(f)=(f,f')$, is an isomorphism, showing the ``complete disconnection'' between $\pi_1$ and $\pi_2$. This means that given $g,h\in L^p(\mathbb{R})$ there exists a sequence $(f_n)_n$ of $C^1$ functions such that $\left(f_n,f_n'\right)_n$ converge to $(g,h)$ in $L^p(\mathbb{R})\times L^p(\mathbb{R})$.
  In this paper we obtain results of this type, but for homeomorphisms of an open bounded $\Omega \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$, that are volume preserving, in the case $d\geq 2$. The convergence of the sequences will be more restricted as we consider it in $L^\infty(\Omega)\times L^p(\Omega)$. As a particular case, we will show that if $SO(d)$ is the special orthogonal group and $H$ is a Riemann integrable function from $\Omega$ to $SO(d)$, then there exists a sequence $(f_n)_n$ of orientation and volume preserving $C^\infty$ homeomorphisms of $\Omega$ converging in $L^\infty(\Omega)$ to the identity and such that $\left(Df_n\right)_n$ converges to $H$ in $L^p(\Omega)^{d^2}$. The same is true if we substitute the identity function by any $f$, $C^1$ homeomorphism of $\Omega$ such that $Df(x)\in SO(d)$ for all $x\in\Omega$.
  In the case $d=1$, where the volume preserving condition has no interest, we will prove that a pair $(f,F)\in C^1(I)\times L^p(I)$, such that $f', (f^{-1})'\in L^r(I)$ for some $r&gt;1$, admits a sequence $(f_n)_n$ of $C^1$ homeomorphisms converging in $L^\infty(I)$ to $f$ and such that $(f_n')_n$ converges in $L^p(I)$ to $F$, if and only if $0\leq F\leq g'$.</description>

      <title>Quantitative equidistribution of periodic points for rational maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that periodic points of period $n$ of a complex rational map of degree $d$ equidistribute towards the equilibrium measure $\mu_f$ of the rational map with a rate of convergence of $(nd^{-n})^{1/2}$ for $\mathscr{C}^1$-observables. This is a consequence of a quantitative equidistribution of Galois invariant finite subsets of preperiodic points \`a la Favre and Rivera-Letelier. Our proof relies on the H\"older regularity of the quasi-psh Green function of a rational map, an estimate of Baker concerning Hsia kernel, as well as on the product formula and its generalization by Moriwaki for finitely generated fields over $\mathbb{Q}$.</description>

Abstract: We study points in cut-and-project sets which are visible from the origin, continuing a direction of inquiry initiated in [6,14] where the asymptotic density of visible points was investigated. We establish an error bound for the density of visible points in certain cases. We also prove that the set of visible points in irreducible cut-and-project sets with star-shaped windows is never relatively dense.</description>

      <title>Learning the Simplest Neural ODE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the advent of the ``Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (Neural ODE)'' paper, learning ODEs with deep learning has been applied to system identification, time-series forecasting, and related areas. Exploiting the diffeomorphic nature of ODE solution maps, neural ODEs has also enabled their use in generative modeling. Despite the rich potential to incorporate various kinds of physical information, training Neural ODEs remains challenging in practice. This study demonstrates, through the simplest one-dimensional linear model, why training Neural ODEs is difficult. We then propose a new stabilization method and provide an analytical convergence analysis. The insights and techniques presented here serve as a concise tutorial for researchers beginning work on Neural ODEs.</description>

      <title>Boundary value problem of magnetically insulated diode: existence of solutions and complex bifurcation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper focuses on the stationary self-consistent problem of magnetic insulation for a vacuum diode with space-charge limitation, described by a singularly perturbed Vlasov-Maxwell system of dimension 1.5. The case of insulated diode when the electrons are deflected back towards the cathode at the point $x^{*}$ is considered. First, the initial VM system is reduced to the nonlinear singular limit system of ODEs for the potentials of electric and magnetic fields. The second step deals with the limit system's reduction to the new nonlinear singular ODE equation for effective potential $\Theta(x)$. The existence of non-negative solutions is proved for the last equation on the interval $[0, x^{*})$ where $\Theta(x)&gt;0$. The most interesting and unexplored case is when $\Theta(x)&lt;0$ on the interval $(x^{*}, 1]$ and corresponds to the case of an insulated diode. For the first time, a numerical analysis of complex bifurcation of solutions in insulated diode is considered for $\Theta(x)&lt;0$ depending on parameters and boundary conditions. Bifurcation diagrams of the dependence of solution $\Theta(x)$ on a free point (free boundary) $x^{*}$ were constructed. Insulated diode spacing is found.</description>

      <title>Enabling Local Neural Operators to perform Equation-Free System-Level Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural Operators (NOs) provide a powerful framework for computations involving physical laws that can be modelled by (integro-) partial differential equations (PDEs), directly learning maps between infinite-dimensional function spaces that bypass both the explicit equation identification and their subsequent numerical solving. Still, NOs have so far primarily been employed to explore the dynamical behavior as surrogates of brute-force temporal simulations/predictions. Their potential for systematic rigorous numerical system-level tasks, such as fixed-point, stability, and bifurcation analysis - crucial for predicting irreversible transitions in real-world phenomena - remains largely unexplored. Toward this aim, inspired by the Equation-Free multiscale framework, we propose and implement a framework that integrates (local) NOs with advanced iterative numerical methods in the Krylov subspace, so as to perform efficient system-level stability and bifurcation analysis of large-scale dynamical systems. Beyond fixed point, stability, and bifurcation analysis enabled by local in time NOs, we also demonstrate the usefulness of local in space as well as in space-time ("patch") NOs in accelerating the computer-aided analysis of spatiotemporal dynamics. We illustrate our framework via three nonlinear PDE benchmarks: the 1D Allen-Cahn equation, which undergoes multiple concatenated pitchfork bifurcations; the Liouville-Bratu-Gelfand PDE, which features a saddle-node tipping point; and the FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model, consisting of two coupled PDEs that exhibit both Hopf and saddle-node bifurcations.</description>

      <title>Frequently hypercyclic composition operators on the little Lipschitz space of a rooted tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize the strictly increasing symbols $\varphi:\mathbb{N}_0\longrightarrow\mathbb{N}_0$ whose composition operators~$C_{\varphi}$ satisfy the Frequent Hypercyclicity Criterion on the little Lipschitz space $\mathcal{L}_0(\mathbb{N}_0)$. With this result we continue the recent research about this kind of spaces and operators, but our approach relies on establishing a natural isomorphism between the Lipschitz-type spaces over rooted trees and the classical spaces $\ell^{\infty}$ and $c_0$. Such isomorphism provides an alternative framework that simplifies and allows to improve many previous results about these spaces and the operators defined there.</description>

      <title>A short introduction to the control theory in finite-dimensional spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is a brief introduction to control theory in finite-dimensional spaces. The material is partly based on my lectures for the Master 1 program in Math\'ematiques et applications at Sorbonne University, delivered over the past few years. The aim is to provide a concise overview of the subject, primarily focusing on the linear setting. Proofs are presented in detail and are selected to allow for extensions to the infinite-dimensional case in many situations. Topics covered include the Kalman rank condition, the Hautus test, observability, stability, detectability and dynamic observers, the Pole Shifting Theorem, the linear test for controllability, linear-quadratic optimal control over finite and infinite horizons, and stabilization via Gramians.</description>

      <title>Symplectic Tiling Billiards, Planar Linkages, and Hyperbolic Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12259v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper I will unite two games,
  symplectic billiards and tiling billiards. The new
  game is called symplectic tiling billiards.
  I will prove a result about periodic orbits of
  symplectic tiling billiards in a
  very special case and then show how this result
  combines with the construction in
  Thurston's paper {\it Shapes of Polyhedra\/} to
  give hyperbolic structures on moduli spaces
  of planar equilateral polygons. One corollary
  is that the configuration space of the hexagonal
  planar linkage with unit-length rods (modulo
  isometry) has an
  algebraically defined hyperbolic structure in which
  it is a $10$-cusped hyperbolic $3$-manifold
  that is tiled by $15$ regular ideal octahedra.
  The $10$ cusps correspond to the $10$ maximally degenerate
  configurations.</description>

Abstract: We study non-expanding random walks on the space of affine lattices and establish a new classification theorem for stationary measures. Further, we prove a theorem that relates the genericity with respect to these random walks to Birkhoff genericity. Finally, we apply these theorems to obtain several results in inhomogeneous Diophantine approximation, especially on fractals.</description>

      <title>Mostly contracting random maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the long-term behavior of the iteration of a random map consisting of Lipschitz transformations on a compact metric space, independently and randomly selected according to a fixed probability measure. Such a random map is said to be \emph{mostly contracting} if all Lyapunov exponents associated with stationary measures are negative. This requires introducing the notion of (maximal) Lyapunov exponent in this general context of Lipschitz transformations on compact metric spaces. We show that this class is open with respect to the appropriate topology and satisfies the strong law of large numbers for non-uniquely ergodic systems, the limit theorem for the law of random iterations, the global Palis' conjecture, and that the associated annealed Koopman operator is quasi-compact. This implies many statistical properties such as central limit theorems, large deviations, statistical stability, and the continuity and H\"older continuity of Lyapunov exponents.
  Examples from this class of random maps include random products of circle $C^1$ diffeomorphisms, interval $C^1$ diffeomorphisms onto their images, and $C^1$ diffeomorphisms of a Cantor set on a line, all considered under the assumption of no common invariant measure. This class also includes projective actions of locally constant linear cocycles under the assumptions of simplicity of the first Lyapunov exponent and some kind of irreducibility.
  One of the main tools to prove the above results is the generalization of Kingman's subadditive ergodic theorem and the uniform Kingman's subadditive ergodic theorem for general Markov operators. These results are of independent interest, as they may have broad applications in other contexts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the work of Katznelson and Ornstein, we present a short way to achieve the almost optimal regularity in Moser's twist theorem. Specifically, for an integrable area-preserving twist map, the invariant circle with a given constant type frequency $\alpha$ persists under a small perturbation (dependent on $\alpha$) of class $C^{3+\epsilon}$. This result was initially established independently by Herman and R\"{u}ssmann in 1983. Our method differs essentially from their approaches.</description>

      <title>There are not many periodic orbits in bunches for iteration of complex quadratic polynomials of one variable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is proved that for every complex quadratic polynomial $f$ with Cremer's fixed point $z_0$ (or periodic orbit) for every $\delta&gt;0$, there is at most one periodic orbit of minimal period $n$ for all $n$ large enough, entirely in the disc (ball) $B(z_0, \exp -\delta n)$ (at most $p$ for a periodic Cremer orbit of period $p$). Next, it is proved that the number of periodic orbits of period $n$ in a bunch $P_n$, that is for all $x,y\in P_n$, $|f^j(x)- f^j(y)|\le \exp -\delta n$ for all $j=0,...,n-1$, does not exceed $\exp \delta n$. We conclude that the geometric pressure defined with the use of periodic points coincides with the one defined with the use of preimages of an arbitrary typical point. I. Binder, K. Makarov and S. Smirnov (Duke Math. J. 2003) proved this for all polynomials but assuming all periodic orbits were hyperbolic, and asked about general situations. We prove here a positive answer for all quadratic polynomials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2012.10186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the set of subgroups of the automorphism group of a two-sided full shift is closed under countable graph products. We introduce the notion of a group action without $A$-cancellation (for an abelian group $A$), and show that when $A$ is a finite abelian group and $G$ is a group of cellular automata whose action does not have $A$-cancellation, the wreath product $A \wr G$ embeds in the automorphism group of a full shift. We show that all free abelian groups and free groups admit such cellular automata actions. In the one-sided case, we prove variants of these results with reasonable alphabet blow-ups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15208v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate actions of topological groups $G$ on Lipschitz-free spaces $\mathcal{F}(M)$, induced by isometric actions on pointed metric spaces $M$. In particular, we study the associated dynamical $G$-systems under the weak-star topology, focusing on the dual action on $\mathrm{Lip}_0(M) = \mathcal{F}(M)^*$ and the bidual $\mathcal{F}(M)^{**}$. Two natural compactification constructions are considered: the metric compactification of isometric $G$-spaces over pointed metric spaces, and the Gromov $G$-compactification of bounded metric $G$-spaces. We show that for every bounded stable metric $G$-space $(M, d, \mathbf{0})$, the corresponding metric $G$-compactification defines a weakly almost periodic $G$-flow. We also explore notions of amenability in this setting, particularly in relation to the metric compactification, and introduce a topometric version of Lipschitz-free spaces.</description>

      <title>A Spectral Theory of Scalar Volterra Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work aims to bridge the gap between pure and applied research on scalar, linear Volterra equations by examining five major classes: integral and integro-differential equations with completely monotone kernels (viscoelastic models); equations with positive definite kernels (partially observed quantum systems); difference equations with discrete, positive definite kernels; a generalized class of delay differential equations; and a generalized class of fractional differential equations. We develop a general, spectral theory that provides a system of correspondences between these disparate domains. As a result, we see how `interconversion' (operator inversion) arises as a natural, continuous involution within each class, yielding a plethora of novel formulas for analytical solutions of such equations. This spectral theory unifies and extends existing results in viscoelasticity, signal processing, and analysis. It also introduces a geometric construction of the regularized Hilbert transform, revealing a fundamental connection to fractional and delay differential equations. Finally, it offers a practical toolbox for Volterra equations of all classes, reducing many to pen-and-paper calculations and introducing a powerful spectral approach for general Volterra equations based on rational approximation.</description>

      <title>Observability conditions for neural state-space models with eigenvalues and their roots of unity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We operate through the lens of ordinary differential equations and control theory to study the concept of observability in the context of neural state-space models and the Mamba architecture. We develop strategies to enforce observability, which are tailored to a learning context, specifically where the hidden states are learnable at initial time, in conjunction to over its continuum, and high-dimensional. We also highlight our methods emphasize eigenvalues, roots of unity, or both. Our methods effectuate computational efficiency when enforcing observability, sometimes at great scale. We formulate observability conditions in machine learning based on classical control theory and discuss their computational complexity. Our nontrivial results are fivefold. We discuss observability through the use of permutations in neural applications with learnable matrices without high precision. We present two results built upon the Fourier transform that effect observability with high probability up to the randomness in the learning. These results are worked with the interplay of representations in Fourier space and their eigenstructure, nonlinear mappings, and the observability matrix. We present a result for Mamba that is similar to a Hautus-type condition, but instead employs an argument using a Vandermonde matrix instead of eigenvectors. Our final result is a shared-parameter construction of the Mamba system, which is computationally efficient in high exponentiation. We develop a training algorithm with this coupling, showing it satisfies a Robbins-Monro condition under certain orthogonality, while a more classical training procedure fails to satisfy a contraction with high Lipschitz constant.</description>
