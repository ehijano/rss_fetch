      <title>Superposition with Delayed Unification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classically, in saturation-based proof systems, unification has been considered atomic. However, it is also possible to move unification to the calculus level, turning the steps of the unification algorithm into inferences. For calculi that rely on unification procedures returning large or even infinite sets of unifiers, integrating unification into the calculus is an attractive method of dovetailing unification and inference. This applies, for example, to AC-superposition and higher-order superposition. We show that first-order superposition remains complete when moving unification rules to the calculus level. We discuss some of the benefits this has even for standard first-order superposition and provide an experimental evaluation.</description>

      <title>Representing Pedagogic Content Knowledge Through Rough Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A teacher's knowledge base consists of knowledge of mathematics content, knowledge of student epistemology, and pedagogical knowledge. It has severe implications on the understanding of student's knowledge of content, and the learning context in general. The necessity to formalize the different content knowledge in approximate senses is recognized in the education research literature. A related problem is that of coherent formalizability. Responsive or smart AI-based software systems do not concern themselves with meaning, and trained ones are replete with their own issues. In the present research, many issues in modeling teachers' understanding of content are identified, and a two-tier rough set-based model is proposed by the present author. The main advantage of the proposed approach is in its ability to coherently handle vagueness, granularity and multi-modality. An extended example to equational reasoning is used to demonstrate these.</description>

      <title>Foundational propositions of hesitant fuzzy soft $\beta$-covering approximation spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soft set theory serves as a mathematical framework for handling uncertain information, and hesitant fuzzy sets find extensive application in scenarios involving uncertainty and hesitation. Hesitant fuzzy sets exhibit diverse membership degrees, giving rise to various forms of inclusion relationships among them. This article introduces the notions of hesitant fuzzy soft $\beta$-coverings and hesitant fuzzy soft $\beta$-neighborhoods, which are formulated based on distinct forms of inclusion relationships among hesitancy fuzzy sets. Subsequently, several associated properties are investigated. Additionally, specific variations of hesitant fuzzy soft $\beta$-coverings are introduced by incorporating hesitant fuzzy rough sets, followed by an exploration of properties pertaining to hesitant fuzzy soft $\beta$-covering approximation spaces.</description>

      <title>Sound and Complete Witnesses for Template-based Verification of LTL Properties on Polynomial Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the classical problem of verifying programs with respect to formal specifications given in the linear temporal logic (LTL). We first present novel \emph{sound and complete} witnesses for LTL verification over imperative programs. Our witnesses are applicable to both universal (all runs) and existential (some run) settings. We then consider LTL formulas in which atomic propositions can be polynomial constraints and turn our focus to polynomial arithmetic programs, i.e. programs in which every assignment and guard consists only of polynomial expressions. For this setting, we provide an efficient algorithm to automatically synthesize such LTL witnesses. Our synthesis procedure is both sound and semi-complete. Finally, we present experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach and that it can handle programs which were beyond the reach of previous state-of-the-art tools.</description>

      <title>A Fibrational Tale of Operational Logical Relations: Pure, Effectful and Differential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.03271v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Logical relations built on top of an operational semantics are one of the most successful proof methods in programming language semantics. In recent years, more and more expressive notions of operationally-based logical relations have been designed and applied to specific families of languages. However, a unifying abstract framework for operationally-based logical relations is still missing. We show how fibrations can provide a uniform treatment of operational logical relations, using as reference example a lambda-calculus with generic effects endowed with a novel, abstract operational semantics defined on a large class of categories. Moreover, this abstract perspective allows us to give a solid mathematical ground also to differential logical relations -- a recently introduced notion of higher-order distance between programs -- both pure and effectful, bringing them back to a common picture with traditional ones.</description>
