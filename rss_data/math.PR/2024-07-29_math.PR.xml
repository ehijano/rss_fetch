      <title>Critical Conditions for the Coverage of Complete Graphs with the Frog Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a system of interacting random walks known as the frog model. Let $\mathcal{K}_n=(\mathcal{V}_n,\mathcal{E}_n)$ be the complete graph with $n$ vertices and $o\in\mathcal{V}_n$ be a special vertex called the root. Initially, $1+\eta_o$ active particles are placed at the root and $\eta_v$ inactive particles are placed at each other vertex $v\in\mathcal{V}_n\setminus\{o\}$, where $\{\eta_v\}_{v\in \mathcal{V}_n}$ are i.i.d. random variables. At each instant of time, each active particle may die with probability $1-p$. Every active particle performs a simple random walk on $\mathcal{K}_n$ until the moment it dies, activating all inactive particles it hits along its path. Let $V_\infty(\mathcal{K}_n,p)$ be the total number of visited vertices by some active particle up to the end of the process, after all active particles have died. In this paper, we show that $V_\infty(\mathcal{K}_n,p_n)\geq (1-\epsilon)n$ with high probability for any fixed $\epsilon&gt;0$ whenever $p_n\rightarrow 1$. Furthermore, we establish the critical growth rate of $p_n$ so that all vertices are visited. Specifically, we show that if $p_n=1-\frac{\alpha}{\log n}$, then $V_\infty(\mathcal{K}_n,p_n)=n$ with high probability whenever $0&lt;\alpha&lt;E(\eta)$ and $V_\infty(\mathcal{K}_n,p_n)&lt;n$ with high probability whenever $\alpha&gt;E(\eta)$.</description>

      <title>Central limit theorem and moderate deviation principle for the stochastic generalized Burgers-Huxley equation with multiplicative noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) and Moderate Deviation Principle (MDP) for the stochastic generalized Burgers-Huxley (SGBH) equation with multiplicative Gaussian noise. The SGBH equation is a diffusion-convection-reaction type equation which consists a nonlinearity of polynomial order, and we take into account of an infinite-dimensional noise having a coefficient that has linear growth. We first prove the CLT which allows us to establish the convergence of the distribution of the solution to a re-scaled SGBH equation to a desired distribution function. Furthermore, we extend our asymptotic analysis by investigating the MDP for the SGBH equation. Using the weak convergence method, we establish the MDP and derive the corresponding rate function.</description>

      <title>Non-Homogeneous Generalized Fractional Skellam Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Non-homogeneous Generalized Skellam process (NGSP) and its fractional version NGFSP by time changing it with an independent inverse stable subordinator. We study distributional properties for NGSP and NGFSP including probability generating function, probability mass function (p.m.f.), factorial moments, mean, variance, covariance and correlation structure. Then we investigate the long and short range dependence structures for NGSP and NGFSP, and obtain the governing state differential equations of these processes along with their increment processes. We obtain recurrence relations satisfied by the state probabilities of Non-homogeneous Generalized Counting process (NGCP), NGSP and NGFSP. The weighted sum representations for these processes are provided. We further obtain martingale characterization and arrival time distribution for NGSP and NGFSP. An alternative version of NGFSP with a closed-form p.m.f. is introduced along with a discussion of its distributional and asymptotic properties. In addition, we study the running average processes of GCP and GSP which are of independent interest. The p.m.f. of NGSP and the simulated sample paths of GFSP, NGFSP and related processes are plotted. Finally, we discuss an application to a high-frequency financial data set pointing out the advantages of our model compared to existing ones.</description>

      <title>Exchangeable arrays and integrable systems for characteristic polynomials of random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The joint moments of the derivatives of the characteristic polynomial of a random unitary matrix, and also a variant of the characteristic polynomial that is real on the unit circle, in the large matrix size limit, have been studied intensively in the past twenty five years, partly in relation to conjectural connections to the Riemann zeta-function and Hardy's function. We completely settle the most general version of the problem of convergence of these joint moments, after they are suitably rescaled, for an arbitrary number of derivatives and with arbitrary positive real exponents. Our approach relies on a hidden, higher-order exchangeable structure, that of an exchangeable array. Using these probabilistic techniques, we then give a combinatorial formula for the leading order coefficient in the asymptotics of the joint moments, when the power on the characteristic polynomial itself is a positive real number and the exponents of the derivatives are integers, in terms of a finite number of finite-dimensional integrals which are explicitly computable. Finally, we develop a method, based on a class of Hankel determinants shifted by partitions, that allows us to give an exact representation of all these joint moments, for finite matrix size, in terms of derivatives of Painlev\'e V transcendents, and then for the leading order coefficient in the large-matrix limit in terms of derivatives of the $\sigma$-Painlev\'e III' equation. This gives an efficient way to compute all these moments and coefficients explicitly. Our methods can be used to obtain analogous results for a number of other models sharing the same features.</description>

      <title>A probabilistic interpretation of a non-conservative and path-dependent nonlinear reaction-diffusion system for the marble sulphation in Cultural Heritage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a reaction-diffusion system modelling the sulphation phenomenon, we derive a single regularised non-conservative and path-dependent nonlinear partial differential equation and propose a probabilistic interpretation using a non-Markovian McKean-type stochastic differential equation. We discuss the well-posedness of such a stochastic model, and we establish the propagation of chaos property for the related interacting particle system.</description>

      <title>The rank of a random triangular matrix over $\mathbb{F}_q$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider uniformly random strictly upper-triangular matrices in $\operatorname{Mat}_n(\mathbb{F}_q)$. For such a matrix $A_n$, we show that $n-\operatorname{rank}(A_n) \approx \log_q n$ as $n \to \infty$, and find that the fluctuations around this limit are finite-order and given by explicit $\mathbb{Z}$-valued random variables. More generally, we consider the random partition whose parts are the sizes of the nilpotent Jordan blocks of $A_n$: its $k$ largest parts (rows) were previously shown by Borodin to have jointly Gaussian fluctuations as $N \to \infty$, and its columns correspond to differences $\operatorname{rank}(A_n^{i-1}) - \operatorname{rank}(A_n^i)$. We show the fluctuations of the columns converge jointly to a discrete random point configuration $\mathcal{L}_{t,\chi}$ introduced in arXiv:2310.12275. The proofs use an explicit integral formula for the probabilities at finite $N$, obtained by de-Poissonizing a corresponding one in arXiv:2310.12275, which is amenable to asymptotic analysis.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Extinction, An Average Lyapunov Function Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stability of $\mathcal{M}_0$, an invariant subset of a Markov process $(X_t)_{t\geq 0}$ on a metric space $\mathcal{M}$. By building the theory of average Lyapunov functions, we formulate general criteria based on the signs of Lyapunov exponents that guarantee extinction ($X_t \to \mathcal{M}_0$ as $t \to \infty$). Additionally, we provide applications to a stochastic SIS epidemic model on a network with regime-switching, a stochastic differential equation version of the Lorenz system, a general class of discrete-time ecological models, and stochastic Kolmogorov systems. In many examples we improve existing results by removing unnecessary assumptions or providing sharper criteria for the extinction.</description>

      <title>H\"{o}lder continuous solutions to stochastic 3D Euler equations via stochastic convex integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with the three dimensional Euler equations driven by an additive stochastic forcing. First, we construct global H\"{o}lder continuous (stationary) solutions in $C(\mathbb{R};C^{\vartheta})$ space for some $\vartheta&gt;0$ via a different method from \cite{LZ24}. Our approach is based on applying stochastic convex integration to the construction of Euler flows in \cite{DelSze13} to derive uniform moment estimates independent of time. Second, for any divergence-free H\"{o}lder continuous initial condition, we show the existence of infinitely many global-in-time probabilistically strong and analytically weak solutions in $L^p_{\rm{loc}}([0,\infty);C^{\vartheta'}) \cap C_{\rm{loc}}([0,\infty);H^{-1})$ for all $p\in [1,\infty)$ and some $\vartheta'&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>Scaling limits for supercritical nearly unstable Hawkes processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper,we investigate the asymptotic behavior of nearly unstable Hawkes processes whose regression kernel has $L^1$ norm strictly greater than one and close to one as time goes to infinity. We find that,the scaling size determines the scaling behavior of the processes like in \cite{MR3313750}.Specifically,after suitable rescaling,the limit of the sequence of Hawkes processes is deterministic.And also with another appropriate rescaling,the sequence converges in law to an integrated Cox Ingersoll Ross like process.This theoretical result may apply to model the recent COVID19 in epidemiology and in social network.</description>

      <title>Quasi-stationary distributions for continuous-time $\lambda$-recurrent jump processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the continuous-time $\lambda$-recurrent jump process, the $\lambda$-recurrence assures the existence of quasi-stationary distribution when it has finite exit states (the states that have positive killing rates). And we give an explicit representation for this quasi-stationary distribution through $Q$-matrix, where the components of the quasi-stationary distribution outside the set $H$ of exit states can be represented by those within $H$. Sufficient condition is also provided for quasi-stationary distribution when the exit states are infinite.</description>

      <title>Normal approximation of Functionals of Point Processes: Application to Hawkes Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive an explicit upper bound for the Wasserstein distance between a functional of point processes and a Gaussian distribution. Using Stein's method in conjunction with Malliavin's calculus and the Poisson embedding representation, our result applies to a variety of point processes including discrete and continuous Hawkes processes. In particular, we establish an explicit convergence rate for stable continuous non-linear Hawkes processes and for discrete Hawkes processes. Finally, we obtain an upper bound in the context of nearly unstable Hawkes processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this article is to expand on the relationship between random matrix and multiplicative chaos theories using the integrability properties of the circular beta-ensembles. We give a comprehensive proof of the multiplicative chaos convergence for the characteristic polynomial and eigenvalue counting function of the circular beta-ensembles throughout the subcritical phase, including negative powers. This generalizes recent results in the unitary case, [NSW20,BF22], to any beta&gt;0 and for the eigenvalue counting field.</description>

      <title>Limit profile for the transpose top-2 with random shuffle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transpose top-$2$ with random shuffle (J. Theoret. Probab., 2020) is a lazy random walk on the alternating group $A_n$ generated by $3$-cycles of the form $(\star,n-1,n)$ and $(\star,n,n-1)$. We obtain the limit profile of this random walk by comparing it with the random walk on $A_n$ generated by all $3$-cycles. Our method employs a non-commutative Fourier analysis analogue of the comparison method introduced by Nestoridi (Electron. J. Probab., 2024). We also give the complete spectrum of the alternating group graph, thus answering a question of Huang and Huang (J. Algebraic Combin., 2019).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this thesis, we study asymptotic properties of the standard branching Brownian motion, with a specific emphasis on the additive martingales at high temperature. We start by presenting classic and fundamental tools for our investigation. Subsequently, we establish various convergence results that enhance our understanding of the model. In particular, these results include the determination of particles contributing to the additive martingales, the description of the fluctuations of these martingales around their limits, and an approximation of the so-called overlap distribution. Regarding the latter, we believe this is the first time that such an approximation is given. Remarkably, we identify a specific regime in which stable distributions emerge.</description>

      <title>The Global Existence of Martingale Solutions to Stochastic Compressible Navier-Stokes Equations with Density-dependent Viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.12835v5 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The global existence of martingale solutions to the compressible Navier-Stokes equations driven by stochastic external forces, with density-dependent viscosity and vacuum, is established in this paper. This work can be regarded as a stochastic version of the deterministic Navier-Stokes equations \cite{Vasseur-Yu2016} (Vasseur-Yu, Invent. Math., 206:935--974, 2016.), in which the global existence of weak solutions was established for adiabatic exponent $\gamma &gt; 1$. For the stochastic case, the regularity of density and velocity is even worse for passing the limit in nonlinear terms. We design a regularized system to approximate the original system. To make up for the lack of regularity of velocity, we need to add an artificial Rayleigh damping term besides the artificial viscosity and damping forces in \cite{Vasseur-Yu-q2016,Vasseur-Yu2016}. Moreover, we have to send the artificial terms to $0$ in a different order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current concepts of neural networks have emerged over two centuries of progress beginning with the neural doctrine to the idea of neural cell assemblies. Presently the model of neural networks involves distributed neural circuits of nodes, hubs, and connections that are dynamic in different states of brain function. Advances in neurophysiology, neuroimaging and the field of connectomics have given impetus to the application of mathematical concepts of graph theory. Current approaches do carry limitations and inconsistency in results achieved. We model the neural network of the brain as a directed graph and attach a matrix (called the Markov matrix) of transition probabilities (determined by the synaptic strengths) to every pair of distinct nodes giving rise to a (continuous) Markov process. We postulate that the network hubs are the nodes with the highest probabilities given by the stationary distribution of Markov theory. We also derive a new upper bound for the diameter of a graph in terms of the eigenvalues of the Markov matrix.</description>

Abstract: This work proposes stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) as a practical tool to replicate clustering effects of more detailed particle-based dynamics. Inspired by membrane-mediated receptor dynamics on cell surfaces, we formulate a stochastic particle-based model for diffusion and pairwise interaction of particles, leading to intriguing clustering phenomena. Employing numerical simulation and cluster detection methods, we explore the approximation of the particle-based clustering dynamics through mean-field approaches. We find that SPDEs successfully reproduce spatiotemporal clustering dynamics, not only in the initial cluster formation period, but also on longer time scales where the successive merging of clusters cannot be tracked by deterministic mean-field models. The computational efficiency of the SPDE approach allows us to generate extensive statistical data for parameter estimation in a simpler model that uses a Markov jump process to capture the temporal evolution of the cluster number.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Random Batch Method with replacement for interacting particle systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Random Batch Method (RBM) proposed in [Jin et al. J Comput Phys, 2020] is an efficient algorithm for simulating interacting particle systems. In this paper, we investigate the Random Batch Method with replacement (RBM-r), which is the same as the kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) method for the pairwise interacting particle system of size $N$. In the RBM-r algorithm, one randomly picks a small batch of size $p \ll N$, and only the particles in the picked batch interact among each other within the batch for a short time, where the weak interaction (of strength $\frac{1}{N-1}$) in the original system is replaced by a strong interaction (of strength $\frac{1}{p-1}$). Then one repeats this pick-interact process. This KMC algorithm dramatically reduces the computational cost from $O(N^2)$ to $O(pN)$ per time step, and provides an unbiased approximation of the original force/velocity field of the interacting particle system. In this paper, We give a rigorous proof of this approximation with an explicit convergence rate. An improved rate is also obtained when there is no diffusion in the system. Notably, the techniques in our analysis can potentially be applied to study KMC for other systems, including the stochastic Ising spin system.</description>

      <title>The $B_2$ index of galled trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been an effort to extend the classical notion of phylogenetic balance, originally defined in the context of trees, to networks. One of the most natural ways to do this is with the so-called $B_2$ index. In this paper, we study the $B_2$ index for a prominent class of phylogenetic networks: galled trees. We show that the $B_2$ index of a uniform leaf-labeled galled tree converges in distribution as the network becomes large. We characterize the corresponding limiting distribution, and show that its expected value is 2.707911858984... This is the first time that a balance index has been studied to this level of detail for a random phylogenetic network.
  One specificity of this work is that we use two different and independent approaches, each with its advantages: analytic combinatorics, and local limits. The analytic combinatorics approach is more direct, as it relies on standard tools; but it involves slightly more complex calculations. Because it has not previously been used to study such questions, the local limit approach requires developing an extensive framework beforehand; however, this framework is interesting in itself and can be used to tackle other similar problems.</description>

      <title>Dimers and M-Curves: Limit Shapes from Riemann Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general approach for the study of dimer model limit shape problems via variational and integrable systems techniques. In particular we deduce the limit shape of the Aztec diamond and the hexagon for quasi-periodic weights through purely variational techniques.
  Putting an M-curve at the center of the construction allows one to define weights and algebro-geometric structures describing the behavior of the corresponding dimer model. We extend the quasi-periodic setup of our previous paper [7] to include a diffeomorphism from the spectral data to the liquid region of the dimer.
  Our novel method of proof is purely variational and exploits a duality between the dimer height function and its dual magnetic tension minimizer and applies to dimers with gas regions. We apply this to the Aztec diamond and hexagon domains to obtain explicit expressions for the complex structure of the liquid region of the dimer as well as the height function and its dual.
  We compute the weights and the limit shapes numerically using the Schottky uniformization technique. Simulations and predicted results match completely.</description>

Abstract: Stochastic Volterra equations (SVEs) serve as mathematical models for the time evolutions of random systems with memory effects and irregular behaviour. We introduce neural stochastic Volterra equations as a physics-inspired architecture, generalizing the class of neural stochastic differential equations, and provide some theoretical foundation. Numerical experiments on various SVEs, like the disturbed pendulum equation, the generalized Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process and the rough Heston model are presented, comparing the performance of neural SVEs, neural SDEs and Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets).</description>

      <title>Causal effect estimation under network interference with mean-field methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study causal effect estimation from observational data under interference. The interference pattern is captured by an observed network. We adopt the chain graph framework of Tchetgen Tchetgen et. al. (2021), which allows (i) interaction among the outcomes of distinct study units connected along the graph and (ii) long range interference, whereby the outcome of an unit may depend on the treatments assigned to distant units connected along the interference network. For ``mean-field" interaction networks, we develop a new scalable iterative algorithm to estimate the causal effects. For gaussian weighted networks, we introduce a novel causal effect estimation algorithm based on Approximate Message Passing (AMP). Our algorithms are provably consistent under a ``high-temperature" condition on the underlying model. We estimate the (unknown) parameters of the model from data using maximum pseudo-likelihood and establish $\sqrt{n}$-consistency of this estimator in all parameter regimes. Finally, we prove that the downstream estimators obtained by plugging in estimated parameters into the aforementioned algorithms are consistent at high-temperature. Our methods can accommodate dense interactions among the study units -- a setting beyond reach using existing techniques. Our algorithms originate from the study of variational inference approaches in high-dimensional statistics; overall, we demonstrate the usefulness of these ideas in the context of causal effect estimation under interference.</description>

      <title>Stationary solution to Stochastically Forced Euler-Poisson Equations in Bounded Domain: Part 2. 1-D Ohmic Contact Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the asymptotic stability of the steady-state for a 1-D stochastic Euler-Poisson equations with Ohmic contact boundary conditions forced by the Wiener process. We utilize Banach's fixed point theorem and the a priori energy estimates uniformly in time to ensure the global existence of solutions around the steady state. In contrast to the deterministic case, the presence of stochastic forces lead to the lack of temporal derivatives of momentum, posing challenges for energy estimates. Furthermore, Ohmic contact boundary conditions pose greater challenges for energy estimates compared to systems with insulating boundary conditions. To address this issue, we establish asymptotic stability concerning the spatial derivatives through weighted energy estimates for the estimates of stochastic integrals, employing a technique distinct from that of the deterministic case. Furthermore, we demonstrate the existence of an invariant measure based on the a priori energy estimates. This invariant measure precisely corresponds to the Dirac measure generated by the steady state, due to the exponential decay of perturbed solutions around the steady state.</description>

      <title>The generator gradient estimator is an adjoint state method for stochastic differential equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the increasing popularity of overparameterized Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) like Neural SDEs, Wang, Blanchet and Glynn recently introduced the generator gradient estimator, a novel unbiased stochastic gradient estimator for SDEs whose computation time remains stable in the number of parameters. In this note, we demonstrate that this estimator is in fact an adjoint state method, an approach which is known to scale with the number of states and not the number of parameters in the case of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). In addition, we show that the generator gradient estimator is a close analogue to the exact Integral Path Algorithm (eIPA) estimator which was introduced by Gupta, Rathinam and Khammash for a class of Continuous-Time Markov Chains (CTMCs) known as stochastic chemical reactions networks (CRNs).</description>

      <title>Characterizing Dynamical Stability of Stochastic Gradient Descent in Overparameterized Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For overparameterized optimization tasks, such as the ones found in modern machine learning, global minima are generally not unique. In order to understand generalization in these settings, it is vital to study to which minimum an optimization algorithm converges. The possibility of having minima that are unstable under the dynamics imposed by the optimization algorithm limits the potential minima that the algorithm can find. In this paper, we characterize the global minima that are dynamically stable/unstable for both deterministic and stochastic gradient descent (SGD). In particular, we introduce a characteristic Lyapunov exponent which depends on the local dynamics around a global minimum and rigorously prove that the sign of this Lyapunov exponent determines whether SGD can accumulate at the respective global minimum.</description>

      <title>A new framework for identifying most reliable graphs and a correction to the $K_{3,3}$-theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a finite connected multigraph $G=(V,E)$, the all-terminal reliability function $R(G,p)$ is the probability that $G$ remains connected under percolation with parameter $p$. We develop new results concerning the question of which (multi)graphs~$G$ maximize $R(G,p)$ for a given number of vertices $n$, edges $m$ and a given parameter $p$ -- such graphs are called optimally reliable graphs -- paying particular attention to uniqueness and to whether the answer depends upon $p$.
  We generalize the concept of a distillation, and build a framework which we use to identify all optimally reliable graphs for which $m-n\in\{1,2,3\}$. These graphs are uniformly optimal in $p$. Many of them have been previously identified, but there are serious problems with these treatments, especially for the case $m-n=3$. We also obtain some partial results for $m-n\in\{4,5\}$.
  For $m-n=3$, the optimal graphs were incorrectly identified by Wang in 1994, in the infinite number of cases where $m\equiv 5 \pmod{9}$ and $m\geq 14$. This erroneous result, which concerns subdivisions of $K_{3,3}$, has been cited extensively and the mistake has not been detected. Furthermore, while the optimal graphs were correctly identified for other values of $m$, the proof is incorrect, as it also uses a claim for which we give a counterexample. Our proof of the rectified statement is self-contained.
  Regarding $m-n=4$, it was recently shown by Romero and Safe that the optimal graph depends upon $p$ for infinitely many $m$. We find a new such set of $m$-values, which gives a different perspective on why this phenomenon occurs. This leads us to conjecture that there are only finitely many $m$ for which there are uniformly optimal graphs when $m-n=4$, but that, for $m-n=5$, there are again infinitely many uniformly optimal graphs. We hope that our general results and methods will be useful for continued investigations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are numerous randomized algorithms to generate spanning trees in a given ambient graph; several target the uniform distribution on trees (UST), while in practice the fastest and most frequently used draw random weights on the edges and then employ a greedy algorithm to choose the minimum-weight spanning tree (MST). Though MST is a workhorse in applications, the mathematical properties of random MST are far less explored than those of UST. In this paper we develop tools for the quantitative study of random MST. We consider the standard case that the weights are drawn i.i.d. from a single distribution on the real numbers, as well as successive generalizations that lead to \emph{product measures}, where the weights are independently drawn from arbitrary distributions.</description>

Abstract: We study a continuous-time version of the Hegselmann-Krause model describing the opinion dynamics of interacting agents subject to random perturbations. Mathematically speaking, the opinion of agents is modelled by an interacting particle system with a non-Lipschitz continuous interaction force, perturbed by idiosyncratic and environmental noises. Sending the number of agents to infinity, we derive a McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equation as the limiting dynamic, by establishing propagation of chaos for regularized versions of the noisy opinion dynamics. To that end, we prove the existence of a unique strong solution to the McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equation as well as well-posedness of the associated non-local, non-linear stochastic Fokker-Planck equation.</description>

Abstract: We study the equilibrium fluctuations of an interacting particle system evolving on the discrete ring with $N\in\mathbb N$ points, denoted by $\mathbb T_N$, and with three species of particles that we name $A,B$ and $C$, but such that at each site there is only one particle. We prove that proper choices of density fluctuation fields (that match those from nonlinear fluctuating hydrodynamics theory) associated to the (two) conserved quantities converge, in the limit $N\to\infty$, to a system of stochastic partial differential equations, that can either be the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck equation or the Stochastic Burgers equation. To understand the cross interaction between the two conserved quantities, we derive a general version of the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma which is of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: We consider the 2D Euler equations on $\R^2$ in vorticity form, with unbounded initial vorticity, perturbed by a suitable non-smooth Kraichnan transport noise, with regularity index $\alpha\in (0,1)$.
  We show weak existence for every $\dot{H}^{-1}$ initial vorticity. Thanks to the noise, the solutions that we construct are limits in law of a regularized stochastic Euler equation and enjoy an additional $L^2([0,T];H^{-\alpha})$ regularity.
  For every $p&gt;3/2$ and for certain regularity indices $\alpha \in (0,1/2)$ of the Kraichnan noise, we show also pathwise uniqueness for every $L^p$ initial vorticity. This result is not known without noise.</description>

Abstract: We consider de Finetti's optimal dividends problem with absolutely continuous strategies in a spectrally negative L\'evy model with Parisian ruin as the termination time. The problem considered is essentially a generalization of both the control problems considered by Kyprianou, Loeffen &amp; P\'erez (2012) and by Renaud (2019). Using the language of scale functions for Parisian fluctuation theory, and under the assumption that the density of the L\'evy measure is completely monotone, we prove that a refraction dividend strategy is optimal and we characterize the optimal threshold. In particular, we study the effect of the rate of Parisian implementation delays on this optimal threshold.</description>

Abstract: The model of directed polymer in a random environment is a fundamental model of interaction between a simple random walk and ambient disorder. This interaction gives rise to complex phenomena and transitions from a central limit theory to novel statistical behaviours. Despite its intense study, there are still many aspects and phases which have not yet been identified. In this review we focus on the current status of our understanding of the transition between weak and strong disorder phases, give an account of some of the methods that the study of the model has motivated and highlight some open questions.</description>

Abstract: The randomized play-the-winner rule (RPW) is a response-adaptive design proposed by Wei and Durham (1978) for sequentially randomizing patients to treatments in a two-treatment clinical trial so that more patients are assigned to the better treatment as the clinical trial goes on. The elephant random walk (ERW) proposed by Schutz and Trimper (2004) is a non-Markovian discrete-time random walk on $\mathbb Z$ which has a link to a famous saying that elephants can always remember where they have been. The asymptotic behaviors of RPW rule and ERW have been studied in litterateurs independently, and their asymptotic behaviors are very similar. In this paper, we link RPW rule and ERW with the recursive stochastic algorithm. With the help of a recursive stochastic algorithm, we obtain the Gaussian approximation of the ERW and multi-dimensional varying-memory ERW with random step sizes. By the Gaussian approximation, the central limit theorem, precise law of the iterated logarithm, and almost sure central limit theorem are obtained for the multi-dimensional ERW, the multi-dimensional ERW with random step sizes, and their centers of mass for all the diffusive, critical, and superdiffusive regimes. Based on the Gaussian approximation and the small ball probabilities for a new kind of Gaussian process, the precise Chung type laws of the iterated logarithm of the multi-dimensional ERW with random step sizes and its mass of center are also obtained for both the diffusive regime and superdiffusive regime.</description>

      <title>Multi-level reflecting Brownian motion on the half line and its stationary distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16764v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A semi-martingale reflecting Brownian motion is a popular process for diffusion approximations of queueing models including their networks. In this paper, we are concerned with the case that it lives on the nonnegative half-line, but the drift and variance of its Brownian component discontinuously change at its finitely many states. This reflecting diffusion process naturally arises from a state-dependent single server queue, studied by the author (2024). Our main interest is in its stationary distribution, which is important for application. We define this reflecting diffusion process as the solution of a stochastic integral equation, and show that it uniquely exists in the weak sense. This result is also proved in a different way by Atar, Castiel and Reiman (2022,2023). In this paper, we consider its Harris irreducibility and stability, that is, positive recurrence, and derive its stationary distribution under this stability condition. The stationary distribution has a simple analytic expression, likely extendable to a more general state-dependent SRBM. Our proofs rely on the generalized Ito formula for a convex function and local time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2006.15158v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The relative arbitrage portfolio outperforms a benchmark portfolio over a given time-horizon with probability one. With market price of risk processes depending on the market portfolio and investors, this paper analyzes the multi-agent optimization of relative arbitrage opportunities in the coupled system of market and wealth dynamics. We construct a well-posed market dynamical system of McKean-Vlasov type under an empirical measure of investors, where each investor seeks for relative arbitrage with respect to a benchmark dependent on market and all the agents. We show the conditions to guarantee relative arbitrage opportunities among competitive investors through the Fichera drift. Under mild conditions, we derive the optimal strategies for investors and the unique Nash equilibrium that depends on the smallest nonnegative solution of a Cauchy problem.</description>

      <title>Inverse Scattering Method Solves the Problem of Full Statistics of Nonstationary Heat Transfer in the Kipnis-Marchioro-Presutti Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.02474v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We determine the full statistics of nonstationary heat transfer in the Kipnis-Marchioro-Presutti lattice gas model at long times by uncovering and exploiting complete integrability of the underlying equations of the macroscopic fluctuation theory. These equations are closely related to the derivative nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation (DNLS), and we solve them by the Zakharov-Shabat inverse scattering method (ISM) adapted by Kaup and Newell (1978) for the DNLS. We obtain explicit results for the exact large deviation function of the transferred heat for an initially localized heat pulse, where we uncover a nontrivial symmetry relation.</description>

      <title>Bounded-Confidence Models of Opinion Dynamics with Adaptive Confidence Bounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.07563v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: People's opinions change with time as they interact with each other. In a bounded-confidence model (BCM) of opinion dynamics, individuals (which are represented by the nodes of a network) have continuous-valued opinions and are influenced by neighboring nodes whose opinions are sufficiently similar to theirs (i.e., are within a confidence bound). In this paper, we formulate and analyze discrete-time BCMs with heterogeneous and adaptive confidence bounds. We introduce two new models: (1) a BCM with synchronous opinion updates that generalizes the Hegselmann--Krause (HK) model and (2) a BCM with asynchronous opinion updates that generalizes the Deffuant--Weisbuch (DW) model. We analytically and numerically explore our adaptive BCMs' limiting behaviors, including the confidence-bound dynamics, the formation of clusters of nodes with similar opinions, and the time evolution of an "effective graph", which is a time-dependent subgraph of a network with edges between nodes that {are currently receptive to each other.} For a variety of networks and a wide range of values of the parameters that control the increase and decrease of confidence bounds, we demonstrate numerically that our adaptive BCMs result in fewer major opinion clusters and longer convergence times than the baseline (i.e., nonadaptive) BCMs. We also show that our adaptive BCMs can have adjacent nodes that converge to the same opinion but are not {receptive to each other.} This qualitative behavior does not occur in the associated baseline BCMs.</description>

      <title>Extremal jumps of circuit complexity of unitary evolutions generated by random Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.17538v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate circuit complexity of unitaries generated by time evolution of randomly chosen strongly interacting Hamiltonians in finite dimensional Hilbert spaces. Specifically, we focus on two ensembles of random generators -- the so called Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE) and the ensemble of diagonal Gaussian matrices conjugated by Haar random unitary transformations. In both scenarios we prove that the complexity of $\exp(-it H)$ exhibits a surprising behaviour -- with high probability it reaches the maximal allowed value on the same time scale as needed to escape the neighborhood of the identity consisting of unitaries with trivial (zero) complexity. We furthermore observe similar behaviour for quantum states originating from time evolutions generated by above ensembles and for diagonal unitaries generated from the ensemble of diagonal Gaussian Hamiltonians. To establish these results we rely heavily on structural properties of the above ensembles (such as unitary invariance) and concentration of measure techniques. This gives us a much finer control over the time evolution of complexity compared to techniques previously employed in this context: high-degree moments and frame potentials.</description>

      <title>Coordinated Multi-Agent Patrolling with State-Dependent Cost Rates -- Asymptotically Optimal Policies for Large-Scale Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a large-scale patrol problem with state-dependent costs and multi-agent coordination.We consider heterogeneous agents, rather general reward functions, and the capabilities of tracking agents' trajectories.Given the complexity and uncertainty of the practical situations for patrolling, we model the problem as a discrete-time Markov decision process (MDP) that consists of a large number of parallel stochastic processes.We aim to minimize the cumulative patrolling cost over a finite time horizon.The problem exhibits an excessively large size of state space, which increases exponentially in the number of agents and the size of geographical region for patrolling.To reach practical solutions, we relax the dependencies between these parallel stochastic processes by randomizing all the state and action variables.In this context, the entire problem can be decomposed into a number of sub-problems, each of which has a much smaller state space and can be solved independently. The solutions of these sub-problems can lead to efficient heuristics.Unlike the past systems assuming relatively simple structure of the underlying stochastic process, here, tracking the patrol trajectories involves strong dependencies between the stochastic processes, leading to entirely different state and action spaces, transition kernels, and behaviours of processes,rendering the existing methods inapplicable or impractical.Further more, we prove that the performance deviation between the proposed policies and the possible optimal solution diminishes exponentially in the problem size, which also establishes the fact that the policies converge asymptotically at an exponential rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13144v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interacting particle systems in a finite-volume in equilibrium are often described by a grand-canonical ensemble induced by the corresponding Hamiltonian, i.e. a finite-volume Gibbs measure. However, in practice, directly measuring this Hamiltonian is not possible, as such, methods need to be developed to calculate the Hamiltonian potentials from measurable data. In this work, we give an expansion of the chemical potential in terms of the correlation functions of such a system in the thermodynamic limit. This is a justification of a formal approach of Nettleton and Green from the 50's, that can be seen as an inverse cluster expansion.</description>

      <title>Importance sampling for rare event tracking within the ensemble Kalman filtering framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12793v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we employ importance sampling (IS) techniques to track a small over-threshold probability of a running maximum associated with the solution of a stochastic differential equation (SDE) within the framework of ensemble Kalman filtering (EnKF). Between two observation times of the EnKF, we propose to use IS with respect to the initial condition of the SDE, IS with respect to the Wiener process via a stochastic optimal control formulation, and combined IS with respect to both initial condition and Wiener process. Both IS strategies require the approximation of the solution of Kolmogorov Backward equation (KBE) with boundary conditions. In multidimensional settings, we employ a Markovian projection dimension reduction technique to obtain an approximation of the solution of the KBE by just solving a one dimensional PDE. The proposed ideas are tested on three illustrative examples: Double Well SDE, Langevin dynamics and noisy Charney-deVore model, and showcase a significant variance reduction compared to the standard Monte Carlo method and another sampling-based IS technique, namely, multilevel cross entropy.</description>

Abstract: The recent seminal work of Chernozhukov, Chetverikov and Kato has shown that bootstrap approximation for the maximum of a sum of independent random vectors is justified even when the dimension is much larger than the sample size. In this context, numerical experiments suggest that third-moment match bootstrap approximations would outperform normal approximation even without studentization, but the existing theoretical results cannot explain this phenomenon. In this paper, we first show that Edgeworth expansion, if justified, can give an explanation for this phenomenon. Second, we obtain valid Edgeworth expansions in the high-dimensional setting when the random vectors have Stein kernels. Finally, we prove the second-order accuracy of a double wild bootstrap method in this setting. As a byproduct, we find an interesting blessing of dimensionality phenomenon: The single third-moment match wild bootstrap is already second-order accurate in high-dimensions if the covariance matrix has identical diagonal entries and bounded eigenvalues.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random Projections have been widely used to generate embeddings for various graph learning tasks due to their computational efficiency. The majority of applications have been justified through the Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma. In this paper, we take a step further and investigate how well dot product and cosine similarity are preserved by random projections when these are applied over the rows of the graph matrix. Our analysis provides new asymptotic and finite-sample results, identifies pathological cases, and tests them with numerical experiments. We specialize our fundamental results to a ranking application by computing the probability of random projections flipping the node ordering induced by their embeddings. We find that, depending on the degree distribution, the method produces especially unreliable embeddings for the dot product, regardless of whether the adjacency or the normalized transition matrix is used. With respect to the statistical noise introduced by random projections, we show that cosine similarity produces remarkably more precise approximations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13416v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $E$ be a Banach space such that $E'$ has the Radon-Nikod\'ym property. The aim of this work is to connect relative weak compactness in the $E$-valued martingale Hardy space $H^{1}(\mu,E)$ to a convex compactness criterion in a weaker topology, such as the topology of uniform convergence on compacts in measure. These results represent a dynamic version of the deep result of Diestel, Ruess, and Schachermayer on relative weak compactness in $L^{1}(\mu,E)$. In the reflexive case, we obtain a Kadec-Pe{\l}czy\'nski dichotomy for $H^{1}(\mu,E)$-bounded sequences, which decomposes a subsequence into a relatively weakly compact part, a pointwise weakly convexly convergent part, and a null part converging to zero uniformly on compacts in measure. As a corollary, we investigate a parameterized version of the vector-valued Koml\'os theorem without the assumption of $H^{1}(\mu,E)$-boundedness.</description>

      <title>Fock space of local fields of the discrete GFF and its scaling limit bosonic CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To connect conformal field theories (CFT) to probabilistic lattice models, recent works [HKV22, Ada23] have introduced a novel definition of local fields of the lattice models. Local fields in this picture are probabilistically concrete: they are built from random variables in the model. The key insight is that discrete complex analysis ideas allow to equip the space of local fields with the main structure of a CFT: a representation of the Virasoro algebra.
  In this article, for the first time, we fully analyze the structure of the space of local fields of a lattice model as a representation, and use this to establish a one-to-one correspondence between the local fields of a lattice model and those of a conformal field theory. The CFT we consider is probabilistically realized in terms of the gradient of the Gaussian Free Field (GFF). Its space of local fields is just a bosonic Fock space for two chiral symmetry algebras. The corresponding lattice model is the discrete Gaussian Free Field. Our first main result is that the space of local fields of polynomials in the gradient of the discrete GFF is isomorphic to the Fock space. These local fields make sense with both Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. Our second main result is that with the appropriate renormalization, correlation functions of local fields of the discrete GFF converge in the scaling limit to the correlation functions of the CFT. The renormalization needed is, conceptually correctly, according to the eigenvalue of the Virasoro generator $L_0 + \bar{L}_0$ on the local field.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Markovian Arrivals and Service with Applications to Intermittent Overload</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Almost all queueing analysis assumes i.i.d. arrivals and service. In reality, arrival and service rates fluctuate over time. In particular, it is common for real systems to intermittently experience overload, where the arrival rate temporarily exceeds the service rate, which an i.i.d. model cannot capture. We consider the MAMS system, where the arrival and service rates each vary according to an arbitrary finite-state Markov chain, allowing intermittent overload to be modeled.
  We derive the first explicit characterization of mean queue length in the MAMS system, with explicit bounds for all arrival and service chains at all loads. Our bounds are tight in heavy traffic. We prove even stronger bounds for the important special case of two-level arrivals with intermittent overload.
  Our key contribution is an extension to the drift method, based on the novel concepts of relative arrivals and relative completions. These quantities allow us to tractably capture the transient correlational effect of the arrival and service processes on the mean queue length.</description>

      <title>A Berry-Esseen theorem for incomplete U-statistics with Bernoulli sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There has been a resurgence of interest in the asymptotic normality of incomplete U-statistics that only sum over roughly as many kernel evaluations as there are data samples, due to its computational efficiency and usefulness in quantifying the uncertainty for ensemble-based predictions. In this paper, we focus on the normal convergence of one such construction, the incomplete U-statistic with Bernoulli sampling, based on a raw sample of size $n$ and a computational budget $N$. Under minimalistic moment assumptions on the kernel, we offer accompanying Berry-Esseen bounds of the natural rate $1/\sqrt{\min(N, n)}$ that characterize the normal approximating accuracy involved when $n \asymp N$, i.e. $n$ and $N$ are of the same order in such a way that $n/N$ is lower-and-upper bounded by constants. Our key techniques include Stein's method specialized for the so-called Studentized nonlinear statistics, and an exponential lower tail bound for non-negative kernel U-statistics.</description>
