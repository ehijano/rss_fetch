      <title>First Search for High-Energy Neutrino Emission from Galaxy Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exact sources of high-energy neutrinos detected by the IceCube neutrino observatory still remain a mystery. For the first time, this work explores the hypothesis that galaxy mergers may serve as sources for these high-energy neutrinos. Galaxy mergers can host very high-energy hadronic and photohadronic processes, which may produce very high-energy neutrinos. We perform an unbinned maximum-likelihood-ratio analysis utilizing the galaxy merger data from six catalogs and 10 years of public IceCube muon-track data to quantify any correlation between these mergers and neutrino events. First, we perform the single source search analysis, which reveals that none of the considered galaxy mergers exhibit a statistically significant correlation with high-energy neutrino events detected by IceCube. Furthermore, we conduct a stacking analysis with three different weighting schemes to understand if these galaxy mergers can contribute significantly to the diffuse flux of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos detected by IceCube. We find that upper limits (at $95\%$ c.l.) of the all flavour high-energy neutrino flux, associated with galaxy mergers considered in this study, at $100$ TeV with spectral index $\Gamma=-2$ are $2.57\times 10^{-18}$, $8.51 \times 10^{-19}$ and $2.36 \times 10^{-18}$ $\rm GeV^{-1}\,cm^2\,s^{-1}\,sr^{-1}$ for the three weighting schemes. This work shows that these selected galaxy mergers do not contribute significantly to the IceCube detected high energy neutrino flux. We hope that in the near future with more data, the search for neutrinos from galaxy mergers can either discover their neutrino production or impose more stringent constraints on the production mechanism of high-energy neutrinos within galaxy mergers.</description>

      <title>The influence of thermonuclear bursts on polar caps of accreting X-ray millisecond pulsar MAXI J1816-195</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report accretion-powered pulsations for the first time during thermonuclear bursts in hard X-rays, which were observed with Insight-HXMT in 2022 during the outburst of the accreting X-ray millisecond pulsar MAXI J1816-195. By stacking 73 bursts, we detected pulse profiles in 8-30 keV and 30-100 keV during bursts, which are identical to those obtained from the persistent (non-burst) emission. On average, no significant phase lag was observed between burst and persistent pulse profiles. In addition, we suggest that the interaction with burst photons can be used as a direct diagnostic to distinguish contributions from the hot plasma near polar caps and the corona around the accretion disk, which are highly degenerate in their spectral shapes.</description>

      <title>A correlation between hard X-rays and neutrinos in radio-loud and radio-quiet AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The production mechanism of astrophysical high-energy neutrinos is not yet understood. A common assumption is that beamed relativistic outflows (jets) driven by accreting black holes are needed to accelerate particles to such high energies to produce high-energy neutrinos. Indeed, the first astrophysical high-energy neutrino source candidate identified by IceCube at a significance level of $&gt;3\sigma$ was a blazar -- an AGN with an accreting supermassive black hole that drives a relativistic jet directed towards Earth. Recently, IceCube discovered strong evidence that Seyfert galaxies also emit neutrinos, which appears unrelated to jet activity. Here, we show that the neutrino--hard X-ray flux ratio of the blazar TXS 0506+056 is consistent with neutrino production in a $\gamma$-obscured region near the central supermassive black hole, with the X-ray flux corresponding to reprocessed $\gamma$-ray emission with flux comparable to that of neutrinos. Similar neutrino--hard X-ray flux ratios were found for three of IceCube's Seyfert galaxies, raising the possibility of a common neutrino production mechanism that may not involve a strong jet. We examine how future observations could test the jet origin of blazar neutrinos.</description>

      <title>A Multi-wavelength Study on A Gamma-ray Bright AGN 1308+326 Using KVN at 22 and 43 GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we conduct a multi-frequency analysis of the gamma-ray bright blazar 1308+326 from February 2013 to March 2020, using the Korean VLBI Network at 22 and 43 GHz and gamma-ray data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). Our findings reveal spectral variations around the 2014 gamma-ray flare, aligning with the shock-in-jet model. A strong correlation is observed between gamma-ray and 43 GHz emissions, with a 27-day lag in the VLBI core light curve, indicating a 50-day delay from the beginning of a specific radio flare to the gamma-ray peak. This radio flare correlates with a new jet component, suggesting the 2014 gamma-ray flare resulted from its interaction with a stationary component. Our analysis indicates the 2014 gamma-ray flare originated 40-63 parsecs from the central engine, with seed photons for the gamma-ray emission unlikely from the broad-line region.</description>

      <title>Impact of reflection Comptonization on X-ray reflection spectroscopy: the case of EXO 1846-031</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the disk-corona model, it is natural to expect that a fraction of reflection photons from the disk are Compton scattered by the hot corona (reflection Comptonization), even if this effect is usually ignored in X-ray reflection spectroscopy studies. We study the effect by using NICER and NuSTAR data of the Galactic black hole EXO 1846-031 in the hard-intermediate state with the model SIMPLCUTX. Our analysis suggests that a scattered fraction of order 10% is required to fit the data, but the inclusion of reflection Comptonization does not change appreciably the measurements of key-parameters like the black hole spin and the inclination angle of the disk.</description>

      <title>Precession and Split of Tilted, Geometrically Thin Accretion Disk: an Analytical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been observed that many relativistic jets display a kind of cork-screw-like precession. Numerical simulations has suggested that such kind of precession may originate from the precession of the disk. In this work, we introduce an analytical model to describe the precession and split of a tilted, geometrically thin disk. We consider the Lense-Thirring effect from the central (primary) black hole (BH) and the gravitational effect from the companion (secondary) BH far away from the center, both of which could induce the precession of the accretion disk around the spin axis of central black hole. We propose the splitting conditions that when the rate of viscous diffusion cannot catch up with the dynamical frequency at a certain layer of fluid, the disk would split into two parts which precess independently. We presume that the precessions of the inner and outer disks are in accord with the rotation and precession of jet, respectively. By matching the frequencies of the disks to the observed frequencies of jet in the cork-screw-like precession and considering the splitting condition, we are allowed to read four parameters, the innermost radius ($r_{\rm in}$), the outermost radius ($r_{\rm out}$) of the disk, the initial splitting radius ($r_{\rm sp,0}$), and the inflow speed magnitude($\beta$), of the disk. We apply this model to OJ 287. Moreover, considering the inward shrinking of the disks, we find the time variation of the precession angle of jet. This time variation presents a unique feature of our model, which could be distinguishable in the future observation.</description>

      <title>From MRI to SARI: Parametric survey of accretion disk instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accretion disks are highly unstable to magnetic instabilities driven by shear flow, where classically, the axisymmetric, weak-field Magneto-Rotational Instability (MRI) has received much attention through local WKB approximations. In contrast, discrete non-axisymmetric counterparts require a more involved analysis through a full global approach to deal with the influence of the nearby magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) continua. Recently, rigorous MHD spectroscopy identified a new type of an ultra-localised, non-axisymmetric instability in global disks with super-Alfv\'enic flow. These Super-Alfv\'enic Rotational Instabilities (SARIs) fill vast unstable regions in the complex eigenfrequency plane with (near-eigen)modes that corotate at the local Doppler velocity and are radially localised between Alfv\'enic resonances. Unlike discrete modes, they are utterly insensitive to the radial disk boundaries. In this work, we independently confirm the existence of these unprecedented modes using our novel spectral MHD code Legolas reproducing and extending our earlier study with detailed eigenspectra and eigenfunctions. We calculate growth rates of SARIs and MRI in a variety of disk equilibria, highlighting the impact of field strength and orientation, and find correspondence with analytical predictions for thin, weakly magnetised disks. We show that non-axisymmetric modes can significantly extend instability regimes at high mode numbers, with maximal growth rates comparable to the MRI. Furthermore, we explicitly show a region filled with quasi-modes whose eigenfunctions are extremely localised in all directions. These modes must be ubiquitous in accretion disks, and play a role in local shearing box simulations. Finally, we revisit recent dispersion relations in the Appendix, highlighting their relation to our global framework.</description>

      <title>The NANOGrav 15 yr Data Set: Looking for Signs of Discreteness in the Gravitational-wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmic merger history of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) is expected to produce a low-frequency gravitational wave background (GWB). Here we investigate how signs of the discrete nature of this GWB can manifest in pulsar timing arrays through excursions from, and breaks in, the expected $f_{\mathrm{GW}}^{-2/3}$ power-law of the GWB strain spectrum. To do this, we create a semi-analytic SMBHB population model, fit to NANOGrav's 15 yr GWB amplitude, and with 1,000 realizations we study the populations' characteristic strain and residual spectra. Comparing our models to the NANOGrav 15 yr spectrum, we find two interesting excursions from the power-law. The first, at $2 \; \mathrm{nHz}$, is below our GWB realizations with $p$-value significance $p = 0.05$ to $0.06$ ($\approx 1.8 \sigma - 1.9 \sigma$). The second, at $16 \; \mathrm{nHz}$, is above our GWB realizations with $p = 0.04$ to $0.15$ ($\approx 1.4 \sigma - 2.1 \sigma$). We explore the properties of a loud SMBHB which could cause such an excursion. Our simulations also show that the expected number of SMBHBs decreases by three orders of magnitude, from $\sim 10^6$ to $\sim 10^3$, between $2\; \mathrm{nHz}$ and $20 \; \mathrm{nHz}$. This causes a break in the strain spectrum as the stochasticity of the background breaks down at $26^{+28}_{-19} \; \mathrm{nHz}$, consistent with predictions pre-dating GWB measurements. The diminished GWB signal from SMBHBs at frequencies above the $26$~nHz break opens a window for PTAs to detect continuous GWs from individual SMBHBs or GWs from the early universe.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the periodic variability patterns of the X-ray emission from the blazar PG 1553+113</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for periodicity in the multi-wavelength high variable emission of blazars is a key feature to understand dynamical processes at work in this class of active galactic nuclei. The blazar PG 1553+113 is an attractive target due to the evidence of periodic oscillations observed at different wavelengths, with a solid proof of a 2.2-year modulation detected in the $\gamma$-ray, UV and optical bands. We aim at investigating the variability pattern of the PG 1553+113 X-ray emission using a more than 10-years long light curve, in order to robustly assess the presence or lack of a periodic behavior whose evidence is only marginal so far. We conducted detailed statistical analyses, studying in particular the variability properties of the X-ray emission of PG 1553+113 by computing the Lomb-Scargle periodograms, which are suited for the analyses of unevenly sampled time series, and adopting epoch folding techniques. We find out a modulation pattern in the X-ray light curve of PG 1553+113 with a period of $\sim$1.4 years, about 35% shorter than the one observed in the $\gamma$-ray domain. Our finding is in agreement with the recent spectro-polarimetric analyses and supports the presence of more dynamical phenomena simultaneously at work in the central engine of this quasar.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A large fraction of massive stars are found in higher order systems where the presence of a tertiary may significantly modify the system's evolution. In particular, it can lead to increased numbers of compact object binaries and accelerate their mergers with important implications for gravitational wave observations. Using Gaia, we constrain the number of Galactic supernovae that produce unbound triples. We do this by searching 8 supernova remnants for stars with consistent Gaia parallaxes and paths intersecting near the center of the supernova remnant at a time consistent with the age of the remnant. We find no candidates for unbound triple systems. Combined with prior work, less than 11.4\% of supernovae leave behind unbound triples at a 90\% confidence limit. The absence of such systems limits their role in the evolution of massive stars and the formation of merging compact objects.</description>

      <title>Deriving X-ray Line Profiles for Massive-Star Winds from Momentum-Conserving Dynamical Working Surface Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general procedure for deriving a line profile model for massive star X-ray spectra that captures the dynamics of the wind more directly. The basis of the model is the analytic solution to the problem of variable jets in Herbig-Haro objects given by \citet{Canto2000}. In deriving our model, we generalize this jet solution to include flows with a prescribed nonzero acceleration for the context of radiatively driven winds. We provide example line profiles generated from our model for the case of sinusoidal velocity and mass ejection variations. The example profiles show the expected shape of massive star X-ray emission lines, as well as interesting but complicated trends with the model parameters. This establishes the possibility that observed X-rays could be a result of temporal variations seeded at the wind base, rather than purely generated intrinsically within the wind volume, and can be described via a quantitative language that connects with the physical attributes of those variations, consistently with the downstream momentum-conserving nature of radiatively cooled shocked radial flows.</description>

      <title>Ensemble power spectral density of SDSS quasars in UV/optical bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context: Quasar variability has proven to be a powerful tool to constrain the properties of their inner engine and the accretion process onto supermassive black holes. Correlations between UV/optical variability and physical properties have been long studied with a plethora of different approaches and time-domain surveys, although the detailed picture is not yet clear. Aims: We analysed archival data from the SDSS Stripe-82 region to study how the quasar power spectral density (PSD) depends on the black hole mass, bolometric luminosity, accretion rate, redshift, and rest-frame wavelength. We developed a model-independent analysis framework that could be easily applied to upcoming large surveys such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). Methods: We used light curves of 8042 spectroscopically confirmed quasars, observed in at least six yearly seasons in five filters ugriz. We split the sample into bins of similar physical properties containing at least 50 sources, and we measured the ensemble PSD in each of them. Results: We find that a simple power law is a good fit to the power spectra in the frequency range explored. Variability does not depend on redshift at a fixed wavelength. Instead, both PSD amplitude and slope depend on the black hole mass, accretion rate, and rest-frame wavelength. We provide scaling relations to model the observed variability as a function of the physical properties, and discuss the possibility of a universal PSD shape for all quasars, where frequencies scale with the black hole mass, while normalization and slope(s) are fixed (at any given wavelength and accretion rate).</description>

      <title>Observational features of reflection asymmetric black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kerr spacetime is symmetric with respect to a well-defined equatorial plane. When testing the equatorial reflection symmetry of an isolated black hole, one is at the same time testing the Kerr hypothesis in General Relativity. In this work, we investigate the possible observational features when a Keplerian disk is surrounding a rotating black hole without reflection symmetry. When such symmetry is broken, generically, the photon trajectories around the black hole and the Keplerian orbits on the accretion disk are distorted vertically away from the equatorial plane by an amount that depends on their distance to the black hole. In the reflection asymmetric spacetime we are considering, these two kinds of orbits are distorted in opposite directions. Interestingly, while the size and shape of black hole shadows closely resemble those of Kerr black holes, distinct observational characteristics can emerge in the disk image and emission line profiles. When observing the disk edge-on, a pronounced concave shape may appear along its innermost edge on the incoming side. Furthermore, distinctive horn-like features might be observed on the spectral line profile at the blue-shifted side. These special features can serve as compelling indicators of the reflection asymmetry present in rotating black holes.</description>

Abstract: We study lensing of gravitational waves by a black hole in the deep wave optics regime, i.e. when the wavelength is much larger than the black hole Schwarzschild radius. We apply it to triple systems, with a binary of stellar mass objects in the inspiraling phase orbiting around a central massive black hole. We describe the full polarisation structure of the wave and derive predictions for the polarisation modes of the scattered wave measured by the observer. We show that lensing in the wave optics regime is not helicity preserving, as opposed to lensing in the geometric optics regime. The amplitude of the total wave is modulated due to interference between the directly transmitted and lensed components. The relative amplitude of the modulation is fixed by the lensing geometry and can reach unity in the most favourable settings. This indicates that wave optics lensing is potentially detectable by LISA for sufficiently high SNR systems. Our findings show that in the wave optics regime it is necessary to go beyond the usual lensing description where the amplification factor is assumed to be the same for both helicity modes. While motivated by GW190521 and the AGN formation scenario, our results apply more broadly to stellar-mass binaries orbiting a third body described as a Schwarzschild black hole, with a period comparable to the GW observation time.</description>

      <title>Particle content of very inclined air showers for radio signal modeling</title>

Abstract: The reconstruction of very inclined air showers is a new challenge for next-generation radio experiments such as the AugerPrime radio upgrade, BEACON, and GRAND, which focus on the detection of ultra-high-energy particles. To tackle this, we study the electromagnetic particle content of very inclined air showers, which has scarcely been studied so far. Using the simulation tools CORSIKA and CoREAS, and analytical modeling, we explore the energy range of the particles that contribute most to the radio emission, quantify their lateral extent, and estimate the atmospheric depth at which the radio emission is strongest. We find that the distribution of the electromagnetic component in very inclined air showers has characteristic features that could lead to clear signatures in the radio signal, and hence impact the reconstruction strategies of next-generation radio-detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Radio polarization of millisecond pulsars with multipolar magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11474</link>

Abstract: NICER has observed a few millisecond pulsars where the geometry of the X-ray emitting hotspots on the neutron star is analyzed in order to constrain the mass and radius from X-ray light curve modeling. One example, PSR J0030+0451, is shown to possibly have significant multipolar magnetic fields at the stellar surface. Using force-free simulations of the magnetosphere structure, it has been shown that the radio, X-ray, and gamma-ray light curves can be modeled simultaneously with appropriate field configuration. An even more stringent test is to compare predictions of the force-free magnetosphere model with observations of the radio polarization. This paper attempts to reproduce the radio polarization of PSR J0030+0451 using a force-free magnetospheric solution. As a result of our modeling, we can reproduce certain features of the polarization well.</description>

      <title>Source Confusion from Neutron Star Binaries in Ground-Based Gravitational Wave Detectors is Minimal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06836</link>

Abstract: Upgrades beyond the current second generation of ground-based gravitational wave detectors will allow them to observe tens of thousands neutron star and black hole binaries. Given the typical minute-to-hour duration of neutron star signals in the detector frequency band, a number of them will overlap in the time-frequency plane resulting in a nonzero cross-correlation. We examine source confusion arising from overlapping signals whose time-frequency tracks cross. Adopting the median observed merger rate of $100$ Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$, each neutron star binary signal overlaps with an average of 42(4)[0.5] other signals when observed from 2(5)[10] Hz. The vast majority of overlaps occur at low frequencies where the inspiral evolution is slow: 91% of time-frequency overlaps occur in band below 5 Hz. The combined effect of overlapping signals does not satisfy the central limit theorem and source confusion cannot be treated as stationary, Gaussian noise: on average 0.91(0.17)[0.05] signals are present in a single adaptive time-frequency bin centered at 2(5)[10] Hz. We quantify source confusion under a realistic neutron star binary population and find that parameter uncertainty typically increases by less than 1% unless there are overlapping signals whose detector-frame chirp mass difference is $\lesssim 0.01 M_{\odot}$ and the overlap frequency is $\gtrsim$ 40 Hz. Out of $1\times10^6$ simulated signals, 0.14% fall within this region of detector-frame chirp mass differences, but their overlap frequencies are typically lower than 40 Hz. Source confusion for ground-based detectors, where events overlap instantaneously is significantly milder than the equivalent LISA problem, where many classes of events overlap for the lifetime of the mission.</description>

      <title>Reduced-resolution beamforming: lowering the computational cost for pulsar and technosignature surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12723</link>

Abstract: In radio astronomy, the science output of a telescope is often limited by computational resources. This is especially true for transient and technosignature surveys that need to search high-resolution data across a large parameter space. The tremendous data volumes produced by modern radio array telescopes exacerbate these processing challenges. Here, we introduce a 'reduced-resolution' beamforming approach to alleviate downstream processing requirements. Our approach, based on post-correlation beamforming, allows sensitivity to be traded against the number of beams needed to cover a given survey area. Using the MeerKAT and Murchison Widefield Array telescopes as examples, we show that survey speed can be vastly increased, and downstream signal processing requirements vastly decreased, if a moderate sacrifice to sensitivity is allowed. We show the reduced-resolution beamforming technique is intimately related to standard techniques used in synthesis imaging. We suggest that reduced-resolution beamforming should be considered to ease data processing challenges in current and planned searches; further, reduced-resolution beamforming may provide a path toward computationally-expensive search strategies previously considered infeasible.</description>

      <title>Generation of narrow beams of super high-energy gamma quanta in the resonant inverse Compton-effect in the field of a strong x-ray wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The article presents a theoretical study of Oleinik resonances in the process of scattering a gamma quantum by an ultrarelativistic electron in the field of a strong electromagnetic wave. It is shown that under resonant conditions, the scattering channels of the reaction effectively split into two first-order processes according to a fine structure constant such as the external field-stimulated Compton effect. And the annihilation channel of the reaction effectively decays into direct and reverse the external field-stimulated Breit-Wheeler processes. The significant dependence of the resonant energy of final particles and resonant cross sections on the outgoing angles of the final gamma quantum, the number of absorbed and emitted photons of the wave, as well as the characteristic quantum parameters of the problem is shown. These quantum parameters are determined by the ratio of the initial particle energies to the characteristic energies of the Compton effect and the Breit-Wheeler process. An unambiguous relationship between the outgoing angles of final electrons and gamma quanta has been obtained, which qualitatively distinguishes the resonant process from the non-resonant one. The cases when the energy of the initial electrons significantly exceeds the energy of the initial gamma quanta have been studied. The conditions under which the energy of high-energy initial electrons is converted into the energy of final gamma quanta are obtained. At the same time, the resonant differential cross-section of such a process significantly (by several orders of magnitude) exceeds the corresponding non-resonant cross-section. This theoretical study predicts a number of new physical effects that may explain the high-energy fluxes of gamma quanta born near neutron stars and magnetars.</description>
