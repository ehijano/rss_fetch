      <title>Mahonian Statistics and Vincular Patterns on Permutations over Multisets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most Mahonian statistics can be expressed as a linear combination of vincular patterns. This is not only true with statistics on the permutation set, but it can also be applied for statistics on the permutation with repetition set. By following the method extending the vincular patterns combinations presented by Kitaev and Vajnovszki, we discover 8 vincular-patterns combinations of mad and madl extensions that are possible to be Mahonian. Some of these have been proved to be Mahonian on repetitive permutations by Clarke, Steingrimsson and Zeng, while the rest are new statistics extensions. In this thesis, we determine combinations of vincular pattern extension of mad and madl in Clarke, Steingrimsson and Zeng s paper, which have been proved to be Mahonian on the repetitive permutations. This result will be used to support the proof of Mahonity of the new statistics extensions. We show that these new statistics extensions are also Mahonian by constructing an involution {\Phi} on repetitive permutations, which preserves the descents statistics and transforms new statistics extensions to Mahonian mad and madl extensions of Clarke.</description>

      <title>Two Combinatorial Interpretations of Rascal Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main goal of this paper is to assign two combinatorial interpretations to the elements of the Rascal Triangle defined by Angorro et al. The first interpretation involves counting ascents in binary words, while the second interpretation involves pattern avoidance in the ascent sequences studied by Duncan and Steingr\'imsson, and related directly to a more recent paper by Baxter and Pudwell.</description>

      <title>Anti-Ramsey Numbers of Expansions of Doubly Edge-critical Graphs in Uniform Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an $r$-graph $H$, the anti-Ramsey number ${\rm ar}(n,r,H)$ is the minimum number $c$ of colors such that for any edge-coloring of the complete $r$-graph on $n$ vertices with at least $c$ colors, there is a copy of $H$ whose edges have distinct colors. A 2-graph $F$ is doubly edge-$p$-critical if the chromatic number $\chi(F - e)\geq p$ for every edge $e$ in $F$ and there exist two edges $e_1,e_2$ in $F$ such that $\chi(F -e_1- e_2)=p-1$. The anti-Ramsey numbers of doubly edge-$p$-critical 2-graphs were determined by Jiang and Pikhurko \cite{Jiang&amp;Pikhurko2009}, which generalized the anti-Ramsey numbers of cliques determined by Erd\H{o}s, Simonovits and S\'{o}s \cite{Erdos&amp;Simonovits&amp;Sos1975}. In general, few exact values of anti-Ramsey numbers of $r$-graphs are known for $r\geq 3$. Given a 2-graph $F$, the expansion $F^{(r)}$ of $F$ is an $r$-graph on $|V(F)|+(r-2)|F|$ vertices obtained from $F$ by adding $r-2$ new vertices to each edge of $F$. In this paper, we determine the exact value of ${\rm ar}(n,r,F^{(r)})$ for any doubly edge-$p$-critical 2-graph $F$ with $p&gt;r\geq 3$ and sufficiently large $n$.</description>

      <title>Maximizing the index of signed complete graphs with spanning trees on $k$ pendant vertices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A signed graph $\Sigma=(G,\sigma)$ consists of an underlying graph $G=(V,E)$ with a sign function $\sigma:E\rightarrow\{-1,1\}$. Let $A(\Sigma)$ be the adjacency matrix of $\Sigma$ and $\lambda_1(\Sigma)$ denote the largest eigenvalue (index) of $\Sigma$.Define $(K_n,H^-)$ as a signed complete graph whose negative edges induce a subgraph $H$. In this paper, we focus on the following problem: which spanning tree $T$ with a given number of pendant vertices makes the $\lambda_1(A(\Sigma))$ of the unbalanced $(K_n,T^-)$ as large as possible? To answer the problem, we characterize the extremal signed graph with maximum $\lambda_1(A(\Sigma))$ among graphs of type $(K_n,T^-)$.</description>

      <title>On differences of two harmonic numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the existence of a set of positive real numbers $X$ such that, for any $x \in X$, the difference of two harmonic numbers $H_m - H_{n}$ can asymptotically never get too close to $x$: for some $c=c_x&gt;0$ and all sufficiently large $m \geq n \geq N_0(x)$, one has the lower bound $$ \left| (H_m - H_n) - x \right| \geq c \cdot n^{-2}.$$ We show $1 \in X$ which answers a question of Erd\H{o}s and Graham. The set also contains the rational numbers $1/n \in X$ and $2/(2n+1) \in X$.</description>

      <title>A graph-theoretic proof of Cobham's Dichotomy for automatic sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a new graph-theoretic proof of Cobham's Theorem which says that the support of an automatic sequence is either sparse or grows at least like $N^\alpha$ for some $\alpha &gt; 0$. The proof uses the notions of tied vertices and cycle arboressences. With the ideas of the proof we can also give a new interpretation of the rank of a sparse sequence as the height of its cycle arboressence. In the non-sparse case we are able to determine the supremum of possible $\alpha$, which turns out to be the logarithm of an integer root of a Perron number.</description>

      <title>On Tuza's Conjecture in Dense Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1982, Tuza conjectured that the size $\tau(G)$ of a minimum set of edges that intersects every triangle of a graph $G$ is at most twice the size $\nu(G)$ of a maximum set of edge-disjoint triangles of $G$. This conjecture was proved for several graph classes. In this paper, we present three results regarding Tuza's Conjecture for dense graphs. By using a probabilistic argument, Tuza proved its conjecture for graphs on $n$ vertices with minimum degree at least $\frac{7n}{8}$. We extend this technique to show that Tuza's conjecture is valid for split graphs with minimum degree at least $\frac{3n}{5}$; and that $\tau(G) &lt; \frac{28}{15}\nu(G)$ for every tripartite graph with minimum degree more than $\frac{33n}{56}$. Finally, we show that $\tau(G)\leq \frac{3}{2}\nu(G)$ when $G$ is a complete 4-partite graph. Moreover, this bound is tight.</description>

      <title>An answer to Goswami's question and new sources of $IP^{\star}$-sets containing combined zigzag structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $A$ set is called $IP$-set in a semigroup $\left(S,\cdot \right)$ if it contains finite products of a sequence. A set that intersects with all $IP$-sets is called $IP^\star$-set. It is a well known and established result by Bergelson and Hindman that if $A$ is an $IP^{\star}$-set, then for any sequence $\langle x_{n}\rangle_{n=1}^{\infty}$, there exists a sum subsystem $\langle y_{n}\rangle_{n=1}^{\infty}$ such that $FS\left(\langle x_{n}\rangle_{n=1}^{\infty}\right)\cup \left(\langle x_{n}\rangle_{n=1}^{\infty}\right)\subset A$. In \cite[Question 3]{G}, S. Goswami posed the question: if we replace the single sequence by $l$-sequences, then is it possible to obtain a sum subsystem such that all of its zigzag finite sums and products will be in $A$. Goswami has given affirmative answers only for dynamical $IP^{\star}$-sets which are not equivalent to those of $IP^{\star}$-sets, but are rather significantly stronger. In this article, we will give the answer to Goswami's question that was unknown until now.</description>

      <title>The Factor Width Rank of a Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A matrix is said to have factor width at most $k$ if it can be written as a sum of positive semidefinite matrices that are non-zero only in a single $k \times k$ principal submatrix. We explore the ``factor-width-$k$ rank'' of a matrix, which is the minimum number of rank-$1$ matrices that can be used in such a factor-width-at-most-$k$ decomposition. We show that the factor width rank of a banded or arrowhead matrix equals its usual rank, but for other matrices they can differ. We also establish several bounds on the factor width rank of a matrix, including a tight connection between factor-width-$k$ rank and the $k$-clique covering number of a graph, and we discuss how the factor width and factor width rank change when taking Hadamard products and Hadamard powers.</description>

      <title>On the treewidth of generalized q-Kneser graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generalized $q$-Kneser graph $K_q(n,k,t)$ for integers $k&gt;t&gt;0$ and $n&gt;2k-t$ is the graph whose vertices are the $k$-dimensional subspaces of an $n$-dimensional $F_q$-vectorspace with two vertices $U_1$ and $U_2$ adjacent if and only if $\dim(U_1\cap U_2)&lt;t$. We determine the treewidth of the generalized $q$-Kneser graphs $K_q(n,k,t)$ when $t\ge 2$ and $n$ is sufficiently large compared to $k$. The imposed bound on $n$ is a significant improvement of the previously known bound. One consequence of our results is that the treewidth of each $q$-Kneser graph $K_q(n,k,t)$ with $k&gt;t&gt;0$ and $n\ge 3k-t+9$ is equal to $\gauss{n}{k}-\gauss{n-t}{k-t}-1$.</description>

      <title>On a Conjecture by Hayashi on Finite Connected Quandles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quandle is an algebraic structure whose binary operation is idempotent, right-invertible and right self-distributive. Right-invertibility ensures right translations are permutations and right self-distributivity ensures further they are automorphisms. For finite connected quandles, all right translations have the same cycle structure, called the profile of the connected quandle. Hayashi conjectured that the longest length in the profile of a finite connected quandle is a multiple of the remaining lengths. We prove that this conjecture is true for profiles with at most five lengths.</description>

      <title>Tighter Bounds on the Expected Absorbing Time of Ungarian Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2023, Defant and Li defined the Ungarian Markov chain associated to a lattice $L$. This Markov chain has state space $L$, and from any state $x \in L$ transitions to the meet of $\{x\} \cup T$, where $T$ is a randomly selected subset of the elements of $L$ covered by $x$. They defined $\mathcal{E}(L)$ to be the expected number of steps until the maximal element $\hat{1}$ of $L$ transitions into the minimal element $\hat{0}$ in the Ungarian Markov chain, and investigated its asymptotics when $L$ is the weak order on $S_n$, or the $n$th Tamari lattice $\textrm{Tam}_n$. This paper resolves a conjecture of Defant and Li and makes partial progress towards another, by proving that $\mathcal{E}(S_n)$ is linear in $n$, and proving an $n^{1 - o(1)}$ lower bound on $\mathcal{E}(\textrm{Tam}_n)$.</description>

      <title>The general position number under vertex and edge removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let ${\rm gp}(G)$ be the general position number of a graph $G$. It is proved that ${\rm gp}(G-x)\leq 2{\rm gp}(G)$ holds for any vertex $x$ of a connected graph $G$ and that if $x$ lies in some ${\rm gp}$-set of $G$, then ${\rm gp}(G) - 1 \le {\rm gp}(G-x)$. Constructions are given which show that ${\rm gp}(G-x)$ can be much larger than ${\rm gp}(G)$ also when $G-x$ is connected. For diameter $2$ graphs it is proved that ${\rm gp}(G-x) \le {\rm gp}(G)$, and that ${\rm gp}(G-x) \ge {\rm gp}(G) - 1$ when the diameter of $G-x$ remains $2$. It is demonstrated that ${\rm gp}(G)/2\le {\rm gp}(G-e)\leq 2{\rm gp}(G)$ holds for any edge $e$ of a graph $G$. For diameter $2$ graphs these results sharpens to ${\rm gp}(G)-1\le {\rm gp}(G-e)\leq\ {\rm gp}(G) + 1$. All these bounds are proved to be sharp.</description>

      <title>Higher weight spectra of ternary codes associated to the quadratic Veronese $3$-fold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem studied in this work is to determine the higher weight spectra of the Projective Reed-Muller codes associated to the Veronese $3$-fold $\mathcal V$ in $PG(9,q)$, which is the image of the quadratic Veronese embedding of $PG(3,q)$ in $PG(9,q)$. We reduce the problem to the following combinatorial problem in finite geometry: For each subset $S$ of $\mathcal V$, determine the dimension of the linear subspace of $PG(9,q)$ generated by $S$. We develop a systematic method to solve the latter problem. We implement the method for $q=3$, and use it to obtain the higher weight spectra of the associated code. The case of a general finite field $\mathbb F_q$ will be treated in a future work.</description>

      <title>Fully graphic degree sequences and P-stable degree sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of P-stability played an influential role in approximating the permanents, sampling rapidly the realizations of graphic degree sequences, or even studying and improving network privacy. However, we did not have a good insight of the structure of P-stable degree sequence families. In this paper we develop a remedy to overstep this deficiency.
  We will show, that if an infinite set of graphic degree sequences, characterized by some simple inequalities of their fundamental parameters, is $P$-stable, then it is ``fully graphic'' -- meaning that every degree sequence with an even sum, meeting the specified inequalities, is graphic. The reverse statement also holds: an infinite, fully graphic set of degree sequences characterized by some simple inequalities of their fundamental parameters is P-stable.
  Along the way, we will significantly strengthen some well-known, older results, and we construct new P-stable families of degree sequences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We begin by considering a sequence of polynomials in three variables whose coefficients count restricted binary overpartitions with certain properties. We then concentrate on two specific subsequences that are closely related to the Chebyshev polynomials of both kinds, deriving combinatorial and algebraic properties of some special cases. We show that the zeros of these polynomial sequences lie on certain algebraic curves, some of which we study in greater detail. Finally, we extend part of this work to restricted $b$-ary overpartitions for arbitrary integers $b\geq 2$.</description>

      <title>Extremal oriented graphs avoiding 1-subdivision of an in-star</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An oriented graph is a digraph obtained from an undirected graph by choosing an orientation for each edge. Given a positive integer $n$ and an oriented graph $F$, the oriented Tur$\acute{\rm a}$n number $ex_{ori}(n,F)$ is the maximum number of arcs in an $F$-free oriented graph of order $n$. In this paper, we investigate the oriented Tur$\acute{\rm a}$n number $ex_{ori}(n, \overrightarrow{S_{k,1}} )$, where $\overrightarrow{S_{k,1}}$ is the $1$-subdivision of the in-star of order $k+1$. We determine $ex_{ori}(n,\overrightarrow{S_{k,1}}) $ for $k=2,3$ as well as the extremal oriented graphs. For $k\ge 4$, we establish a lower bound and an upper bound on $ex_{ori}(n,\overrightarrow{S_{k,1}})$.</description>

Abstract: Let $F_{k,d}(n)$ be the maximal size of a set ${A}\subseteq [n]$ such that the equation \[a_1a_2\dots a_k=x^d, \; a_1&lt;a_2&lt;\ldots&lt;a_k\] has no solution with $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_k\in {A}$ and integer $x$. Erd\H{o}s, S\'ark\"ozy and T. S\'os studied $F_{k,2}$, and gave bounds when $k=2,3,4,6$ and also in the general case. We study the problem for $d=3$, and provide bounds for $k=2,3,4,6$ and $9$, furthermore, in the general case, as well. In particular, we refute an 18 years old conjecture of Verstra\"ete.
  We also introduce another function $f_{k,d}$ closely related to $F_{k,d}$: While the original problem requires $a_1, \ldots , a_k$ to all be distinct, we can relax this and only require that the multiset of the $a_i$'s cannot be partitioned into $d$-tuples where each $d$-tuple consists of $d$ copies of the same number.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the combinatorial invariance conjecture for parabolic Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials, formulated by Mario Marietti, is equivalent to its restriction to maximal quotients. This equivalence lies at the other extreme in respect to the equivalence, recently proved by Barkley and Gaetz, with the invariance conjecture for Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials, which turns out to be equivalent to the conjecture for maximal quotients.</description>

      <title>Metric Dimension and Resolvability of Jaccard Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A subset of points in a metric space is said to resolve it if each point in the space is uniquely characterized by its distance to each point in the subset. In particular, resolving sets can be used to represent points in abstract metric spaces as Euclidean vectors. Importantly, due to the triangle inequality, points close by in the space are represented as vectors with similar coordinates, which may find applications in classification problems of symbolic objects under suitably chosen metrics. In this manuscript, we address the resolvability of Jaccard spaces, i.e., metric spaces of the form $(2^X,\text{Jac})$, where $2^X$ is the power set of a finite set $X$, and $\text{Jac}$ is the Jaccard distance between subsets of $X$. Specifically, for different $a,b\in 2^X$, $\text{Jac}(a,b)=\frac{|a\Delta b|}{|a\cup b|}$, where $|\cdot|$ denotes size (i.e., cardinality) and $\Delta$ denotes the symmetric difference of sets. We combine probabilistic and linear algebra arguments to construct highly likely but nearly optimal (i.e., of minimal size) resolving sets of $(2^X,\text{Jac})$. In particular, we show that the metric dimension of $(2^X,\text{Jac})$, i.e., the minimum size of a resolving set of this space, is $\Theta(|X|/\ln|X|)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.04727v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study graphs of polynomial growth from the perspective of asymptotic geometry and descriptive set theory. The starting point of our investigation is a theorem of Krauthgamer and Lee who showed that every connected graph of polynomial growth admits an injective contraction mapping to $(\mathbb Z^n, \|\cdot\|_\infty)$ for some $n\in\mathbb N$. We strengthen and generalize this result in a number of ways. In particular, answering a question of Papasoglu, we construct coarse embeddings from graphs of polynomial growth to $\mathbb Z^n$. Moreover, we only require $n$ to be linear in the asymptotic polynomial growth rate of the graph; this confirms a conjecture of Levin and Linial, London, and Rabinovich "in the asymptotic sense." (The exact form of the conjecture was refuted by Krauthgamer and Lee.) All our results are proved for Borel graphs, which allows us to settle a number of problems in descriptive combinatorics. Roughly, we prove that graphs generated by free Borel actions of $\mathbb Z^n$ are universal for the class of Borel graphs of polynomial growth. This provides a general method for extending results about $\mathbb Z^n$-actions to all Borel graphs of polynomial growth. For example, an immediate consequence of our main result is that all Borel graphs of polynomial growth are hyperfinite, which answers a well-known question in the area. As another illustration, we show that Borel graphs of polynomial growth support a certain combinatorial structure called toast. An important technical tool in our arguments is the notion of padded decomposition from computer science, which is closely related to the concept of asymptotic dimension due to Gromov. Along the way we find an alternative, probabilistic proof of a theorem of Papasoglu that graphs of asymptotic polynomial growth rate $\rho&lt;\infty$ have asymptotic dimension at most $\rho$ and establish the same bound in the Borel setting.</description>

      <title>On graphs embeddable in a layer of a hypercube and their extremal numbers</title>

Abstract: A graph is cubical if it is a subgraph of a hypercube. For a cubical graph $H$ and a hypercube $Q_n$, $ex(Q_n, H)$ is the largest number of edges in an $H$-free subgraph of $Q_n$. If $ex(Q_n, H)$ is equal to a positive proportion of the number of edges in $Q_n$, $H$ is said to have positive Tur\'an density in a hypercube; otherwise it has zero Tur\'an density. Determining $ex(Q_n, H)$ and even identifying whether $H$ has positive or zero Tur\'an density remains a widely open question for general $H$.
  In this paper we focus on layered graphs, i.e., graphs that are contained in an edge-layer of some hypercube. Graphs $H$ that are not layered have positive Tur\'an density because one can form an $H$-free subgraph of $Q_n$ consisting of edges of every other layer. For example, a $4$-cycle is not layered and has positive Tur\'an density.
  However, in general it is not obvious what properties layered graphs have. We give a characterisation of layered graphs in terms of edge-colorings. We show that most non-trivial subdivisions have zero Tur\'an density, extending known results on zero Tur\'an density of even cycles of length at least $12$ and of length $8$. However, we prove that there are cubical graphs of girth $8$ that are not layered and thus having positive Tur\'an density. The cycle of length $10$ remains the only cycle for which it is not known whether its Tur\'an density is positive or not. We prove that $ex(Q_n, C_{10})= \Omega(n2^n/ \log^a n)$, for a constant $a$, showing that the extremal number for a $10$-cycle behaves differently from any other cycle of zero Tur\'an density.</description>

Abstract: Nevo, Santos, and Wilson constructed $2^{\Omega(N^d)}$ combinatorially distinct simplicial $(2d-1)$-spheres with $N$ vertices. We prove that all spheres produced by one of their methods are shellable. Combining this with prior results of Kalai, Lee, and Benedetti and Ziegler, we conclude that for all $D \ge 3$, there are $2^{\Theta(N^{\lceil D/2 \rceil})}$ shellable simplicial $D$-spheres with $N$ vertices.</description>

      <title>Random Tur\'an theorem for expansions of spanning subgraphs of tight trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.04193v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $r$-expansion of a $k$-uniform hypergraph $H$, denoted by $H^{(+r)}$, is an $r$-uniform hypergraph obtained by enlarging each $k$-edge of $H$ with a set of $r-k$ vertices of degree one. The random Tur\'an number $\mathrm{ex}(G^r_{n,p},H)$ is the maximum number of edges in an $H$-free subgraph of $G^r_{n,p}$, where $G^r_{n,p}$ is the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random $r$-graph with parameter $p$. In this paper, we prove an upper bound for $\mathrm{ex}(G^r_{n,p},H)$ when $H$ belongs to a large family of $r$-partite $r$-graphs: the $r$-expansion of spanning subgraphs of tight trees. This upper bound is essentially tight for at least the following two families of hypergraphs.
  1. Our upper bounds are essentially tight for expansions of $K^{k-1}_{k}$, the complete $(k-1)$-graph on $k$ vertices. The proof of the lower bound makes use of a recent construction of Gowers and Janzer generalizing the famous Ruzsa-Szemer\"edi construction. In particular, when $k=3$, this answers a question of the current author, Spiro and Verstra\"ete concerning the random Tur\'an number of linear triangle.
  2. Let $T$ be a tight tree such that the intersection of all edges of $T$ is empty. Simple construction shows that the upper bounds we have for expansions of $T$ are essentially tight.
  The main technical contribution of this paper is a new way to obtain balanced supersaturation results for expansions of hypergraphs: we combine two ideas, one of Mubayi-Yepremyan and another of Balogh-Narayanan-Skokan, via codegree dichotomy. We note that neither of these two ideas alone would be enough to recover results in this paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.02761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a given connected graph $G$, the edge Mostar index $Mo_e(G)$ is defined as $Mo_e(G)=\sum_{e=uv \in E(G)}|m_u(e|G) - m_v(e|G)|$, where $m_u(e|G)$ and $m_v(e|G)$ are respectively, the number of edges of $G$ lying closer to vertex $u$ than to vertex $v$ and the number of edges of $G$ lying closer to vertex $v$ than to vertex $u$. We determine a sharp upper bound for the edge Mostar index on bicyclic graphs and identify the graphs that attain the bound, which disproves a conjecture proposed by Liu et al. [Iranian J. Math. Chem. 11(2) (2020) 95--106].</description>

Abstract: Consider a subset [1,2,...,n]x[1,2,...,n] of the plane integer lattice. Take any non self-intersecting n^2-gon built on it (straight angles are allowed). The square of a side length is a positive integer. It is thus natural to ask how large the sum of square lengths of such an n^2-gon can be. This maximal value is a new integer sequence, labeled by A358212 in OEIS. In this note we give the lower bound and conjecture that this in fact is the correct answer. We further investigate proper n^2-gons (straight angles are not allowed) and present analogous results. Both sequences (conjecturally) have a different growth size.</description>

      <title>New examples and partial classification of 15-vertex triangulations of the quaternionic projective plane</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Brehm and K\"uhnel (1992) constructed three 15-vertex combinatorial 8-manifolds `like the quaternionic projective plane' with symmetry groups $\mathrm{A}_5$, $\mathrm{A}_4$, and $\mathrm{S}_3$, respectively. Gorodkov (2016) proved that these three manifolds are in fact PL homeomorphic to $\mathbb{HP}^2$. Note that 15 is the minimal number of vertices of a combinatorial 8-manifold that is not PL homeomorphic to $S^8$. In the present paper we construct a lot of new 15-vertex triangulations of $\mathbb{HP}^2$. A surprising fact is that such examples are found for very different symmetry groups, including those not in any way related to the group $\mathrm{A}_5$. Namely, we find 19 triangulations with symmetry group $\mathrm{C}_7$, one triangulation with symmetry group $\mathrm{C}_6\times\mathrm{C}_2$, 14 triangulations with symmetry group $\mathrm{C}_6$, 26 triangulations with symmetry group $\mathrm{C}_5$, one new triangulation with symmetry group $\mathrm{A}_4$, and 11 new triangulations with symmetry group $\mathrm{S}_3$. Further, we obtain the following classification result. We prove that, up to isomorphism, there are exactly 75 triangulations of $\mathbb{HP}^2$ with 15 vertices and symmetry group of order at least 4: the three Brehm-K\"uhnel triangulations and the 72 new triangulations listed above. On the other hand, we show that there are plenty of triangulations with symmetry groups $\mathrm{C}_3$ and $\mathrm{C}_2$, as well as the trivial symmetry group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17469v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we give a combinatorial formula for a certain class of Koornwinder polynomials, also known as Macdonald polynomials of type $\tilde{C}$. In particular, we give a combinatorial formula for the Koornwinder polynomials $K_{\lambda} = K_{\lambda}(z_1,\dots,z_N; a,b,c,d; q,t)$, where $\lambda = (1,\dots,1,0,\dots,0)$. We also give combinatorial formulas for all ``open boundary ASEP polynomials'' $F_{\mu}$, where $\mu$ is a composition in $\{-1,0,1\}^N$; these polynomials are related to the nonsymmetric Koornwinder polynomials $E_{\mu}$ up to a triangular change of basis. Our formulas are in terms of rhombic staircase tableaux, certain tableaux that we introduced in previous work to give a formula for the stationary distribution of the two-species asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) on a line with open boundaries.</description>

These tools are subsequently applied to derive counterparts for the exponential identity $e^{A+B} = e^A e^B$ and the binomial theorem $(A+B)^n = \sum \binom{n}{k} A^k B^{n-k}$ when the commutator $[B, A]$ is either an arbitrary quadratic polynomial or a monomial in $A$ or $B$. Analogous formulas are found when the commutator is bivariate. Furthermore, we introduce a novel operator bridging between the normal and antinormal forms.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous extension of the polynomial Central Sets Theorem and the polynomial Milliken-Taylor theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we prove twofold polynomial extension of Beigelb\"{o}ck's \cite{b} multidimensional Central Sets Theorem (which was a common extension of Furstenberg's Central Sets Theorem, and Milliken-Taylor theorem). We also find the complete ultrafilter characterization of the multidimensional Central Sets Theorems. Then we prove twofold common extension of Bergelson, Hindman, and William's \cite{bhw} polynomial Milliken-Taylor theorem, and the multidimensional polynomial Central Sets Theorems. We also find a sufficient condition over two distinct multidimensional polynomials for which their Milliken-Taylor image lie in the same color. This result gives a partial polynomial extension of Deuber, Hindman, Leader, and Lefmann's \cite{d} result on the separating Milliken-Taylor system.</description>

      <title>Betti numbers and torsions in homology groups of double coverings</title>

Abstract: Papadima and Suciu proved an inequality between the ranks of the cohomology groups of the Aomoto complex with finite field coefficients and the twisted cohomology groups, and conjectured that they are actually equal for certain cases associated with the Milnor fiber of the arrangement. Recently, an arrangement (the icosidodecahedral arrangement) with the following two peculiar properties was found: (i) the strict version of Papadima-Suciu's inequality holds, and (ii) the first integral homology of the Milnor fiber has a non-trivial $2$-torsion. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between these two properties for double covering spaces. We prove that (i) and (ii) are actually equivalent.</description>

      <title>The landscape of compressibility measures for two-dimensional data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02629v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we extend to two-dimensional data two recently introduced one-dimensional compressibility measures: the $\gamma$ measure defined in terms of the smallest string attractor, and the $\delta$ measure defined in terms of the number of distinct substrings of the input string. Concretely, we introduce the two-dimensional measures $\gamma_{2D}$ and $\delta_{2D}$, as natural generalizations of $\gamma$ and $\delta$, and we initiate the study of their properties. Among other things, we prove that $\delta_{2D}$ is monotone and can be computed in linear time, and we show that, although it is still true that $\delta_{2D} \leq \gamma_{2D}$, the gap between the two measures can be $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ and therefore asymptotically larger than the gap between $\gamma$ and $\delta$. To complete the scenario of two-dimensional compressibility measures, we introduce the measure $b_{2D}$ which generalizes to two dimensions the notion of optimal parsing. We prove that, somewhat surprisingly, the relationship between $b_{2D}$ and $\gamma_{2D}$ is significantly different than in the one-dimensional case. As an application of our results we provide the first analysis of the space usage of the two-dimensional block tree introduced in [Brisaboa et al., Two-dimensional block trees, The computer Journal, 2024]. Our analysis shows that the space usage can be bounded in terms of both $\gamma_{2D}$ and $\delta_{2D}$. Finally, using insights from our analysis, we design the first linear time and space algorithm for constructing the two-dimensional block tree for arbitrary matrices.</description>

      <title>$q$-deformation of Aomoto complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A degree one element of the Orlik-Solomon algebra of a hyperplane arrangement defines a cochain complex known as the Aomoto complex. The Aomoto complex can be considerd as the ``linear approximation'' of the twisted cochain complex with coefficients in a complex rank one local system.
  In this paper, we discuss $q$-deformations of the Aomoto complex. The $q$-deformation is defined by replacing the entries of representation matrices of the coboundary maps with their $q$-analogues. While the resulting maps do not generally define cochain complexes, for certain special basis derived from real structures, the $q$-deformation becomes again a cochain complex. Moreover, it exhibits universality in the sense that any specialization of $q$ to a complex number yields the cochain complex computing the corresponding local system cohomology group.</description>

      <title>Nearly Orthogonal Sets over Finite Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a field $\mathbb{F}$ and integers $d$ and $k$, a set of vectors of $\mathbb{F}^d$ is called $k$-nearly orthogonal if its members are non-self-orthogonal and every $k+1$ of them include an orthogonal pair. We prove that for every prime $p$ there exists a positive constant $\delta = \delta (p)$, such that for every field $\mathbb{F}$ of characteristic $p$ and for all integers $k \geq 2$ and $d \geq k^{1/(p-1)}$, there exists a $k$-nearly orthogonal set of at least $d^{\delta \cdot k^{1/(p-1)}/ \log k}$ vectors of $\mathbb{F}^d$. In particular, for the binary field we obtain a set of $d^{\Omega( k /\log k)}$ vectors, and this is tight up to the $\log k$ term in the exponent. For comparison, the best known lower bound over the reals is $d^{\Omega( \log k / \log \log k)}$ (Alon and Szegedy, Graphs and Combin., 1999). The proof combines probabilistic and spectral arguments.</description>

      <title>A categorification of cluster algebras of type B and C through symmetric quivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11308v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We express cluster variables of type $B_n$ and $C_n$ in terms of cluster variables of type $A_n$. Then we associate a cluster tilted bound symmetric quiver $Q$ of type $A_{2n-1}$ to any seed of a cluster algebra of type $B_n$ and $C_n$. Under this correspondence, cluster variables of type $B_n$ (resp. $C_n$) correspond to orthogonal (resp. symplectic) indecomposable representations of $Q$. We find a Caldero-Chapoton map in this setting. We also give a categorical interpretation of the cluster expansion formula in the case of acyclic quivers.</description>
