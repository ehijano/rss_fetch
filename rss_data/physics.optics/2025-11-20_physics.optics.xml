      <title>Membrane stepping optimization in Modulation Based Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modulation-based imaging (MoBI) is an X-ray phase-contrast technique that uses an intensity modulator (or membrane) in the beam. Although MoBI can be performed in a single shot, multiple exposures are typically needed to improve the quality of the result. The membrane is typically moved using a regular stepping pattern for convenience; however, the impact of the membrane movement scheme on image quality has not been fully investigated yet. In this work, we explore optimized movement strategies aiming at improving MoBI performance. An experimental study tested optimization schemes based on global and local standard deviation metrics, and compared them with regular and random stepping motions. The results demonstrated superior contrast-to-noise ratio and reduced angular sensitivity in the optimized approaches compared to conventional stepping. These results were consistent across different membrane types, with honeycomb membranes showing the highest compatibility with the optimization procedure. Noise power spectrum analysis further validated the advantages of the optimized motion strategies. Overall, the results demonstrate that an optimized membrane movement can significantly improve MoBI image quality without increasing experimental complexity.</description>

      <title>Thermalization of quantum light induced by classical nonlinear wave dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermalization of isolated quantum systems is an intriguing phenomenon at the forefront of contemporary physics. In this work, we demonstrate that nonlinear multimode optical platforms can be harnessed to induce effective quantum interactions between photons. Through numerical experiments where quantum beams propagate alongside classical light within multimode nonlinear optical systems, we reveal the thermalization of fundamental quantum light states--specifically single- and two-photon states. This thermalization is clearly manifested by the emergence of Rayleigh-Jeans and Boltzmann statistical distributions. Beyond providing a deeper understanding of how classical nonlinearities can be used to investigate quantum many-body dynamics, our findings will enable the exploration of a broader range of complex quantum phenomena, including aspects of quantum phase transitions, within readily accessible classical optical settings.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Inverse Design of Multi-Layer Metasurface Cavities for Dual Resonance Enhancement of Nanodiamond Single Photon Emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-photon emitters (SPEs) based on nitrogen-vacancy centers in nanodiamonds (neutral NV0 (wavelength 575 nm) and negative NV- (wavelength 637 nm)) represent promising platforms for quantum nanophotonics applications, yet their emission efficiencies remain constrained by weak light-matter interactions. Multi-layer metasurfaces (MLM) offer unprecedented degrees of freedom for efficient light manipulation beyond conventional single-material metasurfaces, enabling dual-resonance cavities that can simultaneously enhance pump excitation and SPE collection. However, traditional trial-and-error and forward optimization methods face significant challenges in designing these complex structures due to the vast parameter space and computational demands. Here, we present NanoPhotoNet-Inverse, an artificial intelligence-driven inverse design framework based on a hybrid deep neural network architecture. This model efficiently performs inverse design of two dual-resonance MLM cavities to amplify pump and SPE emissions of different vacancies in nanodiamond and improve SPE collection. Our approach achieves inverse design prediction efficiency exceeding 98.7%, demonstrating three orders of magnitude amplification in SPE count rate and 50 picosecond lifetime, significantly surpassing conventional cavity designs. These remarkable enhancements in emission rates and collection efficiency position our platform as a transformative technology for advancing quantum communication networks, quantum computing architectures, quantum sensing applications, and quantum cryptography systems. Therefore, it opens new pathways for intelligent photonic device engineering in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>A High Responsivity Broadband Photodetector Based on a WSe2 NiO Nanowire Heterostructure with Engineered Nanophotonic Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Engineering nanoscale light matter interaction in mixed dimensional semiconductor heterostructures offers a pathway to mitigate the intrinsic gain bandwidth trade off in photodetectors. Here, we report a broadband, high responsivity 2D and 1D photodetector formed by integrating monolayer p type WSe2 with electrospun p type NiO nanowires. The device photoresponse spans 350 to 780 nm and is governed by a nanophotonic field confinement mechanism rather than bulk optical absorption. The high index NiO nanowire acts as a dielectric Mie type nanoresonator that supports geometry defined optical modes and produces antenna like near field concentration at the nanoscale WSe2 and NiO junction. This localized optical mode increases the local absorption cross section and enhances the photocarrier generation rate within the junction region, identified as the dominant active volume for photocurrent. A coupled optoelectronic model linking full wave electromagnetic simulations to carrier generation, recombination, and extraction accurately captures the measured responsivity spectrum and its power dependence using only two electronic fitting parameters. The device achieves responsivities of 627 A/W in the visible region, 227 A/W in the UV, and 167 A/W in the NIR, demonstrating broadband operation with ultrahigh gain. These results show that geometric resonance in mixed dimensional junctions is a powerful design principle for next generation high gain optoelectronic detectors.</description>

      <title>Large field-of-view, distortion-corrected off-axis parabolic mirror relay microscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Off-axis parabolic mirrors (OAPs) are occasionally desirable for specialized applications, but are known to introduce field-dependent astigmatic aberrations. In an experiment where optical tweezers are formed by OAPs, another OAP is added to form a relay configuration with an optional microscope, resulting in near diffraction-limited performance, with a resolution of $2.19$ $\mu m$. The severe radially non-uniform distortion incurred by this configuration, with a long path length and a large field of view, requires software corrections for the microscopic image. To avoid overfitting given the limited features available for calibration at the tweezers focal plane, a distortion model with a reduced set of parameters is selected based on simulation data. Applying the model to experimental data, an average residual error of $3.60$ $\mu m$ ($1.33$ $\mu m$) is achieved in object space after the simple relay (adding a $5 \times$ microscope) over a field of approximately $1$ $\mu m$ $\times$ $1$ $\mu m$ ($200$ $\mu m$ $\times$ $200$ $\mu m$). The residual errors are likely dominated by diffraction artifacts in the features used for correction.</description>

      <title>3D printed waveguides for optogenetics applications: design optimization and optical characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optogenetics has emerged as a powerful tool for disease modeling, enabling precise control of cellular activities through light stimulation and providing a valuable insights into disease mechanisms and therapeutic possibilities. Innovative materials and technologies such as micro-LEDs, optical fibers and micro/nano probes have been developed to allow precise spatial and temporal control of light delivery to target cells. Recent advances in 3D printing have further enhanced optogenetic applications by enabling the fabrication of implantable, customizable, and miniaturized light stimulation systems with high spatial resolution. In this study, we introduce a novel concept of a 3D printed light delivery system for brain organoid stimulation exploring the capabilities of projection microstereolithography (P$\mu$SL). We characterized the optical properties of the high-resolution acrylate-based 3D print resin, i.e., refractive index and extinction coefficient, to evaluate if the light transmission efficiency might limit the performance of the optogenetic stimulation systems. Finite element method simulations were employed to optimize the 3D printed design. An optogenetic setup was developed for optimal light delivery, and initial tests with optogenetically modified cells showed light-induced dopamine release with a stimulation efficiency of 2.8\%, confirming the 3D printed waveguide functionality and guiding future optimization. Our results demonstrate that this light stimulation tool offers strong potential for advancing customizable optogenetic applications.</description>

      <title>Thickness-dependence of Linear and Nonlinear Optical Properties of Multilayer 3R-MoS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3R-MoS2, a MoS2 polytype with broken inversion symmetry, enables unique light-matter interactions and is promising for linear and nonlinear integrated photonics beyond the monolayer limit. Yet, systematic studies of its thickness-dependent reflectivity and its impact on harmonic generation are still lacking. . Yet, systematic studies of its thickness-dependent reflectivity and its impact on harmonic generation are still lacking. Here, we introduce a non-destructive optical method to determine the thickness of 3r-MoS2 flakes from reflectivity measurements, offering AFM-like precision with a mean bias of less than 2 nm range, while being much faster and applicable to non-solid substrates such as PDMS, in the 3-200 nm range. Nonlinear characterization further reveals distinct thickness-dependent maxima in second- and third-harmonic generation (SHG/THG), with the first clear peak at ~200 nm. These maxima arise from Fabry-P\'erot-type phase matching conditions mediated by the film thickness and can further be shaped by absorption. This work thus provides both a practical thickness metrology and new insights for exploiting thickness-dependent 3R-MoS2 nonlinearities in scalable photonic technologies.</description>

      <title>Geometric-phase portrayal of electromagnetic scattering by a three-dimensional object in free space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of geometric phase was applied to initiate the geometric-phase portrayal of electromagnetic scattering by a three-dimensional object in free space. Whereas the incident electromagnetic field is that of an arbitrarily polarized plane wave, the direction-dependent far-zone scattering amplitude is used to define
  direction-dependent Stokes parameters for the scattered field. Both symmetric and asymmetric Poincar\'e spinors are formulated to characterize the polarization states of incident plane wave and the far-zone scattering amplitude, and two different geometric phases are defined therefrom. Density plots of both geometric phases were calculated for six different homogeneous isotropic spheres with different linear constitutive properties and boundary conditions: dielectric-magnetic spheres (non-dissipative and dissipative), impedance spheres, perfect electrically conducting spheres, charged dielectric-magnetic spheres, dielectric-magnetic spheres with topologically insulating surface states, and isotropic chiral spheres. The incident plane waves were taken to be linearly and circularly polarized, for the sake of illustration. Numerical results revealed that geometric-phase density plots possess significantly richer features than their counterparts for the differential scattering efficiency. The geometric-phase portrayals exhibit enhanced sensitivity to changes in the size and composition of the scatterer, the boundary conditions, and the incident polarization state, suggesting promise for inverse-scattering problems.</description>

      <title>Probing Electro-Magnetic Field Enhancement in 3D Plasmonic Nanopores Using DNA-PAINT and Nanorulers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasmonic nanopores combine nanofluidic confinement with electromagnetic field enhancement, enabling optical interrogation of single molecules in sub-wavelength volumes. Yet, direct optical readout within these metallic geometries has remained challenging due to fluorescence quenching near the surface. Here, we implement DNA-PAINT as a molecular reporter of local optical fields inside plasmonic nanopores. Transient hybridization of fluorescent imager strands at the nanopore tips yields stochastic emission bursts that map active binding sites with nanometric precision. By varying the fluorophore-metal distance using DNA spacers of controlled length, we observe a non-monotonic intensity response consistent with near-field quenching and plasmonic enhancement, identifying an optimal separation of around 6 nm. Finally, we extend the concept to dual-material Au/Si nanopores, demonstrating lateral coupling between plasmonic and semiconducting regions. These results establish DNA-PAINT as a quantitative probe of nanoscale optical environments in hybrid nanopores.</description>

      <title>Tensor-network approach to quantum optical state evolution beyond the Fock basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the quantum evolution of light in nonlinear media is central to the development of next-generation quantum technologies. Yet modeling these processes remains computationally demanding, as the required resources grow rapidly with photon number and phase-space resolution. Here we introduce a tensor-network approach that efficiently captures the dynamics of nonlinear optical systems in a continuous-variable representation. Using the matrix product state (MPS) formalism, both quantum states and operators are encoded in a highly compressed form, enabling direct numerical integration of the Schr\"odinger equation. We demonstrate the method by simulating degenerate spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) and show that it accurately reproduces established theoretical benchmarks - energy conservation, pump depletion, and quadrature squeezing - even in regimes where conventional Fock-basis simulations become infeasible. For high-intensity pump fields ($\alpha = 100$), the MPS representation achieves compression ratios above $3\cdot 10^3$ while preserving physical fidelity. This framework opens a scalable route to modeling multimode quantum light and nonlinear optical phenomena beyond the reach of traditional methods.</description>

      <title>Long-Range Magnetic Order in Structurally Embedded Mesospin Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Engineered assemblies of interacting magnetic elements-magnetic metamaterials-provide a powerful route to tailor collective magnetic order and dynamics. By structuring matter at the mesoscale, they bridge atomic magnetism and macroscopic functionality, enabling emergent behaviour inaccessible in conventional materials. However, realizing large-area metamaterials that combine high morphological uniformity with intrinsic long-range order has remained challenging, largely due to the structural disorder inherent to lithographic fabrication. Here we demonstrate a scalable route to structurally and magnetically coherent metamaterials by embedding iron-ions to form mesospins within a non-magnetic thin film palladium host matrix. Using controlled implantation, we realize morphologically uniform arrays that spontaneously develop extended antiferromagnetic order in the as-fabricated state - without the need of external annealing or field cycling. Resonant X-ray scattering and microscopy reveal sharp magnetic Bragg peaks modulated by the mesospin form factor, evidencing long-range antiferromagnetic order coupled to structural coherence. This embedded architecture establishes a platform for exploring coherent spin-photon interactions and functional X-ray scattering in magnetic metamaterials free from lithographic topography and disorder.</description>

Abstract: We investigate ablation experiments performed by laser-plasma-filament guided electrical discharges at high-voltages of up to 145 kV. The guiding was accomplished via fs-laser-generated plasma filaments across a gap of 201 mm of air onto steel 1.3343 samples. This method combines remote material processing and enables the steering and deflection of high voltage discharges with the ease-of-use of remote laser processing technology. We observe an increase of the per-pulse-(and-discharge)-ablated volume by a factor of 1.67 over an ablation regime when the discharges are not present and up to a factor of 12.5 over the case when neither discharges nor plasma filaments, only a loosely focused laser beam, are present.</description>

      <title>Compact, Large-Scale Photonic Neurons by Modulation-and-Weight Microring Resonators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11369v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neuromorphic photonics offers sub-nanosecond latency, ultrawide bandwidth, and massive parallelism, yet scalability remains limited by fabrication tolerances, device alignment, and energy cost. Here, we present a large-scale, compact, and reconfigurable photonic neuron in which each microring performs modulation and weighting simultaneously. Leveraging both carrier and thermal tuning, this dual-function architecture conserves footprint, simplifies spectral alignment to just two components, and achieves a steep transfer response that minimizes tuning energy. In addition, we investigate a range of configurations for the proposed neuron to better tailor its behavior to various computational tasks. Moreover, the same photonic neuron can be reconfigured into a recurrent arrangement through a short electrical feedback path, enabling short- and long-term memory for temporal tasks. Demonstrated with a 10-microring resonator (MRR) array, our neuron performs both spatial and temporal tasks: a 3x3 convolution for image processing with 5\% error and, for the first time, high-frequency financial time-series prediction. Each modulation-weighting element occupies only 80x45 um2 and consumes 0.186 mW on average, resulting in 105 TOPs/W and a compute density of 4.67 TOPS/s/mm2, competitive with the state of the art. These results position modulation-and-weighting MRR banks as scalable building blocks for large-scale neuromorphic photonic systems, combining compactness, ultra-low power, and versatility to unlock new frontiers in intelligent computing.</description>

      <title>Super-efficient optical frequency division referenced to {\mu}Hz Schawlow-Townes-linewidth quantum-noise-limited lasers</title>

Abstract: Optical frequency division (OFD) implements the conversion of ultra-stable optical frequencies into microwave frequencies through an optical frequency comb flywheel, generating microwave oscillators with record-low phase noise and time jitter. However, conventional OFD systems face significant trade-off between division complexity and noise suppression due to severe thermal noise and technical noise in the optical frequency references. Here, we address this challenge by generating common-cavity bi-color Brillouin lasers as the optical frequency references, which operate at the fundamental quantum noise limit with Schawlow-Townes linewidth on the 10 {\mu}Hz level. Enabled by these ultra-coherent reference lasers, our OFD system uses a dramatically simplified comb divider with an unprecedented small division factor of 10, and generates 10 GHz microwave signal with exceptional phase noise of -65 dBc/Hz at 1Hz, -155 dBc/Hz at 10 kHz, and -172 dBc/Hz at 10 MHz offset. Moreover, to fully harness the spectral purity of the OFD technology, here we implement broadband frequency synthesis directly referenced to the OFD oscillator, covering 5 to 20 GHz with millisecond tuning time. Our work redefines the trade-off between noise suppression and division complexity in OFD, paving the way for compact, high-performance microwave synthesis for next-generation atomic clocks, quantum sensors, and low-noise radar systems.</description>

      <title>Using tunable coherence for reaching micrometer coherence lengths and suppressing stray light in a power-recycled Michelson interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00503</link>

Abstract: By reentering into laser interferometers, scattered or stray light introduces non-linear noise. This is a major limitation of precision interferometers as preventing such parasitic light is nearly impossible. Thus, substantial effort is put into mitigating the reentering of these fields in various ways. Ground-based laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors employ such mitigation techniques to reduce otherwise restrictive stray light noise. However, they are now reaching sensitivities where conventional mitigation techniques reach limitations. Further improvements planed for future observatories are placing even more demanding constraints on tolerable stray light power. We previously presented tunable coherence as a possible technique to ease these constraints and suppress unwanted coherent interference. For these promising demonstrations, the remaining coherence length and achievable suppression in length-constrained layouts was limited, among other things, by the used pseudo-random-noise phase modulation frequency. In this work, we demonstrate stray light suppression and cavity performance at modulation frequencies up to 10 GHz. This reduces the remaining coherence to a few centimeter in an interferometer, and even to the scale of the laser wavelength in a cavity. We further present a first demonstration of tunable coherence in a power-recycled Michelson interferometer, successfully suppressing stray light in a more complex topology.</description>

      <title>Design of efficient high-order immersed metagratings using an evolutionary algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Immersed reflection gratings improve spectral resolving power by enabling diffraction within a high refractive index medium. This principle has been widely adopted to make grating spectrometers more compact. Conventional immersed gratings have blazed profiles which typically show the highest efficiency for one main design wavelength. In addition, the blazed profiles tend to cause significant polarization sensitivity. In this work, we propose an alternative approach for designing an immersed grating composed of sub-wavelength structures, designed to increase diffraction efficiency and reduce polarization dependence. For a theoretical demonstration, a reflective metagrating immersed in silicon is optimized over the short-wave infrared band-3 (SWIR-3, here $2.304~\mu$m-$2.405~\mu$m), targeting the same diffraction angles as the immersion grating used in the Sentinel-5 Earth observation mission. The structure is optimized using a modified Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES). The optimized immersed metagrating achieves an average efficiency of (over the SWIR-3 band) $\sim 78\%$, compared to $\sim 62\%$ for the conventional immersed blazed grating, and reduces polarization sensitivity from roughly $\sim 15\%$ to $\sim 5\%$. A manufacturing tolerance analysis is also conducted to evaluate the design's performance under systematic manufacturing errors, which revealed a degradation of $\sim 10\%$ efficiency at feature size errors of $\pm 25{nm}$ and almost negligible effect on the efficiency at $-10{nm}$ and of $\sim 5\%$ at $+10{nm}$.</description>

      <title>Ultracompact Low-Loss Grating Couplers</title>

Abstract: Fiber-to-chip couplers play a crucial role in interfacing on-chip photonic circuits with other optical systems or off-chip devices. Downsizing the couplers via topology optimization addresses the demand for high-density integration and improves the scalability of photonic integrated systems. However, these optimized couplers have yet to reach the performance level demonstrated by their conventional counterparts, leaving room for further improvement. In this work, we apply topology optimization to design single-polarization 1D and dual-polarization 2D grating couplers incorporating bottom reflectors and achieve sub-decibel coupling efficiency. Both types of couplers are fabricated on the silicon-on-insulator platform with dimensions of mere 14 $\mu$m $\times$ 14 $\mu$m and are compatible with standard single-mode fibers at normal incidence. From our experimental characterization, the measured peak coupling efficiency of the topology-optimized 1D and 2D couplers is -0.92(1) dB and -0.86(13) dB, respectively, within the telecom C-band. Our demonstration provides a coupling solution for photonic applications requiring high efficiency and high-density integration, such as spatial division multiplexing and photonic quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Rotational Jamming of Plasmonic Optical Matter Driven by Chiral Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Plasmonic Optical matter (OM), composed of optically bound metallic particles, can be rotated by transferring the spin angular momentum (SAM) of chiral light to the assembly. Rotating OM is a promising platform for optical micromachines, with potential applications in plasmofluidics and soft robotics. Understanding the dynamic states of such Brownian, micro-mechanical systems is a relevant issue. One key problem is understanding kinetic jamming and clogging. Studies of driven multiparticle systems have revealed that under suboptimal driving, the systems can stop moving, showing jamming transitions. It is important to identify dynamic regimes where crowding competes with driving and is susceptible to jamming in the context of optical micromachines. Through experiments supported by numerical simulations, we reveal assemblies with well-defined hexagonal or triangular symmetry that efficiently harness the SAM of incident chiral light, resulting in stable rotation. However, as the plasmonic-particle assembly grows and its dimensions approach the beam waist, new particles can disrupt this order. This causes a transition to a fluid-like state with less-defined symmetry, correlated with a significant reduction in transferred torque, causing rotation to stagnate or cease. We suggest this behaviour is analogous to a rotational jamming transition, where the rotational motion is arrested. Our findings establish a clear relationship between the structural symmetry of the OM assembly and its ability to harness SAM, providing new insights into controlling chiral light-matter interactions and offering a novel platform for studying jamming transitions.</description>

      <title>Polarization-sensitive GeSn Mid-Infrared Membrane Photodetectors with Integrated Plasmonic Metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00771v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Germanium-Tin (GeSn) semiconductors are promising for mid-infrared optoelectronics owing to their silicon compatibility, tunable bandgap, and potential for room-temperature operation. Released GeSn membranes provide an additional degree of freedom to extend the operation wavelength through epitaxial strain relaxation, while their transferability expands design flexibility. On the other hand, metasurfaces have become an effective strategy to engineer light--matter interaction, and their integration with photodetectors can enhance performance and introduce new functionalities. Here, we demonstrate a mid-infrared photodetector consisting of a transfer-printed Ge$_{0.89}$Sn$_{0.11}$ membrane integrated with an Au plasmonic metasurface. The photodetector exhibits a wavelength cutoff exceeding 3.0~$\mu$m with nearly fourfold increase in responsivity at 2.5~$\mu$m as compared to unreleased films, attributed to Fabry--P\'erot resonance. Furthermore, the integration with an anisotropic metasurface yields detectors with strong polarization sensitivity, achieving a measured contrast ratio of $\sim$4:1 between orthogonal polarizations. Moreover, the operation wavelength of the photodetector can be selectively tuned by varying the geometric scale of the metasurface. The experimental results show excellent agreement with simulations, confirming the effectiveness and versatility of this integrated metasurface--membrane design.</description>

      <title>Quantum Key Distribution via Charge Teleportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04188v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a quantum key distribution (QKD) primitive based on charge teleportation: by Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC) on an entangled many-body ground state, Alice's one-bit choice steers the sign of a local charge shift at Bob, which directly encodes the key bit. Relative to energy teleportation schemes, the charge signal is bit-symmetric, measured in a single basis, and markedly more robust to realistic noise and model imperfections. We instantiate the protocol on transverse-field Ising models, star-coupled and one-dimensional chain, obtain closed-form results for two qubits, and for larger systems confirm performance via exact diagonalization, circuit-level simulations, and a proof-of-principle hardware run. We quantify resilience to classical bit flips and local quantum noise, identifying regimes where sign integrity, and hence key correctness, is preserved. These results position charge teleportation as a practical, low-rate QKD primitive compatible with near-term platforms.</description>
