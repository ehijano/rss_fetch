      <title>Droplet Nucleation In a Rapid Expansion Aerosol Chamber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new experimental facility to investigate the nucleation and growth of liquid droplets and ice particles under controlled conditions and characterize processes relevant to cloud microphysics: the rapid expansion aerosol chamber (REACh). REACh is an intermediate size chamber (~0.14 m$^3$) combining the principle of an expansion chamber with the ability to probe the influence of turbulent flows. Nucleation is achieved via a sudden pressure drop accompanied by a temperature drop, which can cause humid air to condense into a cloud of droplets under the appropriate thermodynamic conditions. REACh features tight control and monitoring of the initial saturation ratio of water vapor, identity and concentration of seeding aerosol particles, temperature, pressure, and air flow mixing, together with high speed real time measurements of aerosol and droplet size and number. Here, we demonstrate that the minimum temperature reached during each expansion can be reasonably described by the thermodynamics of dry or moist adiabats, for a wide range of initial relative humidity. The size and number of droplets formed, and the overall lifetime of the cloud, are characterized as a function of the aerosol concentration and initial water vapor saturation ratio. The total droplet concentration scales linearly with the seeding aerosol concentration, suggesting that all injected aerosol particles serve as condensation nuclei. While the total number of droplets formed increases with aerosol concentration, the mean droplet size decreases with the concentration of seeding aerosols as a result of competition for the available water vapor. Theoretical considerations provide a quantitative prediction for the mean droplet size for a wide range of conditions.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic approximations for convection onset with Ekman pumping at low wavenumbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ekman pumping is a phenomenon induced by no-slip boundary conditions in rotating fluids. In the context of Rayleigh-B\'enard convection, Ekman pumping causes a significant change in the linear stability of the system compared to when it is not present (that is, stress-free). Motivated by numerical solutions to the marginal stability problem of the incompressible Navier-Stokes (iNSE) system, we seek analytical asymptotic solutions which describe the departure of the no-slip solution from the stress-free. The substitution of normal modes into a reduced asymptotic model yields a linear system for which we explore analytical solutions for various scalings of wavenumber. We find very good agreement between the analytical asymptotic solutions and the numerical solutions to the iNSE linear stability problem with no-slip boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Quantification of Flagellar Gait Changes with Combined Shape Mode Analysis and Swimming Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many different microswimmers propel themselves using flagella that beat periodically. The shape of the flagellar beat and swimming speed have been observed to change with fluid rheology. We quantify changes in the flagellar waveforms of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in response to changes in fluid viscosity using (1) shape mode analysis and (2) a full swimmer simulation to analyze how shape changes affect the swimming speed and to explore the dimensionality of the shape space. By decomposing the gait into the time-independent mean shape and the time-varying stroke, we find that the flagellar mean shape substantially changes in response to viscosity, while the changes in the time-varying stroke are more subtle. Using the swimmer simulation, we quantify how the swimming speed is affected by the dimensionality of the flagellar shape reconstruction, and we show that the observed change in swimming speed with viscosity is explained by the variations in mean flagellar shape and beat frequency, while the changes in swimming speed from the different time-varying strokes are on the scale of variation between cells.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement-learning-based control of turbulent channel flows at high Reynolds numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is employed to develop control strategies for drag reduction in direct numerical simulations (DNS) of turbulent channel flows at high Reynolds numbers. The DRL agent uses near-wall streamwise velocity fluctuations as input to modulate wall blowing and suction velocities. These DRL-based strategies achieve significant drag reduction, with maximum rates of 35.6% at Re_{\tau}=180, 30.4% at Re_{\tau}=550, and 27.7% at Re_{\tau}=1000, outperforming traditional opposition control methods. Expanded range of wall actions further enhances drag reduction, although effectiveness decreases at higher Reynolds numbers. The DRL models elevate the virtual wall through blowing and suction, aiding in drag reduction. However, at higher Reynolds numbers, the amplitude modulation of large-scale structures significantly increases the residual Reynolds stress on the virtual wall, diminishing the drag reduction. Analysis of budget equations provides a systematic understanding of the drag reduction dynamics behind. DRL models reduce skin friction by inhibiting the redistribution of wall-normal turbulent kinetic energy. This further suppresses the wall-normal velocity fluctuations, reducing the production of Reynolds stress, thereby decreasing skin friction. This study showcases the successful application of DRL in turbulence control at high Reynolds numbers and elucidates the nonlinear control mechanisms underlying the observed drag reduction.</description>

      <title>Bioinspired Drone Rotors for Reduced Aeroacoustic Noise and Improved Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is surging across several industries, paralleled by growing demand for these UAVs. However, the noise emitted by UAVs remains a significant impediment to their widespread use even though in areas such as product delivery, they can be more environmentally friendly than traditional delivery methods. Nature has often been a source of inspiration for devices that are efficient and eco-friendly. In the current study, we leverage the previous work by Seo et al. (Bioinsp. Biomimetics, 16 (4):046019, 2021) on the aeroacoustics of flapping wing flight in mosquitoes and fruit flies to propose and examine a simple strategy for reducing the aeroacoustic noise from drone rotors. In particular, inspired by these insects, we explore how an increase in the planform area of the rotor could be used to reduce the rotation rate and the associated aeroacoustic noise from small-scale rotors. The study employs a sharp-interface immersed boundary solver for the flow simulations and the aeroacoustic sound is predicted by the Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings equation. Simulations indicate that the simple strategy of employing rotors with larger planform areas could lead not just to reduced aeroacoustic noise but improved power economy as well.</description>

      <title>Turbulent Pipe Flow of Thixotropic Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex materials with internal microstructure such as suspensions and emulsions exhibit time-dependent rheology characterized by viscoelasticity and thixotropy. In many large-scale applications such as turbulent pipe flow, the elastic response occurs on a much shorter timescale than the thixotropy, hence these flows are purely thixotropic. The fundamental dynamics of thixotropic turbulence is poorly understood, particularly the interplay between microstructural state, rheology, and turbulence structure. To address this gap, we conduct direct numerical simulations (DNS) of fully developed turbulent pipe flow of a model thixotropic (Moore) fluid over a range of thixoviscous numbers $\Lambda$ from slow ($\Lambda\ll 1$) to fast ($\Lambda\gg 1$) thixotropic kinetics relative to the eddy turnover time. Analysis of DNS results in the Lagrangian frame shows that, as expected, in the limits of slow and fast kinetics, these time-dependent flows behave as time-independent purely viscous (generalized Newtonian) analogues. For intermediate kinetics ($\Lambda\sim 1$), the rheology is governed by a \emph{path integral} of the thixotropic fading memory kernel over the distribution of Lagrangian shear history, the latter of which is modelled via a simple stochastic model for the radially non-stationary pipe flow. DNS computations based on this effective viscosity closure exhibit excellent agreement (within 2.4\% error) with the fully thixotropic model for $\Lambda=1$, indicating that the purely viscous (generalized Newtonian) analogue persists for arbitrary values of $\Lambda\in[0,\infty^+)$ and across nonlinear rheology models. These results uncover the feedback mechanisms between microstructure, rheology, and turbulence and offer fundamental insights into the structure of thixotropic turbulence.</description>

      <title>Multifluid tensorial equations for the flow of semi-dilute monodisperse suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the volume averaging technique of Jackson (1997), we derive a set of two-fluid equations that describe the dynamics of a mono-disperse non-Brownian colloidal suspension in the semi-dilute regime. The equations are tensorial and can be applied in arbitrary geometries. Closure models are developed that represent the stress surrounding each particle as a sum of stresses due to fluid movement through a fixed bed of particles, and those due to interactions between particles. Emphasising pragmatism, the developed closure models are consistent with current knowledge of particle interactions in these systems but employ parameters that can be tuned to represent the microstructure of specific particle suspensions. Within the interaction model, a model for the particle distribution around each particle is used that depends on the strain rate field, allowing anisotropy of the microstructure (and hence normal suspension stresses) to develop within the suspension in response to arbitrary strain fields. Force moments acting on particles during particle interactions are calculating by summing hydrodynamic contributions between particle pairs, but adjusted to recognise that multi-particle interactions can increase the effective stress generated during each interaction. Finally, an order of magnitude analysis is performed on the derived momentum equations to determine what terms are significant, leaving only terms in the final equations that are required to predict behaviour during laminar flow within the targeted semi-dilute regime. In a companion paper (referred to as paper II, Noori et. al., 2024) we chose sets of microstructure parameters that predict experimentally measured bulk suspension behaviour, creating a link between particle properties (i.e. roughness), suspension microstructure and shear-induced particle migration in arbitrary flow fields.</description>

      <title>Detecting Turbulent Patterns in Particulate Pipe Flow by Streak Angle Visualization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting the transition from laminar to turbulent flow in particulate pipe systems remains a complex issue in fluid dynamics, often requiring sophisticated and costly experimental apparatus. This research presents an innovative streak visualization method designed to offer a simple and robust approach to identify transitional turbulent patterns in particulate pipe flows with neutrally buoyant particles. The technique employs a laser arrangement and a low-cost camera setup to capture particle-generated streaks within the fluid, enabling real-time observation of flow patterns. Validation of the proposed method was conducted through comparison with established techniques like Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and pressure drop measurements, confirming its accuracy and reliability. Experiments demonstrate the streak visualization method's capacity to differentiate between laminar, transitional, and turbulent flow regimes by analyzing the standard deviation of streak angles. The method is especially efficient at low particle concentration, ie precisely where other more established methods become less effective. Furthermore, this technique enables us to identify a critical Reynolds number using Kullback-Leibler divergence built on the statistical distribution of streak angles, which is consistent with previous studies.
  Because it is effective at low concentrations and robust, this streak visualization technique opens new perspectives for the characterization of particulate pipe flows not only in the confines of the laboratory but also in less controlled industrial multi-phase flows where determining the laminar or turbulent nature of the flow is a prerequisite for flowmeter calibration.</description>

      <title>Geometry Matters: Benchmarking Scientific ML Approaches for Flow Prediction around Complex Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rapid yet accurate simulations of fluid dynamics around complex geometries is critical in a variety of engineering and scientific applications, including aerodynamics and biomedical flows. However, while scientific machine learning (SciML) has shown promise, most studies are constrained to simple geometries, leaving complex, real-world scenarios underexplored. This study addresses this gap by benchmarking diverse SciML models, including neural operators and vision transformer-based foundation models, for fluid flow prediction over intricate geometries. Using a high-fidelity dataset of steady-state flows across various geometries, we evaluate the impact of geometric representations -- Signed Distance Fields (SDF) and binary masks -- on model accuracy, scalability, and generalization. Central to this effort is the introduction of a novel, unified scoring framework that integrates metrics for global accuracy, boundary layer fidelity, and physical consistency to enable a robust, comparative evaluation of model performance. Our findings demonstrate that foundation models significantly outperform neural operators, particularly in data-limited scenarios, and that SDF representations yield superior results with sufficient training data. Despite these advancements, all models struggle with out-of-distribution generalization, highlighting a critical challenge for future SciML applications. By advancing both evaluation methodologies and modeling capabilities, this work paves the way for robust and scalable ML solutions for fluid dynamics across complex geometries.</description>

      <title>An asynchronous discontinuous Galerkin method for combustion simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method has been widely considered in recent years to develop scalable flow solvers for its ability to handle discontinuities, such as shocks and detonations, with greater accuracy and high arithmetic intensity. However, its scalability is severely affected by communication bottlenecks that arise from data movement and synchronization at extreme scales. Recently, an asynchronous discontinuous Galerkin (ADG) method was proposed to reduce communication overhead by either relaxing synchronization or avoiding communication between processing elements (PEs). The numerical properties of the ADG method were verified by solving simple one-dimensional partial differential equations. In this study, the application of the ADG method is extended to complex chemically reacting flows, particularly to evaluate its efficacy in capturing flame fronts and detonations. New asynchrony-tolerant weighted essentially non-oscillatory (AT-WENO) limiters are derived to accurately capture flow discontinuities with communication delays at the PE boundaries. The numerical accuracy of the ADG method is verified on the premixed spontaneous ignition of a fuel-lean mixture with detailed chemistry. The progression of the flame front is accurately represented by the ADG method, and the numerical errors incurred at the PE boundaries turn out to be insignificant. The efficacy of the AT-WENO limiters in capturing discontinuities is demonstrated by the propagation of a detonation wave. The findings of this study serve as a basis for the development of highly scalable discontinuous Galerkin-based solvers for combustion simulations on massively parallel supercomputers.</description>

      <title>Dense array of elastic hairs obstructing a fluidic channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dense arrays of soft hair-like structures protruding from surfaces in contact with fluids are ubiquitous in living systems. Fluid flows can easily deform these soft hairs which in turn impacts the flow properties. At the microscale, flows are often confined which exacerbates this feedback loop since the hair deformation has a strong impact on the flow geometry. Here, I investigate experimentally and theoretically pressure driven flows in laminar channels obstructed by a dense array of elastic hairs. I show that the system displays a nonlinear hydraulic resistance that I model by treating the hair bed as a deformable porous media. The porous media height and thus degree of confinement results from the deflection of individual hairs. The resulting fluid-structure interaction model is leveraged to identify the dimensionless drag force $\hat{f}_0$ controlling the elasto-viscous coupling and used to design passive flow control elements for microfluidic networks.</description>

      <title>Fusion DeepONet: A Data-Efficient Neural Operator for Geometry-Dependent Hypersonic Flows on Arbitrary Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing re-entry vehicles requires accurate predictions of hypersonic flow around their geometry. Rapid prediction of such flows can revolutionize vehicle design, particularly for morphing geometries. We evaluate advanced neural operator models such as Deep Operator Networks (DeepONet), parameter-conditioned U-Net, Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), and MeshGraphNet, with the objective of addressing the challenge of learning geometry-dependent hypersonic flow fields with limited data. Specifically, we compare the performance of these models for two grid types: uniform Cartesian and irregular grids. To train these models, we use 36 unique elliptic geometries for generating high-fidelity simulations with a high-order entropy-stable DGSEM solver, emphasizing the challenge of working with a scarce dataset. We evaluate and compare the four operator-based models for their efficacy in predicting hypersonic flow field around the elliptic body. Moreover, we develop a novel framework, called Fusion DeepONet, which leverages neural field concepts and generalizes effectively across varying geometries. Despite the scarcity of training data, Fusion DeepONet achieves performance comparable to parameter-conditioned U-Net on uniform grids while it outperforms MeshGraphNet and vanilla DeepONet on irregular, arbitrary grids. Fusion DeepONet requires significantly fewer trainable parameters as compared to U-Net, MeshGraphNet, and FNO, making it computationally efficient. We also analyze the basis functions of the Fusion DeepONet model using Singular Value Decomposition. This analysis reveals that Fusion DeepONet generalizes effectively to unseen solutions and adapts to varying geometries and grid points, demonstrating its robustness in scenarios with limited training data.</description>

      <title>Physics-constrained coupled neural differential equations for one dimensional blood flow modeling</title>

Abstract: Computational cardiovascular flow modeling plays a crucial role in understanding blood flow dynamics. While 3D models provide acute details, they are computationally expensive, especially with fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulations. 1D models offer a computationally efficient alternative, by simplifying the 3D Navier-Stokes equations through axisymmetric flow assumption and cross-sectional averaging. However, traditional 1D models based on finite element methods (FEM) often lack accuracy compared to 3D averaged solutions. This study introduces a novel physics-constrained machine learning technique that enhances the accuracy of 1D blood flow models while maintaining computational efficiency. Our approach, utilizing a physics-constrained coupled neural differential equation (PCNDE) framework, demonstrates superior performance compared to conventional FEM-based 1D models across a wide range of inlet boundary condition waveforms and stenosis blockage ratios. A key innovation lies in the spatial formulation of the momentum conservation equation, departing from the traditional temporal approach and capitalizing on the inherent temporal periodicity of blood flow. This spatial neural differential equation formulation switches space and time and overcomes issues related to coupling stability and smoothness, while simplifying boundary condition implementation. The model accurately captures flow rate, area, and pressure variations for unseen waveforms and geometries. We evaluate the model's robustness to input noise and explore the loss landscapes associated with the inclusion of different physics terms. This advanced 1D modeling technique offers promising potential for rapid cardiovascular simulations, achieving computational efficiency and accuracy. By combining the strengths of physics-based and data-driven modeling, this approach enables fast and accurate cardiovascular simulations.</description>

Abstract: Pilot-wave hydrodynamics concerns the dynamics of 'walkers,' droplets walking on a vibrating bath, and has provided the basis for the burgeoning field of hydrodynamic quantum analogs. We here explore a theoretical model of pilot-wave hydrodynamics that relaxes the simplifying assumption of resonance between the droplet and its pilot wave, specifically the assumption of a fixed impact phase between the bouncing drop and its wave field. The model captures both the vertical and horizontal dynamics of the drop, allowing one to examine non-resonant effects for both free and constrained walkers. The model provides new rationale for a number of previously reported but poorly understood features of free walker motion in pilot-wave hydrodynamics, including colinear swaying at the onset of motion, intermittent walking, and chaotic speed oscillations, all of which are accompanied by sporadic changes in the impact phase of the bouncing drop. The model also highlights the degeneracy in the droplets' vertical dynamics, specifically, the possibility of two distinct bouncing phases and of switching between the two. Consideration of this degeneracy is critical to understanding the droplet dynamics and statistics emerging in confined geometries at high memory and the interaction of walking droplets with standing Faraday waves.</description>
