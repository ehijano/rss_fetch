      <title>An improved nonlocal electron heat transport model for magnetized plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distortions in the electron distribution function driven by intense temperature gradients critically influence the generation and evolution of heat flux and magnetic fields in plasmas under the condition of inertial confinement fusion. Describing such kinetic behaviors at large spatiotemporal scales typically requires multigroup models based on simplified Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equations. However, the accuracy of existing multigroup models remains uncertain, without a well-defined methodology for implementing nonlocal magnetic field corrections. This paper develops an improved nonlocal multigroup model for magnetized plasmas. The advancements comprise: (i) a revised source term in the diffusion equations, (ii) a Biermann-producing electric field equation incorporating the density perturbation, and (iii) a nonlocal correction method for the Nernst velocity. The numerical method for the anisotropic heat conduction equation is analyzed, and three test cases demonstrate that the model accurately predicts the key phenomena arising from nonlocal effects in magnetized plasmas.</description>

      <title>Design and initial results from the "Junior" Levitated Dipole Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: OpenStar Technologies is a private fusion company exploring the levitated dipole concept for commercial fusion energy production. OpenStar has manufactured a new generation of levitated dipole experiment, called "Junior", leveraging recent advances made in high-temperature superconducting magnet technologies. Junior houses a ~5.6 T REBCO high-temperature superconducting magnet in a 5.2 m vacuum chamber, with plasma heating achieved via &lt; 50 kW of electron cyclotron resonance heating power. Importantly, this experiment integrates novel high temperature superconductor power supply technology on board the dipole magnet. Recently OpenStar has completed first experimental campaigns with the Junior experiment, achieving first plasmas in late 2024. Experiments conducted with the full levitated system are planned for 2025. This article provides an overview of the main results from these experiments and details improvements planned for future campaigns.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Terahertz Generation via Oblique Incidence of Unipolar Laser Pulses on Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate terahertz (THz) radiation generation at the vacuum-plasma interface driven by the oblique incidence of s-polarized Gaussian laser pulse(s) on a semi-infinite underdense plasma.~Extending beyond the conventional single-frequency bipolar pulse (B-pulse), this work focuses on leveraging two-color mixed-frequency pulse-- (M-pulse) excitation to enhance THz performance in terms of strength and broadening that can be tuned through controlled amplitude and phase of the constituent pulses of the M-pulse. A new expression for the ponderomotive force (PF) -- which acts as the main driver of THz radiation at the vacuum-plasma boundary -- is derived to capture the hitherto unexplored effects of phase asymmetry intrinsic to the M-pulse, in contrast to a single B-pulse where its phase is irrelevant. This PF formulation captures the underlying cycle-to-cycle symmetry-breaking for the M-pulse field, responsible for efficient THz emission. We demonstrate analytically that such M-pulses of the same total energy as a B-pulse may generate significantly enhanced PF, leading to THz yields several orders of magnitude higher. With a judicious choice of low-frequency to high-frequency ratio, the M-pulse configuration is shown to emerge as a highly efficient, phase-controllable driver of
  THz radiation and offers a promising route for optimizing THz source design via tailored two-color laser-plasma interactions.</description>

      <title>Precision alignment and tolerance of a plasma wakefield accelerator in a laser-ionized plasma source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel method for aligning a laser ionized plasma source to a pair of ultra-relativistic electron beams that comprise a plasma wakefield accelerator (PWFA). We achieve alignment by analyzing the plasma afterglow light observed at two longitudinal locations as the plasma column is scanned across the electron beam. By analyzing the relative plasma light intensity at the two locations, we aligned an 85-cm plasma source to a 10 GeV, 1.6 nC electron beam to within 10 um offset, 10 urad tilt. The alignment is verified by analyzing the drive beam energy loss, energy transfer efficiency, and the witness beam energy gain as a function of the misalignment between the beams and the plasma. From this measurement, we extract the alignment tolerance required between the laser-ionized plasma source and electron beams, an important metric necessary for collider design studies or light source applications based on a laser-ionized plasma source.</description>

      <title>Landau damping and the long-time collisionless limit of the Vlasov-Poisson-Landau Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Vlasov-Poisson-Landau Equations on $\mathbb{T}^3\times \mathbb{R}^3$ with small collision frequency $\nu\ll 1$. We prove that for $\nu$-independent perturbations of the global Maxwellians in Gevrey-$2_-$, solutions display uniform-in-$\nu$ Landau damping and enhanced dissipation. Moreover, the collisionless limit holds, that is, as $\nu\to 0_+$ for $0&lt;t\ll \nu^{-\frac{1}{3}}$, the $\nu &gt; 0$ solutions converge uniformly (and in much stronger norms) to the solution of the Vlasov-Poisson equation with the same initial data. To our knowledge, this work is hence the first justification that the collisionless prediction matches those of collisional plasmas in the nonlinear equations.
  The interaction between Landau damping and collisions requires several new ideas:
  (1) an infinite-regularity commuting vector field method, merged with Guo's weighted energy methods for the Landau operator and hypocoercivity to extract the enhanced dissipation;
  (2) A novel nearly-physical side treatment of the collisionless Vlasov echoes;
  (3) A new set of decomposition methods to treat the effects of the nonlinear collisions in the Volterra equation for the density (i.e., the ``collisional echoes'')
  (4) A new quasi-linearization method for treating the effect of the slowly evolving homogeneous modes over long times.
  As a side result, we also prove Landau damping and enhanced dissipation of $O(\epsilon\nu^{1/3})$ Sobolev-space perturbations of homogeneous distributions that are only $O(\epsilon)$ perturbations of global Maxwellians, generalizing the recent results of Chaturvedi, Luk, and Nguyen. As another side result, our methods also provide a nearly-completely physical-side proof of Mouhot and Villani's theorem in the full range of Gevrey-$3_-$.</description>

      <title>Pulsed laser synthesis of mesoporous metal chalcogenide thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mesoporous films of the metal chalcogenide $\beta$-FeSe were grown on MgO substrates by KrF pulsed laser deposition (PLD) in an argon background. At 100 mTorr, gated intensified charge-coupled device imaging and ion probe measurements showed that the plasma plume responsible for crystal growth initially comprised three components, with distinct expansion velocities. Plume interactions with the substrate heater and ablation target gave rise to complex dynamics, including collisions between the charged leading edge -- rebounding between the substrate and the target -- and slower-moving species in the plume interior. Film growth was dominated by species with kinetic energies $\le$0.5 eV/atom. X-ray reflectivity and atomic force microscopy revealed that films grown in this environment -- with a substrate temperature of 350$^\circ$C, a laser fluence of 1.0 J cm$^{-2}$, and a 7.5 mm$^2$ spot area -- formed a porous framework with 15% porosity and pore sizes below 100 nm. X-ray diffraction indicated that the porous films were epitaxial with respect to the substrate and likely grew by oriented-attachment of gas-phase molecular clusters or very small nanoparticles, in contrast to the conventional epitaxy of vacuum films from atomic constituents. The in-plane orientation of the mesoporous films was $\beta$-FeSe[100]$\parallel$[110]MgO, attributed to the soft landing of pre-formed crystallites on the MgO substrates, where protruding Se rows of $\beta$-FeSe aligned with corrugations of the MgO surface. This work implies that growth of candidate electrocatalyst materials by PLD in inert gas background may allow mesoporous frameworks with a single crystallographic orientation that expose specific crystal facets for electrochemical reactions and active site engineering.</description>

      <title>Kinetic contribution to the arbitrary order odd frequency moments of the dynamic structure factor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An exact expression is derived for the kinetic contribution to the odd (arbitrary order) frequency moments of the dynamic structure factor via a finite summation that features averages of even (all lower orders) powers of the momentum over the exact momentum distribution. The derivation is carried out for the non-interacting Fermi gas and generalized to the interacting case based on the conjecture that averages over the Fermi distribution can be substituted with averages over the exact distribution. The expression is validated against known results (first, third frequency moments) and new explicit calculations (fifth, seventh frequency moments).</description>

      <title>3D non-linear MHD simulations of core density collapse event in LHD plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15823v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new three-dimensional, non-linear Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) model has been extended in MIPS code, incorporating parallel heat diffusivity. The model has been benchmarked against the former MHD model used in MIPS code. A preliminary study of the core density collapse event (CDC) observed in the Large Helical Device (LHD) plasma has been performed using the developed model. The equilibrium has been constructed using HINT code for a typical super dense core discharge in LHD, with vacuum magnetic axis configuration RaxV = 3.85 m and magnetic axis beta \beta0 = 4% plasma. This configuration corresponds to a plasma with a steep pressure gradient and strong Shafranov shift, which makes the plasma potentially unstable in the LHD. The model shows preliminary characteristics of the CDC event. The plasma is destabilized by high-n ballooning modes in the low-field side region during the linear regime, eventually leading to the collapse of the pressure and density profiles, together with the stochastization of the magnetic field and a shift to low-n modes centered at the core of the plasma after the non-linear coupling at the relaxation regime.</description>

      <title>Scenarios for magnetic X-point collapse in 2D incompressible dissipationless extended magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07311v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The equations of 2D incompressible dissipationless extended magnetohydrodynamics (XMHD) extend the equations of incompressible Hall MHD (HMHD) by retaining finite-electron inertia. These XMHD equations couple the fluid velocity ${\bf V} = \wh{\sf z}\btimes\nabla\phi + V_{z}\,\wh{\sf z}$ with the magnetic field ${\bf B} = \nabla\psi\btimes\wh{\sf z} + B_{z}\,\wh{\sf z}$ in a process that is known to support dissipationless solutions that exhibit finite-time singularities associated with magnetic X-point collapse in the magnetic plane $(B_{x} = \partial\psi/\partial y, B_{y} = -\,\partial\psi/\partial x)$. Here, by adopting a 2D self-similar model for the four XMHD fields $(\phi,\psi,V_{z},B_{z})$, we obtain five coupled ordinary differential equations that are solved in terms of the Jacobi elliptic functions based on an orbital classification associated with particle motion in a quartic potential. Excellent agreement is found when these analytical solutions are compared with numerical solutions, including the precise time of a magnetic X-point collapse.</description>

      <title>Suppression of two stream instability in relativistic electron-ion plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the suppression of two stream instabilities in electron ion plasmas when the individual species attain relativistic velocities. This suppression of the growth rate of two stream instability is consistent even when the ions form a neutralizing background. It is found that the parameter space of the growth rate reasonably squeezes for relativistic electrons at higher plasma frequencies. We further report the suppression of the growth rate of the said instability as the ion electron mass ratio reaches the realistic limit. Our results have implications for high-energy plasmas, laser-plasma interactions, and relativistic particle beam physics, providing insights into the complex interplay of linear and nonlinear processes governing the two-stream instability. Our unified four-regime analysis extends previous understanding of how realistic mass ratios fundamentally modify relativistic suppression effects, providing essential scaling laws for high-energy plasma applications.</description>

      <title>Strong and weak dynamo regimes in Taylor-Couette flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reveal a nonlinear magnetic dynamo in a Taylor-Couette flow at small magnetic Prandtl numbers $Pm\leq 1$, which has been previously believed to exist only at higher $Pm\gtrsim 10$ in this flow. The amplitude of initial perturbations, $Pm$ and domain aspect ratio play a key role in the onset and evolution of the dynamo. It exists in two main states -- a weak state dominated by large-scale modes and a strong, turbulent state with higher amplitude dominated by small-scale modes. These findings can be important for dynamo processes in various astrophysical objects with small $Pm$.</description>

      <title>Trotter-based quantum algorithm for solving transport equations with exponentially fewer time-steps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The extent to which quantum computers can simulate physical phenomena and solve the partial differential equations (PDEs) that govern them remains a central open question. In this work, one of the most fundamental PDEs is addressed: the multidimensional transport equation with space- and time-dependent coefficients. We present a quantum numerical scheme based on three steps: quantum state preparation, evolution, and measurement of relevant observables. The evolution step combines a high-order centered finite difference with a time-splitting scheme based on product formula approximations, also known as Trotterization. We introduce novel vector-norm analysis and prove that the number of time-steps can be reduced by a factor exponential in the number of qubits compared to previously established operator-norm analysis, thereby significantly lowering the projected computational resources. We also present efficient quantum circuits and numerical simulations that confirm the predicted vector-norm scaling. We report results on real quantum hardware for the one-dimensional convection equation, and solve a non-linear ordinary differential equation via its associated Liouville equation, a particular case of transport equations. This work provides a practical framework for efficiently simulating transport phenomena on quantum computers, with potential applications in plasma physics, molecular gas dynamics and non-linear dynamical systems, including chaotic systems.</description>
