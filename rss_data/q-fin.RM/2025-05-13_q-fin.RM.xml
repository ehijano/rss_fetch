      <title>Copula Analysis of Risk: A Multivariate Risk Analysis for VaR and CoVaR using Copulas and DCC-GARCH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A multivariate risk analysis for VaR and CVaR using different copula families is performed on historical financial time series fitted with DCC-GARCH models. A theoretical background is provided alongside a comparison of goodness-of-fit across different copula families to estimate the validity and effectiveness of approaches discussed.</description>

      <title>Singular Control in Inventory Management with Smooth Ambiguity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider singular control in inventory management under Knightian uncertainty, where decision makers have a smooth ambiguity preference over Gaussian-generated priors. We demonstrate that continuous-time smooth ambiguity is the infinitesimal limit of Kalman-Bucy filtering with recursive robust utility. Additionally, we prove that the cost function can be determined by solving forward-backward stochastic differential equations with quadratic growth. With a sufficient condition and utilising variational inequalities in a viscosity sense, we derive the value function and optimal control policy. By the change-of-coordinate technique, we transform the problem into two-dimensional singular control, offering insights into model learning and aligning with classical singular control free boundary problems. We numerically implement our theory using a Markov chain approximation, where inventory is modeled as cash management following an arithmetic Brownian motion. Our numerical results indicate that the continuation region can be divided into three key areas: (i) the target region; (ii) the region where it is optimal to learn and do nothing; and (iii) the region where control becomes predominant and learning should inactive. We demonstrate that ambiguity drives the decision maker to act earlier, leading to a smaller continuation region. This effect becomes more pronounced at the target region as the decision maker gains confidence from a longer learning period. However, these dynamics do not extend to the third region, where learning is excluded.</description>

      <title>Robust Asset-Liability Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How should financial institutions hedge their balance sheets against interest rate risk when managing long-term assets and liabilities? We address this question by proposing a bond portfolio solution based on ambiguity-averse preferences, which generalizes classical immunization and accommodates arbitrary liability structures, portfolio constraints, and interest rate perturbations. In a further extension, we show that the optimal portfolio can be computed as a simple generalized least squares problem, making the solution both transparent and computationally efficient. The resulting portfolio also reduces leverage by implicitly regularizing the portfolio weights, which enhances out-of-sample performance. Numerical evaluations using both empirical and simulated yield curves from a no-arbitrage term structure model support the feasibility and accuracy of our approach relative to existing methods.</description>
