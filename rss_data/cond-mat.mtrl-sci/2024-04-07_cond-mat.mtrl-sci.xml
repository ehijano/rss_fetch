      <title>Nernst effect of high-mobility Weyl electrons in NdAlSi enhanced by a Fermi surface nesting instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermoelectric Nernst effect of solids converts heat flow to beneficial electronic voltages. Here, using a correlated topological semimetal with high carrier mobility $\mu$ in presence of magnetic fluctuations, we demonstrate an enhancement of the Nernst effect close to a magnetic phase transition. A magnetic instability in NdAlSi modifies the carrier relaxation time on 'hotspots' in momentum space, causing a strong band filling dependence of $\mu$. We quantitatively derive electronic band parameters from a novel two-band analysis of the Nernst effect $S_{xy}$, in good agreement with quantum oscillation measurements and band calculations. While the Nernst response of NdAlSi behaves much like conventional semimetals at high temperatures, an additional contribution $\Delta S_{xy}$ from electronic correlations appears just above the magnetic transition. Our work demonstrates the engineering of the relaxation time, or the momentum-dependent self energy, to generate a large Nernst response independent of a material's carrier density, i.e. for metals, semimetals, and semiconductors with large $\mu$.</description>

      <title>Establishing the relationship between generalized crystallographic texture and macroscopic yield surfaces using partial input convex neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we present a methodology to predict the macroscopic yield surface of metals and metallic alloys with general crystallographic textures. In previous work, we have established the use of partially input convex neural networks (pICNN) as macroscopic yield functions of crystal plasticity simulations. However, this work was performed with an over-abundance of data, and on limited crystallographic textures. Here, we extend this study to approach more realistic material states (i.e., complex crystallographic textures), and consider data-availability as a major driver for our approach. We present our modified framework capable of handling generalized material states and demonstrate its effectiveness on materials with complex textures. We further describe an adaptive algorithm for the generation of training data as informed by the shape of yield surfaces to reduce the time for both the generation of training data as well as pICNN training. Finally, we will discuss errors in both training and test datasets, limitations, and future extensibility.</description>

      <title>On the critical competition between singlet exciton decay and free charge generation in non-fullerene-based organic solar cells with low energetic offsets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this era of non-fullerene acceptor (NFA) based organic solar cells, reducing voltage losses while maintaining high photocurrents is the holy grail of current research. Recent focus lies in understanding the manifold fundamental mechanisms in organic blends with minimal energy offsets - particularly the relationship between ionization energy offset ({\Delta}IE) and free charge generation. We quantitatively probe this relationship in multiple NFA-based blends by mixing Y5 and Y6 NFAs with PM6 of varying molecular weights, covering a 15% to 1% power conversion efficiency (PCE) range and a progression of {\Delta}IE. Spectroelectrochemistry reveals a critical {\Delta}IE of approximately 0.3 eV, below which the PCE sharply declines. Transient absorption spectroscopy consistently reveals that a smaller {\Delta}IE slows the dissociation of the NFA's local singlet exciton (LE) into free charges, albeit restorable by an electric field. Bias-dependent time delayed collection experiments quantify the free charge generation efficiency, while photoluminescence quantum efficiency measurements assess photocurrent loss from LE decay. Combined with transient photoluminescence experiments, we find that the decay of singlet excitons is the primary competition to free charge generation in low-offset NFA-based organic solar cells, with neither noticeable losses from charge-transfer (CT) decay nor evidence for LE-CT hybridization. Our experimental data align with Marcus theory calculations, supported by density functional theory simulations, for zero-field free charge generation and exciton decay efficiencies. We find that efficient photocurrent generation generally requires that the CT state is located below the LE, but that this restriction is lifted in systems with a small reorganization energy for charge transfer.</description>

      <title>Current-density-modulated Antiferromagnetic Domain Switching Revealed by Optical Imaging in Pt/CoO(001) Bilayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient control of antiferromagnetic (AFM) domain switching in thin films is vital for advancing antiferromagnet-based memory devices. In this study, we directly observed the current-driven switching process of CoO AFM domains in the Pt/CoO(001) bilayer by the magneto-optical birefringence effect. The observed critical current density for AFM domain switching remains nearly constant across varying CoO thicknesses, associated with the consistent switching polarity n $\perp$ j, suggesting the dominance of the thermomagnetoelastic effect, where and stand for Neel vector and current density vector, respectively. Further confirmation comes from a similar switching process with n $\perp$ j observed in the Pt/Al2O3/CoO sample, excluding the contribution of spin current injection. Remarkably, it was also surprisingly observed that the Neel vector can be further switched parallel to the current direction (n//j) at higher current density. Our findings not only enhance the understanding of current-driven AFM domain switching but also present new avenues for manipulating AFM domains.</description>

      <title>Neutron optical tuning of Fe/11B4CTi multilayers for optimal polarization and increased reflectivity for polarizing neutron optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of scattering length density tuning for improved polarization is investigated for Fe/11B4CTi multilayers and compared to the commonly used Fe/Si system in polarizing multilayer neutron optics. X-ray and neutron reflectivity, magnetization, and neutron polarization have been measured on such multilayers, highlighting differences from conventional Fe/Si multilayers. The multilayer systems were deposited with 25 {\AA} period thickness, a layer thickness ratio of 0.35 and 20 periods, using ion-assisted DC magnetron sputtering. Replacing Si with 11B4CTi for these multilayers showed an increase in reflectivity due to a reduction in interface width. By tuning the ratio between 11B4C and Ti in the non-magnetic layers, a broad range of scattering length density values was achieved, facilitating scattering length density contrast matching between layers for spin-down neutrons, thereby enhancing polarization. These findings demonstrate the potential of Fe/11B4CTi multilayers as a promising option for polarizing neutron optics and highlight the concept of scattering length density tuning in a large range using 11B4CTi.</description>

      <title>Resonant Raman signatures of exciton polarons in a transition metal oxide: BiVO$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the delocalized excitons and excitons trapped by a polaron formation in \BVO{} by means of resonant Raman spectroscopy. We record Raman spectra with 16 laser lines between 1.9 and \SI{2.6}{\eV} and analyze intensity variations of the Raman peaks for different vibrational modes. The resonant Raman cross sections of the \Ag{} modes contain two types of resonances. The first high-energy resonance near \SI{2.45}{\eV} belongs to a transition between delocalized states; it is close to absorption edge measured at \SI{2.3}{\eV} and exhibits a characteristic \SI{50}{\meV} anisotropy between polarization parallel and perpendicular to the $c$ axis. The high energy Raman resonance occurs inside the gap at \SI{1.94}{\eV} for all crystallographic directions.
  The in-gap resonance can involve a localized transition. We attribute it to an exciton-polaron, formed by a small localized electron polaron of Holstein type and delocalized holes. It manifests in the vibrations of vanadium and oxygen atoms where polaron localization occurs and the resonance energy matches theoretical predictions. The vibrational modes couple to the polaron with different efficiency determined from resonant Raman profiles.</description>

      <title>Theory of ultrathin ferroelectrics: the case of CsGeBr$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectricity has recently been demonstrated in germanium-based inorganic halide perovskites. We use atomistic first-principles-based simulations to study ultra-thin CsGeBr$_3$ films with thicknesses of 4-18 nm and develop a theory for ferroelectric ultrathin films. The theory introduces (i) a local order parameter, the local polarization, which allows the identification of phase transitions into both monodomain and polydomain phases, and (ii) a dipole pattern classifier, which allows efficient and reliable identification of unique dipole patterns. Application of the theory to both halides CsGeBr$_3$ and CsGeI$_3$, as well as oxide BiFeO$_3$ ultrathin ferroelectrics, which undergo paraelectric cubic to ferroelectric rhombohedral phase transition in bulk, reveal two distinct scenarios for ultrathin films. In the first one, the films transition into a monodomain phase, which is allowed below a critical value of the residual depolarizing field. Above this critical value, the second scenario occurs, and the film undergoes a phase transition into a nanodomain phase. The two scenarios are associated with the opposite response of Curie temperature to thickness reduction. As the film's thickness decreases, the transition temperature into the monodomain phase increases while the transition temperature into the nanodomain phase decreases. The surface effects are responsible for the Curie temperature enhancement, while the stripe domain pattern is the origin of the transition temperature suppression. Application of dipole pattern classifier reveals a rich variety of nanodomain phases in halide films: nano-stripes, labyrinths, zig-zags, pillars, and lego-domains. Our work could lead to both a deeper understanding of nanoscale ferroelectrics and discoveries of unusual nanoscale dipole patterns.</description>

      <title>The structural stability of tungsten nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by contradicting reports in the literature, we have investigated the structural stability of tungsten nanoparticles using density functional theory calculations. The comparison of BCC, FCC, A15, disordered, and icosahedral configurations unequivocally shows that BCC is the energetically most stable structure when the number of atoms is greater than 40. A disordered structure is more stable for smaller sizes. This result conflicts with an earlier theoretical study on transition metal nanoparticles, based on a semi-empirical modeling of nanoparticles energetics [D. Tom{\'a}nek et al., Phys. Rev. B \textbf{28}, 665 (1983)]. Examining this latter work in the light of our results suggests that an erroneous description of clusters geometry is the source of the discrepancy. Finally, we improve the accuracy of the semi-empirical model proposed in this work, which will be useful to calculate nanoparticle energies for larger sizes.</description>

      <title>Direct evidence of low work function on SrVO$_3$ cathode using thermionic electron emission microscopy and high-field ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perovskite SrVO$_3$ has recently been proposed as a novel electron emission cathode material. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest multiple low work function surfaces and recent experimental efforts have consistently demonstrated effective work functions of ~2.7 eV for polycrystalline samples, both results suggesting, but not directly confirming, some fraction of even lower work function surface is present. In this work, thermionic electron emission microscopy (ThEEM) and high-field ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy are used to study the local work function distribution and measure the work function of a partially-oriented-(110)-SrVO$_3$ perovskite oxide cathode surface. Our results show direct evidence of low work function patches of about 2.1 eV on the cathode surface, with corresponding onset of observable thermionic emission at 750 $^o$C. We hypothesize that, in our ThEEM experiments, the high applied electric field suppresses the patch field effect, enabling the direct measurement of local work functions. This measured work function of 2.1 eV is comparable to the previous DFT-calculated work function value of the SrVO-terminated (110) SrVO$_3$ surface (2.3 eV) and SrO terminated (100) surface (1.9 eV). The measured 2.1 eV value is also much lower than the work function for the (001) LaB$_6$ single crystal cathode (~2.7 eV) and comparable to the effective work function of B-type dispenser cathodes (~2.1 eV). If SrVO$_3$ thermionic emitters can be engineered to access domains of this low 2.1 eV work function, they have potential to significantly improve thermionic emitter-based technologies.</description>

      <title>Grand canonically optimized grain boundary phases in hexagonal close-packed titanium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grain boundaries (GBs) profoundly influence the properties and performance of materials, emphasizing the importance of understanding the GB structure and phase behavior. As recent computational studies have demonstrated the existence of multiple GB phases associated with varying the atomic density at the interface, we introduce a validated, open-source GRand canonical Interface Predictor (GRIP) tool that automates high-throughput, grand canonical optimization of GB structures. While previous studies of GB phases have almost exclusively focused on cubic systems, we demonstrate the utility of GRIP in an application to hexagonal close-packed titanium. We perform a systematic high-throughput exploration of tilt GBs in titanium and discover previously unreported structures and phase transitions. In low-angle boundaries, we demonstrate a coupling between point defect absorption and the change in the GB dislocation network topology due to GB phase transformations, which has important implications for the accommodation of radiation-induced defects.</description>

      <title>Incoherent polariton dynamics and nonlinearities in organic light-emitting diodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) have redefined lighting with their environment-friendliness and flexibility. However, only 25 % of the electronic states of fluorescent molecules can emit light upon electrical excitation, limiting the overall efficiency of OLEDs. Strong light-matter coupling, achieved by confining light within OLEDs using mirrors, generates polaritons - hybrid light-matter states - that could activate the remaining 75 % electronic states. Here, we show how different processes in such polariton OLEDs can be expected to change using a phenomenological quantum master equation model. We are especially interested in reverse inter-system crossing happening directly from the dark triplet states to the emitting lower polariton. We derive a simple expression for the enhancement factor of polaritonic RISC in the linear regime. In addition, we explore the extension of our model to higher dimensions and study some potential effects of strong coupling on nonlinear processes such as triplet-triplet annihilation.</description>

      <title>Waveguide QED at the onset of spin-spin correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We experimentally explore the competition between light-mediated and direct matter-matter interactions in waveguide quantum electrodynamics. For this, we couple a superconducting line to a model magnetic material, made of organic free radical DPPH molecules with a spin $S=1/2$ and a $g_{S}$ factor very close to that of a free electron. The microwave transmission has been measured in a wide range of temperatures ($0.013$ K $\leq T \leq 2$ K), magnetic fields ($0\leq B \leq 0.5$ T) and frequencies ($0 \leq \omega/2 \pi \leq 14$ GHz). We find that molecules belonging to the crystal sublattice B form one-dimensional spin chains. Temperature then controls intrinsic spin correlations along the chain in a continuous and monotonic way. In the paramagnetic region ($T &gt; 0.7$ K), the microwave transmission shows evidences for the collective coupling of quasi-identical spins to the propagating photons, with coupling strengths that reach values close to the dissipation rates. As $T$ decreases, the growth of intrinsic spin correlations, combined with the anisotropy in the spin-spin exchange constants, break down the collective spin-photon coupling. In this regime, the temperature dependence of the spin resonance visibility reflects the change in the nature of the dominant spin excitations, from single spin flips to bosonic magnons, which is brought about by the magnetic correlation growth.</description>

      <title>Dualtronics: leveraging both faces of polar semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unlike non-polar semiconductors such as silicon, the broken inversion symmetry of the wide bandgap semiconductor gallium nitride leads to a large electronic polarization along a unique crystal axis. This makes the two surfaces of the semiconductor wafer perpendicular to the polar axis dramatically different in their physical and chemical properties. In the last three decades, the cation (gallium) face of gallium nitride has been used for photonic devices such as LEDs and lasers. Though the cation face has also been predominantly used for electronic devices, the anion (nitrogen) face has recently shown promise for high electron mobility transistors due to favorable polarization discontinuities. In this work we show that it is possible to make photonic devices on the cation face, and electronic devices on the anion face, of the same semiconductor wafer. This opens the possibility for dualtronics in polar semiconductors, where electronic, photonic, and acoustic properties can be implemented on opposite faces of the same wafer, dramatically enhancing the functional capabilities of this revolutionary semiconductor family.</description>

      <title>WS$_2$ Monolayer Integration in a FAPbI$_3$-based Heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Incorporating a monolayer of WS$_2$ via interface engineering enhances the overall physical properties of a FAPbI3 perovskite based heterostructure. FAPbI$_3$/WS$_2$/TiO$_2$/ITO and FAPbI$_3$/TiO$_2$/ITO heterostructures were analyzed by UV-Vis spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. The configuration with WS$_2$ interlayer presents higher absorption in the visible region with a bandgap of {\aprox} 1.44 eV. WS$_2$ also enhances the deposition process of FAPbI$_3$, resulting in the formation of pure photoactive $\alpha$-phase without the non-photoactive $\delta$-phase nor residual plumbates. The incorporation of the monolayer improves the crystalline structure of the FAPbI$_3$, promoting a preferential growth in the [100] direction. The smooth surface of WS$_2$ favors a homogeneous morphology and an increase of the grain size to ~4.5 $\mu$m, the largest reported for similar structures. Furthermore, the work function obtained lets us propose an enhance an adequate energy band alignment between FAPbI$_3$ and the n-type layers for the electron flux to the cathode. These findings strongly suggest that the interfacial coupling of FAPbI$_3$/WS$_2$ could be a promising candidate in photovoltaic applications.</description>

      <title>Photochemistry upon charge separation in triphenylamine derivatives from fs to $\mathrm{\mu}$s</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum chemical methods and time-resolved laser spectroscopy are employed to elucidate ultrafast charge separation processes in triphenylamine (TPA) derivatives upon photoexcitation. When changing the ambient solvent from generic ones to those capable of accepting electrons, such as chloroform, a vastly extended and multifaceted photochemistry is observed. Following the initial excitation, two concurrent charge transfer processes are identified. Firstly, when the TPA derivative and solvent molecules are correctly positioned, an electron transfer to the solvent molecule with immediate charge separation takes place. Consequently, this process gives rise to the formation of the corresponding radical cation of the TPA derivative. This highly reactive species can subsequently combine with other TPA derivative molecules to yield dimeric species. Secondly, when the molecular positioning upon photoexcitation is not optimal, relaxation back to the $\mathrm{S_1}$ state occurs. From this state, an electron transfer process leads to the formation of a charge transfer complex. In this complex, the negatively charged solvent molecule remains closely associated with the positively charged TPA derivative. Within 30 picoseconds, the charges within this complex recombine, yielding a triplet state. This transition to the triplet state is driven by a lower reaction barrier for charge separation compared to the formation of the singlet state.</description>

Abstract: We examine a class of Hamiltonians characterized by interatomic, interorbital even-odd parity hybridization as a model for a family of topological insulators without the need for spin-orbit coupling. Non-trivial properties of these materials are exemplified by studying the topologically-protected edge states of s-p hybridized alkali and alkaline earth atoms in one and two-dimensional lattices. In 1D the topological features are analogous to the canonical Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model but, remarkably, occur in the absence of dimerization. Alkaline earth chains, with Be standing out due to its gap size and near particle-hole symmetry, are of particular experimental interest since their Fermi energy without doping lies directly at the level of topological edge stats. Similar physics is demonstrated to occur in a 2D honeycomb lattice system of s-p bonded atoms, where dispersive edge states emerge. Lighter elements are predicted using this model to host topological states in contrast to spin-orbit coupling-induced band inversion favoring heaving atoms.</description>

      <title>Reliable operation in high-mobility indium oxide thin film transistors</title>

Abstract: Transparent oxide semiconductors (TOSs) based thin-film transistors (TFTs) that exhibit higher field effect mobility (uFE) are highly required toward the realization of next-generation displays. Among numerous types of TOS-TFTs, In2O3-based TFTs are the front-running candidate because they exhibit the highest uFE ~100 cm2/Vs. However, the device operation of In2O3 TFTs is unreliable; a large voltage shift occurs especially when negative gate bias is applied due to adsorption/desorption of gas molecules. Although passivation of the TFTs is used to overcome such instability, previously proposed passivation materials did not improve the reliability. Here, we show that the In2O3 TFTs passivated with Y2O3 and Er2O3 films are highly reliable and do not show threshold voltage shifts when applying gate bias. We applied positive and negative gate bias to the In2O3 TFTs passivated with various insulating oxides and found that only the In2O3 TFTs passivated with Y2O3 and Er2O3 films did not exhibit threshold voltage shifts. We observed that only the Y2O3 grew heteroepitaxially on the In2O3 crystal. This would be the origin of the high reliability of the In2O3 TFTs passivated with Y2O3 and Er2O3 films. This finding accelerates the development of next-generation displays using high-mobility In2O3 TFTs.</description>

      <title>Strong magneto-optical responses of an ensemble of defect-bound excitons in aged WS$_{2}$ and WSe$_{2}$ monolayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers present a singular coupling in their spin and valley degrees of freedom. Moreover, by applying an external magnetic field it is possible to break the energy degeneracy between their K and $-$K valleys. Thus, this analogous valley Zeeman effect opens the possibility of controlling and distinguishing the spin and valley of charge carriers in TMDs by their optical transition energies, making these materials promising for the next generation of spintronic and photonic devices. However, the free excitons of pristine TMD monolayer samples present a moderate valley Zeeman splitting, which is measured by their g-factor values that are approximately $-4$. Therefore, for application purposes it is mandatory alternative excitonic states with higher magnetic responses. Here we investigate the valley Zeeman effect in aged WS$_{2}$ and WSe$_{2}$ grown monolayers by magneto-photoluminescence measurements at cryogenic temperatures. These samples present a lower energy defect-bound exciton emission related to defects adsorbed during the aging process. While the free excitons of these samples exhibit g-factors between $-3$ and $-4$, their defect-bound excitons present giant effective g-factor values of $-(25.0 \pm 0.2)$ and $-(19.1 \pm 0.2)$ for WS$_{2}$ and WSe$_{2}$ aged monolayers, respectively. In addition, we observe a significant spin polarization of charge carriers in the defective mid gap states induced by the external magnetic fields. We explain this spin polarized population in terms of a spin-flip transition mechanism, which is also responsible for the magnetic dependent light emission of the defect-bound exciton states. Our work sheds light in the potential of aged TMDs as candidates for spintronic based devices.</description>

      <title>Unusual acceleration and size effects in grain boundary migration with shear coupling</title>

Abstract: Grain boundary (GB) migration plays a crucial role in the thermal and mechanical responses of polycrystalline materials, particularly in ultrafine-grained and nano-grained materials exhibiting grain size-dependent properties. This study investigates the migration behaviors of a set of GBs in Ni through atomistic simulations, employing synthetic driving forces and shear stress. Surprisingly, the displacements of some shear-coupling GBs do not follow the widely assumed linear or approximately linear relation with time; instead, they exhibit a noticeable acceleration tendency. Furthermore, as the bicrystal size perpendicular to the GB plane increases, the boundary velocity significantly decreases. These observations are independent of the magnitude and type of driving force but are closely linked to temperature, unique to shear-coupling GBs that display a rise in the kinetic energy component along the shear direction. By adopting a specific boundary condition, the acceleration in migration and size effect can be largely alleviated. However, the continuous rise in kinetic energy persists, leading to the true driving force for GB migration being lower than the applied value. To address this, we propose a technique to extract the true driving force based on a quantitative analysis of the work-energy relation in the bicrystal system. The calculated true mobility reveals that the recently proposed mobility tensor may not be symmetric at relatively large driving forces. These discoveries advance our understanding of GB migration and offer a scheme to extract the true mobility, crucial for meso- and continuum-scale simulations of GB migration-related phenomena such as crack propagation, recrystallization, and grain growth.</description>

      <title>Spatially resolved dielectric loss at the Si/SiO$_2$ interface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Si/SiO$_2$ interface is populated by isolated trap states which modify its electronic properties. These traps are of critical interest for the development of semiconductor-based quantum sensors and computers, as well as nanoelectronic devices. Here, we study the electric susceptibility of the Si/SiO$_2$ interface with nm spatial resolution using frequency-modulated atomic force microscopy to measure a patterned dopant delta-layer buried 2 nm beneath the silicon native oxide interface. We show that surface charge organization timescales, which range from 1-150 ns, increase significantly around interfacial states. We conclude that dielectric loss under time-varying gate biases at MHz and sub-MHz frequencies in metal-insulator-semiconductor capacitor device architectures is highly spatially heterogeneous over nm length scales.

      <title>Chemical-substitution-driven giant anomalous Hall and Nernst effects in magnetic cubic Heusler compounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07722v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chemical substitution efficiently optimizes the physical properties of Heusler compounds, especially their anomalous transport properties, including anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) and anomalous Nernst conductivity (ANC). This study systematically investigates the effect of chemical substitution on AHC and ANC in 1493 magnetic cubic Heusler compounds using high-throughput first-principles calculations. Notable trends emerge in Co- and Rh-based compounds, where chemical substitution effectively enhances the AHC and ANC. Intriguingly, certain chemically substituted candidates exhibit outstanding enhancement in AHCs and ANCs, such as (Co$_{0.8}$Ni$_{0.2}$)$_2$FeSn with considerable AHC and ANC values of $-2567.78$ S cm$^{-1}$ and $8.27$ A m$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$, respectively, and (Rh$_{0.8}$Ru$_{0.2}$)$_2$MnIn with an AHC of $1950.49$ S cm$^{-1}$. In particular, an extraordinary ANC of $8.57$ A m$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ is identified exclusively in Rh$_2$Co$_{0.7}$Fe$_{0.3}$In, nearly double the maximum value of $4.36$ A m$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ observed in the stoichiometric Rh$_2$CoIn. A comprehensive band structure analysis underscores that the notable enhancement in ANC arises from the creation and modification of the energy-dependent nodal lines through chemical substitution. This mechanism generates a robust Berry curvature, resulting in significant ANCs. These findings emphasize the pivotal role of chemical substitution in engineering high-performance materials, thereby expanding the horizons of transport property optimization within Heusler compounds.</description>

Abstract: The Open Databases Integration for Materials Design (OPTIMADE) application programming interface (API) empowers users with holistic access to a growing federation of databases, enhancing the accessibility and discoverability of materials and chemical data. Since the first release of the OPTIMADE specification (v1.0), the API has undergone significant development, leading to the upcoming v1.2 release, and has underpinned multiple scientific studies. In this work, we highlight the latest features of the API format, accompanying software tools, and provide an update on the implementation of OPTIMADE in contributing materials databases. We end by providing several use cases that demonstrate the utility of the OPTIMADE API in materials research that continue to drive its ongoing development.</description>

Abstract: Topological defects, such as Stone-Wales defects and grain boundaries, are common in 2D materials. In this study, we investigate the intricate interplay of topological defects and carbon contamination in hexagonal boron nitride revealing an intriguing class of color centers. We demonstrate that both carbon contamination and strain can stabilize Stone-Wales configurations and give rise to emitters with desirable optical properties in the visible spectral range. Inspired by these results, we further demonstrate that carbon atoms at grain boundaries can resolve energetic B-B and N-N bonds leading to highly favorable atomic structures that may facilitate the accumulation of carbon contamination at the boundaries. Similarly to contaminated Stone-Wales defects, carbon-doped grain boundaries can also give rise to color centers emitting in the visible spectral range with short radiative lifetime and high Debye-Waller factors. Our discoveries shed light on an exciting class of defects and pave the way toward the identification of color centers and single photon emitters in hBN.</description>

      <title>A fundamental correlative spectroscopic study on LixNiO2 and NaNiO2</title>

Abstract: The intimate correlation between the local atomic arrangement and electronic states in Li-ion battery cathode materials plays a crucial role in determining their electrochemical properties, including capacity, cycling stability, and rate capability. Despite almost 30 years of research efforts on high performance cathodes based on Ni rich layered oxides, there is still no consensus on LiNiO2 local atomic and electronic structure. Ni sites could be either Jahn-Teller distorted or bond disproportionated and the role of Ni and oxygen in the charge compensation mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we compare the local and electronic structure of LiNiO2 and NaNiO2, a long-range Jahn-Teller system, using a novel approach which aims at correlating the results from bulk spectroscopy techniques, particularly under operando conditions, obtained on standard samples to ensure sample interoperability and enhance the reliability and robustness of our results. Despite being a site-selective and local technique, XAS is unable to discriminate between the proposed scenarios, as confirmed also by theoretical calculations. On the contrary, Raman spectroscopy show local structural differences between monoclinic distorted NaNiO2 and rhombohedral LiNiO2. Additionally, HAXPES confirms the presence of multiple formal oxidation states for Ni, and RIXS data provides evidence of 3d8 states, confirming the negative charge transfer character of Ni and some degree of bond disproportionation in LiNiO2. Regarding the charge compensation mechanism, XRS and RIXS support the participation of oxygen holes in the redox activity, while Raman spectroscopy does not detect molecular oxygen. By combing several high-fidelity spectroscopy datasets, this study shows the value of correlative characterization workflows to provide insights into complex structural-electrochemical relationships.</description>

Abstract: The Unruh-DeWitt particle detector model has found success in demonstrating quantum information channels with non-zero channel capacity between qubits and quantum fields. These detector models provide the necessary framework for experimentally realizable Unruh-DeWitt Quantum Computers with near-perfect channel capacity. We propose spin qubits with gate-controlled coupling to Luttinger liquids as a laboratory setting for Unruh-DeWitt detectors and general design constraints that underpin their feasibility in this and other settings. We also present several experimental scenarios including graphene ribbons, edges states in the quantum spin Hall phase of HgTe quantum wells, and the recently discovered quantum anomalous Hall phase in transition metal dichalcogenides. Theoretically, through bosonization, we show that Unruh-DeWitt detectors can carry out Quantum Computations and when they can make perfect quantum communication channels between qubits via the Luttinger liquid. Our results point the way toward an all-to-all connected solid state quantum computer and the experimental study of quantum information in quantum fields via condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional coherent spectrum of high-spin models via a quantum computing approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present and benchmark a quantum computing approach to calculate the two-dimensional coherent spectrum (2DCS) of high-spin models. Our approach is based on simulating their real-time dynamics in the presence of several magnetic field pulses, which are spaced in time. We utilize the adaptive variational quantum dynamics simulation (AVQDS) algorithm for the study due to its compact circuits, which enables simulations over sufficiently long times to achieve the required resolution in frequency space. Specifically, we consider an antiferromagnetic quantum spin model that incorporates Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions and single-ion anisotropy. The obtained 2DCS spectra exhibit distinct peaks at multiples of the magnon frequency, arising from transitions between different eigenstates of the unperturbed Hamiltonian. By comparing the one-dimensional coherent spectrum with 2DCS, we demonstrate that 2DCS provides a higher resolution of the energy spectrum. We further investigate how the quantum resources scale with the magnitude of the spin using two different binary encodings of the high-spin operators: the standard binary encoding and the Gray code. At low magnetic fields both encodings require comparable quantum resources, but at larger field strengths the Gray code is advantageous. Lastly, we compare the numerical 2DCS with experimental results on a rare-earth orthoferrite system. The observed strength of the magnonic high-harmonic generation signals in the 2DCS of the quantum high-spin model aligns well with the experimental data, showing significant improvement over the corresponding mean-field results.</description>

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is transforming computational materials science, improving the prediction of material properties, and accelerating the discovery of novel materials. Recently, publicly available material data repositories have grown rapidly. This growth encompasses not only more materials, but also a greater variety and quantity of their associated properties. Existing machine learning efforts in materials science focus primarily on single-modality tasks, i.e., relationships between materials and a single physical property, thus not taking advantage of the rich and multimodal set of material properties. Here, we introduce Multimodal Learning for Materials (MultiMat), which enables self-supervised multi-modality training of foundation models for materials. We demonstrate our framework's potential using data from the Materials Project database on multiple axes: (i) MultiMat achieves state-of-the-art performance for challenging material property prediction tasks; (ii) MultiMat enables novel and accurate material discovery via latent space similarity, enabling screening for stable materials with desired properties; and (iii) MultiMat encodes interpretable emergent features that may provide novel scientific insights.</description>
