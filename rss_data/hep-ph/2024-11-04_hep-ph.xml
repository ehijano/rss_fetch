      <title>Phenomenology of scotogenic-like 3-loop neutrino mass models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this talk, we discuss the phenomenology of radiative 3-loop seesaw models. The 3-loop suppression allows the new particles to have masses at the TeV scale, along with relatively large Yukawa couplings, while retaining consistency with neutrino masses and mixing, as observed in neutrino oscillation experiments. This leads to a rich phenomenology, especially in searches for charged lepton flavor violation, where the models predict sizable rates, well within future experimental reach. The models provide viable fermionic or scalar dark matter candidates, as is typical within the scotogenic paradigm. We discuss specific realizations in which the W-mass anomaly and the baryon asymmetry of the Universe can be accommodated, while complying with current constraints imposed by electroweak precision observables, charged-lepton flavor violation and neutrinoless double-beta decay.</description>

      <title>Progress in top-quark pair production cross section calculations and impact on parton distribution functions of the proton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the impact of eligible top-quark pair production differential cross-section measurements at the LHC with a collision energy of 13 TeV on the parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the proton as well as the impact of approximate next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (aN$^3$LO) QCD corrections combined with next-to-leading order (NLO) electroweak (EW) corrections on $t\bar t$ observables. We illustrate the effects on the gluon PDF at large $x$ from an optimal baseline selection of data in NNLO global fits, and show comparisons between the theory prediction for $t\bar t$ total and differential cross sections at aN$^3$LO QCD combined with NLO EW and recent measurements from the ATLAS and CMS collaborations at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Light states in real multi-Higgs models with spontaneous CP violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In models with extended scalar sectors consisting of multiple Higgs doublets that trigger spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking, it might be expected that the abundance of dimensionful quadratic couplings in the scalar potential could allow for a regime where, apart from the would-be Goldstone bosons and a neutral Higgs-like state, all new scalars have masses much larger than the electroweak scale. In the case of models where CP invariance holds at the lagrangian level but is broken by the vacuum, we show that such a reasonable expectation does not hold. When perturbativity requirements are placed on the dimensionless quartic couplings, the spectrum of the new scalars includes one charged and two additional neutral states whose masses cannot be much larger than the electroweak scale.</description>

      <title>Accurate and robust methods for direct background estimation in resonant anomaly detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resonant anomaly detection methods have great potential for enhancing the sensitivity of traditional bump hunt searches. A key component of these methods is a high quality background template used to produce an anomaly score. Using the LHC Olympics R&amp;D dataset, we demonstrate that this background template can also be repurposed to directly estimate the background expectation in a simple cut and count setup. In contrast to a traditional bump hunt, no fit to the invariant mass distribution is needed, thereby avoiding the potential problem of background sculpting. Furthermore, direct background estimation allows working with large background rejection rates, where resonant anomaly detection methods typically show their greatest improvement in significance.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Dark Matter with Future MeV Gamma-Ray Telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A number of new balloon or space-based gamma-ray observatories have been proposed to close a "MeV gap" in sensitivity to gamma rays in the MeV-GeV energy band. One aspect of the science case for these instruments is their ability to constrain or discover decaying or annihilating dark matter. In this work, we forecast the sensitivity of these instruments for dark matter annihilation or decay for a range of possible Standard Model final states and compare to existing bounds.</description>

      <title>Improving the Global SMEFT Picture with Bounds on Neutrino NSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze how neutrino oscillation and coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering data impact the global SMEFT fit. We first review the mapping between the SMEFT parameters and the so-called NSI framework, commonly considered in the neutrino literature. We also present a detailed discussion of how the measurements for the normalization of neutrino fluxes and cross sections, that will also be affected by the new physics, indirectly impact the measured oscillation probabilities. We then analyze two well-motivated simplified scenarios. Firstly, we study a lepton flavour conserving case, usually assumed in global SMEFT analyses, showing the complementarity of neutrino oscillation and CE$\nu$NS experiments with other low-energy observables. We find that the inclusion of neutrino data allows to constrain previously unbounded SMEFT operators involving the tau flavour and confirm the improvement of the constraint on a combination of Wilson coefficients previously identified. Moreover, we find that neutrino oscillation constraints on NSI are improved when embedded in the global SMEFT framework. Secondly, we study a lepton flavour violating scenario and find that neutrino data also improves over previously derived global constraints thanks to its sensitivity to new combinations of Wilson coefficients.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Electroweakino Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The system of light electroweakinos and heavy squarks gives rise to one of the most challenging signatures to detect at the LHC. It consists of missing transverse energy recoiled against a few hadronic jets originating either from QCD radiation or squark decays. The analysis generally suffers from the large irreducible Z + jets $(Z \to \nu \bar \nu)$ background. In this study, we explore Machine Learning (ML) methods for efficient signal/background discrimination. Our best attempt uses both reconstructed (jets, missing transverse energy, etc.) and low-level (particle-flow) objects. We find that the discrimination performance improves as the pT threshold for soft particles is lowered from 10 GeV to 1 GeV, at the expense of larger systematic uncertainty. In many cases, the ML method provides a factor two enhancement in $S/\sqrt{(S + B)}$ from a simple kinematical selection. The sensitivity on the squark-elecroweakino mass plane is derived with this method, assuming the Run-3 and HL-LHC luminosities. Moreover, we investigate the relations between input features and the network's classification performance to reveal the physical information used in the background/signal discrimination process.</description>

      <title>Maximal value for trilinear Higgs coupling in a 3-3-1 EFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent efforts, both theoretical and experimental, have increasingly focused on the scalar potential of the Standard Model, with a highlight on the trilinear Higgs coupling. This parameter has long been recognized for its potential to test Beyond-Standard-Model (BSM) theories and its significance in understanding early cosmological dynamics. In order to broadly map BSM scenarios, a powerful tool is to devise its effective field theory (EFT) version for low-energies. In this work, we obtain a consistent EFT for a class of models based on the gauge group $SU(3)_c\times SU(3)_L\times U(1)_Y$. After properly matching the UV-complete theory at tree-level, we show that the EFT is a Two-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM), where some of the quartic couplings are naturally small. By imposing bounds from electroweak precision observables, collider, flavor, as well as theoretical considerations we obtain that the maximum value of the trilinear Higgs coupling is more than four times larger than the SM prediction, potentially testable at the LHC Hi-Lumi upgrade and other future colliders. Moreover, we find that such large values are only attainable if one considers an out-of-alignment scenario, even if the deviation is very small, which is not typically considered in the literature.</description>

      <title>Why detect forward muons at a muon collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We survey the opportunities offered by the detection of the forward muons that accompany the creation of neutral effective vector bosons at a muon collider, in different kinematic regimes. Vectors with relatively low energy produce the Higgs boson and the extended muon angular coverage enables studies of the Higgs properties, such as the measurement of the inclusive production cross section and of the branching ratio to invisible final states. New heavy particles could be produced by vectors of higher energy, through Higgs portal interactions. If the new particles are invisible, the detection of the forward muons is essential in order to search for this scenario. The angular correlations of the forward muons are sensitive to the quantum interference between the vector boson helicity amplitudes and can be exploited for the characterisation of vector boson scattering and fusion processes. This is illustrated by analysing the CP properties of the Higgs coupling to the Z boson. Our findings provide a physics case and a set of benchmarks for the design of a dedicated forward muon detector.</description>

      <title>A functional treatment of small instanton-induced axion potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a functional method to perform complete one-instanton calculations of the axion potential. This is done for an $SU(N)$ gauge theory with a matter content in any representation of the gauge group. This type of computation requires the expression of the fermion zero modes of the theory. We construct them for all representations of $SU(2)$, which serve as building blocks for obtaining the fermion zero modes for arbitrary representations of $SU(N)$. The method is applied to the Minimal Supersymmetric $SU(5)$ model and its low-energy counterpart, the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model extended with two color triplets.</description>

      <title>Systematic Interpretability and the Likelihood for Boosted Top Quark Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identification of boosted, hadronically-decaying top quarks is a problem of central importance for physics goals of the Large Hadron Collider. We present a theoretical analysis of top quark tagging, establishing zeroth-order, minimal assumptions that should be satisfied by any purported top-tagged jet, like existence of three hard subjets, a bottom-tagged subjet, total mass consistent with the top quark, and a pairwise subjet mass consistent with the W boson. From these minimal assumptions, we construct the optimal discrimination observable, the likelihood ratio, for the binary discrimination problem of top quark-initiated versus bottom quark-initiated jets through next-to-leading order in the strong coupling. We compare and compute corresponding signal and background efficiencies both analytically and from simulated data, validating an understanding of the relevant physics identified and exploited by the likelihood. In the process, we construct a method for systematic interpretability of the likelihood ratio for this problem, and explicitly establish a hard floor on possible discrimination power. These results can correspondingly be applied to understanding and interpreting machine learning studies of this problem.</description>

      <title>The quark gap equation in light-cone gauge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the quark self-energy correction in light-cone gauge motivated by distribution amplitudes whose definition implies a Wilson line. The latter serves to preserve the gauge invariance of the hadronic amplitudes and becomes trivial in light-cone gauge. Therefore, the calculation of the distribution amplitudes simplifies significantly provided that wave functions and propagators are obtained in that gauge. In here, we explore the corresponding Dyson-Schwinger equation in its leading truncation and with a dressed vertex derived from a Ward identity in light-cone gauge. The quark's mass and wave renormalization functions, as well as a third complex-valued amplitude, are found to depend on the relative orientation of the quark momentum and a light-like four-vector, which expresses a geometric gauge dependence of the propagator.</description>

      <title>Is Ball Lightning a Signal of Magnetic Monopoles?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While ball lighting is known to exist from thousands of observations, its properties have never been explained by known physics. The combined order of magnitude of power, size, time scale, and characteristic behavior of ball lightning have defeated every model. The failure of standard physics does not hinge on fine details, but on the breadth of qualitative features of the phenomenon itself. We consider the possibility that ball lighting may be a signal of physics beyond the Standard Model. The mass and energy scale of ball lightning is remarkably consistent with new physics scales of grand unified theories. We analyze a suggestion that monopole catalysis of baryon decays in air might explain ball lightning. Nothing can be done to make it consistent, including saturating interaction cross sections with unitarity bounds. However a high mass dyon partially decaying by neutralization of deeply bound electromagnetic energy explains several puzzles naturally. The study suggests new ways to search for dyons and monopoles. The organizational skills of ambitious experimental physics groups could lead to productive searches beyond the Standard Model that do not need a new particle accelerator.</description>

Abstract: It is shown that the Belle and LHCb data on the interference of the amplitudes of the S- and D-partial waves in the decays $D_{s1}(2536 )^+\to D^{*+}K^0_S$ and $D_{s1}(2536)^-\to\bar D^{*0}K^-$ allow us to obtain an estimate of the S-wave $D^*K$ scattering length in the channel with isospin $I=0$: $|a^{(0)}_{D^*K}|=(0.94\pm0.06)$ fm. The possibility of explaining the found value by the contribution of the $D_{s1}(2460)$ resonance is discussed. The decay of $B_{s1}(5830)\to B^*\bar K$ is also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>A Lorentz-Equivariant Transformer for All of the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the Lorentz-Equivariant Geometric Algebra Transformer (L-GATr) yields state-of-the-art performance for a wide range of machine learning tasks at the Large Hadron Collider. L-GATr represents data in a geometric algebra over space-time and is equivariant under Lorentz transformations. The underlying architecture is a versatile and scalable transformer, which is able to break symmetries if needed. We demonstrate the power of L-GATr for amplitude regression and jet classification, and then benchmark it as the first Lorentz-equivariant generative network. For all three LHC tasks, we find significant improvements over previous architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New sources of CP violation are necessary to solve the problem of the baryon asymmetry of the Universe. Extending Higgs sector is one way to introduce such new CP violating phases, and studying observables resulting from the CP violation is important to test the model in future experiments. In these proceedings, we discuss the loop induced $ H^\pm W^\mp Z$ vertices in the CP violating general two Higgs doublet model, summarizing our results. We evaluate impacts of the CP violation on the decays $H^\pm \to W^\pm Z$ through these vertices, and find that the difference between the decays $H^+ \to W^+ Z$ and $H^- \to W^- Z$ is sensitive to the CP violating phases in the model.</description>

      <title>Lepton Flavor Violation in Nonholomorphic Soft SUSY-Breaking Scenarios: Experimental Limits and Excesses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the prospects for the observation of lepton flavor violation (LFV) within the nonholomorphic supersymmetric standard model (NHSSM). We examine charged lepton flavor-violating (cLFV) decays such as such $\mu \rightarrow e \gamma$, $\tau \rightarrow e \gamma$ and $\tau \rightarrow \mu \gamma$ to impose indirect constraints on both LFV holomorphic and nonholomorphic (NH) soft Supersymmetry-breaking (SSB) terms. These constraints are subsequently utilized to calculate decay rates for LFV Higgs decays (LFVHD). Within the allowed parameter space, NH contributions to LFVHD can be notably larger compared to the holomorphic counterparts. Interestingly, recently ATLAS reported an excess larger than $2\,\sigma$ in their searches for $h \to e \tau$ and $h \to \mu\tau$. Their best-fit point is not excluded by the corresponding CMS limits. We demonstrate that for some parts of parameter space, the predicted values for $\text{BR}(h\to e \tau)$ and $\text{BR}(h\to \mu \tau)$ in the NH scenarios reach up to the present experimental limit for these decay processes and can potentially explain the excesses observed by ATLAS, while being in agreement with other experimental constraints. If these decays are eventually observed experimentally, they could potentially serve as a distinctive signature of the NH scenarios and determine some of the NH parameters. Conversely, the limits on the LFVHDs can restrict the allowed parameter space for the NH SSB terms in the NHSSM.</description>

      <title>The Quest for Understanding: The Case of the Upgraded Superconducting Super Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fundamental particle physics is at a cross road. On the one hand the Standard Model successfully accounts for all experimental observations to date. On the other hand the ElectroWeak symmetry breaking mechanism is poorly understood and suggests the existence of new physics within reach of future colliders. Building on LHC experience, a hadron collider using the well established LHC magnet technology in a 90--100km circular ring, can reach the required 50--60TeV energy range and uncover the next layers of reality by the early 2040s.</description>

      <title>A Practical Guide to Statistical Techniques in Particle Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In high-energy physics (HEP), both the exclusion and discovery of new theories depend not only on the acquisition of high-quality experimental data but also on the rigorous application of statistical methods. These methods provide probabilistic criteria (such as p-values) to compare experimental data with theoretical models, aiming to describe the data as accurately as possible. Hypothesis testing plays a central role in this process, as it enables comparisons between established theories and potential new explanations for the observed data. This report reviews key statistical methods currently employed in particle physics, using synthetic data and numerical comparisons to illustrate the concepts in a clear and accessible way. Our results highlight the practical significance of these statistical tools in enhancing the experimental sensitivity and model exclusion capabilities in HEP. All numerical results are estimated using Python and RooFit, a high-level statistical modeling package used by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations at CERN to model and report results from experimental data.</description>

      <title>Gauge coupling jump and small instantons from a large non-minimal coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If a scalar field couples to the Ricci scalar with a large non-minimal coupling, the Standard Model coupling parameters can differ above and below an intermediate field range of the scalar due to the non-renormalizability. In this paper, we study, for the first time, the threshold effects on a gauge coupling in both Metric and Palatini formulations of gravity. We find that the gauge coupling naturally jumps around this intermediate scale since counter terms for the renormalization behave so. If the gauge coupling becomes strong with a large scalar field value due to this effect, there can be an enhanced small instanton contribution, the dilute gas approximation of which is justified because the gauge sector decouples when the scalar wave mode is very short. Using these findings, we discuss the QCD axion quality problem, the heavy QCD axion, the QCD axion abundance, and the suppression of isocurvature perturbations. We show that axion physics may differ substantially from na\"{i}ve expectations when we introduce a large non-minimal coupling for any scalar field.</description>

      <title>Spinor-Vector Duality and Mirror Symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18790v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mirror symmetry was first observed in worldsheet string constructions and shown to have profound implications in the Effective Field Theory (EFT) limit of string compactifications, and for the properties of Calabi-Yau manifolds. It opened up a new field in pure mathematics and was utilised in the area of enumerative geometry. Spinor-Vector Duality (SVD) is an extension of mirror symmetry. This can be readily understood in terms of the moduli of toroidal compactification of the heterotic string, which include the metric the antisymmetric tensor field and the Wilson line moduli. In terms of toroidal moduli, mirror symmetry corresponds to mappings of the internal space moduli, whereas spinor-vector duality corresponds to maps of the Wilson line moduli. In the past few of years, we demonstrated the existence of spinor-vector duality in the effective field theory compactifications of the string theories. This was achieved by starting with a worldsheet orbifold construction that exhibited spinor-vector duality and resolving the orbifold singularities, hence generating a smooth effective field theory limit with an imprint of the spinor-vector duality. Just like mirror symmetry, the spinor-vector duality can be used to study the properties of complex manifolds with vector bundles. Spinor--vector duality offers a top-down approach to the ``Swampland''-program, by exploring the imprint of the symmetries of the ultra-violet complete worldsheet string constructions in the effective field theory limit. The SVD suggests a demarcation line between (2,0) EFTs that possess an ultra-violet complete embedding versus those that do not.</description>

      <title>Self-Gravity Effects of Ultralight Boson Clouds Formed by Black Hole Superradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Oscillating clouds of ultralight bosons can grow around spinning black holes through superradiance, extracting energy and angular momentum, and eventually dissipating through gravitational radiation. Gravitational wave detectors like LIGO, Virgo, KAGRA, and LISA can thus probe the existence of ultralight bosons. In this study, we use fully general-relativistic solutions of the black hole-boson cloud systems to study the self-gravity effects of scalar and vector boson clouds, making only the simplifying assumption that the spacetime is axisymmetric (essentially corresponding to taking an oscillation average). We calculate the self-gravity shift in the cloud oscillation frequency, which determines the frequency evolution of the gravitational wave signal, finding that this effect can be up to twice as large in the relativistic regime compared to non-relativistic estimates. We use this to improve the superrad waveform model, and estimate that this reduces the theoretical phase error to a few cycles over the characteristic timescale of the gravitational wave emission timescale for the louder vector boson signals. We also perform an analysis of the spacetime geometry of these systems, calculating how the cloud changes the innermost stable circular orbit and light-ring around the black hole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify a new class of three-nucleon forces that arises in the low-energy effective theory of nuclear interactions including pions. We estimate their contribution to the energy of neutron and nuclear matter and find that it can be as important as the leading-order three-nucleon forces previously considered in the literature. The magnitude of this force is set by the strength of the coupling of pions to two nucleons and is presently not well constrained by experiments. The implications for nuclei, nuclear matter, and the equation of state of neutron matter are briefly discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Pierre Auger Observatory has revealed a significant challenge in air shower physics: a discrepancy between the simulated and observed muon content in cosmic-ray interactions, known as the 'Muon Puzzle'. This issue stems from a lack of understanding of high-energy hadronic interactions. Current state-of-the-art hadronic interaction models fall short, underscoring the need for improvements. In this contribution, we explore the integration of the Pythia 8 hadronic interaction model into air shower simulations. While Pythia 8 is primarily used in Large Hadron Collider experiments, recent advancements in its Angantyr module show promise in better describing hadron-nucleus interactions, making it a valuable tool for addressing the Muon Puzzle.</description>

      <title>Attosecond physics hidden in Cherenkov radiation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cherenkov radiation of charged particles moving with superluminal velocities in transparent media is a well-studied phenomenon with a plethora of applications. Its microscopic origins can be traced to the polarization of atomic shells, characterized by time scales in the subfemtosecond range - dynamics that eludes conventional macroscopic treatment. Here we present a theoretical framework for probing the intrinsic dynamics of Cherenkov radiation, unveiling quantum features absent in classical realm and even in a fully quantum theory in momentum space. These features include a finite formation length and spreading time of the photon, the latter becoming negative nearby the Cherenkov angle, a finite flash duration tied to the size of the electron packet, along with a shift in the photon arrival time that can be either positive or negative. The calculated time scales naturally lie in the attosecond range for relevant parameters, thereby linking this macroscopic phenomenon back to its atomic origins. Finally, we propose that by measuring the duration of the Cherenkov flash one can in principle retrieve the length of the emitting packet, deepening our understanding of quantum coherence effects in photon emission.</description>

      <title>Model-independent results on parity violation in the trace anomaly</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anomalous parity violation in four dimensions would be significant for phenomenology (baryogenesis, gravitational waves) and mathematical physics. Over the past decade, there has been a controversy in the literature as to whether free Weyl fermions give rise to (anomalous) parity violation in the trace of the energy momentum tensor; expressed by the Pontryagin densities $R\tilde R$ and $F\tilde F$ in the gravity and the gauge sector respectively. In Ref.$^1$, we have shown, using path integral methods, that the trace anomaly of a free Weyl fermion does not violate parity (i.e the absence of the Pontryagin density). In a subsequent work$^2$ we came to the stronger conclusion that for any theory compatible with dimensional regularisation, the Pontryagin-terms are equally absent. It is the \textit{finiteness} of the diffeomorphism, the Lorentz and the gauge anomalies that prevents anomalous parity violation.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes and Second-order Gravitational Waves in Axion-like Hybrid Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility that primordial black holes (PBHs) can be formed from large curvature perturbations generated during the waterfall phase transition in a hybrid inflation model driven by an axion-like particle (ALP) $\phi$. The model predicts a spectral index $n_s \simeq 0.964$ and a tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \simeq 0.003$, in agreement with Planck data and potentially testable by next generation cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments such as CMB-S4 and LiteBIRD. We find that the PBH mass and the peak of the associated scalar-induced gravitational wave (SIGW) spectrum are correlated with the ALP mass. In particular, PBHs in the mass range $10^{-13}\, M_\odot$ can constitute either the entire dark matter (DM) content of the universe or a significant fraction of it. The predicted second-order GWs from this mechanism are within the sensitivity reach of future observatories like LISA and ET. The typical reheating temperature in the model is around $10^6 - 10^7$ GeV is consistent with Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09160v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose to use the nuclear spin excitation in the ferromagnetic A1 phase of the superfluid $^3$He for the axion dark matter detection. This approach is striking in that it is sensitive to the axion-nucleon coupling, one of the most important features of the QCD axion introduced to solve the strong CP problem. We review a quantum mechanical description of the nuclear spin excitation and apply it to the estimation of the axion-induced spin excitation rate. We also describe a possible detection method of the spin excitation in detail and show that the combination of the squeezing of the final state with the Josephson parametric amplifier and the homodyne measurement can enhance the sensitivity. It turns out that this approach gives good sensitivity to the axion dark matter with the mass of $O(1) \, \mu \mathrm{eV}$ depending on the size of the external magnetic field. We estimate the parameters of experimental setups, e.g., the detector volume and the amplitude of squeezing, required to reach the QCD axion parameter space.</description>

      <title>Dark matter with exotic mediators: The diquark portal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we build out complete mediator sectors for models of frustrated dark matter (fDM), a new paradigm in which fermionic dark matter couples to the Standard Model (SM) through a scalar-fermionic mediator pair. The fDM paradigm allows great freedom in the charge assignments of the mediators: it accommodates any representation of the SM gauge group provided that the scalar and fermionic mediators have the same charges. In this paper, we write down all renormalizable models in which the mediator(s) make contact with the SM through pairs of quarks, a model space we refer to as the \emph{diquark portal}. The mediators in this portal may be singlets, triplets, sextets, or octets of the color group $\mathrm{SU}(3)_{\text{c}}$. The mediators may additionally be in non-trivial representations of the weak group $\mathrm{SU}(2)_{\text{L}}$, including doublet and triplet representations, depending on the mediators' color charge. In addition to writing the complete set of renormalizable Lagrangians, we categorize the general collider phenomenology of the models and discuss pair- and single-production LHC signatures of the mediator sectors.</description>

Abstract: The effect of finite coupling corrections to the Langevin diffusion coefficients on a moving heavy quark in the Super Yang-Mills plasma is investigated. These corrections are related to curvature squared corrections in the corresponding gravity sector. We compare the results of both longitudinal and perpendicular Langevin diffusion coefficients with those in $\mathcal{N}$=4 Super Yang-Mills plasma. It is observed that the curvature-squared corrections influence the Langevin diffusion coefficients, and the corrections for both Langevin diffusion coefficients demonstrate the dependence on the velocity of the moving heavy quark and the specifics of the higher derivative correction. In addition, we conduct calculations for the Langevin diffusion coefficients of a moving heavy quark within the Gauss-Bonnet background.</description>

We employ a Dark Matter simplified model that couples a scalar mediator with top quarks. The reconstruction of the kinematic variables is presented at NLO accuracy for events associated with this massive scalar particle, which is assumed to be vanishing to invisible decays in a detector such as ATLAS. We build these observables by taking advantage of the similarity between the scalar coupling with the top quark and the factorization theorem in the total scattering amplitude, in order to represent the basis in which the phase space is parameterized. A twofold approach employs the direct implementation of the four-momentum phase space measure in building CP sensitive observables such as $b_{2}$ for the Higgs, and the spin polarization of the top-quark decays in the narrow width approximation for the employed model. We studied the asymmetries of these distributions to test for any improvement in increasing the exclusion region for the $g_{u_{33}}^S-g_{u_{33}}^P$ parameters associated with this vanishing scalar particle. We have found no significant effect in the exclusion limits by using the forward-backward asymmetry distributions and the full-shaped ones. Considering the case of an invisible mediator with mass of 10$^{-2}$ GeV for a luminosity of 300 fb$^{-1}$ expected at the end of Run 3, the best limits for $g_{u_{33}}^S$ and $g_{u_{33}}^P$ at NLO accuracy were obtained using the variables ${\tilde{b}}_{2}^{\widehat{y}}$ and $b_{2}$ respectively, with corresponding limits set to $[-0.0425, 0.0425] $ and $[-0.83, 0.83]$ at $68\%$ CL.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop parameterizations of 8 of the lowest Born-Oppenheimer potentials for quarkonium hybrid mesons as functions of the separation $r$ of the static quark and antiquark sources. The parameters are determined by fitting results calculated using pure $SU(3)$ lattice gauge theory. The parameterizations have the correct limiting behavior at small $r$, where the potentials form multiplets associated with gluelumps. They have the correct limiting behavior at large $r$, where the potentials form multiplets associated with excitations of a relativistic string. There is a narrow avoided crossing in the small-$r$ region between two potentials with the same Born-Oppenheimer quantum numbers.</description>

      <title>Representation-theoretical characterization of canonical custodial symmetry in NHDM potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05085v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By considering the basis-covariant constituents of N-Higgs-doublet potentials, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for canonical SO(4)_C Custodial Symmetry (CS) of potentials with N&gt;2 doublets, based on representation-theoretical and geometrical relations. In essence, our characterization relates the presence of canonical CS to basis-covariant vectors corresponding to particular bases of the defining representation of the orthogonal Lie algebras. For N=3,4 and 5, the conditions demand little computational effort to be evaluated, and we provide practical algorithms that may be efficiently implemented in a computer program, for deciding whether or not a potential is custodial-symmetric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05752v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: All of the significant evidence for dark matter observed thus far has been through its gravitational interactions. After 40 years of direct detection experiments, the parameter space for Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) as dark matter candidates is rapidly approaching the neutrino floor. In this light, we consider a dark sector that is strongly decoupled from the visible sector, interacting exclusively through gravity. In this model, proposed by Freese and Winkler (arXiv:2302.11579), dark matter can be produced through a first-order phase transition in the dark sector dubbed the Dark Big Bang. In this study we fully determine the allowed region of parameter space for the tunneling potential that leads to the realization of a Dark Big Bang and is consistent with all experimental bounds available.</description>

      <title>All order factorization for virtual Compton scattering at next-to-leading power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss all-order factorization for the virtual Compton process at next-to-leading power (NLP) in the $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}/Q$ and $\sqrt{-t}/Q$ expansion (twist-3), both in the double-deeply-virtual case and the single-deeply-virtual case. We use the soft-collinear effective theory (SCET) as the main theoretical tool. We conclude that collinear factorization holds in the double-deeply virtual case, where both photons are far off-shell. The agreement is found with the known results for the hard matching coefficients at leading order $\alpha_s^0$, and we can therefore connect the traditional approach with SCET. In the single-deeply-virtual case, commonly called deeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS), the contribution of non-target collinear regions complicates the factorization. These include momentum modes collinear to the real photon and (ultra)soft interactions between the photon-collinear and target-collinear modes. However, such contributions appear only for the transversely polarized virtual photon at the NLP accuracy and in fact it is the only NLP $\sim (\Lambda_{\rm QCD}/Q)^1 \sim (\sqrt{-t}/Q)^1$ contribution in that case. We therefore conclude that the DVCS amplitude for a longitudinally polarized virtual photon, where the leading power $\sim (\Lambda_{\rm QCD}/Q)^0 \sim (\sqrt{-t}/Q)^0$ contribution vanishes, is free of non-target collinear contributions and the collinear factorization in terms of twist-3 GPDs holds in that case as well.</description>

      <title>The ground states of hidden-charm tetraquarks and their radial excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13826v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the great progress in the observations of charmonium-like states in recent years, we perform a systematic analysis about the ground states and the first radially excited states of $qc\bar{q}\bar{c}$ ($q$=$u/d$ and $s$) tetraquark systems. Their mass spectra, root mean square (r.m.s.) radii and radial density distributions are predicted within the framework of relativized quark model. By comparing with experimental data, some potential candidates for hidden-charm tetraquark states are suggested. For $qc\bar{q}\bar{c}$ ($q$=$u/d$) system, if $Z_{c}(3900)$ is supposed to be a compact tetraquark state with $J^{PC}=1^{+-}$, $Z(4430)$ can be interpreted as the first radially excited states of $Z_{c}(3900)$. Another broad structure $Z_{c}(4200)$ can also be explained as a partner of $Z_{c}(3900)$, and it arise from a higher state with $J^{PC}=1^{+-}$. In addition, theoretical predictions indicate that the possible assignments for $X(3930)$, $X(4050)$ and $X(4250)$ are low lying $0^{++}$ tetraquark states. As for the $sc\bar{s}\bar{c}$ system, $X(4140)$ and $X(4274)$ structures can be interpreted as this type of tetraquark states with $J^{PC}=1^{++}$, and $X(4350)$ can be described as a $sc\bar{s}\bar{c}$ tetraquark with $J^{PC}=0^{++}$. With regard to $qc\bar{s}\bar{c}$ ($q$=$u/d$) system, we find two potential candidates for this type of tetraquark, which are $Z_{cs}(4000)$ and $Z_{cs}(4220)$ structures. The measured masses of these two structures are in agreement with theoretical predictions for the $1^{+}$ state.</description>

Abstract: If a neutrino or antineutrino produced in the decay of an unstable particle is not entangled to its accompanying particles, its mass is necessarily correlated with its momentum. In this note, I illustrate this entanglement would destroy the quantum coherence between the neutrino's mass eigenstates in both the momentum and position representations, which was overlooked by other authors in previous investigations of entanglement and coherence associated with neutrino oscillations.</description>

      <title>Rapid identification of time-frequency domain gravitational wave signals from binary black holes using deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19003v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in deep learning techniques have offered an alternative and complementary approach to traditional matched filtering methods for the identification of gravitational wave (GW) signals. The rapid and accurate identification of GW signals is crucial for the progress of GW physics and multi-messenger astronomy, particularly in light of the upcoming fourth and fifth observing runs of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA. In this work, we use the 2D U-Net algorithm to identify the time-frequency domain GW signals from stellar-mass binary black hole (BBH) mergers. We simulate BBH mergers with component masses from 5 to 80 $M_{\odot}$ and account for the LIGO detector noise. We find that the GW events in the first and second observation runs could all be clearly and rapidly identified. For the third observing run, about $80\%$ GW events could be identified. In particular, GW190814, currently unknown, is a special case that can be identified by the network, while other binary neutron star mergers and neutron star-black hole mergers can not be identified. Compared to the traditional convolutional neural network, the U-Net algorithm can output the time-frequency domain signal images rather than probabilities, providing a more intuitive investigation. Moreover, some of the results through U-Net can provide preliminary inference on the chirp mass information. In conclusion, the U-Net algorithm can rapidly identify the time-frequency domain GW signals from BBH mergers and potentially be helpful for future parameter inferences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate quark-gluon plasma at nonzero density by using two holographic models for QCD based on either brane or Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton actions. We determine the parameters of these models through a systematic statistical fitting procedure to lattice QCD data, which encompasses the equation of state (through the entropy density) and the two lowest baryon number susceptibilities. The predictions from the two models for the higher-order susceptibilities and the equation of state at nonzero density are strikingly similar. In particular, both models suggest the presence of a critical point on the $(\mu_B,T)$-phase diagram near $\mu_B/T \approx 6$. The results for the equation of state are in agreement with lattice data for higher-order susceptibilities and experimental data for the cumulants of the net-proton number from the Beam Energy Scan program at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the decomposition of gauge-theory amplitudes into kinematic and color factors, the color factors (at a given loop order $L$) span a proper subspace of the extended trace space (which consists of single and multiple traces of generators of the gauge group, graded by powers of $N$). Using an iterative process, we systematically construct the $L$-loop color space of four-point amplitudes of fields in the adjoint representation of SU($N$), SO($N$), or Sp($N$). We define the null space as the orthogonal complement of the color space. For SU($N$), we confirm the existence of four independent null vectors (for $L \ge 2$) and for SO($N$) and Sp($N$), we establish the existence of seventeen independent null vectors (for $L \ge 5$). Each null vector corresponds to a group-theory constraint on the color-ordered amplitudes of the gauge theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13132v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate the S-matrix bootstrap analysis of theories with non-invertible symmetries in (1+1) dimensions. Our previous work showed that crossing symmetry of S-matrices in such theories is modified, with modification characterized by the fusion category data. By imposing unitarity, symmetry and the modified crossing, we constrain the space of consistent S-matrices, identifying integrable theories with non-invertible symmetries at the cusps of allowed regions. We also extend the modified crossing rules to cases where vacua transform in non-regular representations of fusion category, utilizing a connection to a dual category $\mathscr C^{*}_{\mathscr{M}}$ and Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT). This highlights the utility of SymTFT in the analysis of scattering amplitudes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a cutting rule for equal-time in-in correlators including cosmological correlators based on Keldysh $r/a$ basis, which decomposes diagrams into fully retarded functions and cut-propagators consisting of Wightman functions. Our derivation relies only on basic assumptions such as unitarity, locality, and the causal structure of the in-in formalism, and therefore holds for theories with arbitrary particle contents and local interactions at any loop order. As an application, we show that non-local cosmological collider signals arise solely from cut-propagators under the assumption of microcausality. Since the cut-propagators do not contain (anti-)time-ordering theta functions, the conformal time integrals are factorized, simplifying practical calculations.</description>

      <title>511 keV Galactic Photons from a Dark Matter Spike</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16379v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose that a dark matter (DM) spike around the Galactic Center's (GC) supermassive black hole, Sgr A*, could account for most of the bulge's measured 511 keV line intensity while remaining cosmologically compatible. DM annihilation can be the primary source of the 511 keV line emission without violating constraints from disk emission observations and in-flight positron annihilation with the interstellar medium, provided the disk emission is dominated by an astrophysical source of low-energy positrons. We find that a DM mass up to approximately 20 MeV, either with a Gondolo-Silk spike or one softened by stellar heating, could explain the observed 511 keV bulge emission profile. Our proposal can be tested by future observations of the continuum diffuse emission close to the GC.</description>
