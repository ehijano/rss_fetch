      <title>Observations of the 2024 May 14 X8.7 Solar Flare with the Goldstone-Apple Valley Radio Telescope (GAVRT)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Goldstone-Apple Valley Radio Telescope (GAVRT) project conducts a regular monitoring program of the Sun. The GAVRT Solar Patrol project uses a 34 m diameter antenna to produce raster-scan maps of the Sun simultaneously at 4 frequencies ranging from approximately 3 GHz to 14 GHz. On 2024 May 14, as part of regular GAVRT Solar Patrol observations, raster maps were produced when an X8.7 solar flare occurred in active region AR13664. Here we present the GAVRT maps of the May 14 flare along with microwave flux density spectra showing the non-thermal microwave burst emission from mildly relativistic electrons produced in this largest flare of Solar Cycle 25 to date. AR13664 reappeared as AR13697 and continued to be very active, producing X flares while GAVRT monitored its activity. GAVRT microwave data provide a powerful complement to the energetic electrons tracked by X-ray, millimeter-wave and {\gamma}-ray emissions.</description>

      <title>A non-accreting neutron star and $\delta$ Scuti candidate revealed by asteroseismological modelling and radial velocity measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SZ Lyn is an astrometric binary consisting of a $\delta$ Scuti star and an unseen component. The two stars around each other in an almost circular orbit (e=0.186) with a period of about 3.32 years. We aim to explore the physical properties of the two components using the radial velocity method and asteroseismology. Our results show that the $\delta$ Scuti variable is a post-main sequence star with a helium core ($M_{\rm He}$= 0.1671$^{+0.0028}_{-0.0045}$ M$_{\odot}$ and $R_{\rm He}$= 0.1414$^{+0.0035}_{-0.0020}$ R$_{\odot}$) surrounded by a burning hydrogen shell; its fundamental parameters is accurately calculated to be $M$=1.82$^{+0.04}_{-0.02}$ M$_{\odot}$, $R$=2.91$^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$ R$_{\odot}$, $L$=17.07$^{+1.28}_{-2.61}$ L$_{\odot}$, and $X_c$=0.078$^{+0.021}_{-0.004}$; the mass of the invisible object is thus estimated to be $M_{\rm co}$=1.68 $^{+0.62}_{-0.60}$ M$_{\odot}$. Combined with the low-resolution LAMOST spectrum, we suggest that the unseen object is an neutron star candidate. Our work demonstrates the methodology of using the radial velocity method and asteroseismology to detect the compact object in such an astrometric binary.</description>

      <title>A Markovian description of the multi-level source function and its application to the Lyman series in the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. We introduce a new method to calculate and interpret indirect transition rates populating atomic levels using Markov chain theory. Indirect transition rates are essential to evaluate interlocking in a multi-level source function, which quantifies all the processes that add and remove photons from a spectral line. A better understanding of the multi-level source function is central to interpret optically thick spectral line formation in stellar atmospheres, especially outside local thermodynamical equilibrium (LTE). Methods. We compute the level populations from a hydrogen model atom in statistical equilibrium, using the solar FALC model, a 1D static atmosphere. From the transition rates, we reconstruct the multi-level source function using our new method and compare it with existing methods to build the source function. We focus on the Lyman series lines and analyze the different contributions to the source functions and synthetic spectra. Results. Absorbing Markov chains can represent the level-ratio solution of the statistical equilibrium equation and can therefore be used to calculate the indirect transition rates between the upper and lower levels of an atomic transition. Our description of the multi-level source function allows a more physical interpretation of its individual terms, particularly a quantitative view of interlocking. For the Lyman lines in the FALC atmosphere, we find that interlocking becomes increasingly important with order in the series, with Ly-{\alpha} showing very little, but Ly-\b{eta} nearly 50% and Ly-{\gamma} about 60% contribution coming from interlocking. In some cases, this view seems opposed to the conventional wisdom that these lines are mostly scattering, and we discuss the reasons why.</description>

      <title>The variable stars in the field of the bulge cluster NGC 6558</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We made a survey of the variable stars in a $13.2 \times 13.2$ arcmin$^2$ centered on the field of the Galactic bulge cluster NGC 6558. A total of 78 variables was found in the field of the cluster. Many of these variables are included in the Catalogue of Variable Stars in Galactic Globular Clusters (Clement et al. 2001), OGLE or Gaia-DR3 data releases. A membership analysis based on the proper motions of Gaia-DR3 revealed that many of these variables do not belong to the cluster. We employed the data from the aforementioned surveys and our own data in the VI photometric system to estimate the periods, which along with the light curves morphology and position in a deferentially dereddened colour-magnitude diagram(CMD), help classifying the variable types. Two new member variables were found; an eclipsing binary (V18) and a semi-regular SR/L (V19). In the end we conclude that only 9 variables are likely cluster members. Member variables were used to discuss the mean metallicity and distance of the parental cluster and find the average values.</description>

      <title>The differences in the origination and properties of the near-Earth solar wind between solar cycles 23 and 24</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dependence of the sources and properties of the near-Earth solar wind on solar cycle activity is an important issue in solar and space physics. We use the improved two-step mapping procedure that takes into account the initial acceleration processes to trace the near-Earth solar winds back to their source regions from 1999 to 2020, covering solar cycles (SCs) 23 and 24. Then the solar wind is categorized into coronal hole (CH), active region (AR), and quiet Sun (QS) solar wind based on the source region types. We find that the proportions of CH and AR (QS) wind during SC 23 are higher (lower) than those during SC 24. During solar maximum and declining phases, the magnetic field strength, speed, helium abundance (AHe), and charge states of all three types of solar wind during SC 23 are generally higher than those during SC 24. During solar minimum, these parameters of solar wind are generally lower during SC 23 than those during SC 24. There is a significant decrease in the charge states of all three types of solar wind during the solar minimum of SC 23. The present statistical results demonstrate that the sources and properties of the solar wind are both influenced by solar cycle amplitude. The temperatures of AR, QS, and CH regions exhibit significant difference at low altitudes, whereas they are almost uniform at high altitudes.</description>

      <title>Runaway BN supergiant star HD 93840: Progenitor of an imminent core-collapse supernova above the Galactic plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantitative spectral analysis of the extreme nitrogen-enhanced supergiant HD 93840 (BN1 Ib) at an intermediate galactic latitude. Based on an optical high-resolution spectrum and complementary ultraviolet and infrared (spectro-)photometry, in addition to Gaia data, we carried out a full characterisation of the star's properties. We used both hydrostatic and unified (photosphere+wind) model atmospheres that account for deviations from local thermodynamic equilibrium. A highly unusual surface CNO-mixing signature and a marked stellar overluminosity compared to the mass imply a binary channel for the star's past evolution. The kinematics shows that it has reached its current position above the Galactic plane as a runaway star, likely ejected by the supernova explosion of its former companion star. Its current bulk composition, with a notably increased mean molecular weight due to core He- and progressed shell H-burning, suggests an advanced evolutionary stage. It is poised to yield a rare core-collapse supernova of a blue supergiant about ten OB star population scale heights above the Galactic disk relatively soon, contributing to the metal enrichment of the circumgalactic medium.</description>

      <title>Eight new 2+2 doubly eclipsing quadruple systems detected</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We studied eight new doubly eclipsing stellar systems. We found that they are all rare examples of quadruple systems of 2 + 2 architecture, where both inner pairs are eclipsing binaries. Until now, such a configuration had only been proven for dozens of systems on the whole sky. We enlarged this rare group of systems with four stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) galaxy and four brighter stars on the northern sky. These analysed systems are the following: OGLE SMC-ECL-2339 (both eclipsing periods of 0.72884 days and 3.39576 days; mutual orbital period of 5.95 years); OGLE SMC-ECL-3075 (1.35890 d, 2.41587 d, 9.75 yr); OGLE SMC-ECL-4756 (0.91773 d, 2.06047 d, 4.34 yr); OGLE SMC-ECL-6093 (0.90193 d, 2.03033 d, 31.2 yr); GSC 01949-01700 (0.24058 d, 0.75834 d, 21.7 yr); ZTF J171602.61+273606.5 (0.36001 d, 4.51545 d, 19.5 yr); WISE J210935.8+390501 (0.33228 d, 3.51575 d, 1.9 yr); and V597 And (0.46770 d, 0.35250, 20.4 yr). These systems constitute a rare selection of W UMa stars among the doubly eclipsing quadruples. For all of the systems, new dedicated observations were obtained as well. V597 And is definitely the most interesting system for several reasons: (1) the system is the brightest in our sample; (2) it is a rare quintuple (2 + 2) + 1 system; and (3) it is also closest to the Sun. It yielded the predicted angular separation of the two components of 57 mas, which is probably within the detection limits for modern, high-angular-resolution techniques.</description>

      <title>RIS: Regularized Imaging Spectroscopy for STIX on-board Solar Orbiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imaging spectroscopy, i.e., the generation of spatially resolved count spectra and of cubes of count maps at different energies, is one of the main goals of solar hard X-ray missions based on Fourier imaging. For these telescopes, so far imaging spectroscopy has been realized via the generation of either count maps independently reconstructed at the different energy channels, or electron flux maps reconstructed via deconvolution of the bremsstrahlung cross-section. Our aim is to introduce the Regularized Imaging Spectroscopy method (RIS), in which regularization implemented in the count space imposes a smoothing constraint across contiguous energy channels, without the need to deconvolve the bremsstrahlung effect. STIX records imaging data computing visibilities in the spatial frequency domain. Our RIS is a sequential scheme in which part of the information coded in the image reconstructed at a specific energy channel is transferred to the reconstruction process at a contiguous channel via visibility interpolation based on Variably Scaled Kernels. In the case of STIX visibilities recorded during the November 11, 2022 flaring event, we show that RIS is able to generate hard X-ray maps whose morphology smoothly evolves from one energy channel to the contiguous one, and that from these maps it is possible to infer spatially-resolved count spectra characterized by notable numerical stability. We also show that the performances of this approach are robust with respect to both the image reconstruction method and the count energy channel utilized to trigger the sequential process. RIS is appropriate to construct image cubes from STIX visibilities that are characterized by a smooth behavior across count energies, thus allowing the generation of numerically stable (and, thus, physically reliable) local count spectra.</description>

      <title>Towards characterising rocky worlds: Trends in chemical make-ups of M dwarfs versus GK dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elemental abundances of Sun-like stars are crucial for understanding the detailed properties of their planets. However, measuring elemental abundances in M stars is challenging due to their faintness and pervasive molecular features in optical spectra. To address this, elemental abundances of Sun-like stars have been proposed to constrain those of M stars by scaling [X/H] with measured [Fe/H]. This study tests the robustness of this practice using M- and GK-dwarf stellar abundances and rigorous statistical methods. We compile elemental abundances for 43 M dwarfs for 10 major rock-forming elements (Fe, C, O, Mg, Si, Al, Ca, Na, Ni, and Ti) from high-resolution near-infrared stellar surveys. We perform bootstrap-based linear regressions on the M dwarfs to determine the trends of [X/H] vs. [Fe/H] and compare them with GK dwarfs. A 2-sample, multivariate Mahalanobis Distance test is applied to assess the significance of differences in [X/H]--[Fe/H] trends for individual elemental pairs between M and GK dwarfs. The null hypothesis of no significant difference in chemical trends between M and GK dwarfs is strongly rejected for all elements except Si, for which rejection is marginal, and Na and Ni, for which results are inconclusive. This suggests that assuming no difference may lead to biased results and inaccurate constraints on rocky planets around M dwarfs. Therefore, it is crucial for both the stellar and exoplanet communities to recognise these differences. To better understand these differences, we advocate for dedicated modelling techniques for M dwarf atmospheres and more homogeneous abundance analyses. Our statistically constrained trends of [X/H]--[Fe/H] for M dwarfs offer a new constraint on estimating M-dwarf elemental abundances given measured [Fe/H], aiding in characterising the properties of M dwarf-hosted rocky worlds.</description>

      <title>Wind line variability and intrinsic errors in observational mass loss rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: UV wind line variability in OB stars appears to be universal. To quantify this variation and to estimate its effect on a mass loss rate determined from a single observation, we use the IUE archive to identify non-peculiar OB stars with well developed but unsaturated Si IV 1400 doublets and at least 10 independent observations. This resulted in 1699 spectra of 25 stars. We use SEI modelling to translate the profile variations into optical depth variations and, hence, variations in measured mass loss rates. These variations quantify the intrinsic error inherent in any mass loss rate derived from a single observation. The derived rates have an overall RMS variation of about 22%, but this differs with effective temperature, being as small at 8% for the hottest stars and up to 45% for the cooler ones. Furthermore, any single determination can differ from the mean by a factor of 2 or more. Our results also imply that mass loss rates determined from non-simultaneous observations (such as UV and ground based data) need not agree. We also use our results to examine the nature of the wind structures responsible for the variability. Our findings suggest that the optical depth variations result from optically very thick structures occulting more or less of the line of sight to the stellar disk. Further, the smaller optical depth variations in the hottest stars suggests that the responsible structures are disrupted in their more powerful winds.</description>

      <title>High-energy spectra of LTT 1445A and GJ 486 reveal flares and activity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The high-energy radiative output, from the X-ray to the ultraviolet, of exoplanet host stars drives photochemical reactions and mass loss in the upper regions of planetary atmospheres. In order to place constraints on the atmospheric properties of the three closest terrestrial exoplanets transiting M dwarfs, we observe the high-energy spectra of the host stars LTT1445A and GJ486 in the X-ray with XMM-Newton and Chandra and in the ultraviolet with HST/COS and STIS. We combine these observations with estimates of extreme ultraviolet flux, reconstructions of the Ly-a lines, and stellar models at optical and infrared wavelengths to produce panchromatic spectra from 1A--20um for each star. While LTT1445Ab, LTT1445Ac, and GJ486b do not possess primordial hydrogen-dominated atmospheres, we calculate that they are able to retain pure CO2 atmospheres if starting with 10, 15, and 50% of Earth's total CO2 budget, respectively, in the presence of their host stars' stellar wind. We use age-activity relationships to place lower limits of 2.2 and 6.6 Gyr on the ages of the host stars LTT1445A and GJ486. Despite both LTT1445A and GJ486 appearing inactive at optical wavelengths, we detect flares at ultraviolet and X-ray wavelengths for both stars. In particular, GJ486 exhibits two flares with absolute energies of 10^29.5 and 10^30.1 erg (equivalent durations of 4357+/-96 and 19724+/-169 s) occurring three hours apart, captured with HST/COS G130M. Based on the timing of the observations, we suggest that these high-energy flares are related and indicative of heightened flaring activity that lasts for a period of days, but our interpretations are limited by sparse time-sampling. Consistent high-energy monitoring is needed to determine the duration and extent of high-energy activity on individual M dwarfs, as well as the population as a whole.</description>

      <title>Formation of Wind-Fed Black Hole High-mass X-ray Binaries: The Role of Roche-lobe-Overflow Post Black-Hole Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The three dynamically confirmed wind-fed black hole high-mass X-ray binaries (BH-HMXBs) are suggested to all contain a highly spinning black hole (BH). However, based on the theories of efficient angular momentum transport inside the stars, we expect that the first-born BHs in binary systems should have low spins, which is consistent with gravitational-wave observations. As a result, the origin of the high BH spins measured in wind-fed BH-HMXBs remains a mystery. In this paper, we conduct a binary population synthesis study on wind-fed BH-HMXBs at solar metallicity with the use of the newly developed code POSYDON, considering three scenarios for BH accretion: Eddington-limited, moderately super-Eddington, and fully conservative accretion. Taking into account the conditions for accretion-disk formation, we find that regardless of the accretion model, these systems are more likely to have already experienced a phase of Roche-lobe overflow after the BH formation. To account for the extreme BH spins, highly conservative accretion onto BHs is required, when assuming the accreted material carries the specific angular momentum at the innermost stable orbit. Besides, in our simulations we found that the systems with donor stars within the mass range of $10-20\,M_{\odot}$ are prevalent, posing a challenge in explaining simultaneously all observed properties of the BH-HMXB in our Galaxy, Cygnus X-1, and potentially hinting that the accretion efficiency onto non-degenerate stars, before the formation of the BH, is also more conservative than assumed in our simulations.</description>

      <title>Particle acceleration at the bow shock of runaway star LS 2355: non-thermal radio emission but no $\gamma$-ray counterpart</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive stars that travel at supersonic speeds can create bow shocks as their stellar winds interact with the surrounding interstellar medium. These bow shocks - prominent sites for mechanical feedback of individual massive stars - are predominantly observed in the infrared band. Confirmed high-energy emission from stellar bow shocks has remained elusive and confirmed radio counterparts, while rising in recent years, remain rare. Here, we present an in-depth multi-wavelength exploration of the bow shock driven by LS 2355, focusing on its non-thermal properties. Using the most-recent Fermi source catalogue, we rule out its previously-proposed association with an unidentified $\gamma$-ray source. Furthermore, we use deep ASKAP observations from the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey and the Evolutionary Map of the Universe survey to identify a non-thermal radio counterpart: the third spectrally confirmed non-thermal bow shock counterpart after BD +43$^{\rm o}$ 3654 and BD +60$^{\rm o}$ 2522. We finally use WISE IR data and Gaia to study the surrounding ISM and update the motion of LS 2355. Specifically, we derive a substantially reduced stellar velocity, $v_* = 7.0\pm2.5$ km/s, compared to previous estimates. The observed non-thermal properties of the bow shock can be explained by an interaction between the wind of LS 2355 and a dense HII region, at a magnetic field close to the maximum magnetic field strength allowed by the compressibility of the ISM. Similar to earlier works, we find that the thermal radio emission of the shocked ISM is likely to be substantially suppressed for it to be consistent with the observed radio spectrum.</description>

      <title>Comet C/2012 S1 (ISON) crossing the Jupiter orbit</title>

Abstract: We report results of intensive time-resolved imaging photometry and synoptic deep imaging of the comet C/2012 S1 (ISON) performed in February 2013. The data were obtained at the Wise Observatory in Israel (WO), at the Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT) in India, and at the Polaris Observatory Association in California, USA. During this period, the comet's heliocentric distance changed from 4.9 to 4.6 AU, just within the orbit of Jupiter. We analyze these early images in an attempt to determine the nuclear rotation period, assuming that at these relatively large heliocentric distances it would be possible to detect the photometric modulation of a rotating nucleus against an underdeveloped coma. Since this is not evident in our February 2013 data, with more than 400 independent photometric measurements analyzed, we can only set upper limits of 0.05 mag for periodic brightness modulations. We discuss (and discount) a possible brightening event (minor outburst) that occurred on $15-16$ February 2013.
  We also present deep synoptic images of the comet, obtained by combining our exposures for each night, and analyze them. We find that during the period of our observations the comet exhibited a $\sim$$30^{\prime\prime}\simeq 60000$-km tail with no substructures visible and that this appearance did not change throughout our campaign.
  The comet, as indicated by a single spectroscopic measurement obtained during this observation period, showed a dust coma reflecting the solar light. Our observations indicate that during February 2013, comet ISON was relatively quiet, with the dust coma presumably hiding any light modulation by a spinning nucleus.</description>

      <title>Search for MeV Gamma-ray emission from TeV bright red dwarfs with COMPTEL</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The SHALON atmospheric Cherenkov telescope has detected very high energy gamma-ray emission at TeV energies from eight red dwarfs, namely, V388 Cas, V547 Cas, V780 Tau, V962 Tau, V1589 Cyg, GJ 1078, GJ 3684 and GL 851.1. Consequently, these red dwarfs have been suggested as sources of ultra-high energy cosmic rays. In this work, we search for soft gamma-ray emission from these TeV bright red dwarfs between 0.75-30 MeV using archival data from the COMPTEL gamma-ray imaging telescope, as a follow-up to a similar search for GeV gamma-ray emission using the Fermi-LAT telescope. Although, prima-facie, we detect non-zero photon flux from three red dwarfs with high significance, these signals can attributed to contamination from nearby sources such as Crab and Cygnus, which are within the angular resolution of COMPTEL, and have been previously detected as very bright point sources at MeV energies. Therefore, we could not detect any statistically significant signal ($&gt;3\sigma$) from any of these eight red dwarfs from 0.75-30 MeV. We then report the 95% confidence level upper limits on the differential photon flux (at 30 MeV), integral photon flux and integral energy flux for all of the eight red dwarfs. The integral energy flux limits range between $10^{-11}-10^{-10} \rm{ergs/cm^2/s}$.</description>

      <title>Direct observational evidence of multi-epoch massive star formation in G24.47+0.49</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using new continuum and molecular line data from the ALMA Three-millimeter Observations of Massive Star-forming Regions (ATOMS) survey and archival VLA, 4.86 GHz data, we present direct observational evidence of hierarchical triggering relating three epochs of massive star formation in a ring-like H II region, G24.47+0.49. We find from radio flux analysis that it is excited by a massive star(s) of spectral type O8.5V-O8V from the first epoch of star formation. The swept-up ionized ring structure shows evidence of secondary collapse, and within this ring a burst of massive star formation is observed in different evolutionary phases, which constitutes the second epoch. ATOMS spectral line (e.g., HCO$^+$(1-0)) observations reveal an outer concentric molecular gas ring expanding at a velocity of $\sim$ 9 $\rm km\,s^{-1}$, constituting the direct and unambiguous detection of an expanding molecular ring. It harbors twelve dense molecular cores with surface mass density greater than 0.05 $\rm g\,cm^{-2}$, a threshold typical of massive star formation. Half of them are found to be subvirial, and thus in gravitational collapse, making them third epoch of potential massive star-forming sites.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the rotational spectrum of CH$_3$$^{17}$OH and its tentative detection toward Sagittarius B2(N)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Methanol is an abundant molecule in space. The column density of CH$_3^{18}$OH is in some star-forming regions so high that the search for CH$_3^{17}$OH is promising. But only very few transition frequencies of CH$_3^{17}$OH with a microwave accuracy have been published thus far. We recorded the rotational spectrum of CH$_3^{17}$OH between 38 and 1095 GHz employing a methanol sample enriched in $^{17}$O to 20\%. A torsion-rotation Hamiltonian model based on the rho-axis method was employed to fit the data, as in our previous studies. We searched for rotational transitions of CH$_3^{17}$OH in the imaging spectral line survey ReMoCA obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) toward the high-mass star-forming region Sgr B2(N). The observed spectra were modeled under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). The assignments cover $0 \le J \le 45$, $K_a \le 16$, and mainly the $v_ t = 0$ and 1 torsional states. The Hamiltonian model describes our data well. The model was applied to derive a line list for radio-astronomical observations. We report a tentative detection of CH$_3^{17}$OH along with secure detections of the more abundant isotopologs of methanol toward Sgr B2(N2b). The derived column densities yield isotopic ratios $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C = 25, $^{16}$O/$^{18}$O = 240, and $^{18}$O/$^{17}$O = 3.3, which are consistent with values found earlier for other molecules in Sgr B2. The agreement between the $^{18}$O/$^{17}$O isotopic ratio that we obtained for methanol and the $^{18}$O/$^{17}$O ratios reported in the past for other molecules in Sgr B2(N) strongly supports our tentative interstellar identification of CH$_3^{17}$OH. The accuracy of the derived line list is sufficient for further radio astronomical searches for this methanol isotopolog toward other star-forming regions.</description>

      <title>Herschel Gould Belt Survey in Taurus. II: A census of dense cores and filaments in the TMC1 region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a catalogue of dense cores and filaments in a $3.8^{\circ}\times2.4^{\circ}$ field around the TMC1 region of the Taurus Molecular Cloud. The catalogue was created using photometric data from the Herschel SPIRE and PACS instruments in the 70 $\mu$m, 160 $\mu$m, 250 $\mu$m, 350 $\mu$m, and 500 $\mu$m continuum bands. Extended structure in the region was reconstructed from a Herschel column density map. Power spectra and PDFs of this structure are presented. The PDF splits into log-normal and power-law forms, with the high-density power-law component associated primarily with the central part of TMC1. The total mass in the mapped region is 2000 M$_\odot$, of which 34% is above an extinction of AV $\sim$ 3 mag -- a level that appears as a break in the PDF and as the minimum column density at which dense cores are found. A total of 35 dense filaments were extracted from the column density map. These have a characteristic FWHM width of 0.07 pc, but the TMC1 filament itself has a mean FWHM of $\sim$ 0.13 pc. The thermally supercritical filaments in the region are aligned orthogonal to the prevailing magnetic field direction. Derived properties for the supercritical TMC1 filament support the scenario of it being relatively young. A catalogue of 44 robust and candidate prestellar cores is created and is assessed to be complete down to 0.1 M$_\odot$. The combined prestellar CMF for the TMC1 and L1495 regions is well fit by a single log-normal distribution and is comparable to the standard IMF.</description>

      <title>New Radiative and Collisional Atomic Data for Sr {\sc ii} and Y {\sc ii} with application to Kilonova modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spectra of singly ionised Strontium and Yttrium (Sr {\sc ii} and Y {\sc ii}) have been proposed as identifications of certain spectral features in the AT2017gfo spectrum. With the growing demand for NLTE simulations of Kilonovae, there is a increasing need for atomic data for these and other $r$-process elements. Our goal is to expand upon the current set of atomic data for $r$-process elements, by presenting transition probabilities and Maxwellian-averaged effective collision strengths for Sr {\sc ii} and Y {\sc ii}. The Breit-Pauli and DARC $R$-matrix codes are employed to calculate the appropriate collision strengths, which are thermally averaged according to a Maxwellian distribution to calculate excitation and de-excitation rates. The {\sc tardis} and {\sc ColRadPy} packages are subsequently used to perform LTE and NLTE modelling respectively. A complete set of transition probabilities and effective collision strengths involving levels for Sr {\sc ii} and Y {\sc ii} have been calculated for temperature ranges compatible with kilonova plasma conditions. Forbidden transitions were found to disagree heavily with the Axelrod approximation, an approximation which is currently employed by other models within the literature. Theoretically important spectral lines are identified with both LTE and NLTE modelling codes. LTE simulations in {\sc tardis} reveal no new significant changes to the full synthetic spectra. NLTE simulations in {\sc ColRadPy} provide indications of which features are expected to be strong for a range of regimes, and we include luminosity estimates. Synthetic emission spectra over KNe densities and temperatures reveal potentially interesting spectral lines in the NIR.</description>

      <title>AtLAST Science Overview Report</title>

Abstract: Submillimeter and millimeter wavelengths provide a unique view of the Universe, from the gas and dust that fills and surrounds galaxies to the chromosphere of our own Sun. Current single-dish facilities have presented a tantalising view of the brightest (sub-)mm sources, and interferometers have provided the exquisite resolution necessary to analyse the details in small fields, but there are still many open questions that cannot be answered with current facilities. In this report we summarise the science that is guiding the design of the Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST). We demonstrate how tranformational advances in topics including star formation in high redshift galaxies, the diffuse circumgalactic medium, Galactic ecology, cometary compositions and solar flares motivate the need for a 50m, single-dish telescope with a 1-2 degree field of view and a new generation of highly multiplexed continuum and spectral cameras. AtLAST will have the resolution to drastically lower the confusion limit compared to current single-dish facilities, whilst also being able to rapidly map large areas of the sky and detect extended, diffuse structures. Its high sensitivity and large field of view will open up the field of submillimeter transient science by increasing the probability of serendipitous detections. Finally, the science cases listed here motivate the need for a highly flexible operations model capable of short observations of individual targets, large surveys, monitoring programmes, target of opportunity observations and coordinated observations with other observatories. AtLAST aims to be a sustainable, upgradeable, multipurpose facility that will deliver orders of magnitude increases in sensitivity and mapping speeds over current and planned submillimeter observatories.</description>

      <title>First detection of the $J_{-1}\rightarrow(J-$ 1)$_{0}-E$ methanol maser transitions at $J=7$ and $10$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Class\,I methanol masers provide sensitive information about the shocked environment around star-forming regions. Among the brightest Class~I methanol masers, we have those in the $J_{-1}\rightarrow(J-$ 1)$_{0}-E$ line series, currently reported for the $J=4-9$ transitions, with the only exception being the $J=7$ one at 181.295~GHz, and never expanded to higher $J$ transitions. We aim to search for population inversion in the $7_{-1}\rightarrow6_{0}-E$ and $10_{-1}\rightarrow9_{0}-E$ methanol transition lines at 181.295 and 326.961\,GHz, respectively, and also extend the number of known low-mass star-forming sources harboring Class\,I methanol masers. We employed the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX) 12\,m telescope to survey low-mass Galactic sources, focusing on methanol emission lines. We conducted rotation diagrams for all sources with detected $J=7$ methanol line transitions, while employing radiative transfer modeling (both in and out of local thermodynamic equilibrium) to characterize methanol excitation conditions in detail for one specific source with detected masers. We have detected the $7_{-1}\rightarrow6_{0}-E$ and $10_{-1}\rightarrow9_{0}-E$ methanol transitions in six out of nineteen sources. Among them, we firmly determined the $10_{-1}\rightarrow9_{0}-E$ maser nature in CARMA\,7, L1641N, NGC\,2024, and Serpens FIRS, and we claim for the presence of inverted population emission in the $7_{-1}\rightarrow6_{0}-E$ line toward CARMA\,7 and L1641N. This represents the first report of methanol maser emission in these particular transitions. Our study supports previous works indicating that conditions for Class\,I methanol maser emission are satisfied in low-mass star-forming regions and expands the range of detectable frequencies toward higher values.</description>

      <title>The Galactic Bulge exploration III.: Calcium Triplet Metallicities for RR Lyrae Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: RR Lyrae stars are excellent tracers of stellar populations for old, metal-poor components in the Milky Way Galaxy and the Local Group. Their luminosities have a metallicity-dependence, but determining spectroscopic [Fe/H] metallicities for RR Lyrae stars, especially at distances outside the solar neighbourhood, is challenging. Using 40 RRLs with metallicities derived from both Fe(II) and Fe(I) abundances, we verify the calibration between the [Fe/H] of RR Lyrae stars from the Calcium triplet. Our calibration is applied to all RR Lyrae stars with Gaia RVS spectra in Gaia DR3 as well as to 80 stars in the inner Galaxy from the BRAVA-RR survey. The co-added Gaia RVS RR Lyrae spectra provide RR Lyrae metallicities with an uncertainty of 0.25~dex, which is a factor of two improvement over the Gaia photometric RR Lyrae metallicities. Within our Galactic bulge RR Lyrae star sample, we find a dominant fraction with low energies without a prominent rotating component. Due to the large fraction of such stars, we interpret these stars as belonging to the $in-situ$ metal-poor Galactic bulge component, although we can not rule out that a fraction of these belong to an ancient accretion event such as Kraken/Heracles.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Synthesis of Magnetic Tornado: Co-spatial Incidence of Chromospheric Swirls and EUV Brightening</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic tornadoes, characterized as impulsive Alfven waves initiated by photospheric vortices in intergranular lanes, are considered efficient energy channels to the corona. Despite their acknowledged importance for solar coronal heating, their observational counterparts from the corona have not been well understood. To address this issue, we use a radiative MHD simulation of a coronal loop with footpoints rooted in the upper convection zone, and synthesize the chromospheric and coronal emissions corresponding to a magnetic tornado. Considering SDO/AIA 171 A and Solar Orbiter/EUI 174 A channels, our synthesis reveals that the coronal response to magnetic tornadoes can be observed as an EUV brightening of which width is ~2 Mm. This brightening is located above the synthesized chromospheric swirl observed in Ca II 8542 A, Ca II K, and Mg II k lines, which can be detected by instruments such as SST/CRISP, GST/FISS, and IRIS. Considering the height correspondence of the synthesized brightening, magnetic tornadoes can be an alternative mechanism for the small-scale EUV brightenings such as the solar "campfires''. Our findings indicate that coordinated observations encompassing the chromosphere to the corona are indispensable for comprehending the origin of coronal EUV brightenings.</description>

      <title>Optimized sampling of SDSS-IV MaStar spectra for stellar classification using supervised models</title>

Abstract: Supervised machine learning models are increasingly being used for solving the problem of stellar classification of spectroscopic data. However, training such models requires a large number of labelled instances, the collection of which is usually costly in both time and expertise. Active learning algorithms minimize training dataset sizes by keeping only the most informative instances. This paper explores the application of active learning to sampling stellar spectra using data from a highly class-imbalanced dataset. We utilize the MaStar library from the SDSS DR17 along with its associated stellar parameter catalogue. A preprocessing pipeline that includes feature selection, scaling, and dimensionality reduction is applied to the data. Using different active learning algorithms, we iteratively query instances, where the model or committee of models exhibits the highest uncertainty or disagreement, respectively. We assess the effectiveness of the sampling techniques by comparing several performance metrics of supervised-learning models trained on the queried samples with randomly-sampled counterparts. Evaluation metrics include specificity, sensitivity, and the area under the curve; in addition to the Matthew's correlation coefficient, which accounts for class imbalance. We apply this procedure to effective temperature, surface gravity, and iron metallicity, separately. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of active learning algorithms in selecting samples that produce performance metrics superior to random sampling and even stratified samples, with fewer training instances. Active learning is recommended for prioritizing instance labelling of astronomical-survey data by experts or crowdsourcing to mitigate the high time cost. Its effectiveness can be further exploited in selection of targets for follow-up observations in automated astronomical surveys.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical Parameter Inference on Accreting White Dwarf Binaries using Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accreting binary white dwarf systems are among the sources expected to emanate gravitational waves that the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will detect. We investigate how accurately the binary parameters may be measured from LISA observations. We complement previous studies by performing our parameter estimation on binaries containing a low-mass donor with a thick, hydrogen-rich envelope. The evolution is followed from the early, pre-period minimum stage, in which the donor is non-degenerate, to a later, post-period minimum stage with a largely degenerate donor. We present expressions for the gravitational wave amplitude, frequency, and frequency derivative in terms of white dwarf parameters (masses, donor radius, etc.), where binary evolution is driven by gravitational wave radiation and accretion torques, and the donor radius and logarithmic change in radius ($\eta_{\rm d}$) due to mass loss are treated as model parameters. We then perform a Fisher analysis to reveal the accuracy of parameter measurements, using models from Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) to estimate realistic fiducial values at which we evaluate the measurement errors. We find that the donor radius can be measured relatively well with LISA observations alone, while we can further measure the individual masses if we have an independent measurement of the luminosity distance from electromagnetic observations. When applied to the parameters of the recently-discovered white dwarf binary ZTF J0127+5258, our Fisher analysis suggests that we will be able to constrain the system's individual masses and donor radius using LISA's observations, given ZTF's measurement of the luminosity distance.</description>

      <title>Probing the Shock Breakout Signal of SN 2024ggi from the Transformation of Early Flash Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present early-time, hour-to-day cadence spectroscopy of the nearby type II supernova (SN II) 2024ggi, which was discovered at a phase when the SN shock just emerged from the red-supergiant (RSG) progenitor star. Over the first few days after the first light, SN 2024ggi exhibited prominent narrow emission lines formed through intense and persistent photoionization of the nearby circumstellar material (CSM). In the first 63 hours, spectral lines of He, C, N, and O revealed a rapid rise in ionization, as a result of the progressive sweeping-up of the CSM by the shock. The duration of the IIn-like spectra indicates a dense and relatively confined CSM distribution extending up to $\sim 4 \times 10^{14}$ cm. Spectral modeling reveals a CSM mass loss rate at this region exceeding $5 \times\, 10^{-3}${\rm M}_{\odot} yr$^{-1}$ is required to reproduce low-ionization emissions, which dramatically exceeds that of an RSG. Analyzing H$\alpha$ emission shift implies the velocity of the unshocked outer CSM to be between 20 and 40 km s$^{-1}$, matching the typical wind velocity of an RSG. The differences between the inner and outer layers of the CSM and an RSG progenitor highlight a complex mass loss history before the explosion of SN 2024ggi.</description>

      <title>Potential Flow Formulation of Parker's Unsteady Solar Wind Model and Nonlinear Stability Aspects Near the Parker Sonic Critical Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to present the first ever systematic theoretical formulation addressing the long-standing open issue of regularization of the singularity associated with the Parker sonic critical point in the linear perturbation problem for Parker's unsteady solar wind model. This is predicated on the necessity to go outside the framework of the linear perturbation problem and incorporate the dominant nonlinearities in this dynamical system. This is accomplished by constructing a whole new theoretical formulation of Parker's unsteady solar wind model based on the potential flow theory in ideal gas dynamics, which provides an appropriate optimal theoretical framework for this purpose. The stability of Parker's steady solar wind solution is shown to extend also to the neighborhood of the Parker sonic critical point by going to the concomitant nonlinear problem.</description>
