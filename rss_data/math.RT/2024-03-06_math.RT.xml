      <title>On the character tables of the finite reductive groups $E_6(q)_{\text{ad}}$ and ${^2\!E}_6(q)_{\text{ad}}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how the character tables of the groups $E_6(q)_{\text{ad}}$ and ${^2\!E}_6(q)_{\text{ad}}$ can be constructed, where $q$ is a power of~$2$. (Partial results are also obtained for the case where $q$ is a power of any prime $\neq 3$.) This is based on previous work by Hetz, Lusztig, Malle, Mizuno and Shoji, plus some computations using Michel's version of {\sf CHEVIE}. We also need some general results that are specific to groups where centralisers of semisimple elements are possibly not connected; this may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Kazhdan-Lusztig Correspondence for Vertex Operator Superalgebras from Abelian Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the Kazhdan-Lusztig correspondence for a class of vertex operator superalgebras which, via the work of Costello-Gaiotto, arise as boundary VOAs of topological B twist of 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ abelian gauge theories. This means that we show equivalences of braided tensor categories of modules of certain affine vertex superalgebras and corresponding quantum supergroups.
  We build on the work of Creutzig-Lentner-Rupert to this large class of VOAs and extend it since in our case the categories don't have projective objectives and objects can have arbitrary Jordan H\"older length.
  Our correspondence significantly improves the understanding of the braided tensor category of line defects associated to this class of TQFT, by realizing line defects as modules of a Hopf algebra. In the process, we prove a case of the conjecture of Semikhatov-Tipunin, relating logarithmic CFTs to Nichols algebras of screening operators.</description>

      <title>Binomial Coefficients and Littlewood--Richardson Coefficients for Interpolation Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inhomogeneous versions of Jack and Macdonald polynomials, called interpolation polynomials, have been introduced by Knop--Sahi (type $A$) and Okounkov (type $BC$). In this paper, we study binomial coefficients and Littlewood--Richardson (LR) coefficients for these interpolation polynomials. We extend to type $BC$ the weighted sum formula for binomial coefficients due to the second author in type $A$, and obtain a new weighted sum formula for LR coefficients for both types $A$ and $BC$. We prove that binomial coefficients are positive and monotone using the weighted sum formula and the combinatorial formulas due to Okounkov. As an application, we show that the containment partial order can be characterized in terms of Schur positivity or Jack positivity. This result is in parallel with the work of Cuttler--Greene--Skandera, Sra and Khare--Tao, which characterize two other partial orders, majorization and weak majorization, in terms of evaluation positivity of Schur functions.</description>

      <title>Subalgebras of Lie algebras. Example of sl(3,R) revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Revisiting the results by Winternitz [Symmetry in physics, CRM Proc. Lecture Notes 34, American Mathematical Society, Providence, RI, 2004, pp. 215-227], we thoroughly refine his classification of Lie subalgebras of the real order-three special linear Lie algebra and thus present the correct version of this classification for the first time. A similar classification over the complex numbers is also carried out. We follow the general approach by Patera, Winternitz and Zassenhaus but in addition enhance it and rigorously prove its theoretical basis for the required specific cases of classifying subalgebras of real or complex finite-dimensional Lie algebras. As a byproduct, we first construct complete lists of inequivalent subalgebras of the rank-two affine Lie algebra over both the real and complex fields.</description>

      <title>The Character Triple Conjecture for maximal defect characters and the prime 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that Sp\"ath's Character Triple Conjecture holds for every finite group with respect to maximal defect characters at the prime 2. This is done by reducing the maximal defect case of the conjecture to the so-called inductive Alperin-McKay condition whose verification has recently been completed by Ruhstorfer for the prime 2. As a consequence we obtain the Character Triple Conjecture for all 2-blocks with abelian defect groups by applying Brauer's Height Zero Conjecture, a proof of which is now available. We also obtain similar results for the block-free version of the Character Triple Conjecture at any prime p.</description>

      <title>The sign of linear periods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a group with subgroup $H$, and let $(\pi,V)$ be a complex representation of $G$. The natural action of the normalizer $N$ of $H$ in $G$ on the space $\mathrm{Hom}_H(\pi,\mathbb{C})$ of $H$-invariant linear forms on $V$, provides a representation $\chi_{\pi}$ of $N$ trivial on $H$, which is a character when $\mathrm{Hom}_H(\pi,\mathbb{C})$ is one dimensional. If moreover $G$ is a reductive group over a $p$-adic field, and $\pi$ is smooth irreducible, it is an interesting problem to express $\chi_{\pi}$ in terms of the possibly conjectural Langlands parameter $\phi_\pi$ of $\pi$. In this paper we consider the following situation: $G=\mathrm{GL}_m(D)$ for $D$ a central division algebra of dimension $d^2$ over a $p$-adic field $F$, $H$ is the centralizer of a non central element $\delta\in G$ such that $\delta^2$ is in the center of $G$, and $\pi$ has generic Jacquet-Langlands transfer to $\mathrm{GL}_{md}(F)$. In this setting the space $\mathrm{Hom}_H(\pi,\mathbb{C})$ is at most one dimensional. When $\mathrm{Hom}_H(\pi,\mathbb{C})\simeq \mathbb{C}$ and $H\neq N$, we prove that the value of the $\chi_{\pi}$ on the non trivial class of $\frac{N}{H}$ is $(-1)^m\epsilon(\phi_\pi)$ where $\epsilon(\phi_\pi)$ is the root number of $\phi_{\pi}$. Along the way we extend many useful multiplicity one results for linear and Shalika models to the case of non split $G$, and we also classify standard modules with linear periods and Shalika models, which are new results even when $D=F$.</description>

      <title>Reflective obstructions of unitary modular varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.01128v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To prove that a modular variety is of general type, there are three types of obstructions: reflective, cusp and elliptic obstructions. In this paper, we give a quantitative estimate of the reflective obstructions for the unitary case. This shows in particular that the reflective obstructions are small enough in higher dimension, say greater than $138$. Our result reduces the study of the Kodaira dimension of unitary modular varieties to the construction of a cusp form of small weight in a quantitative manner. As a byproduct, we formulate and partially prove the finiteness of Hermitian lattices admitting reflective modular forms, which is a unitary analog of the conjecture by Gritsenko-Nikulin in the orthogonal case. Our estimate of the reflective obstructions uses Prasad's volume formula.</description>

      <title>On the bottleneck stability of rank decompositions of multi-parameter persistence modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.00300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.00300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A significant part of modern topological data analysis is concerned with the design and study of algebraic invariants of poset representations -- often referred to as multi-parameter persistence modules. One such invariant is the minimal rank decomposition, which encodes the ranks of all the structure morphisms of the persistence module by a single ordered pair of rectangle-decomposable modules, interpreted as a signed barcode. This signed barcode generalizes the concept of persistence barcode from one-parameter persistence to any number of parameters, raising the question of its bottleneck stability. We show in this paper that the minimal rank decomposition is not stable under the natural notion of signed bottleneck matching between signed barcodes. We remedy this by turning our focus to the rank exact decomposition, a related signed barcode induced by the minimal projective resolution of the module relative to the so-called rank exact structure, which we prove to be bottleneck stable under signed matchings. As part of our proof, we obtain two intermediate results of independent interest: we compute the global dimension of the rank exact structure on the category of finitely presentable multi-parameter persistence modules, and we prove a bottleneck stability result for hook-decomposable modules. We also give a bound for the size of the rank exact decomposition that is polynomial in the size of the usual minimal projective resolution, we prove a universality result for the dissimilarity function induced by the notion of signed matching, and we compute, in the two-parameter case, the global dimension of a different exact structure related to the upsets of the indexing poset. This set of results combines concepts from topological data analysis and from the representation theory of posets, and we believe is relevant to both areas.</description>

      <title>Linking numbers of modular knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.05957v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The modular group PSL(2;Z) acts on the hyperbolic plane HP with quotient the modular surface M, whose unit tangent bundle U is a 3-manifold homeomorphic to the complement of the trefoil knot in the 3-sphere. The hyperbolic conjugacy classes of PSL(2;Z) correspond to the closed oriented geodesics in M. Those lift to the periodic orbits for the geodesic flow in U, which define the modular knots. The linking numbers between modular knots and the trefoil is well understood. Indeed, Etienne Ghys showed in 2006 that they are given by the Rademacher invariant of the corresponding conjugacy classes. The Rademacher function is a homogeneous quasi-morphism of PSL(2;Z) which he had recognised with Jean Barge in 1992 as half the primitive of the bounded euler class. This shed light on the 1987 work of Michael Atiyah concerning the logarithm of the Dedekind eta function which identified it with no less than that six other important functions appearing in diverse areas of mathematics. We are concerned with the linking numbers between modular knots and derive several formulae with arithmetical, combinatorial, topological and group theoretical flavours. In particular we associate to a pair of modular knots a function defined on the character variety of PSL(2;Z), whose limit at the boundary point recovers their linking number. Moreover, we show that the linking number with a modular knot minus that with its inverse yields a homogeneous quasi-morphism on the modular group, and how to extract a free basis out of these. For this we prove that the linking pairing is non degenerate.</description>

      <title>Recipes to compute the algebraic K-theory of Hecke algebras of reductive p-adic groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.01510v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the algebraic K-theory of the Hecke algebra of a reductive p-adic group G using the fact that the Farrell-Jones Conjecture is known in this context. The main tool will be the properties of the associated Bruhat-Tits building and an equivariant Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence. In particular the projective class group can be written as the colimit of the projective class groups of the compact open subgroups of G.</description>

      <title>Geometric Positivity of the Fusion Products of Unitary Vertex Operator Algebra Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A unitary and strongly rational vertex operator algebra (VOA) $V$ is called strongly unitary if all irreducible $V$-modules are unitarizable. A strongly unitary VOA $V$ is called completely unitary if for each unitary $V$-modules $W_1$, $W_2$ the canonical nondegenerate Hermitian form on the fusion product $W_1\boxtimes W_2$ is positive. It is known that if $V$ is completely unitary, then the modular category of unitary $V$-modules is unitary [Gui19b], and all simple VOA extensions of V are automatically unitary and moreover completely unitary [Gui22, CGGH23].
  In this paper, we give a geometric characterization of the positivity of the Hermitian product on $W_1$ and $W_2$, which helps us prove that the positivity is always true when the fusion product $W_1\boxtimes W_2$ is an irreducible and unitarizable $V$-module. We give several applications: (1) We show that if $V$ is a unitary (strongly rational) holomorphic VOA with a finite cyclic unitary automorphism group $G$, and if $V^G$ is strongly unitary, then $V^G$ is completely unitary. This result applies to the cyclic permutation orbifolds of unitary holomophic VOAs. (2) We show that if $V$ is unitary and strongly rational, and if $U$ is a simple current extension which is unitarizable as a $V$-module, then $U$ is a unitary VOA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17837v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose two families of relative trace formula comparisons in the study of relative Langlands duality conjectured by Ben-Zvi--Sakellaridis--Venkatesh. This allows us to incorporate numerous relative trace formula comparisons studied during the last four decades under the BZSV duality framework. For the proposed relative trace formula comparisons associated to some strongly tempered spherical varieties, we will prove the fundamental lemma and smooth transfer in the $p$-adic case. Moreover, inspired by the BZSV duality conjecture, we propose a conjecture regarding the degenerate Whittaker period, which generalizes Lapid-Mao's conjecture of the Whittaker period</description>

Abstract: This research comprehensively describes the transversally H-elliptic operators and investigates the index theorem of H-elliptic and transversally H-elliptic operators from the perspective of $KK$-theory, applying Kasparov's methodology. Moreover, the analysis methodically examines specific conditions, with a focus on the Fourier transform of the nilpotent group $C^{\ast}$-algebra. The findings demonstrate enhanced methods for analyzing the hypoellipticity of operators, presenting a robust framework for defining and understanding transversal H-ellipticity in a $KK$-theoretic context. This work provides a solid foundation for future research into the properties of differential operators in complex manifolds.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behavior for twisted traces of self-dual and conjugate self-dual representations of $\mathrm{GL}_n$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the asymptotic behavior of the sum of twisted traces of self-dual or conjugate self-dual discrete automorphic representations of $\mathrm{GL}_n$ for the level aspect of principal congruence subgroups under some conditions. Our asymptotic formula is derived from the Arthur twisted trace formula, and it is regarded as a twisted version of limit multiplicity formula on Lie groups. We determine the main terms for the asymptotic behavior under different conditions, and also obtain explicit forms of their Fourier transforms, which correspond to endoscopic lifts from classical groups. Its main application is the self-dual (resp. conjugate self-dual) globalization of local self-dual (resp. conjugate self-dual) representations of $\mathrm{GL}_n$. We further derive an automorphic density theorem for conjugate self-dual representations of $\mathrm{GL}_n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Affine cluster varieties are covered up to codimension 2 by open algebraic tori. We put forth a general conjecture (based on earlier conversation between Vivek Shende and the last author) characterizing their deep locus, i.e. the complement of all cluster charts, as the locus of points with non-trivial stabilizer under the action of cluster automorphisms. We use the diagrammatics of Demazure weaves to verify the conjecture for skew-symmetric cluster varieties of finite cluster type with arbitrary choice of frozens and for the top open positroid strata of Grassmannians $\mathrm{Gr}(2,n)$ and $\mathrm{Gr}(3,n)$. We illustrate how this already has applications in symplectic topology and mirror symmetry, by proving that the Fukaya category of Grassmannians $\mathrm{Gr}(2,2n+1)$ is split-generated by finitely many Lagrangian tori, and homological mirror symmetry holds with a Landau--Ginzburg model proposed by Rietsch. Finally, we study the geometry of the deep locus, and find that it can be singular and have several irreducible components of different dimensions, but they all are again cluster varieties in our examples in really full rank cases.</description>
