      <title>Pruning for Improved ADC Efficiency in Crossbar-based Analog In-memory Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning has proved successful in many applications but suffers from high computational demands and requires custom accelerators for deployment. Crossbar-based analog in-memory architectures are attractive for acceleration of deep neural networks (DNN), due to their high data reuse and high efficiency enabled by combining storage and computation in memory. However, they require analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) to communicate crossbar outputs. ADCs consume a significant portion of energy and area of every crossbar processing unit, thus diminishing the potential efficiency benefits. Pruning is a well-studied technique to improve the efficiency of DNNs but requires modifications to be effective for crossbars. In this paper, we motivate crossbar-attuned pruning to target ADC-specific inefficiencies. This is achieved by identifying three key properties (dubbed D.U.B.) that induce sparsity that can be utilized to reduce ADC energy without sacrificing accuracy. The first property ensures that sparsity translates effectively to hardware efficiency by restricting sparsity levels to Discrete powers of 2. The other 2 properties encourage columns in the same crossbar to achieve both Unstructured and Balanced sparsity in order to amortize the accuracy drop. The desired D.U.B. sparsity is then achieved by regularizing the variance of $L_{0}$ norms of neighboring columns within the same crossbar. Our proposed implementation allows it to be directly used in end-to-end gradient-based training. We apply the proposed algorithm to convolutional layers of VGG11 and ResNet18 models, trained on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, and achieve up to 7.13x and 1.27x improvement, respectively, in ADC energy with less than 1% drop in accuracy.</description>

      <title>A Fully Automated Platform for Evaluating ReRAM Crossbars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resistive Random Access Memory (ReRAM) is a promising candidate for implementing Computing-in-Memory (CIM) architectures and neuromorphic circuits. ReRAM cells exhibit significant variability across different memristive devices and cycles, necessitating further improvements in the areas of devices, algorithms, and applications. To achieve this, understanding the stochastic behavior of the different ReRAM technologies is essential. The NeuroBreakoutBoard (NBB) is a versatile instrumentation platform to characterize Non-Volatile Memories (NVMs). However, the NBB itself does not provide any functionality in the form of software or a controller. In this paper, we present a control board for the NBB able to perform reliability assessments of 1T1R ReRAM crossbars. In more detail, an interface that allows a host PC to communicate with the NBB via the new control board is implemented. In a case study, we analyze the Cycle-to-Cycle (C2C) variation and read disturb TiN/Ti/HfO2/TiN cells for different read voltages to gain an understanding of their operational behavior.</description>

      <title>AltGraph: Redesigning Quantum Circuits Using Generative Graph Models for Efficient Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum circuit transformation aims to produce equivalent circuits while optimizing for various aspects such as circuit depth, gate count, and compatibility with modern Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. There are two techniques for circuit transformation. The first is a rule-based approach that greedily cancels out pairs of gates that equate to the identity unitary operation. Rule-based approaches are used in quantum compilers such as Qiskit, tket, and Quilc. The second is a search-based approach that tries to find an equivalent quantum circuit by exploring the quantum circuits search space. Search-based approaches typically rely on machine learning techniques such as generative models and Reinforcement Learning (RL). In this work, we propose AltGraph, a novel search-based circuit transformation approach that generates equivalent quantum circuits using existing generative graph models. We use three main graph models: DAG Variational Autoencoder (D-VAE) with two variants: Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), and Deep Generative Model for Graphs (DeepGMG) that take a Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG) of the quantum circuit as input and output a new DAG from which we reconstruct the equivalent quantum circuit. Next, we perturb the latent space to generate equivalent quantum circuits some of which may be more compatible with the hardware coupling map and/or enable better optimization leading to reduced gate count and circuit depth. AltGraph achieves on average a 37.55% reduction in the number of gates and a 37.75% reduction in the circuit depth post-transpiling compared to the original transpiled circuit with only 0.0074 Mean Squared Error (MSE) in the density matrix.</description>

      <title>Fast Iterative Configuration of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces in mmWave Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are a promising solution to improve the coverage of cellular networks, thanks to their ability to steer impinging signals in desired directions. However, they introduce an overhead in the communication process since the optimal configuration of a RIS depends on the channels to and from the RIS, which must be estimated. In this paper, we propose a novel fast iterative configuration (FIC) protocol to determine the optimal RIS configuration that exploits the small number of paths of millimetre-wave (mmWave) channels and an adaptive choice of the explored RIS configurations. In particular, we split the elements of the RIS into a number of subsets equal to the number of channel taps. For each subset, then an iterative procedure finds at each iteration the optimal RIS configuration in a codebook exploring a two-dimensional grid of possible angles of arrival and departure of the path at the RIS. Over the iterations, the grid is made finer around the point identified in previous iterations. Numerical results obtained using an urban channel model confirm that the proposed solution is fast and provides a configuration close to the optimal in a shorter time than other existing approaches.</description>

      <title>QCEDA: Using Quantum Computers for EDA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The field of Electronic Design Automation (EDA) is crucial for microelectronics, but the increasing complexity of Integrated Circuits (ICs) poses challenges for conventional EDA: Corresponding problems are often NP-hard and are therefore in general solved by heuristics, not guaranteeing optimal solutions. Quantum computers may offer better solutions due to their potential for optimization through entanglement, superposition, and interference. Most of the works in the area of EDA and quantum computers focus on how to use EDA for building quantum circuits. However, almost no research focuses on exploiting quantum computers for solving EDA problems. Therefore, this paper investigates the feasibility and potential of quantum computing for a typical EDA optimization problem broken down to the Min-$k$-Union problem. The problem is mathematically transformed into a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, which was successfully solved on an IBM quantum computer and a D-Wave quantum annealer.</description>

      <title>Lightweight, error-tolerant edge detection using memristor-enabled stochastic logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The demand for efficient edge vision has spurred the interest in developing stochastic computing approaches for performing image processing tasks. Memristors with inherent stochasticity readily introduce probability into the computations and thus enable stochastic image processing computations. Here, we present a stochastic computing approach for edge detection, a fundamental image processing technique, facilitated with memristor-enabled stochastic logics. Specifically, we integrate the memristors with logic circuits and harness the stochasticity from the memristors to realize compact stochastic logics for stochastic number encoding and processing. The stochastic numbers, exhibiting well-regulated probabilities and correlations, can be processed to perform logic operations with statistical probabilities. This can facilitate lightweight stochastic edge detection for edge visual scenarios characterized with high-level noise errors. As a practical demonstration, we implement a hardware stochastic Roberts cross operator using the stochastic logics, and prove its exceptional edge detection performance, remarkably, with 95% less computational cost while withstanding 50% bit-flip errors. The results underscore the great potential of our stochastic edge detection approach in developing lightweight, error-tolerant edge vision hardware and systems for autonomous driving, virtual/augmented reality, medical imaging diagnosis, industrial automation, and beyond.</description>
