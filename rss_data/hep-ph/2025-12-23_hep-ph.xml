      <title>Landscapes at Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theories with a large number of long-lived metastable vacua are our only concrete explanation for the puzzling value of the Cosmological Constant (CC). The energy scales where these vacua are realized are unknown. In this work, we consider the possibility that a sector of this landscape of vacua is within experimental reach and discuss its signatures at colliders. We find that striking large-multiplicity final states might have gone undetected due to their relatively small total energy. In particular, this could lead to new exotic Higgs decays, which are both intriguing and challenging to search for. In addition to a general phenomenological analysis of these theories, we also discuss an explicit model where the small values of the CC and the Higgs mass are jointly explained by Weinberg's anthropic argument and a low energy landscape.</description>

      <title>A Numerical Method for the Efficient Calculation of Scattering Form Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scintillating molecular crystals have emerged as prime candidates for directional dark matter detector targets. This anisotropy makes them exquisitely sensitive due to the daily modulation induced by the directional dark matter wind. However, predicting the interaction rate for arbitrary molecules requires accurate modeling of the many-body ground as well as excited states, a task that has been historically computationally expensive. Here, we present a theory and computational framework for efficiently computing dark matter scattering form factors for molecules. We introduce SCarFFF, a GPU-accelerated code to compute the fully three-dimensional anisotropic molecular form factor for arbitrary molecules. We use a full time-dependent density functional theory framework to compute the lowest-lying singlet excited states, adopting the B3YLP exchange functional and a double-zeta Gaussian basis set. Once the many-body electronic structure is computed, the form factors are computed in a small fraction of the time from the transition density matrix. We show that ScarFFF can compute the first 12 form factors for a molecule of 10 heavy atoms in approximately 5 seconds, opening the door to accurate, high-throughput material screening for optimal directional dark matter detector targets. Our code can perform the calculation in three independent ways, two semi-analytical and one fully numeric, providing optimised methods for every precision goal.</description>

      <title>A formalism for constructing the QCD power spectrum with finite sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress in the study of QCD phenomena with energy correlators motivates novel approaches to explore the information contained in the QCD radiation spectrum. Fox-Wolfram moments are a set of observables that characterize the angular distribution of energy flow in high-energy collisions. Contrary to their conventional application, they are a class of correlated moments that cannot be reduced to one or several characteristic ones. We present a formalism to extract their fully correlated information content, while systematically discarding small-angle sampling noise, on an event-by-event basis. We show that our approach circumvents a common misspecification of the data in terms of $\delta$-distributions, and is essential in keeping the power spectrum infrared and collinear safe. Our formalism introduces a means of accounting for the varying spatial extent of objects that enter the calculation of the power spectrum, with which experimental artifacts such as detector element geometries and measurement uncertainties can readily be incorporated.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of deep inelastic scattering in the Schwinger model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hadronic tensors encode the nonperturbative structure of hadrons probed in deep inelastic scattering (DIS), yet their direct evaluation requires real-time evolution that presents a challenge for traditional Euclidean lattice approaches. In this work, we present the first study of the hadronic tensors in DIS using quantum simulation in the Schwinger model, i.e (1+1)-dimensional QED. Using two complementary quantum-simulation strategies -- quantum-circuit and tensor-network methods -- we compute the real-time current-current correlator directly on the lattice and validate our results against exact diagonalization where applicable. From this correlator, we compute the hadronic tensor and determine the longitudinal structure function, the sole nonvanishing DIS observable in two space-time dimensions. Our study demonstrates that quantum simulation offers a viable complementary pathway towards the evaluation of real-time observables relevant for hadronic structure. It also provides a foundation for extending the calculations from Schwinger model to other gauge theories.</description>

      <title>New Multi-messenger Probe of Dark Matter-Nucleon Interactions from Ultra-high Energy Cosmic Ray Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been suggested that the density of dark matter (DM) halo can be highly enhanced around supermassive black holes at the centers of massive galaxies. If real, these DM \emph{spikes} would offer new opportunities to probe the properties of DM. In this work, we point out that DM spikes can significantly impact the composition and survivability of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays accelerated near supermassive black holes. A large DM-nucleon cross section would fragment heavy nuclei into lighter elements and prevent them from attaining the energies observed at Earth. While the origin of cosmic rays remains a mystery, we show that if the highest-energy cosmic rays on Earth come from sources like NGC1068, then cross sections of size $\sigma_{\chi p} \leq 3 \times 10^{-34} \left( \frac{m_\chi}{\mathrm{GeV}}\right)\;\mathrm{cm^{2}}$ would be excluded by cosmic ray data. These bounds can be competitive with other existing probes in the DM mass region $m_\chi\in [5\;\mathrm{MeV}, 50\;\mathrm{MeV}]$. While the uncertainties on the acceleration mechanism of cosmic rays prevent us from setting robust limits, our study highlights an important connection between DM spikes and cosmic ray physics that is complementary to existing cosmological and direct detection constraints.</description>

      <title>Cross section and parametrization of charmonium decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The parametrization forms of charmonium quasi two body decays are discussed in detail in this paper. The symmetry analysis and magnetic transition description are utilized to provide the multi-aspect comprehension of the decay dynamics, including the meson mixing angle, form factor, and $SU(3)$ symmetry breading effect. As the prerequisite, the electromagnetic cross sections involving scalar and pseudoscalar, are calculated for eight final states based on the approach of current algebra. Moreover, the mathematical manipulations of calculation for four kinds of final states are spelled out to illuminate the technique strategy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A study of the retardation contributions to the hadronic quark interaction is performed in the coordinate space elaborating a classical electrodynamics procedure. The possibility of constructing a corresponding quantum operator is critically analyzed also performing some numerical matrix element calculations. A comparison of the model with the Feynman diagram calculation at tree level is studied, showing a substantial physical correspondence of the two models.</description>

      <title>Ultralight dark matter search in a large liquid scintillator detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of dark matter remains one of the most profound mysteries in modern physics. In this work, we investigate the phenomenological implications of ultralight scalar dark matter (ULDM) coupled to neutrinos. We focus on a large homogeneous liquid scintillator detector, analyzing the regime where ULDM oscillations lead to time-averaged distortions in neutrino oscillation probabilities. We derive sensitivity limits on the modulation parameters $\eta_{\Delta_{21}}$ and $\eta_{\Delta_{31}}$, which quantify ULDM-induced smearing effect in oscillations driven by solar ($\Delta m^2_{21}$) and atmospheric ($\Delta m^2_{31}$) mass-squared differences. We further demonstrate that ULDM interactions could produce a mild impact on both the determinations of the neutrino oscillation parameters and the neutrino mass ordering sensitivity. These results showcase the benefits of a large liquid scintillator detector as a powerful probe of neutrino-ULDM interactions via neutrino oscillations.</description>

      <title>High-Energy Pion Scattering in Holographic QCD: A Comparison with Experimental Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following Polchinski and Strassler [1] and our previous work [2], we study high-energy pion scattering in the holographic QCD hard-wall model. In particular, we focus on comparing our predictions for the angular dependence of $\pi^{+} \pi^{-} \to \pi^{+} \pi^{-}$ scattering with experimental data extracted from the process $\pi^{-} p \to \pi^{+} \pi^{-} n$. Having previously shown that our approach reproduces the constituent counting rule found in QCD, we now observe qualitative agreement between our predictions and the extracted data in the high-energy fixed-angle regime. We also provide predictions for all other 2-to-2 pion scattering processes. Our approach can be extended to a broader range of meson and glueball scattering processes in various holographic QCD models.</description>

      <title>Lepton anomalous magnetic moments: Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The anomalous magnetic moment of a lepton encodes the fraction of the lepton's interaction strength with an external magnetic field, which is generated by quantum corrections. Lepton anomalous magnetic moments are sensitive probes of fundamental interactions and play a pivotal role in the quest for "new physics" that may be able to explain the shortcomings of the Standard Model. This chapter introduces the basic concepts and describes the calculation of the individual contributions arising from electromagnetism, the strong and the weak interactions.</description>

      <title>Complete NLO corrections to full off-shell $t\bar{t}$ production in the $\ell + j$ decay channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the calculation of the complete NLO corrections to the full off-shell top-quark pair production in the lepton+jets decay channel, denoted as $pp \to \ell^- \bar{\nu}_{\ell} j_b j_b jj + X$, where $\ell^- = e^-, \mu^-$. The calculation consistently preserves the finite-width effects of the top quarks and $W$ and $Z$ gauge bosons, and takes into account all doubly-, singly-, and non-resonant contributions along with their interference effects. All Born-level contributions, at the perturbative orders from ${\mathcal O}(\alpha_s^4 \alpha^2)$ to ${\mathcal O}(\alpha_s^0 \alpha^6)$, are included and corrected by both NLO QCD and NLO EW effects. We consider all possible partonic initial states and decay channels. Particular attention is paid to the infrared safety in the presence of photons and jets. This requires the use of the so-called parton-to-photon fragmentation function and the photon-to-jet conversion function, which makes the democratic photon-parton clustering and the $\gamma \to q \bar q$ splittings finite. We present our findings at the integrated and differential fiducial cross-section levels for the LHC Run III centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = 13.6$ TeV. In addition, we quantify the impact of subleading NLO effects, in particular electroweak Sudakov logarithms and non-resonant QCD backgrounds. Two analysis strategies are employed and compared, namely with and without the resonance-enhancing requirement on the invariant mass of the two light jets, $|M_{jj} - m_W| &lt; Q_{\text{cut}} = 20$ GeV, illustrating the relationship between QCD background suppression, off-shell effects, interferences, and complete NLO corrections.</description>

Abstract: Recently arXiv:2512.11011 set out to improve on previous work from 1994 by Dolgov and Freese, who used a small-angle approximation to derive the yield of spontaneous baryogenesis from a rolling phase, a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson coupled to the baryon current. The goal of the recent paper was to investigate what happens when the small-angle approximation is not imposed. I point out a serious technical shortcoming in their derivation, as well as an instance of plagiarism.</description>

      <title>Universal Non-Equilibrium Cascade in QGP Light-Nuclei Formation and Cosmological Bose-Einstein Condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent ALICE results demonstrate that over 90\% of light nuclei and anti-nuclei ($d$, $\bar d$) observed in heavy-ion collisions originate from a non-equilibrium, multi-stage process: $\Delta$-resonance production, decay into correlated nucleons, and their subsequent coalescence in a cooler hadronic environment. Although the final particle yields appear thermal, the underlying dynamics is strongly time-ordered and highly non-equilibrium. We show that this mechanism exhibits a striking universality with the formation of Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) and associated density spikes in cosmological scalar-field dark-matter scenarios. In both systems -- the quark-gluon plasma near hadronization and the early universe approaching the BEC critical temperature -- the relevant degrees of freedom reorganize through a hierarchical cascade: high-energy modes first convert into intermediate excitations, which then seed low-energy coherent structures once the temperature crosses a threshold. This work highlights an unexpected theoretical bridge between heavy-ion physics and cosmology, suggesting a common class of emergent non-equilibrium phenomena behind structure formation in both extremes.</description>

      <title>Two-Component Dark Matter with an SU(2) Dark Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an extension to the standard model incorporating a dark sector with a non-Abelian SU(2) gauge symmetry. The model yields stable dark matter candidates, protected by a residual $Z_3$ symmetry arising after the spontaneous symmetry breaking. The dark sector interacts with the SM via a Higgs portal, facilitated from mixing between the SM Higgs doublet and a dark scalar singlet. The model features two distinct DM components. We analyze theoretical and experimental constraints, including perturbativity, unitarity, vacuum stability, dark matter relic density, direct detection, indirect detection, Higgs invisible decays, dark radiation, and ellipticity. Our findings identify viable parameter spaces that satisfy these constraints, as exemplified by two benchmark points.</description>

Abstract: Assuming $X(6900)$ is a tetraquark state, the decay width of $X(6900)\to 2J/\psi$ is calculated in a covariant quark model, with the diquark-antidiquark $[cc][\bar{c}\bar{c}]$ picture. Two possible structures, vector-vector and axial-vector--axial-vector coupling, are investigated. The result indicates that the axial-vector--axial-vector coupling is consistent with the experiments.</description>

      <title>Collapse of Coulomb Bound States of Vector Bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charged spin 1 (vector) particles behave very differently from electrons or scalars in a Coulomb field. For an infinitely heavy point-like nucleus their bound state wave functions fall to the centre, and embedding the system in a renormalisable electroweak-type theory does not remedy this short-distance pathology. We therefore solve the pure Coulomb problem for a finite nuclear radius $R$ and recover the point nucleus limit by letting $R\to 0$. This approach allows us to include the crucial Upsilon term in the wave equations, which for the point-like nucleus is proportional to delta(r) and was ignored in the previous calculations of the energy spectrum. Several unusual effects emerge: (i) The Upsilon term supports a tower of states located mainly inside the nucleus. As R -&gt; 0 their number diverges, most lying in the negative energy continuum (energy epsilon &lt; - m c^2). They trigger vacuum breakdown - particle-antiparticle pair creation that ultimately screens the nuclear charge.
  (ii) Ordinary Sommerfeld-like states (with binding energy smaller m c^2) persist, but a finite fraction of each wave function leaks into the nucleus, even as R -&gt; 0.
  (iii) Charge density of a negatively charged vector particle changes sign in a vicinity of the nucleus and becomes positive charge density, whereas the Upsilon term ensures its density inside the nucleus remains negative.
  (iv) For weak coupling, Z alpha &lt;&lt; 1, yet with mR &lt;Z alpha, the non-relativistic solution differs qualitatively from Schrodinger theory despite binding energies are well below m c^2; agreement is recovered only when Z alpha &lt;&lt; mR.
  These phenomena highlight the distinctive and subtle behaviour of spin-1 particles in the Coulomb field.</description>

      <title>Quark-model search for compact $c\bar c uds$ pentaquark states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A potential quark model is used to search for a $P_{c\bar{c}s}^0=(c\bar{c}uds)^0$, $J^P=1/2^-$ pentaquark state that has recently been observed experimentally by the LHCb collaboration at 4338.2 MeV, with a width of 7.0 MeV and high statistical significance $&gt;15\sigma$. Our model Hamiltonian reproduces the masses of the low-lying charmed and strange hadrons. We use the Gaussian expansion method {to solve the} five-body Schr\"odinger equation. Employing the real scaling method {including}
  the relevant meson-baryon thresholds explicitly, sharp resonances are distinguished from the meson-baryon scattering states. We incorporate new color states of the color-octet meson and baryon configurations as well as the color-singlet configurations for the five-quark states. We find no $ J^P=1/2^-$ resonance close to the observed state, and also none in the $ J^P=3/2^-$ state. This increases the likelihood that $P^0_{c\bar{c}s}$ is a $\Xi_c\bar{D}$ hadronic molecule rather than a compact state.</description>

      <title>Magnetic monopoles as probes of the global structure of the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic charges of monopoles arising in ultraviolet completions of the Standard Model are constrained by the global structure of the gauge group. After electroweak symmetry breaking, a subset of the ultraviolet monopoles carrying magnetic charges 3$g_D$ and $6g_D$ can survive as isolated, colour-neutral states in the infrared. We show that this selection rule follows from the interplay between the symmetry structure and the magnetic 1-form symmetry, and discuss how the relic abundance of such monopoles can be naturally suppressed by the symmetry breaking scale. We further demonstrate that such monopoles with Lorentz factor $\gamma\lesssim 10^4$ propagate through matter with ionisation energy loss profiles scaling as $g^2$ using CORSIKA Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Charm multiplicity distribution in high energy pp collisions with PYTHIA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growth of statistics in the future experiments at the LHC, the number of events with charm production will increase substantially. It may become possible to measure the multiplicity distribution of charm particles. Using PYTHIA-8, we generated charm multiplicity distributions in $pp$ collisions for different pseudorapidity ranges ($|\eta| &lt; 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0$) and center-of-mass energies ($\sqrt{s}=$ 0.9, 2.36, 2.76, 7.0, 8.0, 13.0 TeV). We investigated the role played by multiple parton interactions and color reconnection. We compared the multiplicity distribution of D mesons with the charm quark multiplicity distribution. We observe that the "quark-hadron" duality hypothesis is satisfied. With the obtained distributions we tested the validity of the Koba-Nielsen-Olesen scaling. We also parameterized the charm distributions considering the Poisson and negative binomial distributions.</description>

      <title>Emergent chiral spin symmetry, non-perturbative dynamics and thermoparticles in hot QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several non-perturbative results for hot QCD are challenging some aspects of the phase diagram and its associated degrees of freedom which were previously believed to be well understood. With increasing temperature, the chiral crossover is followed by an intermediate region with an approximate chiral spin symmetry larger than chiral symmetry, in which pseudo-scalar mesons continue to exist as hadron-like excitations, before at some higher temperature the expected chiral symmetry is recovered. By testing general formal considerations against lattice data, it can be shown that thermally modified versions of stable vacuum particles, so-called thermoparticles, form the constituents of thermal quantum field theories, with properties quite different from what is expected perturbatively. This ``viewpoint'' aims to raise broader and, in particular, phenomenological interest in these directions.</description>

      <title>Next-to-Next-to-Leading-Order Corrections to the $B \to \pi $ Form Factors from Light-Cone Sum Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By incorporating the available leading-power results at $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s)$ and next-to-leading-power corrections at tree level, we improve the precision of the theoretical predictions for $B\to\pi$ form factors to the $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^2\beta_0)$ level in the large-recoil region using the light-cone sum rule approach with $B$-meson light-cone distribution amplitudes. We find that the QCD corrections at $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^2\beta_0)$ contribute approximately $+6.1\%$ compared to the tree-level result. Combining the light-cone sum rule predictions in the large-recoil region, lattice QCD results in the small-recoil region, we perform a combined fit for the $B\to\pi$ form factors across the full kinematic range. Utilizing these form factors, we calculate the branching ratios, lepton-flavor-universality ratio $R_\pi$, forward-backward asymmetry $\mathcal{A}_{\rm FB}$, flat term $\mathcal{F}_{\rm H}$ and polarization asymmetry $\mathcal{A}_{\rm \lambda_\ell}$ of $B\to\pi\mu\bar{\nu}_{\mu}$ and $B\to\pi\tau\bar{\nu}_{\tau}$ decays. Using the experimentally measured $q^2$-binned differential branching ratios of $B\to\pi\mu\bar{\nu}_{\mu}$ decay as input, employing the Bourrely-Caprini-Lellouch parametrization, we extract the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element $|V_{ub}| = 3.73(14) \times 10^{-3}$.</description>

      <title>Application of $K \to 3\pi$ amplitudes to semileptonic kaon decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study dispersive representations of nonlocal form factors in $K^+ \to \pi^+ \ell^+ \ell^-$ and $K^+ \to \pi^+ \nu \bar{\nu}$ decays, with an aim of improving the theoretical description of the spectrum and decay rate of the neutrino mode. Based on unitarity, these representations invoke the $K^+ \pi^- \to \pi^+ \pi^-$ amplitude in $P$-wave and the pion vector form factor. The $P$-wave amplitude can be effectively parameterized within the dispersive Khuri-Treiman framework, and constrained by experimental information on the CP-conserving $K^+ \to \pi^+ \pi^+ \pi^-$ and $K^+ \to \pi^0 \pi^0 \pi^+$ decays. We also emphasize certain relations between charged-lepton and neutrino non-local form factors based on the Operator Product Expansion, which can be used to impose further phenomenological constraints.</description>

      <title>Scalar-Mediated Inelastic Dark Matter as a Solution to Small-Scale Structure Anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a scalar-mediated Self-Interacting Dark Matter (SIDM) model to address small-scale structure anomalies such as the core-cusp and diversity problems. The model is composed by a leptophilic scalar mediator and a pseudo-Dirac dark matter candidate with a mass splitting of 100 eV.We imposed aA dark discrete $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry forbids tree-level elastic scattering. Therefore creates kinematic threshold that suppresses scattering in ultra-faint satellite galaxies while enabling large self-interaction cross-sections in dwarf galaxies via resonant enhancement. To satisfy Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) requirements, we introduce a dimension-5 magnetic dipole operator that enable the decay of the excited state ($\chi_2 \rightarrow \chi_1 \gamma$). This operator also provides a unique, low-threshold signal for direct detection experiments, characterized by a distinct $1/E_R$ recoil spectrum. We identify a benchmark parameter space around ($m_\chi \approx 40$ GeV, $m_\phi \approx 20$ MeV) where non-perturbative coupled-channel dynamics successfully reconcile astrophysical observations with cosmological bounds, including CMB constraints on annihilation.</description>

      <title>Searching for Ultralight Dark Matter with M{\"o}ssbauer Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the feasibility of probing the interaction between ultralight scalar dark matter and atomic nuclei using a stationary Mossbauer spectroscopy scheme. The exceptional energy resolution of the Mossbauer resonance enables testing nuclear energy shifts arising from the local dark matter field. In principle, a stationary measurement allows faster data acquisition and becomes advantageous at higher dark matter masses in the range 10^{-15} - 10^{-8} eV. We present the projected sensitivity to the dark matter parameter space for three candidate Mossbauer isotopes, Ag-109, Sc-45, and Zn-67. Among them, Ag-109 provides the highest sensitivity, followed by Zn-67. For Ag-109, the scalar dark matter photon coupling f_gamma^{-1} can be constrained down to the level of 10^{-18} GeV^{-1}}, exceeding the sensitivity of several existing experiments. The scalar dark matter gluon coupling f_g^{-1} can be probed down to 10^{-21} GeV^{-1}, while the scalar dark matter quark coupling y_d can reach approximately 10^{-22} GeV^{-1}. These results demonstrate that Mossbauer based techniques offer a promising and competitive approach for probing ultralight dark matter interactions with Standard Model particles.</description>

Abstract: We investigate hydrodynamic contributions to short-range two-particle correlations in relativistic heavy-ion collisions using the Boltzmann-Langevin equation. We derive and solve the transport equation for equal-time two-point correlations, obtaining both local and non-local contributions that scale with transport coefficients. The non-local correlations emerging from 2-to-2 scattering dynamics provide a hydrodynamic signature in short-range correlation measurements.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Production of Massive Spin-2 Particles During Reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the minimal gravitational portal for a massive spin-2 dark matter candidate $X_{\mu\nu}$ produced during perturbative reheating. The dark sector couples to the visible sector only via gravity, and we analyze two unavoidable channels: (i) inflaton condensate annihilation, $\phi+\phi \to X+X$, and (ii) thermal scatterings, ${\rm SM}+{\rm SM}\to X+X$, both mediated by graviton exchange. Working in the Fierz-Pauli framework for a free massive spin-2 field of mass $m_2$, we derive the graviton-mediated amplitudes and perform a full helicity decomposition of the final state. The relic abundance is obtained analytically in terms of $m_2$ and the reheating temperature $T_{\rm RH}$. In the light mass regime $m_2 \ll m_\phi$ (with $m_\phi$ the inflaton mass during oscillations), production is overwhelmingly dominated by the longitudinal (helicity-0) mode: the $2\to2$ cross section is parametrically enhanced, scaling as $\sim (m_\phi/m_2)^4$, and yields efficient dark matter production despite purely gravitational couplings. Compared to lower-spin cases (spin-$0$, $1/2$, $1$, and $3/2$), massive spin-$2$ production is substantially more efficient for the same reheating history. Over most of the parameter space the inflaton condensate channel dominates the yield, while the thermal contribution is negligible. Avoiding overproduction typically requires either a relatively low $T_{\rm RH}$ or a spin-$2$ mass near threshold, $m_2 \lesssim m_\phi$. This places the spin-$2$ portal on similar footing to other higher spins in reheating scenarios, while emphasizing the central role of the helicity-$0$ mode and the reheating history in setting the dark matter density.</description>

Abstract: The spin density matrix for octet baryon-antibaryon pairs produced in electron-positron annihilation is unambiguously given within the one-photon exchange in the centre-of-mass frame. Both the parity ($P$) and combined parity and charge-conjugation ($CP$) violation effects in the intermediate photon coupling to the baryon pairs are simultaneously considered. The electron mass is explicitly included in the general formulae presented in this paper. The whole framework is build upon the spin projection operator.</description>

      <title>The Standard Model Prediction for the Rare Decay $B \to X_s \nu \bar \nu$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present updated and comprehensive Standard Model predictions for the inclusive rare decay $B \to X_s \nu\bar{\nu}$. Using a state-of-the-art determination of the short-distance coefficient, including NLO QCD and electroweak effects, and implementing a consistent treatment of heavy-quark masses and power corrections within the kinetic scheme, we compute the total decay rate and the neutrino invariant mass spectrum. We incorporate all known perturbative contributions in the heavy quark limit up to $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)$, evaluate non-perturbative corrections through the Heavy Quark Expansion up to $1/m_b^3$, and include estimates of four-quark operator matrix elements from HQET sum rules. We obtain the Standard Model branching ratios $\text{Br}(B^0 \to X_s\nu\bar{\nu}) = (3.35 \pm 0.10)\times 10^{-5} $ and $ \text{Br}(B^+ \to X_s\nu\bar{\nu}) = (3.62 \pm 0.11)\times 10^{-5}, $ representing a significant improvement in both central value and precision compared to previous determinations. We also provide predictions for partial rates with kinematic cuts relevant to Belle II. Our results are timely in view of recent measurements of $B \to K\nu\bar{\nu}$ and the first upper limits on inclusive $B \to X_s\nu\bar{\nu}$, and they offer a robust baseline for future searches for physics beyond the Standard Model in $b\to s\nu\bar{\nu}$ transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We assess the impact of future measurements of deeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS) off protons using the planned detector at the Electron-Ion Collider in China (EicC), proposed as an upgrade to the High Intensity heavy-ion Accelerator Facility (HIAF). We develop a neural-network architecture to flexibly parameterize the Compton Form Factors (CFFs), extrapolate reliably into unmeasured kinematic regions, and provide robust uncertainty estimates through the replica method. The framework is fitted to the available worldwide DVCS data using the Gepard software. We find a significant reduction in the uncertainties of all CFFs after incorporating pseudo-data from single and double polarization asymmetries at the EicC, with particularly strong improvements in the sea-quark region.</description>

      <title>Search for Light Neutral Scalar in the Georgi-Machacek Model with Forward Detectors at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-lived particle (LLP) is one of the well-motivated targets for current collider experiments searching for the physics beyond the Standard Model. In recent years, many dedicated detectors have been developed for such scenarios which are designed to extend the sensitivity to weakly coupled particles with macroscopic $c\tau$. In this work, we investigate the LLP signatures of the neutral component of the fermiophobic fiveplet $H_5^0$ in the Georgi-Machacek model. Due to its fermiophobic nature at tree level, it possesses suppressed decay widths in the low mass region and can naturally be long-lived over a wide region of parameter space. We show that $H_5^0$ can be produced with an appreciable flux in the forward region from the meson decay through loop-induced couplings leading to observable LLP signatures in forward detectors. We evaluate the sensitivity of representative forward detectors to this scenario and compare the result with existing constraints from terrestrial experiments and astrophysical observations. Our results demonstrate that the forward detectors can probe the $s_H$ down to $\mathcal{O}(10^{-5})$ for sub-GeV scalar masses, and hence providing a powerful and complementary probe of the extended Higgs sectors that is inaccessible to conventional searches.</description>

      <title>Investigations on heavy quarkonium hybrid mesons with exotic quantum numbers $J^{PC}=2^{+-}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the heavy quarkonium hybrid mesons with exotic quantum numbers $J^{PC}=2^{+-}$ via QCD sum rule method. We construct the currents with three Lorentz indices and calculate the correlation function up to dimension six at the leading order of $\alpha _{s}$. The states with $J^{PC}=2^{+-}$ are extracted by constructing the corresponding projection operators. The obtained results indicate that the masses of $2^{+-}$ $\bar{c}Gc$ and $\bar{b}Gb$ hybrid states are about $4.49~\mathrm{GeV}$ and $10.48~\mathrm{GeV}$, respectively.

      <title>Constraining the proton transverse partonic distribution through coherent diffractive $J/\psi$ production at HERA within a static Gaussian hot spot model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the transverse parton distribution of the proton through the t-dependence of the coherent J/psi differential cross section extracted from HERA measurements in the small-x regime. Employing a simple static Gaussian hot spot model inspired by the large-x three-valence-quark picture of the proton, we introduce three geometric degrees of freedom of each hot spot: the Gaussian width of each hot spot, the spatial distance of the valence quarks from the proton center, and their azimuthal orientation. In the simplest implementation, the valence quarks are assumed to form a symmetric triangular configuration. We find that variations in these geometric structures significantly influence the t-slope of the coherent cross section. In particular, the rotational degree of freedom strongly affects the cross section at t &gt; 0.5 GeV^2, while the small-t region remains largely insensitive to variations in this parameter.</description>

      <title>Real-time propagators resummed with nontrivial boundary wavefunctions in a constant electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the derivation of an alternative representation of the real-time in-in formalism under a spatially homogeneous and time independent electric field. Because the system exhibits instability associated with pair production of particles and antipartiles, the perturbation theory should be reorganized depending on the choice of the reference vacuum. We recast the boundary wavefunctions into the quadratic self-energy-like terms in the functional integration formalism. The resulting generating functional in the modified in-in formalism leads to the propagators that resum infinite diagrams necessary to capture the vacuum-instability effects. The proper-time representations of the propagators reproduce the known expressions from the canonical operator formalism, but our derivation based on the generating functional along the closed-time path clarifies the origin of the addtional proper-time contour and provides a better physical understanding. Finally, as a concrete example of the application, we compute the in-in expectation value of the vector current in a constant electric field, and find that the one-loop calculation results in the expression consistent with the physical intuition.</description>

      <title>On the inclusion of the pion form factor in $e^+e^- \to \pi^+\pi^-$ beyond leading order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pion form factor plays a crucial role in the determination of the contribution of the hadronic vacuum polarisation to the muon anomalous magnetic moment. In order to measure this quantity, energy-scan experiments rely on Monte Carlo generator to simulate the $e^+e^- \to \pi^+\pi^-(\gamma)$ process. For the theoretical accuracy to match the experimental precision, next-to-leading order calculations and the resummation of multiple photon emissions are needed. In this context, the inclusion of the pion form factor beyond the leading order approximation is crucial to reproduce some observables, like the pion charge asymmetry. We present the impact of the inclusion of the pion form factor in loop diagrams with three approaches and the interplay with radiative corrections.</description>

      <title>On the new physics in Bhabha luminometry at future $e^+e^-$ colliders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The absolute machine luminosity is a key quantity to achieve the high-precision physics program of future $e^+e^-$ collider. It is determined by measuring a theoretically well-known process, which, ideally, can be computed with arbitrary precision in the perturbation theory. However, yet undiscovered new physics could give a non-negligible contribution to the cross section of the luminosity monitoring process, thus invalidating the uncertainty determination of measured quantities. We assess the theoretical error of non-Standard Model origin to the small-angle Bhabha scattering in various future colliders scenarios. In addition, a possible running strategy to constrain unknown heavy interactions is proposed, relying on asymmetries that do not depend on the absolute luminosity.</description>

      <title>Semileptonic neutral currents decays of $\Xi_b$ with dileptons or dineutrinos in the final state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a detailed analysis of semileptonic $\Xi_b$ decays mediated by flavor-changing neutral currents ($b\to s$ and $b\to d$) with dilepton or dineutrino final states within the perturbative QCD framework. All independent form factors including vector, axial-vector, tensor, and pseudotensor currents are calculated and are used to analyze the decay branching fractions and angular distributions. Our numerical results for the branching fractions of $\Xi_b\to \Xi \ell^+\ell^-$ decays suggest they are within measurable reach for the LHCb experiment in the near future. Furthermore, we show that a measurement of the ratio $\mathcal{B}(\Xi_b^-\to \Sigma^- \mu^+\mu^-) / \mathcal{B}(\Xi_b^-\to \Xi^- \mu^+\mu^-)$ will allow for an independent determination of $|V_{td}/V_{ts}|$. For the case of unpolarized $\Xi_b$ baryons, we derive several angular observables, which can provide new and complementary constraints on Wilson coefficients in semileptonic FCNC transitions compared to those from mesonic decays. Finally, we present a combined analysis of dilepton and dineutrino channels, comparing various observables in detail. Our results offer further insights into the long-standing anomalies observed in $B$ meson decays.</description>

      <title>Double Resonance Strategy for Interferometric Detection of Axions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a double-resonant interferometric strategy for axion dark matter detection that combines microwave circuit resonance with Fabry--P\'erot optical enhancement. In a strong magnetic field, axion--photon mixing induces a weak oscillating electric field, which is first amplified by a resonant circuit and then transduced into an optical phase shift via the electro-optic effect. Multiple coherent optical passes through the electro-optic medium accumulate this phase shift, enabling interferometric readout using mature optical techniques. We present the basic operating principle, discuss material requirements, and estimate the achievable sensitivity. For representative parameters, the projected reach extends into the parameter space of well-motivated QCD axion models.</description>

      <title>Analytical study of birefringent cavities for axion-like dark matter search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light polarization plays a crucial role in optical-cavity experiments; however, mirror birefringence presents a significant challenge that must be addressed carefully. In this study, a rigorous, nonperturbative framework is developed to quantify birefringence effects by incorporating variations in reflectance and polarization misalignment. We analyze the impact of this framework on the sensitivity of axion-like particle (ALP) dark-matter searches. The results show that both birefringence and misalignment contribute to sensitivity degradation in the low-mass regime; however, the adverse effects of misalignment can be mitigated by selecting a postselection angle greater than the misalignment angle. Furthermore, birefringence produces an additional resonance peak in the high-mass region, which remains largely unaffected by misalignment and postselection variations. This rigorous framework underscores the importance of considering birefringence in high-precision optical-cavity experiments for ALP detection.</description>

      <title>Probing Dark Sectors with Exploding Black Holes: Gamma Rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hawking radiation from the explosion of a black hole would provide definitive information on the particle spectrum of nature. Here we quantify the potential of current and future gamma ray telescopes to probe new dark sectors. We improve on the analysis used in previous work by making careful use of the experimental response functions, deriving a more realistic estimate of the backgrounds and optimizing the statistical analysis. We compute the sensitivity of the current experiments (HAWC and LHAASO) and estimate the reach of the future experiments (SWGO and CTA North and South), for various sky positions of the explosion. We find that for a black hole exploding at $0.01\,\text{pc}$ the gamma ray signal observed by HAWC could probe dark sectors with 10-20 (or more) new Dirac fermions up to masses around $10^5\,\text{GeV}$, while CTA will be able to probe 2-15 new Dirac fermions with masses up to $10^6\,\text{GeV}$. CTA North and South will have sensitivity to 10 dark fermions up to a distance of 0.1 pc and 50 up to a distance of 0.6 pc.</description>

      <title>Search for Quadruplet Scalars using Boosted Decision Trees at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beyond the Standard Model scenarios introduce additional scalar and fermion multiplets, which influence neutrino mass generation mechanisms and yield distinctive collider signatures. This work focuses on a particular scenario involving a neutral fermion quintuplet and a scalar quadruplet. The study examines the production and decay of the scalar quadruplet components at the LHC, emphasizing how their decay patterns, fermiophobic versus fermiophilic, depend on mass differences and Yukawa couplings with the fermion multiplets. A detailed collider analysis targeting final states with at least four leptons and two jets is conducted. The study also incorporates Standard Model backgrounds, leveraging multivariate techniques via Boosted Decision Trees. Results indicate discovery potential for scalar masses around 600-700 GeV and exclusion sensitivity extending beyond 1 TeV, highlighting the promising experimental signatures in the model and its role in probing new physics at colliders.</description>

      <title>Heavy neutral bosons and dark matter in the 3-3-1 model with axionlike particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider heavy neutral bosons in the 3-3-1 model with axionlike particles (331ALP), including the Higgs boson and the $Z^\prime$ boson which are outside the standard model (SM). Based on gluon-gluon fusion at the LHC, we investigate the signals of cross-sections in the parameter space region satisfying the current experimental limits of lepton flavor violating decay, including processes involving both charged leptons and Higgs boson, and provide predictions of $m_{h_2}\geq 600 ~\mathrm{GeV}$. A new gauge boson, labeled as $Z^{\prime}$, is predicted $m_{Z^{\prime}}\geq 5.1 ~\mathrm{TeV}$ based on the search for high-mass dilepton resonances at ATLAS and CMS. We also introduced the symmetry group $U(1)_{\mathcal{N}}\otimes \mathcal{Z}_2^\prime$ into the model to indicate dark matter candidates. Investigating the relic density of dark matter within experimentally permissible limits, we established a relationship between the mass of dark matter and the breaking scale of axion.</description>

      <title>A Composite Theory of Higgs and Flavour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a composite Higgs model in which a flavour deconstructed gauge group is embedded in the strong sector. The pattern of global symmetry breaking yields, as pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone (pNGB) bosons, both a Standard Model (SM)-like Higgs and the link field whose vacuum expectation value breaks the flavour non-universal gauge group down to the SM. Inevitably, a third pNGB appears, transforming as a second Higgs doublet coupled only to the light generations. This heavy Higgs naturally mediates suppressed light Yukawa couplings, providing a solution to the flavour puzzle. At the same time, new physics contributions to flavour violating observables are CKM- and chirally suppressed, while electric dipole moment bounds are evaded through an automatic mass alignment in the light fermion sector. The result is a natural framework for addressing the origin of both Higgs and flavour hierarchies, with reduced Higgs mass tuning and minimised impact in flavour observables, that is best tested by high-$p_T$ and precision electroweak measurements.</description>

      <title>Achieving angular-momentum conservation with physics-informed neural networks in computational relativistic spin hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) as a numerical solver for relativistic spin hydrodynamics and demonstrate that the total angular momentum, i.e., the sum of orbital and spin angular momentum, is accurately conserved throughout the fluid evolution by imposing the conservation law directly in the loss function as a training target. This enables controlled numerical studies of the mutual conversion between spin and orbital angular momentum, a central feature of relativistic spin hydrodynamics driven by the rotational viscous effect. We present two physical scenarios with a rotating fluid confined in a cylindrical container: one case in which initial orbital angular momentum is converted into spin angular momentum in analogy with the Barnett effect, and the opposite case in which initial spin angular momentum is converted into orbital angular momentum in analogy with the Einstein-de Haas effect. We investigate these conversion processes governed by the rotational viscous effect by analyzing the spacetime profiles of thermal vorticity and spin potential. Our PINNs-based framework provides the first numerical evidence for spin-orbit angular momentum conversion with fully nonlinear computational relativistic spin hydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>First-Principles Formalism for Simulating Self-Interacting Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is plausible that the dark matter particles have non-gravitational interactions among themselves. If such self interactions are large enough, they could leave an imprint on the morphology of galaxies. These effects can be studied with numerical simulations, which serve as the primary tool to predict the non-linear evolution of galactic structure. A standard assumption is that the course-grained phase-space distribution of the macroscopic simulation particles follows the same evolution equation as that of the fundamental dark matter particles. This Letter tests this assumption directly for the case of frequent dark matter scatterings, demonstrating that this is not generically true. Specifically, we develop a first-principles map from a microscopic particle physics description of self-interacting dark matter to a representation of macroscopic simulation particles for theories in the short-mean-free-path regime. Using this procedure, we show the emergence of an effective force between the simulation particles and derive their interaction cross section, which depends on the one from fundamental particle physics. This work provides the first explicit map from particle physics to simulation, which will facilitate exploring the phenomenological implications for galactic dynamics.</description>

      <title>The Clustering of Little Red Dots from Ultra-Strongly Self-Interacting Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We predict the effective clustering bias parameter, $b_{\rm{eff}}$, at $z\sim5$ for Little Red Dots (LRDs) seeded by Ultra-Strongly Self-Interacting Dark Matter (uSIDM). From our model, we find that $b_{\rm{eff}}\sim4.5$, thus we infer that LRDs seeded by uSIDM would populate halos of typical masses $\sim 8\times10^{10}~M_{\odot}$; this bias factor is consistent with LRDs being a distinct population from high redshift quasars. To the extent that we are aware, this is the first formation-based theoretical prediction of LRD clustering from a model consistent with the LRD mass function. We find that this bias and clustering is insensitive to a wide range of the underlying uSIDM microphysics parameters, including the uSIDM cross-section $\sigma/m$ and uSIDM fraction $f$. This is therefore a robust prediction from the uSIDM model, and will allow for direct probes of the uSIDM paradigm as the origin of LRDs in the next few years. Upcoming \texttt{JWST} observations will constrain the population of LRDs, including directly measuring their clustering.</description>

      <title>Constrained Brownian-bridge prior for neutron-star equation-of-state inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We set forth a new method for generating model-agnostic, nonparametric priors for neutron star equation-of-state inference that are stable, causal and thermodynamically consistent by construction. This generalizes Gaussian processes to include global thermodynamic constraints, specifically allowing the inclusion of any number of training points in the form $(\mu, n, p)$ while retaining thermodynamic consistency between them. The method is based on constructing constrained Brownian bridges, whose correlation properties can be tuned at will allowing flexibility between a conservative prior and a theory-informed prior. The method does not require any shooting to obey multiple constraints and provides an efficient and informed way to include both chiral effective field theory and perturbative quantum chromodynamics constraints within the same framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flow equation methods, more generally known as Similarity Renormalization Group (SRG) techniques, were developed to address multiscale problems where multiple length or energy scales contribute simultaneously. In this Thesis, we formulate the flow equation method within a wavelet-based framework and apply it to study scale (resolution) separation in a two-dimensional scalar field theory. We demonstrate that the flow systematically block-diagonalizes the Hamiltonian with respect to wavelet resolution, achieving improved truncation compared to earlier studies. Using a model of two real scalar fields coupled through a quadratic interaction, we show that the flow equations effectively suppress couplings between low- and high-resolution degrees of freedom. This provides a clear mechanism for isolating low-resolution physics and offers insight into the construction of effective Hamiltonians using a wavelet-based flow equation approac</description>

Abstract: The nature of the chiral phase transition of QCD continues to represent a fundamental open problem in the study of strongly interacting matter. In recent years, significant progress has been achieved by exploiting systematic variations of theory parameters in regimes free of the sign problem. In this work, the idea of a follow-up investigation that extends a previous study at zero chemical potential is presented. A concrete programme for such an extension is discussed, outlining the required numerical steps, from data production to final analysis, and pointing to all the software tools that have been released to support these studies.</description>

      <title>Approximating Feynman Integrals Using Complete Monotonicity and Stieltjes Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce two novel numerical approaches for computing Feynman integrals based on their complete monotonicity (CM) and Stieltjes properties. The first method uses that scalar Feynman integrals are CM, meaning that all their derivatives have a fixed sign, in the Euclidean kinematic region. This imposes strong constraints on the function space. Simultaneously, these integrals obey systems of linear differential equations with respect to kinematic parameters. By imposing that the solutions to these differential equations satisfy complete monotonicity across the Euclidean region, we develop an efficient and highly constraining numerical bootstrap method. We provide a proof of principle of the power of our approach by applying it to a class of multi-loop Feynman integrals with internal masses. The second method is based on a refinement of CM. We prove that Feynman integrals, within a certain range of parameters, such as dimension and propagator exponents, are not only CM but in fact Stieltjes functions. The latter can be described efficiently by Pad\'e approximants that are known to converge in the cut complex plane. This means that these representations are valid also in analytically continued kinematics, such as physical scattering regions. These insights allow us to obtain rational approximations to Feynman integrals from minimal information, such as a Taylor expansion about a soft limit. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by applying it to a 20-loop banana-type Feynman integral. Finally, we comment on a number of extensions of these novel avenues for computing Feynman integrals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the origin of modular weights of wave functions in magnetized $T^{2}$ models. It is explicitly demonstrated that the modular weights of the wave functions on magnetized $T^2$ is equivalent to their mass level. We further extend this result to magnetized $T^{2g}$ models. As a result, we construct the wave functions of excited states in magnetized $T^{2g}$ models and show that their modular weights are likewise equivalent to the corresponding mass levels.</description>

      <title>Dissociation driven quarkonium spin alignment in Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observation of spin alignment of quarkonia in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions provides deep insight into the possible formation of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). The present study investigates the spin alignment of quarkonia induced by dissociation mechanisms arising from medium effects imposed on quarkonia. We implement an effective Hamiltonian with a medium-modified color-singlet potential to incorporate the coupling of quarkonium spin with medium vorticity. This coupling gives rise to spin-dependent dissociation, which we identify as a plausible mechanism contributing to quarkonium spin alignment. Within the ambit of second-order relativistic viscous hydrodynamics, we calculate the spin-dependent decay widths of charmonium ($J/\psi$, $\psi$(2S)) and bottomonium ($\Upsilon$(1S), $\Upsilon$(2S)) in a rotating thermal medium, including collisional damping and gluonic dissociation effects. We evaluate the observable $\rho_{00}$ for Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV as a function of transverse momentum of the quarkonia, charged particle multiplicity, and medium rotation. The results demonstrate that medium vorticity modifies the quarkonia net decay width and, as a consequence, quarkonia spin alignment gets modified. These findings suggest new directions for understanding spin transport and the microscopic dynamics of vortical QGP.</description>

      <title>Multi-neutron correlations in light nuclei via ab-initio lattice simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quest to understand multi-neutron systems has a long history, and recent experimental efforts aim to probe candidate four-neutron configurations in neutron-rich light nuclei such as ${}^8$He and ${}^7$H via quasi-free knockout reactions. However, the ground-state energies of the hydrogen isotopes ${}^6$H and ${}^7$H are not yet well constrained, with substantial discrepancies across experimental analyses and theoretical predictions. Using ab initio nuclear lattice effective field theory with an ensemble of 282 chiral two- and three-nucleon forces, we perform an uncertainty-quantified analysis of the ground-state energies of ${}^6$H and ${}^7$H. The marginal posteriors suggest single-neutron separation energy $S_n({}^{7}\text{H})=0.35^{+0.32}_{-0.32}$ MeV, disfavoring sequential ${}^{6}\mathrm{H}+n$ decay and pointing towards direct $t+4n$ emission. Intrinsic densities indicate triton- and $\alpha$-like clusters in ${}^7$H and ${}^8$He, respectively. By computing two-body and reduced four-body correlation functions, we find that the valence neutrons in the surface region of these systems form compact dineutrons that predominantly organize into symmetric dineutron-dineutron configurations, with only a small but non-negligible fraction assembling into more compact tetraneutron-like substructures. In ${}^7$H, these components account for roughly 95% and 5% of the sampled four-neutron configurations, respectively, and ${}^8$He exhibits a similar hierarchy. For these configurations, we also extract the corresponding spatial and angular correlation patterns among the nucleons. These results provide nuclear-structure insights into the debate surrounding four-neutron clusters and complement ongoing experimental searches for tetraneutron signatures in light nuclei.</description>

      <title>Nuclear collectivity and the harmonic spectrum of two-body correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-energy nuclear collisions have opened a new experimental method to reveal collective behavior in nuclear ground states through the lens of many-body correlations of nucleons. Using ab initio lattice and variational calculations of $^{20}$Ne and $^{16}$O, we study how emergent phenomena such as deformation or clustering can be identified in these systems from the dependence of their two-body density distributions on the relative azimuthal angle of nucleon pairs. A harmonic analysis of the correlation functions reveals in particular a dominant quadrupole component in $^{20}$Ne, consistent with a bowling-pin picture, and a prominent triangular modulation in $^{16}$O, possibly indicative of alpha-cluster correlations. Given that such structures can be accurately identified in high-energy collider experiments, these findings open a new paradigm for analyzing emergent collective behavior in atomic nuclei, relating their intrinsic shapes to the harmonic spectrum of microscopic correlations.</description>

      <title>Quantum sensing of high-frequency gravitational waves with ion crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A detection method for high-frequency gravitational waves using two-dimensional ion crystals is investigated. Gravitational waves can resonantly excite the drumhead modes of the ion crystal, particularly the parity-odd modes. In the optical dipole force protocol, entanglement between the drumhead modes and the collective spins transfers the excitation of the drumhead modes to the rotation of the total spin. Furthermore, gravitational wave detection beyond the standard quantum limit becomes possible as a squeezed spin state is generated through this entanglement. The sensitivity gets better with a larger ions crystals as well as a larger number of the ions. Future realization of large ion crystals can significantly improve the sensitivity to gravitational waves in the 10 kHz to 10 MHz region.</description>

Abstract: We present lattice results for $f_K/f_{\pi}$ in the iso-symmetric limit of pure QCD (isoQCD) with $N_f=2+1$ flavours, along with a determination of $|V_{us}|/|V_{ud}|$ and a study on the unitarity of the first row of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix after introducing strong isospin-breaking and QED effects. The results obtained are based on a combination of a Wilson unitary action and the mixed-action setup introduced in arXiv:2309.14154, arXiv:2510.20450. The combination of the two regularisations enables a more precise control over the continuum-limit extrapolation.</description>

      <title>Search for Axion-Like Particles from Nearby Pre-Supernova Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) are hypothetical pseudoscalar bosons that arise in many extensions of the Standard Model and are well-motivated dark matter candidates. Nearby massive stars in the late stages of stellar evolution provide a promising environment for enhanced ALP production due to their high core temperatures and densities. We search for a combined signal of ALP-induced hard X-ray and soft $\gamma$-ray emission from 18 nearby pre-supernova stars using the full public 22-year INTEGRAL/SPI dataset, construct individual stellar spectra and link them in a coherent analysis. A maximum-likelihood approach is used to extract fluxes in the 20--2000 keV energy range. Stellar evolution models are employed to obtain the expected spectral shapes of ALP production processes peaking between 50--500 keV, depending on stellar mass and evolutionary stage. We construct a joint likelihood that incorporates uncertainties in stellar parameters to derive combined constraints on the coupling constants $g_{a\gamma}$ and $g_{ae}$ as a function of the ALP mass $m_a$. The hard X-ray and soft $\gamma$-ray fluxes of all selected stars are consistent with zero within uncertainties. We provide upper limits on the continuum emission and on the 511 keV and 1809 keV line fluxes. The combined upper limit on $g_{a\gamma} \times g_{ae}$ is $(0.008 - 2) x 10^{-24}$ GeV$^{-1}$ (95% C.I.) while the ALP-photon coupling is constrained to $g_{a\gamma} = (0.13 - 1.26) x 10^{-11}$ GeV$^{-1}$ (95% C.I.) for $m_a\leqq10^{-11}$ eV, depending on the time to core collapse and magnetic field assumptions. Conservative limits of $(0.27 - 1.25) x 10^{-24}$ GeV$^{-1}$ (95% C.I.) are obtained assuming all but one star are in the early He-burning phase. These results rank among the strongest limits on ALP couplings to date and demonstrate the importance of soft $\gamma$-ray observations for probing ALPs and massive star evolution.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Fifth- and Sixth-Order Fluctuations of (Net-)proton Number in Au+Au Collisions from Phase II of the Beam Energy Scan Program at RHIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report high-statistics measurements of fifth- and sixth-order factorial cumulants and cumulant ratios of (net-)proton multiplicity distributions in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 7.7$--27 GeV, using data from the STAR experiment collected during the Beam Energy Scan Phase~II at RHIC. Protons and antiprotons are identified at midrapidity ($|y| &lt; 0.5$) with transverse momentum $0.4 &lt; p_T &lt; 2.0$ GeV/$c$. The proton factorial cumulants $\kappa_4$, $\kappa_5$, and $\kappa_6$ increase with order but exhibit no sign alternation within current uncertainties, offering no evidence for a two-component structure in the proton multiplicity distribution, as might be expected near a first-order phase transition. The cumulant ratios $C_{5}/C_{1}$ and $C_{6}/C_{2}$ fluctuate around zero in collisions at 0--40\% centrality. The results are consistent with both the negative predictions from lattice QCD (LQCD) and the positive trends obtained from the Ultra-relativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics (UrQMD) model. At $\sqrt{s_{NN}} \gtrsim 27$ GeV, the $C_4/C_2$ and $C_5/C_1$ results are compatible with predictions from lattice QCD, functional renormalization group (FRG), and hadron resonance gas (HRG) models, while UrQMD describes the data better at lower energies. These measurements place constraints on baryon number fluctuations and offer valuable insights into the QCD phase structure.</description>

Abstract: We propose '$\mathrm{d} \mathcal{E}$-forms' as fundamental building blocks of canonical integrands for elliptic Feynman integrals, which lead to Kronecker-Eisenstein $\omega$-form symbol letters. Built upon pure elliptic multiple polylogarithms, they provide a natural extension of the '$\mathrm{d} \! \log$-form' integrands and $\mathrm{d} \! \log$ letters for polylogarithmic cases. By introducing an extended basis treating all marked points equally, we manifest a hidden symmetry structure in the canonical connection matrix, and demonstrate its covariance under modular transformations. Our result provides a novel perspective on describing canonical bases and symbol letters in a unified language of pure functions.</description>

      <title>Strong model-agnostic constraints for twin-star solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a model-agnostic Bayesian analysis of the neutron-star-matter equation of state (EoS), using known ab-initio constraints and astrophysical observations to limit its behavior at intermediate densities. Permitting explicit first-order phase transitions allows us to systematically search for twin-star solutions, i.e. the existence of stars degenerate in mass but differing in radius. We find that current observational constraints exclude all but two classes of twin stars. The first is characterized by a first-order transition occurring at a very low density, where the material properties of the system either stay largely intact or move away from the conformal limit. In the second, more interesting class, the discontinuity in the mass-radius curve emerges after a rapid crossover transition at a significantly higher density, with the speed of sound exhibiting two sharp peaks at distinct densities. Since neither class shows clear conformalization upon entering the second branch, the standard twin-star scenario linking the mass-radius discontinuity to deconfinement can be firmly ruled out, while even the remaining solutions -- disfavored by per-mille Bayes factors and in tension with theoretical bounds -- are likely to be excluded in the future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the gravitational interaction of two coalescing compact objects at sixth post-Newtonian order in the static limit, employing the diagrammatic approach within the effective field theory framework of General Relativity. The calculation requires the evaluation of six-loop Feynman diagrams that are mapped onto two-point integrals with a gauge-theory-like structure, which are computed here for the first time. The resulting seventh-order contribution in Newton's constant is finite in three space dimensions. This result provides the most technically demanding missing ingredient for the determination of the conservative dynamics of the gravitational two-body system at sixth post-Newtonian order.</description>

      <title>The tidal gap: causality bound on exotic compact objects with applications in the solar and sub-solar mass range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we highlight the existence of a lower limit on the tidal deformability parameter $\Lambda$, determined by the requirement of relativistic causality. Additionally, by considering the upper bound set on compactness, we identify the region within the parameter space of compactness versus tidal deformability, where physically motivated exotic compact objects (ECOs) could potentially reside. Our analysis reveals the presence of a tidal gap between black holes, characterized by vanishing tidal deformability, and physically motivated ECOs. Prompted by this finding, we investigate the possibility that a population of maximally compact exotic objects, described by a linear equation of state (EoS), may simultaneously inhabit the lower mass gap and the sub-solar region, thus qualifying as (primordial) black hole mimickers while distinguishing themselves from the latter by their non-zero tidal deformability. Finally, considering the case of solitonic boson stars as proxies for ECOs described by a linear EoS, we discuss how it is possible to further reduce the lower limit on $\Lambda$, provided that the strong energy condition is violated (but not the dominant energy condition, and therefore causality).</description>

      <title>Structure Functions for small DIS $x$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structure Functions for small DIS (deep inelastic scattering) $x$ for integrable models are investigated, in particular, for the $O(N)$~$\sigma $-model and $SU(N)$ chiral Gross-Neveu model, which are asymptotically free. We get the universal behavior $x^{-1}\ln^{-2}x$ at small Bjorken variable $x$ and confirm a Balog Weisz conjecture. For a the second group of models, the Sine-Gordon, sinh-Gordon and $Z(N)$, we find power behavior $x^{-\lambda}$. The special behavior of the structure function for the Sine-Gordon model is probably crucial for future investigation in 4D QCD.</description>

      <title>Trigonometric continuous-variable gates and hybrid quantum simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid qubit-qumode quantum computing platforms provide a natural setting for simulating interacting bosonic quantum field theories. However, existing continuous-variable gate constructions rely predominantly on polynomial functions of canonical quadratures. In this work, we introduce a complementary universality paradigm based on trigonometric continuous-variable gates, which enable a Fourier-like representation of bosonic operators and are particularly well suited for periodic and non-perturbative interactions. We present a deterministic ancilla-based method for implementing unitary and non-unitary trigonometric gates whose arguments are arbitrary Hermitian functions of qumode quadratures. As a concrete application, we develop a hybrid qubit-qumode quantum simulation of the lattice sine-Gordon model. Using these gates, we prepare ground states via quantum imaginary-time evolution, simulate real-time dynamics, compute time-dependent vertex two-point correlation functions, and extract quantum kink profiles under topological boundary conditions. Our results demonstrate that trigonometric continuous-variable gates provide a physically natural framework for simulating interacting field theories on near-term hybrid quantum hardware, while establishing a parallel route to universality beyond polynomial gate constructions. We expect that the trigonometric gates introduced here to find broader applications, including quantum simulations of condensed matter systems, quantum chemistry, and biological models.</description>

      <title>Are Primordial Black Holes Truly Fine-Tuned?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-field inflationary models which generate primordial black holes through the enhancement of the curvature primordial power at small scales are commonly criticized and frequently dismissed because they require a large amount of fine-tuning in the parameters setting the ultra slow-roll phase. However, the standarly adopted definition of fine-tuning has a clear drawback: the more the primordial black hole abundance is small and cosmologically harmless, the larger the parameter space is fine-tuned. A reliable measure of fine-tuning should deliver a large value when the primordial black hole abundance is fine-tuned and at the same time reduce to something close to unity when it encounters typical sensitivity. Motivated by such arguments, we use the (modified version of) Wilson's naturalness criterion for quantifying the fine-tuning and naturalness and we show that the primordial black hole models are not technically unnatural.</description>

      <title>One-Loop Renormalization of Anisotropic Two-Scalar Quantum Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a Euclidean quantum field theory of two interacting real scalar fields in $D=4-\epsilon$ dimensions with the most general two--derivative but Lorentz--violating quadratic structure, allowing anisotropic spatial gradients and field--mixing time and cross--gradient terms, together with general cubic and quartic interactions. Although Lorentz violation is introduced only through the kinetic sector, the renormalization structure is nontrivial: interactions generate additional couplings, including masses and linear terms, so a consistent renormalization--group analysis cannot be formulated in terms of modified kinetic terms alone and requires an RG--complete operator basis compatible with the reduced symmetry.
  We perform a systematic one--loop renormalization and derive the complete set of beta functions for cubic and quartic couplings, masses, and linear terms. We identify and analyze the resulting fixed points and fixed manifolds, showing in particular how anisotropy restricts their existence and stability. In particular we obtain how anisotropy restricts existence of canonical Wilson-Fisher fixed point. Also we provide a transparent physical interpretation of the anisotropy--dependent coefficients appearing in the beta functions and clarify how kinetic mixing reshapes the interaction flow through the available ultraviolet phase space.</description>

      <title>Boosted dark matter from primordial black holes produced in a first-order phase transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.13035v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During a cosmological first-order phase transition in a dark sector, fermion dark matter particles $\chi$ can form macroscopic Fermi balls that collapse to primordial black holes (PBHs) under certain conditions. The evaporation of the PBHs produces a boosted $\chi$ flux, which may be detectable if $\chi$ couples to visible matter. We consider the interaction of $\chi$ with electrons, and calculate signals of the dark matter flux in the XENON1T, XENONnT, Super-Kamiokande and Hyper-Kamiokande experiments. A correlated gravitational wave signal from the phase transition can be observed at THEIA and $\mu$Ares. An amount of dark radiation measurable by CMB-S4 is an epiphenomenon of the phase transition.</description>

      <title>Observation of quantum effects on radiation reaction in strong fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12071v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radiation reaction, the force experienced by an accelerated charge due to radiation emission, has long been the subject of extensive theoretical and experimental research. Experimental verification of a quantum, strong-field description of radiation reaction is fundamentally important, and has wide-ranging implications for astrophysics, laser-driven particle acceleration, next-generation particle colliders and inverse-Compton photon sources for medical and industrial applications. However, the difficulty of accessing regimes where strong field and quantum effects dominate inhibited previous efforts to observe quantum radiation reaction in charged particle dynamics with high significance. We report the first high significance (&gt; 5{\sigma}) observation of strong-field radiation reaction on electron spectra where quantum effects are substantial. We obtain the first, quantitative, strong evidence favouring the quantum-continuous and quantum-stochastic models over the classical model; the quantum models perform comparably. The lower electron energy losses predicted by the quantum models accounts for their improved performance. Model comparison was performed using a novel Bayesian framework which has widespread utility for laser-particle collision experiments, including those utilising conventional accelerators, where some collision parameters cannot be measured directly.</description>

      <title>Charged Higgs Boson Phenomenology in the Dark Z mediated Fermionic Dark Matter Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07688v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the phenomenology of the charged Higgs boson $H^\pm$ appearing in a fermionic dark matter model mediated by an additional scalar doublet. In order to couple the dark matter fermion to the scalar doublet, we introduce a U(1)$_X$ gauge symmetry, which is spontaneously broken at electroweak symmetry breaking, resulting in a massive $Z'$ gauge boson. Since $Z'$ is generically light, the model is subject to strong constraints from electroweak precision observables. As a result, the charged Higgs boson mass allowed by current experimental bounds is typically light in this model, 110 GeV $&lt;m_{H^\pm}&lt;$ 170 GeV. Such a light charged Higgs boson will be produced mainly through top-quark decays at the LHC. Additionally, depending on the mass of the additional neutral Higgs boson $h$ and the dark gauge boson $Z'$, the direct production channels $pp \to H^\pm Z'$ and $pp \to H^\pm h$ can become sizable. We investigate the corresponding signal processes at the LHC to assess the discovery potential for $H^\pm$. Current ATLAS and CMS searches for light charged Higgs bosons already impose further constraints on the model. We also discuss the implications of dark matter in relation to the charged Higgs boson phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Analysis of neutrino oscillation parameters in the light on quantum entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerous neutrino experiments have confirmed the phenomenon of neutrino oscillation, providing direct evidence of the quantum mechanical nature of neutrinos. In this work, we investigate the entanglement properties of neutrino flavor states within the framework of three-flavor neutrino oscillation using two major entanglement measures: entanglement of formation (EOF) and concurrence, utilizing the DUNE experimental setup. Our findings indicate that the maximally entangled state appears between $\nu_{\mu}$ and $\nu_{\tau}$ whereas, $\nu_{e}$ behaves as a nearly separable state. To further explore the nature of bipartite entanglement, we introduce the concept of the monogamy of entanglement, which allows us to investigate the distinction between genuine three-flavor entanglement and bipartite entanglement. Our analysis confirms that the three-flavor neutrino system forms a bipartite entanglement structure, adhering to the Coffman-Kundu-Wootters (CKW) inequality. Additionally, we implement a minimization procedure to find the best-fit values of the oscillation parameters that correspond to the concurrence minima at the two specific energy points where the concurrence reaches its lowest values. Using these best-fit values, we probe three fundamental unknowns in neutrino oscillation: CP violation sensitivity, neutrino mass hierarchy, and the octant issue of $\theta_{23}$, across two distinct energy points. Our results manifest that while the best-fit values obtained through concurrence minimization show slightly reduced sensitivity to CP violation compared to current best-fit values, they exhibit greater sensitivity to the mass hierarchy. Furthermore, the study reveals a maximal mixing angle for the atmospheric sector.</description>

      <title>Resonant ALP-Portal Dark Matter Annihilation as a Solution to the $B^{\pm} \to K^{\pm} \nu \bar{\nu}$ Excess</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Belle II collaboration recently reported a $2.7\sigma$ excess in the rare decay $B^\pm \to K^\pm \nu \bar{\nu}$, potentially signaling new physics. We propose an axion-like particle (ALP)-portal dark matter (DM) framework to explain this anomaly while satisfying the observed DM relic abundance. By invoking a resonant annihilation mechanism ($m_a \sim 2m_\chi$), we demonstrate that the ALP-mediated interactions between the Standard Model and DM sectors simultaneously account for the $B^\pm \to K^\pm \nu \bar{\nu}$ anomaly and thermal freeze-out dynamics. Two distinct scenarios-long-lived ALPs decaying outside detectors (displaced diphotons) and ALPs decaying invisibly to DM pairs (missing energy)-are examined. While the displaced diphotons scenario is excluded by kaon decay bounds ($K^\pm \to \pi^\pm + \text{inv.}$), the invisible decay channel remains unconstrained and aligns with Belle II's missing energy signature. Using the coupled Boltzmann equation formalism, we rigorously incorporate early kinetic decoupling effects, revealing deviations up to a factor of 20 from traditional relic density predictions in resonance regions. For the missing energy scenario, the viable parameter space features ALP-SM and ALP-DM couplings: $g_{aWW}(g_{a\gamma\gamma}) \in (7.13 \times 10^{-5} - 9.60 \times 10^{-5})\, \text{GeV}^{-1}$ (from $B^\pm \to K^\pm a$) and $g_{a\chi\chi} \in (7.12\times10^{-5} - 7.73\times 10^{-3})\, \text{GeV}^{-1}$ (for resonant annihilation), accommodating ALP masses $m_a \in (0.6, 4.8)\, \text{GeV}$. Therefore, this work establishes the ALP portal as a viable bridge between the $B^\pm \to K^\pm \nu \bar{\nu}$ anomaly and thermal DM production, emphasizing precision calculations of thermal decoupling in resonance regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18349v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain the electromagnetic pion form factor (emFF) $F_\pi$ for spacelike mid-range of momentum transfer in QCD. We use renormalization group (RG) summation within the light cone sum rules (LCSRs) to obtain the QCD radiative corrections to the $F_\pi$ and involve contributions of the leading twist 2 and,
  twists 4, 6. The additional conditions to apply here this RG summation are discussed in details. The strong coupling constants in this approach are free of Landau singularities, which allows one to go down to the lower transferred momentum $Q^2$. The prediction of the calculations performed reproduces the experimental data below/around $Q^2= 1$~GeV$^2$ significantly better than analogous predictions based on a fixed-order power-series expansion in the standard QCD.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Isocurvature Bounds on the Minimal QCD Axion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The QCD axion has important connections to early universe cosmology. For example, it is often said that isocurvature limits rule out a combination of high axion decay constant, $f_a$, and high inflationary Hubble scale, $H_I$. High scales are theoretically motivated, so it is important to ask how robust this constraint is. We demonstrate that this constraint is naturally evaded when the quartic coupling of the complex $U(1)_\mathrm{PQ}$-breaking field is small. In this case, $f_a$ changes from a larger value during inflation to a smaller value in the later universe, suppressing isocurvature perturbations. Importantly, we show that in large parts of parameter space this solution is not jeopardised by overproduction of the axion through parametric resonance. The isocurvature bounds are thus dependent on UV physics. We have found that, even for the minimal QCD axion, large parts of UV parameter space at both high $f_a$ and high $H_I$ are in fact allowed, not ruled out by isocurvature constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we have systematically explored the mass spectrum of fully strange tetraquark candidates within the framework of QCD sum rules, focusing on states with quantum numbers $J^{PC}=0^{++}$, $0^{-+}$, $0^{--}$, $1^{--}$, $1^{+-}$, and $1^{++}$. The analysis reveals the existence of fully strange tetraquark states with masses ranging from approximately $2.07$ to $3.12$ GeV. These predictions are confronted with existing experimental observations of potential fully strange tetraquark resonances, notably the $X(2300)$ recently reported by the BESIII Collaboration, which may be interpreted as a fully strange tetraquark state. Furthermore, the possible decay modes of these fully strange tetraquark states are analyzed, providing guidance for their identification in current and future high energy experiments such as BESIII, Belle II, and LHCb.</description>

      <title>Boosted dark matter versus dark matter-induced neutrinos from single and stacked blazars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12278v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The physics responsible for the production of observed high-energy neutrinos have not been established so far, neither for the diffuse astrophysical ones nor for those detected from single blazars. We recently proposed that both could be explained by deep inelastic scatterings between sub-GeV dark matter (DM) around blazars and protons within their jets. Here, we compute the proton-recoil signals at the neutrino detectors Super-Kamiokande, KamLAND, Borexino, JUNO, Hyper-Kamiokande and DUNE induced by DM that is itself boosted by the scatterings with protons in blazar jets. We do it for the four cases of vector, axial, scalar and pseudoscalar mediators of DM-quark interactions. We perform the analysis for the single blazar TXS 0506+056 and for a sample of more than 300 stacked blazars. We find that searches for such blazar-boosted DM leave room for a variety of DM models to explain observations of high-energy neutrinos. We check that the depletion of the DM spike induced by DM-proton and DM-DM interactions does not compromise the DM interpretation for high-energy neutrinos, but challenges other blazar-DM signals.</description>

Abstract: Dark matter in the form of macroscopic composites is largely unconstrained at masses of $\sim 10^{11}- 10^{17}$ g. In this mass range, dark matter may collide with planetary bodies, depositing an immense amount of energy and leaving dramatic surface features that remain detectable on geological timescales. In this paper, we show that Ganymede, the largest Jovian moon, provides a prime target to search for dark matter impacts due to its differentiated composition and Gyr-old surface. We study the effects of dark matter collisions with Ganymede first with analytic estimates, finding that in a large region of parameter space, dark matter punches through Ganymede's conductive ice sheet, liberating sub-surface material. This sub-surface material may be compositionally different from the surface ice, providing a key observable with which to discriminate asteroid impacts from those caused by dark matter. We confirm our analytic estimates with dedicated simulations of dark matter impacts using iSALE, a multi-material impact code. We then discuss potential detection prospects with two missions currently en route to the Jovian system, Europa Clipper and JUICE, finding that these missions may have the ability not only to identify signs of life on the Galilean moons, but signs of dark matter as well.</description>

      <title>Flavor physics at high-energy muon colliders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flavor-breaking interactions due to heavy new physics can be probed at a 10 TeV muon collider in the high-energy production of quarks and leptons. The high collision energy mitigates the suppression of the new interactions, offering sensitivity to interaction scales well above 100 TeV both in the lepton and in the quark sector. We investigate all possible deformations of the Standard Model that produce quadratic growth with energy of the four-fermion scattering amplitudes at the muon collider, and we derive sensitivity projections. Electroweak radiation emission gives access to new observable final states like for instance the production of a charged pair of fermions by the emission of at least one W boson. This, combined with jet flavor tagging, improves the sensitivity and the ability to disentangle different interactions. Currently, the best probes of flavor-breaking new physics are high-intensity low-energy measurements of lepton or hadron decays or oscillations. The high-energy probes at the muon collider, of the interactions containing a muon bilinear, are competitive with current bounds and strongly superior for some class of transitions. The sensitivity extends to operators involving the top quark that cannot be tested at low energy. In addition, muon collider probes are generically less exposed to experimental or theoretical mismodeling uncertainties as they do not target the observation of extremely rare phenomena, nor they rely on extremely accurate measurements and theoretical predictions: the energy enhancement makes the putative effects relatively easy to observe. Muon collider measurements offer a novel pathway towards the exploration of flavor physics at the energy rather than at the intensity frontier.</description>

      <title>Semihard interactions at TeV energies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the high-energy behavior of the total cross section, $\sigma_{\text{tot}}$, and the ratio of the real to imaginary parts of the scattering amplitude, $\rho$, in both proton-proton and antiproton-proton channels. Our analysis is based on a QCD-inspired model in which the rise of the cross sections is predominantly driven by semihard processes involving gluons. We address the tension between measurements from the ATLAS/ALFA and TOTEM Collaborations, showing that independent analyses of their datasets can provide statistically consistent descriptions of the overall data, even though they do not fully reproduce the central values of the $\rho$ parameter at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV. The slight discrepancy between these central values and the model's predicted values, obtained using an asymptotic dominant crossing-even elastic scattering amplitude, points to the potential presence of an odd component in the semihard amplitude at high energies.</description>

      <title>Absence of Majorana-Weyl fermions in d=4 and the theory of Majorana fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14998v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is customary to identify $\psi_{+}=\nu_{R} + C\overline{\nu_{R}}^{T}$ with a Majorana fermion on the basis of chirality changing charge conjugation $\tilde{C}: \nu_{R}\rightarrow C\overline{\nu_{R}}^{T}$ and parity $\tilde{P}: \nu_{R}\rightarrow i\gamma^{0}\nu_{R}$. The theorem on the absence of a Majorana-Weyl fermion in $d=4$ states $\tilde{C}\gamma_{5}\tilde{C}^{-1}= -\gamma_{5}$ with $\tilde{C}=C\gamma_{4}^{T}$, and thus the charge conjugation of the equivalent Majorana $\psi_{+}=(\frac{1+\gamma_{5}}{2})\nu_{R} + (\frac{1-\gamma_{5}}{2})C\overline{\nu_{R}}^{T}$ vanishes without subsidiary $\gamma_{5}\rightarrow - \gamma_{5}$, namely, not defined in field theory.
  To be consistent with the theorem, it is common to use a doublet representation of chirality preserving charge conjugation $\hat{C}:\nu_{R,L}\rightarrow C\overline{\nu_{L,R}}^{T}$ and parity $\hat{P}: \nu_{R,L}\rightarrow i\gamma^{0}\nu_{L,R}$ in theory containing both $\nu_{R,L}$. In the type I seesaw model, the latter formulation is applicable but $\psi_{+}=\nu_{R} + C\overline{\nu_{R}}^{T}$ is not a Majorana fermion. An analogue of the Bogoliubov transformation converts $\psi_{\pm}=\nu_{R, L} \pm C\overline{\nu_{R, L}}^{T}$, which are obtained by a precise diagonalization of the seesaw model, to Majorana fermions $\psi_{M_{1,2}}=(\psi \pm C\overline{\psi}^{T})/\sqrt{2}$ with a Dirac-type fermion $\psi$, as originally defined by Majorana. A chiral projection $[(1+\gamma_{5})/2] \psi_{M_{1}}$ of a Majorana fermion is not a chiral fermion, which ensures the presence of the neutrino-less double beta decay.</description>

      <title>Possible mixing between elementary and bound state fields in the $t\bar{t}$ production excess at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16828v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent report by CMS Collaboration on the excess of top and anti-top pair production is studied, under the hypothesis of the coexistence of a toponium $(\eta_t)$ and an additional elementary field $(\Psi)$. We examine the scenario where toponium and an additional field are mixed, and consider the plausible scenarios in that case. Two scenarios are examined: one is the minimal model with $\Psi$ close to the inert Higgs doublet, and the other is embedded into the two Higgs doublet models (2HDM), where $\Psi$ is one of the two Higgs scalars after transforming the basis. The value of the each coupling constant is restricted by the Multicritical Point Principle (MPP). Consistency with the data gives constraints on a mixing angle $\theta\ (-45^\circ\le\theta\le45^\circ)$, with which the mass eigenstate $\Psi^\prime$ contributing to the excess is defined by $\Psi^\prime=\Psi\cos \theta + \eta_t\sin \theta$. The obtained results are $|\theta| \le 13^{\circ}$ for the minimum scenario, and $|\theta| \le 1^{\circ}$ for the second scenario of 2HDM(Type II and Y). We also briefly discuss the comparison with Type I and X.</description>

      <title>Nonleptonic $\Omega_{b}^{*}\rightarrow\Omega_{c}^{*}P(V)$ weak transitions in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20937v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the nonleptonic two-body weak decays of the single bottom baryon $\Omega_{b}^{*}$ into $\Omega_{c}^{*}P(V)$ final states within the factorization framework. Employing this framework and incorporating the contributions from the current-current operators, we compute the tree-level decay amplitudes and decay widths of the $\Omega_{b}^{*}\rightarrow\Omega_{c}^{*}P(V)$ processes in terms of the $\Omega_{b}^{*}\rightarrow\Omega_{c}^{*}$ transition form factors. Here, $P$ and $V$ denote pseudoscalar and vector mesons, respectively. Using the form factors obtained in our previous work, we evaluate the numerical values of the decay widths for the dominant nonleptonic weak channels. This study complements our previous analysis of the semileptonic weak transitions $\Omega_{b}^{*}\rightarrow\Omega_{c}^{*}\ell\bar{\nu}_{\ell}$ reported in Ref. [1], thereby providing a detailed investigation of dominant $\Omega_{b}^{*}\rightarrow\Omega_{c}^{*}$ weak decays of the $\Omega_{b}^{*}$ baryon.</description>

Abstract: The tensor form factors of the $\Delta^+$ baryon are defined through the matrix element of the tensor current and describe its internal structure and spin distribution. We present the full Lorentz decomposition for the $\Delta^+ \rightarrow \Delta^+$ tensor current matrix element, including all independent structures consistent with Lorentz covariance, the Rarita-Schwinger constraints, and the discrete symmetries of Hermiticity, time-reversal, and parity invariance. By investigating the tensor form factors corresponding to both the isovector and isoscalar tensor currents, we observe differences that reflect the distinct contributions of up and down quark components in the $\Delta^+$ baryon.</description>

      <title>Can the 3 neutrino masses really be found using SN 1987A data?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutrino masses remain a significant unsolved problem in physics and their nonzero value proves the Standard Model is incomplete. Currently, the values of the three masses only have upper limits from cosmology and experiments like KATRIN. This paper shows that the SN 1987A neutrino data can remarkably yield values for the three neutrino masses, and not merely upper limits. Although this seemingly preposterous idea was suggested a dozen years ago by the author, here it is demonstrated in a much more convincing manner with many new elements, including a stronger statistical treatment, and a thorough explanation of why the method used to find the three masses from supernova SN 1987A neutrino data really works. The key to finding the three neutrino masses is realizing why three normally accepted assumptions are unjustified, The three rejected assumptions are:(a) the 5-hr early LSD (Mont Blanc) neutrinos are unrelated to SN 1987A, (b) any neutrino masses $m_k&gt;1 eV/c^2$ cannot be reconciled with upper limits on the ``effective mass" from KATRIN and other data, and (c) the spread in neutrino emission times from SN 1987A data is too great for the method to work. A particularly interesting piece of evidence supporting the claim made in the paper's title involves a recent negative KATRIN result finding an absence of sterile neutrinos, which falls into the category of "the dog that didn't bark."</description>

      <title>Delayed Scaling of Multi-Type Cosmic F- and D-strings in VOS Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the velocity-dependent one-scale (VOS) model to the case of one cosmic F-string and two D-strings as color flux tubes in pure Spin($4N$) gauge theory. We analytically calculate the scaling string density as a function of the reconnection probabilities, and confirm our results with numerical calculations. We also determine the timescale at which the string density reaches the scaling regime, and find that for certain values of the reconnection probability, the scaling time can become extremely large, by many orders of magnitude. This leads to a characteristic suppression signature of the gravitational-wave signal at high frequencies, which may become observable in the frequency range of future interferometric gravitational-wave observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel quantum sensing approach to search for axion-electron interactions around the axion mass of 6 \mueV. In this region, laboratory searches are relatively scarce, and our direct experiment measuring the axion-electron coupling constant reaches the sensitivity of 8 \times 10^{-6} GeV^{-1}. The method, based on an organic molecular maser establishes a proof-of-principle for quantum-enhanced detection, with a corresponding magnetic field sensitivity of 0.85 fT/\sqrt{\rm{Hz}}. The methodology is generic and can be readily extended to other physical systems, further broadening its applicability in quantum sensing and dark matter searches.</description>

      <title>Evidence of isospin-symmetry violation in high-energy collisions of atomic nuclei -- Supplementary Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07176v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the NA61/SHINE collaboration at the CERN SPS reported evidence of isospin-symmetry violation in high-energy nuclear collisions [Nature Communications 16, 2849 (2025)]. The effect was observed in the relative yields of charged and neutral kaons and cannot be explained by known sources of isospin symmetry breaking. In this work, we provide supplementary information on the theoretical aspects of that study. We discuss the historical background and introduce the concepts of isospin transformations and symmetry. Importantly, we relate isospin symmetry to the QCD flavour symmetry, and we present both conceptual and analytical proofs demonstrating the equality of the mean multiplicities of charged and neutral kaons for an initial ensemble of colliding systems that is invariant under charge-symmetry transformation.</description>

      <title>Hint of dark matter-dark energy interaction in DESI DR2 and current cosmological dataset?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14247v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present new constraints on an interacting dark matter-dark energy scenario motivated by string compactification, where a scalar field adiabatically tracks the minimum of an effective potential sourced by dark matter density. In this study, we focus on the Chameleon dark energy model and numerically solve the Klein-Gordon equation using a shooting algorithm to determine precise initial conditions such that the field rests at effective potential minima today. We perform a comprehensive Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis using a combination of datasets, including Planck, BAO (SDSS and DESI DR2), Pantheon+, and SH$_0$ES. Our analysis shows a mild preference for a higher non-zero dark sector coupling, compared to earlier works on similar models, for two particular combinations of datasets: (i) Planck + DESI DR2 BAO +.Pantheon+, (ii) Planck + SDSS BAO + Pantheon+ + SH$0$ES. Notably, the inclusion of DESI DR2 and SH$0$ES data increases the inferred interaction strength to $\beta \sim 0.3$ (68\% C.L.) and yields weak and positive evidence in favor of the model over $\Lambda$CDM, with $\Delta\chi^2_{\rm min} = -4.75, -6.41$ and $\Delta$AIC= $-0.75, -2.41$ respectively. This model remains consistent with a phantom crossing at redshift $z\sim 0.5$, in agreement with the trend indicated by DESI observations. However, due to the settlement of the scalar field at the minima of the effective potential at the present epoch, the effective dark energy equation of state asymptotically approaches $w_{\rm eff}\to -1$. leading to only weak evidence in favor of this model when analyzed using the DESI DR2 dataset.</description>

      <title>Constraining primordial black hole abundance with Insight-HXMT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09297v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are a major candidate for dark matter and they have been extensively constrained across most mass ranges. However, PBHs in the mass range of $10^{17}$ - $10^{21}$ g remain a viable explanation for all dark matter. In this work, we use observational data from the Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (Insight-HXMT) to refine constraints on PBHs within the mass range of $2\times10^{16}$ - $5\times10^{17}$ g. Our analysis explores three scenarios: directly using observational data, incorporating the astrophysical background model (ABM), and employing the power-law spectrum with an exponential cutoff. Our results indicate that although Insight-HXMT does not have an advantage in the first two scenarios, when considering the power-law model, its exceptional sensitivity in the hard X-ray regime and sufficiently high upper energy limit significantly strengthen the constraints on PBHs with masses greater than $10^{17}$ g compared to previous limits. Furthermore, the exclusion limit for PBHs as dark matter has reached $4\times10^{17}$ g, which is comparable to the current threshold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The question of whether the massive sterile neutrinos exist remains a crucial unresolved issue in both particle physics and cosmology. We explore the cosmological constraints on the massive sterile neutrinos using the latest observational data, including the baryon acoustic oscillations data from DESI, the cosmic microwave background data from Planck satellite and ACT, and the 5-year Type Ia supernova data and the 3-year weak-lensing data from DES. We search for the massive sterile neutrinos within the $\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, and $w_0w_a$CDM models. Our analysis shows that when considering massive sterile neutrinos within the $w_0w_a\rm CDM$ model, the combined datasets allow us to infer a non-zero sterile neutrino mass at approximately $2\sigma$ confidence level. Specifically, in the $w_0w_a$CDM+Sterile model, the effective mass of sterile neutrinos and the effective number of relativistic species are constrained to be $m_{\nu,\ \mathrm{sterile}}^{\mathrm{eff}} = 0.50^{+0.33}_{-0.27} \, \mathrm{eV}$ and $N_\mathrm{eff} = 3.076^{+0.011}_{-0.017}$, respectively. However, the $\Lambda$CDM+Sterile and $w$CDM+Sterile models could not provide evidence supporting the existence of massive sterile neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Sound waves from primordial black hole formations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a numerical investigation of primordial black hole (PBH) formation from super-horizon curvature perturbations and the subsequent generation and propagation of sound waves, which can serve as a new source of stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWBs) presented in a companion letter. Using the Misner-Sharp formalism with an excision technique, our simulations extend to significantly later times than previous work and indicate that the near-critical perturbations produce a distinct compression wave featuring both overdense and underdense shells, while significantly supercritical perturbations yield only an underdense shell. We also show that a softer equation of state suppresses the formation of compression waves. Furthermore, the comoving thickness of sound shells remains nearly constant during propagation and scales with the Hubble radius at horizon re-entry, thereby serving as a key link between the gravitational-wave peak frequency and PBH mass in the companion letter. These results offer new insights into the dynamics of PBH formation and suggest potential observational signatures of PBHs in the gravitational wave (GW) spectrum from associated sound waves.</description>

      <title>In situ axion generation and detection in laser-plasma wakefield interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a laser-plasma wakefield interaction based scheme for in situ axion generation and detection through the Primakoff process.
  Strong electromagnetic fields ($\gtrsim 10^{11}$\,V/m) in the wakefield can enhance axion production rates by 2 orders of magnitude compared to conventional light-shining-through-a-wall experiments. By replacing the axion generation stage with laser-wakefield interaction, the axion-photon coupling constraints can achieve the level of $\gagg \sim 10^{-10}\,\text{GeV}^{-1}$ for axion mass less than 0.1\,meV.
  Besides, the generated axions can convert back into photons in the background fields, leading to axion-regenerated electromagnetic fields (AREM) with unique polarization, frequency, and transverse modes.
  This provides a new promising way to search axions by detecting the filtered AREM fields from the background laser and plasma fields.</description>

      <title>The Possibility of Formation of Compact Boson Stars via Cosmological Evolution of a Background Scalar Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Boson stars, hypothetical astrophysical objects bound by the self-gravity of a scalar field, have been widely studied as a type of exotic compact object that is horizonless and provides a testing ground for physics beyond the Standard Model. In particular, many previous works have demonstrated methods for distinguishing compact boson stars from black holes in general relativity through gravitational wave observations. However, the formation scenario of compact boson stars within the age of the universe remains unclear. In this paper, we explore a possible scenario for the formation of compact boson stars. The model we consider requires two coupled scalar fields: a complex scalar field that forms a boson star and a spatially homogeneous background field, as formation of a compact boson star cannot be achieved in a single filed model. Using the adiabatic approximation, we show that non-relativistic boson clouds can evolve into compact boson stars through the cosmological time-evolution of the background field. In our model the background field evolves to increase the effective mass of the scalar field, and as a result compact boson stars can form within the cosmological timescale, if the variation of the background field is as large as the Planck scale. However, further investigation is required because the required initial states are not the configurations that can be described by the well-studied Schr\"odinger-Poisson system.</description>

      <title>LaMET's Asymptotic Extrapolation vs. Inverse Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-Momentum Effective Theory (LaMET) is a physics-guided systematic expansion to calculate light-cone parton distributions, including collinear (PDFs) and transverse-momentum-dependent ones, at any fixed momentum fraction $x$ within a range of $[x_{\rm min}, x_{\rm max}]$. It theoretically solves the ill-posed inverse problem that afflicts other theoretical approaches to collinear PDFs, such as short-distance factorizations. Recently, arXiv:2504.17706 [1] raised practical concerns about whether current or even future lattice data will have sufficient precision in the sub-asymptotic correlation region to support an error-controlled extrapolation -- and if not, whether it becomes an inverse problem where the relevant uncertainties cannot be properly quantified. While we agree that not all current lattice data have the desired precision to qualify for an asymptotic extrapolation, some calculations do, and more are expected in the future. We comment on the analysis and results in Ref. [1] and argue that a physics-based systematic extrapolation still provides the most reliable error estimates, even when the data quality is not ideal. In contrast, re-framing the long-distance asymptotic extrapolation as a data-driven-only inverse problem with ad hoc mathematical conditioning could lead to unnecessarily conservative errors.</description>

      <title>Effects of Lorentz invariance violation on charged particles and photon production in astrophysical sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06766v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) on radiation processes in astrophysical sources, focusing on synchrotron and inverse Compton interactions. We derive modified expressions for radiated power and photon energy under LIV assumptions and incorporate them into first-order Fermi acceleration models. Our analysis reveals energy thresholds beyond which LIV, within a kinematic framework, significantly alters particle dynamics and photon spectra, introducing non-physical divergences that highlight limitations in perturbative approaches. We model synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission in the presence of LIV and assess its consequences for photon fluxes from blazars, including Markarian 501 and the BL Lac population. LIV introduces distinct high-energy emission regions that deviate from standard expectations. Comparisons with observational data, particularly upper limits from the Pierre Auger Observatory, suggest that future multi-messenger observations, together with the full analysis of particle's trajectories, could constrain LIV parameters through the non-detection of such excesses.</description>

      <title>Lattice study of scattering phase shifts for $DD^*$ and $BB^*$ systems using twisted boundary conditions: Search for bound state formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the $S$- and $P$-wave phase shifts for the $DD^\ast$ and $BB^\ast$ scatterings using L\"uscher's finite-size method under twisted boundary conditions to search for doubly charmed tetraquaks, $T_{cc}^+$, and doubly bottomed tetraquarks, $T_{bb}^-$ as the hadronic bound states. The $T_{cc}^+$ state was observed as a peak just bellow the $DD^*$ threshold by LHCb Collaboration, while the $T_{bb}^-$ state is a theoretically predicted tetraquark state having heavier quark flavors $bb\bar u \bar d$. L\"uscher's finite-size method is one of the well established methods for calculating the scattering phase shifts between two hadrons in lattice QCD simulations. Several studies have used simulations under the periodic boundary condition to determine the scattering phase shifts at a few discrete momenta for the $DD^*$ system. However, the scattering phase shift has not been investigated for the $BB^*$ system. In this study, $S$- and $P$-wave scattering phase shifts for the $DD^*$ and $BB^*$ systems in both $I=0$ and $I=1$ channels under several types of partially twisted boundary conditions. The use of the partially twisted boundary conditions enables us to obtain the scattering phase shift at any momentum by continuously varying the twisting angle. It also allows us to easily access the $P$-wave scattering phase shifts through the mixing of $S$- and $P$-waves, which is induced by the imposed boundary conditions. The 2+1 flavor PACS-CS gauge ensembles at $m_\pi=295$, 411 and 569 MeV are used. For charm and bottom quarks, the relativistic heavy quark action is adopted to reduce the lattice discretization artifacts due to the heavy quark mass. We discuss the emergence of a shallow bound state with a binding energy of $O(100)$ keV at the physical pion mass in the $BB^*$ system, which has the quantum number $I(J^P)=0(1^+)$.</description>

      <title>Eccentricity signatures in LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's BNS and NSBH binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measurement of eccentricity in low-mass binary systems through gravitational waves is crucial to distinguish between various formation channels. Detecting eccentricity in these systems is challenging due to a lack of accurate eccentric waveform models and the high computational cost of Bayesian inferences. We access the eccentricities of six previously observed low-mass gravitational wave events using publicly available data from the first four observing runs of the LIGO and Virgo collaboration. We analyze the events using the new eccentric waveform model, SEOBNRv5EHM, and compare our results with the existing model, TEOBResumS-Dali. We also present the first eccentricity constraints for GW190814. To improve accuracy, we include higher-order modes in both models and optimize inference using efficient marginalization and parallelization techniques. We find that GW200105 exhibits non-negligible eccentricity, with a measured eccentricity of $e=0.135^{+0.019}_{-0.088}$ at 20 Hz (90% credible level) for TEOBResumS-Dali and $e=0.125^{+0.029}_{-0.082}$ for SEOBNRv5EHM, given a uniform eccentricity prior from 0 to 0.2. This provides moderate support for the eccentric hypothesis, with a Bayes factor of $\sim6-7$ in favor of the eccentric model. With a uniform log prior on eccentricity, the Bayes factor is reduced to 2.35. The remaining five sources are consistent with low eccentricity, with 90% upper limits from $e \leq 0.011$ to $e \leq 0.066$. We find no support for non-negligible eccentricity in GW190814. Finally, we discuss the challenges of performing Bayesian inference in eccentric, multi-modal parameter spaces, including issues related to sampling efficiency and waveform systematics.</description>

      <title>Out-of-Equilibrium Dynamics in a U(1) Lattice Gauge Theory via Local Information Flows: Scattering and String Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16101v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce local information flows as a diagnostic tool for characterizing out-of-equilibrium quantum dynamics in lattice gauge theories. We employ the information lattice framework, a local decomposition of total information into spatial- and scale-resolved contributions, to characterize the propagation and buildup of quantum correlations in real-time processes. Focusing on the Schwinger model, a canonical $(1+1)$-dimensional U(1) lattice gauge theory, we apply this framework to two scenarios. First, in the near-threshold scattering of two vector mesons, we demonstrate that the emergence of correlations at a longer length scale in the information lattice marks the production of heavier scalar mesons. Second, in the dynamics of electric field strings, we clearly distinguish between the confining regime, which evolves towards a steady state with a static correlation profile, and the string-breaking sector. The latter is characterized by dynamic correlation patterns that reflect the sequential formation and annihilation of strings. This information-centric approach provides a direct, quantitative, and interpretable visualization of complex many-body phenomena, offering a promising tool for analyzing dynamics in higher-dimensional gauge theories and experiments on quantum hardware.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15815v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The textbook N=1 supergravity has an F-term potential depending on a superpotential $W(z_i)$ and a Kahler potential $K(z^i, \bar z^{\bar i})$, with the scalar potential $V(z^i, \bar z^{\bar i})=e^K (|DW|^2 - 3 |W|^2)$. In this approach, it is not always easy to find the potential $V(z^i, \bar z^{\bar i})$ with the required properties. We show that in supergravity with a nilpotent superfield and with any Kahler potential $K(z^i, \bar z^{\bar i} )$ one can obtain any desired potential $V(z^i, \bar z^{\bar i})$ by a proper choice of the Kahler metric of the nilpotent superfield. This construction is particularly suitable for cosmological and particle physics applications, which may require maximal freedom in the choice of kinetic terms and scalar potentials.</description>

      <title>Quantum Walks and Exact RG in de Sitter Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The local physics of light scalar fields in de Sitter space is well described by classical random walks, as expressed through the framework of Stochastic Inflation. Recent work has clarified how this formalism arises from quantum field theory (QFT) and the renormalization group (RG), allowing for corrections to this formalism to be determined order by order. Yet, this description is incomplete. For example, the quantum dynamics of these fields are expected to become important when determining the tail of the probability distribution for the fluctuations. In this paper, we develop the understanding of fields in de Sitter as a quantum walk in order to bridge the gap between the classical and quantum description. We use the framework of exact RG to calculate the evolution equation for the reduced density matrix of the long wavelength fields. This master equation provides the direct map from light fields to models of quantum walks. We show how to reduce the master equation to Stochastic Inflation, and provide a new understanding of how the higher-order corrections arise. In the process, we demonstrate that divergences and secular growth in de Sitter, for both light and heavy fields, can be absorbed by (dynamical) renormalization.</description>
