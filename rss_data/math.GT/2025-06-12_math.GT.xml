      <title>Augmented links, shadow links, and the TV volume conjecture: a geometric perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For hyperbolic 3-manifolds, the growth rate of their Turaev-Viro invariants, evaluated at a certain root of unity, is conjectured to give the hyperbolic volume of the manifold. This has been verified for a handful of examples and several infinite families of link complements, including fundamental shadow links. Fundamental shadow links lie in connected sums of copies of $S^1\times S^2$, and their complements are built of regular ideal octahedra. Another well-known family of links with complements built of regular ideal octahedra are the octahedral fully augmented links in the 3-sphere. The complements of these links are now known to be homeomorphic to complements of fundamental shadow links, using topological techniques. In this paper, we give a new, geometric proof that complements of octahedral fully augmented links are isometric to complements of fundamental shadow links. We then use skein theoretic techniques to determine formulae for coloured Jones polynomials of these links. In the case of no half-twists, this gives a new, more geometric verification of the Turaev-Viro volume conjecture for these links.</description>

      <title>Positivity of simplicial volume for closed nonpositively curved four-manifolds with nonzero Euler characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, by employing the Gauss-Bonnet theorem for Riemannian simplices due to Allendoerfer and Weil, we show that if a closed nonpositively curved $4$-manifold has nonzero Euler characteristic, then its simplicial volume is necessarily positive. This result partially resolves conjectures posed by Connell-Ruan-Wang and Gromov concerning the relationship between the simplicial volume and the Euler characteristic for four-dimensional manifolds. As an application, we show that if a closed nonpositively curved $4$-manifold has negative Ricci curvature, then its simplicial volume is positive, thereby confirming in dimension four another conjecture of Gromov on the positivity of simplicial volume.</description>

      <title>The torsion order in knot Floer homology is multiplicative for L-space knots under cabling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The knot Floer order $\operatorname{Ord}(K)$ is a knot invariant derived from the knot Floer homology. It bounds many invariants that are difficult to calculate. For all L-space cables of L-space knots, we prove that $\operatorname{Ord}(K) + 1$ is multiplicative in $p$ when $g(K) &gt; 1$. The same holds for $g(K) = 1$, provided $q &gt; 2p$. We further compute the knot Floer torsion order in the range $p &lt; q &lt; 2p$, thereby determining $\operatorname{Ord}(K_{p,q})$ from $\operatorname{Ord}(K)$ for all L-space cables of L-space knots. We discuss possible applications to the BB-conjecture.</description>

      <title>Crossing numbers of dense graphs on surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide upper and lower bounds on the crossing numbers of dense graphs on surfaces, which match up to constant factors. First, we prove that if $G$ is a dense enough graph with $m$ edges and $\Sigma$ is a surface of genus $g$, then any drawing of $G$ on $\Sigma$ incurs at least $\Omega \left(\frac{m^2}{g} \log ^2 g\right)$ crossings. The poly-logarithmic factor in this lower bound is new even in the case of complete graphs and disproves a conjecture of Shahrokhi, Sz\'ekely and Vrt'o from 1996. Then we prove a geometric converse to this lower bound: we provide an explicit family of hyperbolic surfaces such that for any graph $G$, sampling the vertices uniformly at random on this surface and connecting them with shortest paths yields $O\left(\frac{m^2}{g} \log ^2 g\right)$ crossings in expectation.</description>

      <title>The Thurston norm of graph manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Thurston norm of a closed oriented graph manifold is a sum of absolute values of linear functionals, and either each or none of the top-dimensional faces of its unit ball are fibered. We show that, conversely, every norm that can be written as a sum of absolute values of linear functionals with rational coefficients is the nonvanishing Thurston norm of some graph manifold, with respect to a rational basis on its second real homology. Moreover, we can choose such graph manifold either to fiber over the circle or not. In particular, every symmetric polygon with rational vertices is the unit polygon of the nonvanishing Thurston norm of a graph manifold fibering over the circle. In dimension $\ge 3$ many symmetric polyhedra with rational vertices are not realizable as nonvanishing Thurston norm ball of any graph manifold. However, given such a polyhedron, we show that there is always a graph manifold whose nonvanishing Thurston norm ball induces a finer partition into cones over the faces.</description>

      <title>Rep-Tiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An $n$-dimensional rep-tile is a compact, connected submanifold of $\mathbb{R}^n$ with non-empty interior which can be decomposed into pairwise isometric rescaled copies of itself whose interiors are disjoint. We show that every smooth compact $n$-dimensional submanifold of $\mathbb{R}^n$ with connected boundary is topologically isotopic to a polycube that tiles the $n$-cube, and hence is topologically isotopic to a rep-tile. Consequently, there is a rep-tile in the homotopy type of any finite CW complex. In addition to classifying rep-tiles in all dimensions up to isotopy, we also give new explicit constructions of rep-tiles in all dimensions, including examples in the homotopy type of any finite bouquet of spheres.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Anosov flows on hyperbolic L-spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that for each $n\in\mathbb{N}$ there is a hyperbolic L-space with $n$ pseudo-Anosov flows, no two of which are orbit equivalent. These flows have no perfect fits and are thus quasigeodesic. In addition, our flows admit positive Birkhoff sections, which we argue implies that they give rise to $n$ universally tight contact structures whose lifts to any finite cover are non-contactomorphic. This argument involves cylindrical contact homology together with the work of Barthelm\'e, Frankel, and Mann on the reconstruction of pseudo-Anosov flows from their closed orbits. These results answer more general versions of questions posed by Calegari and by Min and Nonino.</description>

      <title>$\pi_1$-injective bounding and application to 3- and 4-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Suppose a closed oriented $n$-manifold $M$ bounds an oriented $(n+1)$-manifold. It is known that $M$ $\pi_1$-injectively bounds an oriented $(n+1)$-manifold $W$. We prove that $\pi_1(W)$ can be residually finite if $\pi_1(M)$ is, and $\pi_1(W)$ can be finite if $\pi_1(M)$ is. In particular, each closed 3-manifold $M$ $\pi_1$-injectively bounds a 4-manifold with residually finite $\pi_1$, and bounds a 4-manifold with finite $\pi_1$ if $\pi_1(M)$ is finite. Applications to 3- and 4-manifolds are given:
  (1) We study finite group actions on closed 4-manifolds and $\pi_1$-isomorphic cobordism of 3-dimensional lens spaces. Results including: (a) Two lens spaces are $\pi_1$-isomorphic cobordant if and only if there is a degree one map between them. (b) Each spherical 3-manifold $M\ne S^3$ can be realized as the unique non-free orbit type for a finite group action on a closed 4-manifold.
  (2) The minimal bounding index $O_b(M)$ for closed 3-manifolds $M$ are defined, %and bounding Euler charicteristic $\chi_b(M)$. the relations between finiteness of $O_b(M)$ and virtual achirality of aspherical (hyperbolic) $M$ are addressed. We calculate $O_b(M)$ for some lens spaces $M$. Each prime is realized as a minimal bounding index.
  (3) We also discuss some concrete examples:Surface bundle often bound surface bundles, and prime 3-manifolds often virtually bound surface bundles, $W$ bounded by some lens spaces realizing $O_b$ is constructed.</description>

      <title>Friedman-Ramanujan functions in random hyperbolic geometry and application to spectral gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.02678v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This two-part paper studies the Weil-Petersson measure on the moduli space of compact hyperbolic surfaces of genus $g$. In this first part, we define "volume functions" $V_g^{T}(l)$ associated with arbitrary topological types $T$ of closed geodesics, generalising the "volume polynomials" studied by M. Mirzakhani for simple closed geodesics. Our programme is to study the structure of these functions, focusing on their behaviour as a function of $l$ in the limit $g\rightarrow +\infty$.
  In this first article, motivated by J. Friedman's work on random graphs, we prove that volume functions admit asymptotic expansions to any order in powers of $1/g$, and claim that the coefficients in these expansions belong to a newly-introduced class of functions called "Friedman-Ramanujan functions". We prove the claim for closed geodesics filling a surface of Euler characteristic $0$ and $-1$. This result is then applied to prove that a random hyperbolic surface has spectral gap $\geq 2/9-\epsilon$ with high probability as $g \rightarrow +\infty$, using the trace method and cancellation properties of Friedman--Ramanujan functions.</description>

      <title>Complex affine spheres and a Bers theorem for SL(3,C)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15287v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For $S$ a closed surface of genus at least $2$, let $\mathrm{Hit}_3(S)$ be the Hitchin component of representations to $\mathrm{SL}(3,\mathbb{R}),$ equipped with the Labourie-Loftin complex structure. We construct a mapping class group equivariant holomorphic map from a large open subset of $\mathrm{Hit}_3(S)\times \overline{\mathrm{Hit}_3(S)}$ to the $\mathrm{SL}(3,\mathbb{C})$-character variety that restricts to the identity on the diagonal and to Bers' simultaneous uniformization on $\mathrm{T}(S)\times \overline{\mathrm{T}(S)}$. The open subset contains $\mathrm{Hit}_3(S)\times \overline{\mathrm{T}(S)}$ and $\mathrm{T}(S)\times \overline{\mathrm{Hit}_3(S)}$, and the image includes the holonomies of $\mathrm{SL}(3,\mathbb{C})$-opers.
  The map is realized by associating pairs of Hitchin representations to immersions into $\mathbb{C}^3$ that we call complex affine spheres, which are equivalent to certain conformal harmonic maps into $\mathrm{SL}(3,\mathbb{C})/\mathrm{SO}(3,\mathbb{C})$ and to new objects called bi-Higgs bundles. Complex affine spheres are obtained by solving a second-order complex elliptic PDE that resembles both the Beltrami and Tzitz\'eica equations. To study this equation we establish analytic results that should be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Can Yang-Baxter imply Lie algebra?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum knot invariants (like colored HOMFLY-PT or Kauffman polynomials) are a distinguished class of non-perturbative topological invariants. Any known way to construct them (via Chern-Simons theory or quantum R-matrix) starts with a finite simple Lie algebra. Another set of knot invariants - of finite type - is related to quantum invariants via a perturbative expansion. However can all finite type invariants be obtained in this way? Investigating this problem, P. Vogel discovered a way to polynomially parameterize the expansion coefficients with three parameters so that, at different specific values, this reproduces the answers for all simple Lie (super)algebras. Then it is easy to construct a polynomial $P_{alg}$ that vanishes for all simple Lie algebras, and the corresponding Vassiliev invariant would thus be absent from the perturbative expansion.
  We review these Vogel claims pointing out at least two interesting implications of his construction. First, we discuss whether infinite-dimensional Lie algebras might enlarge Chern-Simons theory. Second, Vogel's construction implies an alternative axiomatization of simple Lie algebras - when we start from knot invariants and arrive at Lie algebras and their classification, which is opposite to conventional logic that we mentioned at the beginning.</description>
