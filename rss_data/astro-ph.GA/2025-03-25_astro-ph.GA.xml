      <title>Comprehensive Analysis of Middle-Aged Open Cluster NGC 6793 in Vulpecula via Gaia DR3 Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conducted an in-depth analysis of NGC 6793 open cluster via Gaia DR3 data, including astrometric, spectroscopic, and photometric measurements. Selection of 147 stars, which show membership probabilities $P\geq0.5$ were classified as likely members. The mean trigonometric parallaxes and proper-motion components of the cluster were found to be $\varpi = 1.674 \pm0.045$ mas and ($\mu_{\alpha}\cos \delta$,~$\mu_{\delta}$) =($3.814\pm0.031$,~$3.547\pm0.034$) mas yr$^{-1}$. Fundamental astrophysical parameters of NGC 6793 are derived simultaneously as $t$ = $650 \pm 50$ Myr, $\mu$ = $9.508\pm0.070$ mag, and $E(G_{\rm BP}-G_{\rm RP})$ = $0.361 \pm 0.035$ mag. Additionally, the cluster's luminosity function analysis reveals the $G$-absolute magnitude limit of the most likely stars, indicating a well-defined stellar population. The total mass of the cluster, determined through the mass function (MF) and considering stars with membership probabilities $P \geq 0.5$, was estimated as 139 $\pm$ 12 $M/M_{\odot}$. The slope of the MF was found to be $\Gamma = 1.40 \pm 0.26$, a result consistent with the Salpeter value. The kinematic analyses present velocity ellipsoid parameters as well as the convergent point $(A_{\rm o},~D_{\rm o}) = \left(85^{\circ}.85 \pm 0^{\circ}.11,~3^{\circ}.12 \pm 0^{\circ}.57\right)$. Analyses have shown that it is moving in a box-shaped orbit beyond the Sun's galactic radius and belongs to the thin disk population of the Milky Way. The calculated relaxation time suggests that NGC 6793 has reached a dynamically relaxed state, where the dynamical evolution parameter $\tau$ significantly exceeds one. These results highlight both the cluster's internal stability and its connection to the thin disc population.</description>

      <title>Jet-mode feedback in NGC 5972: insights from resolved MUSE, GMRT and VLA observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NGC 5972, a Voorwerp galaxy, features a helical-shaped extended emission-line region (EELR) with a radius &gt; 10 kpc and a S-shaped radio structure spanning about 470 kpc. We use VLT MUSE, GMRT, and VLA to study the stellar and ionized gas kinematics and how the radio jet influences the gas in the galaxy. Our sensitive radio observations detect the southern jet for the first time, roughly coinciding with the southern EELR. The VLA images show a continuous inner jet connected to the outer E-W lobe, confirming the jet origin of the radio emission. Our kinematic analysis shows spatial correlations between the radio jet and the outflowing gas, supporting the jet-driven feedback mechanism. More interestingly, we observe enhanced velocity dispersion in the perpendicular direction along with a shell-like structure. Our BPT analysis shows that the [O III] emission overlapping with the radio jet is consistent with the shock+precursor model, whereas in the perpendicular region, a pure shock model fits well with the observations, indicating jet-induced shocks. Radio observations indicate episodic AGN activity characterized by surface brightness and spectral index discontinuities. Overall, based on our findings, we propose a jet-driven feedback mechanism as one of the key factors in the formation of the EELR in NGC 5972. Future high-resolution radio observations will be crucial to further investigate the origin of the EELR and quantify the extent to which the jet influences its formation and evolution.</description>

      <title>The robust detection and spatial distribution of acetaldehyde in Orion KL: ALMA observations and chemical modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the organic molecule inventory detected in Orion KL, acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) -- one of the most ubiquitous interstellar aldehydes -- has not been firmly identified with mm-wave interferometry. We analyze extensive ALMA archival datasets (142-355 GHz) to search for acetaldehyde, revealing two distinct acetaldehyde emission peaks and one component with more complex kinematic structures. One peak aligns with MF10/IRc2, where emissions of other O-bearing complex organic molecules are rarely reported, while the other is coincident with the ethanol peak in the hot core-SW. The MF10/IRc2 detection suggests unique chemistry, possibly influenced by repeated heating events. In contrast, co-detection with ethanol indicates an ice origin and suggests a potential chemical relationship between the two species. We determined acetaldehyde column densities and its kinetic temperatures toward these two peaks under LTE assumptions and compare its distribution with ethanol and other molecules that have an aldehyde (HCO) group, such as methyl formate, glycolaldehyde, and formic acid. Toward the ethanol peak, observed abundance ratios between HCO-containing species are analyzed using a chemical model. The model suggests two key points: 1) the destruction of ethanol to form acetaldehyde in the ice may contribute to the observed correlation between the two species, 2) a long cold-collapse timescale and a methyl formate binding energy similar to or lower than water are needed to explain the observations. The relative abundance ratios obtained from the model are highly sensitive to the assumed kinetic temperature, which accounts for the high spatial variability of the aldehyde ratios observed toward Orion KL.</description>

      <title>MEGA Mass Assembly with JWST: The MIRI EGS Galaxy and AGN Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the MIRI EGS Galaxy and AGN (MEGA) survey, a four band MIRI survey with 25 pointing in the Extended Groth Strip (EGS) extragalactic field. Three of the pointings utilized only the three reddest bands (F1000W, F1500W, F2100W) while the remainder of the pointings also add a blue filter (F770W). MEGA builds upon the existing observations in the EGS field by providing MIRI imaging for 68.9% of CEERS NIRCam imaging, filling a cruciality gap in order to understand galaxy evolution by observing the obscured Universe. Here, we present the technical design, data reduction, photometric catalog creation, the first data release, and science drivers of the MEGA survey. Our data reduction starts with the standard JWST calibration pipeline, but adds additional warm pixel masking and custom background subtraction steps to improve the quality of the final science image. We estimate the image depth of the reduced mosaics and present new galaxy number counts in four MIRI bands.</description>

      <title>Studying Binary Systems in Omega Centauri with MUSE: II. Observational constraints on the orbital period distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Omega Centauri ($\omega$ Cen) is one of the most complex star clusters in the Milky Way, and likely the stripped nucleus of an accreted dwarf galaxy. Being the subject of debate between it hosting an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) or a collection of stellar-mass black holes (BHs) in its center, $\omega$ Cen has been intensively studied over the past decades. Our work focuses on characterizing the properties of binary systems in $\omega$ Cen via multi-epoch MUSE spectroscopic observations spanning over eight years and covering much of its central regions (i.e. core radius). We did not detect any stellar-mass BHs candidates orbiting luminous stars, although mock samples indicate a high sensitivity of our survey to such systems. This suggests that BHs orbiting stars may be rare in $\omega$ Cen or in wide orbits around low-mass companions (where our survey is 50% complete) or that the periods of such systems are longer than expected from cluster dynamics. Additionally, we constrained the orbital properties of 19 binary systems in the cluster, with periods ranging from fractions of a day up to several hundred days. We observe an excess of binaries with P $\ge$ 10 d and find evidence that the intrinsic period distribution of binaries in $\omega$ Cen differs from those predicted by cluster evolutionary models.</description>

      <title>The impact of assembly history on the X-ray detectability of halos. From galaxy groups to galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy groups represent a significant fraction of the halo population, playing a crucial role in galaxy formation and evolution. However, their detection in X-rays remains challenging, raising questions about the physical mechanisms driving their detectability in current surveys.
  Using the Magneticum simulations, we construct a mock X-ray lightcone of the local Universe ($z&lt;0.2$) to investigate the selection function of galaxy groups and clusters. We find that AGN activity is a key driver of baryon depletion, but late-time mergers boost X-ray brightness by replenishing the gas reservoir in the halos, highlighting the interplay between feedback processes and the environment. Our analysis shows that X-ray bright groups experience sustained late-time mass accretion, maintaining higher gas fractions and fueling the central supermassive black holes (SMBH), further increasing the X-ray emissivity in the core. In contrast, X-ray faint groups form earlier and lose most of their gas over time, resembling fossil groups.
  Magneticum predicts strong anti-correlations between gas fraction (or X-ray luminosity) and SMBH mass, stellar mass (both in the central galaxy and intracluster light), and group richness at fixed halo mass. We derive predictions on the hot gas fraction at fixed halos mass (e.g. a group of total mass $M_{500}=10^{13} M_{\odot}$ can have hot gas fractions in the range $f_\mathrm{gas}=0.02-0.06$ and a central SMBH with a median mass of $M_\mathrm{BH}=10^9 M_{\odot}$ and a scatter of $0.5$ dex) compatible with the most recent measurements of the baryonic fraction. These findings will aid the interpretation of future X-ray surveys, demonstrating the power of simulation-based inference.</description>

      <title>Turbulent dynamos in a collapsing cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The amplification of magnetic fields is crucial for understanding the observed magnetization of stars and galaxies. Turbulent dynamo is the primary mechanism responsible for that but the understanding of its action in a collapsing environment is still rudimentary and relies on limited numerical experiments. We develop an analytical framework and perform numerical simulations to investigate the behavior of small-scale and large-scale dynamos in a collapsing turbulent cloud. This approach is also applicable to expanding environments and facilitates the application of standard dynamo theory to evolving systems. Using a supercomoving formulation of the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations, we demonstrate that dynamo action in a collapsing background leads to a super-exponential growth of magnetic fields in time, significantly faster than the exponential growth seen in stationary turbulence. The enhancement is mainly due to the increasing eddy turnover rate during the collapse, which boosts the instantaneous growth rate of the dynamo. We also show that the final saturated magnetic field strength exceeds the expectation from considerations of pure flux-freezing or energy equipartition with the turbulence, scaling as $B \propto \rho^{5/6}$, where $\rho$ is the cloud density. Apart from establishing a formal framework for the studies of magnetic field evolution in collapsing (or expanding) turbulent plasmas, these findings have significant implications for early star and galaxy formation, suggesting that magnetic fields can be amplified to dynamically relevant strengths much earlier than previously thought.</description>

      <title>Flipping of the tidal tails of the Ophiuchus stream due to the decelerating Galactic bar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ophiuchus stellar stream presents a puzzle due to its complicated morphology, with a substructure perpendicular to the main track (spur), a broadened tail (fanning), and a shorter than expected angular extent given its old stellar population and short orbital period. The location of the stream approaches the Galactic center, implying a possible connection between its orbit and its unusual morphology. Here we demonstrate that the morphology of Ophiuchus can be attributed to its interaction with the decelerating Galactic bar, which leads to the flipping or transposition of its tidal tails. The short length of the stream is the result of stars stripped in the ancient past still remaining concentrated, and the spur, as well as the fanning, are composed of either leading or trailing tails built up of stars released at different time intervals. Our new spectroscopic data, obtained as part of the Southern Stellar Stream Spectroscopic Survey $(S^5)$, and modeling of Ophiuchus indicate that, in the presence of the bar, an initial leading tail can be redistributed to the trailing side and vice versa, and the morphology of a stream can be reshaped. This result confirms that the Galactic bar plays a vital role in reconstructing the orbital behavior of streams passing close to the central region of the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Growing 3D clouds from 2D maps via full spherization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a novel framework for constructing three-dimensional (3D) objects from two-dimensional (2D) maps, tailored for the analysis of complex structures in the interstellar medium (ISM). The framework extends the Abel transform and the AVIATOR algorithm. By expanding medial-axis trees along the $z$-coordinate and transforming circular components into spheres, we generate 3D objects from 2D flux slices while preserving key structural features such as filament intersections, the spatial distribution of bright cores, and filamentary twists. The framework introduces multiple expansion strategies--random, fiducial, and physical--allowing for different interpretations of the underlying 3D structures. While the column density probability density function (PDF) remains largely invariant across different construction methods, the high degree of freedom in the 3D expansion poses challenges in accurately recovering true spatial configurations in complex regions. Our work provides a flexible, extensible platform for exploring the 3D organization of ISM structures, with potential applications in star formation and molecular cloud analysis.</description>

      <title>The fifth data release of the Kilo Degree Survey: Multi-epoch optical/NIR imaging covering wide and legacy-calibration fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the final data release of the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS-DR5), a public European Southern Observatory (ESO) wide-field imaging survey optimised for weak gravitational lensing studies. We combined matched-depth multi-wavelength observations from the VLT Survey Telescope and the VISTA Kilo-degree INfrared Galaxy (VIKING) survey to create a nine-band optical-to-near-infrared survey spanning $1347$ deg$^2$. The median $r$-band $5\sigma$ limiting magnitude is 24.8 with median seeing $0.7^{\prime\prime}$. The main survey footprint includes $4$ deg$^2$ of overlap with existing deep spectroscopic surveys. We complemented these data in DR5 with a targeted campaign to secure an additional $23$ deg$^2$ of KiDS- and VIKING-like imaging over a range of additional deep spectroscopic survey fields. From these fields, we extracted a catalogue of $126\,085$ sources with both spectroscopic and photometric redshift information, which enables the robust calibration of photometric redshifts across the full survey footprint. In comparison to previous releases, DR5 represents a $34\%$ areal extension and includes an $i$-band re-observation of the full footprint, thereby increasing the effective $i$-band depth by $0.4$ magnitudes and enabling multi-epoch science. Our processed nine-band imaging, single- and multi-band catalogues with masks, and homogenised photometry and photometric redshifts can be accessed through the ESO Archive Science Portal.</description>

      <title>The metal-poorest tail of the Galactic halo: hypothesis on its origin from precise spectral analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of the Galactic halo is one of the fundamental topics linking the study of galaxy formation and evolution to cosmology. We aim at deriving precise and accurate stellar parameters, Mg abundances, and ages for a sample of metal-poor stars with [Fe/H] $&lt;$ -2 dex from high signal-to-noise and high resolution spectra. We derive effective temperatures from H$\alpha$ profiles using three-dimensional non local thermodynamic equilibrium (3D NLTE) models, and surface gravities and ages from isochrone fitting based on Gaia data. Iron abundances were derived in one-dimensional (1D) NLTE, while Mg abundances were derived in 1D LTE, 1D NLTE, 3D LTE, and 3D NLTE to show the increasing level of accuracy. The stars show a tight trend in the [Mg/Fe] vs [Fe/H] plane with a knee at [Fe/H]$\sim$ -2.8 dex, which indicates a low level of stochasticity. Their location in the Lindblad diagram confirms their belonging to the Galactic halo, but does not show a distinct clustering that might be expected for a merger with a single low-mass galaxy. Comparison with chemical evolution models is also not definitive on whether the sample stars were born in-situ or in accreted low-mass galaxy mergers. We find two plausible explanations for the chemical sequence traced by the stars in the [Mg/Fe] vs [Fe/H] plane. One is that the sample stars originated in the already formed Milky Way, which at that time (12.5 Gyr ago) was already the main galaxy of its Local Group surroundings. Another one is that the sample stars originated in several small galaxies with similar properties, which later merged with the Galaxy. Only accurate spectroscopic analysis such as that done here can reveal trustworthy chemical diagrams required to observe the traces of the Galaxy evolution. Other elements are required to discern between the two hypotheses.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves from binary neutron star mergers provide insights into dense matter physics and strong-field gravity, but waveform modeling remains computationally challenging. We develop a deep generative model for gravitational waveforms from BNS mergers, covering the late inspiral, merger, and ringdown, incorporating precession and tidal effects. Using the conditional autoencoder, our model efficiently generates waveforms with high fidelity across a broad parameter space, including component masses $(m_1, m_2)$, spin components $(S_{1x}, S_{1y}, S_{1z}, S_{2x}, S_{2y}, S_{2z})$, and tidal deformability $(\Lambda_1, \Lambda_2)$. Trained on $3 \times 10^5$ waveforms from the IMRPhenomXP\_NRTidalv2 waveform model, it achieves an average overlap accuracy of 99.6\% on the test set. The model significantly accelerates waveform generation. For a single sample, it requires $0.12$ seconds (s), compared to $0.38$ s for IMRPhenomXP\_NRTidalv2 and $0.62$ s for IMRPhenomPv2\_NRTidal, making it approximately 3 to 5 times faster. When generating $10^3$ waveforms, the network completes the task in $0.86$ s, while traditional waveform approximation methods take over $46$--$53$ s. Our model achieves a total time of $7.48$ s to generate $10^4$ such waveforms, making it about 60 to 65 times faster than traditional waveform approximation methods. This speed advantage enables rapid parameter estimation and real-time gravitational wave searches. With higher precision, it will support low-latency detection and broader applications in multi-messenger astrophysics.</description>

      <title>A multi-scale investigation into the diagnostic potential of the HCN/HCO$^+$ ratio for AGN and starburst activity in nearby galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (Abridged) The identification of AGN and SB regions in galaxies is crucial for understanding the role of various physical processes in galaxy evolution. Molecular line ratios, such as the HCN/HCO+ ratio, have been proposed as potential tracers of these distinct environments. This paper aims to assess the reliability of the HCN/HCO+ ratio, from J = 1-0 to J = 4-3 transitions, as a diagnostic tool for differentiating AGN and SB activity across a diverse sample of nearby galaxies. We focus on evaluating the effect of spatial resolution on the robustness of these ratios and investigate the underlying physical conditions that drive observed variations. We compile observations of HCN and HCO+ lines across multiple J transitions from various sources, covering different galaxy types, including Seyferts, starbursts, and (ultra-)luminous infrared galaxies (U/LIRGs). The observations span spatial scales from cloud-sized regions to kiloparsec scales. We analyse the behaviour of these ratios at varying resolutions and employ non-LTE radiative transfer models to infer the physical conditions that drive the observed ratios. We find that the HCN/HCO+ ratio from higher J transitions can differentiate between AGN and SB activity when observed at high spatial resolution. This distinction occurs around unity. However, at lower resolutions, contamination from multiple emission sources and beam averaging effects destroy these distinctions. Modelling suggests that elevated HCN/HCO+ ratios in AGN-dominated regions are largely driven by an enhancement in HCN abundance relative to HCO+, likely due to high-temperature chemistry or increased excitation. Our study confirms that the HCN/HCO+ ratio, particularly of higher J transitions, can be a reliable tracer of AGN versus SB activity if observations are conducted at sufficiently high spatial resolution.</description>

      <title>Chronology of our Galaxy from Gaia colour-magnitude diagram fitting (ChronoGal) II. Unveiling the formation and evolution of the kinematically selected Thick and Thin Discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the formation and evolution of the Milky Way's thin and thick discs is crucial to galaxy formation studies. We derive age and metallicity distributions of the kinematic thick and thin discs using the CMDft.Gaia pipeline and Gaia DR3 data within 250 pc of the Sun, covering 1 kpc in height. Our results show that the kinematic thick disc is mostly older than 10 Gyr, undergoing three main metallicity enrichment episodes: (1) over 12 Gyr ago, peaking at [M/H] $\sim$ -0.5 dex, (2) $\sim$11 Gyr ago, rapidly increasing to solar [M/H] and spanning [$\alpha$/Fe] from 0.3 to solar, and (3) just over 10 Gyr ago, reaching supersolar metallicities. Meanwhile, the kinematic thin disc began forming $\sim$10 Gyr ago, just as thick disc star formation ended, characterized by supersolar metallicities and low [$\alpha$/Fe]. This transition coincides with the Milky Way's last major merger: Gaia-Sausage Enceladus (GSE). We also identify a subset of kinematic thin disc stars older than 10 Gyr with high/intermediate [$\alpha$/Fe], indicating a transition phase. The age-metallicity relation of the thin disc suggests overlapping star formation episodes and radial mixing in the solar neighborhood, with the greatest spread $\sim$6 Gyr ago. Additionally, we detect an isolated thick disc star formation event at solar metallicity, coinciding with Sagittarius' first pericenter passage. These findings provide precise age-metallicity distributions and star formation rates, offering key insights for chemical evolution models and cosmological simulations.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Analysis on the Nature of the Spiral Arms in NGC 3686, NGC 4321, and NGC 2403</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In theoretical investigations, various mechanisms have been put forward to explain the emergence of spiral patterns in galaxies. One of the few ways to find out the nature of spirals in a particular galaxy is to consider the so-called corotation radius, or corotation resonance. A distinctly defined corotation resonance is likely to indicate the existence of a spiral density wave, while the chaotic distribution of their positions may suggest a dynamic nature to the spiral structure. In this study, we analyzed measurements of the corotation radius obtained using several methods for three galaxies (NGC 3686, NGC 4321, and NGC 2403) that exhibit different morphologies of spiral structures. We also performed independent measurements to estimate the location of the resonance, which allowed us to determine whether each galaxy has a clear corotation radius position. This examination, along with other tests such as stellar age gradient, interlocking resonances, and the radial distribution of metallicity, enables us to understand the mechanism that may be responsible for the formation of spiral arms in the studied galaxies.</description>

      <title>Extended Emission Line Region in a Post-Starburst Galaxy Hosting TDE AT2019qiz and QPE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the extended emission line region (EELR) in the host galaxy of the tidal disruption event (TDE) AT2019qiz, utilizing VLT/MUSE integral-field spectroscopy. The high spatial-resolution data reveal a bi-conical emission structure approximately $3.7~\mathrm{kpc}$ in scale within the galactic center, characterized by a prominent [OIII] line in the nucleus and significant [NII] line emission extending into the EELR. Spectral analysis of the EELR indicates line ratios consistent with Seyfert ionization in the center and LINER-type ionization in the outer diffuse region, suggesting ionization from galactic nuclear activity. The required ionizing luminosity, estimated from the H$\rm{\alpha}$ and H$\rm{\beta}$ luminosities based on the photoionization and recombination balance assumption, is $10^{41.8}$ $\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$ for all spaxels classified as AGN, and $10^{40.7}$ $\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$ for spaxels in the central $0.9~\mathrm{kpc}$ Seyfert region. However, the current bolometric luminosity of the nucleus $L_{\text{bol}} \leq 10^{40.8}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$, estimated from quiescent-state soft X-ray observations, is insufficient to ionize the entire EELR, implying a recently faded AGN or a delayed response to historical activity. Stellar population analysis reveals a post-starburst characteristic in the EELR, and the gas kinematics show disturbances and non-circular components compared to the stellar kinematics. Notably, the recent detection of quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) in the X-ray light curve of AT2019qiz confirms the TDE-QPE association. Our findings provide direct evidence for an AGN-like EELR in the host galaxy of the nearest TDE with QPE detection, offering new insights into the complex interplay between TDEs, QPEs, AGN activity, and host galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>The COSMOS Wall at z$\sim$0.73: star-forming galaxies and their evolution in different environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of the evolution of star-forming galaxies within the so-called Wall structure at z$\sim$0.73 in the field of the COSMOS survey. We use a sample of star-forming galaxies from a comprehensive range of environments and across a wide stellar mass range and discuss the correlation between the environment and the galaxy's internal properties, including its metallicity from the present-day gas-phase value measured from emission-lines and its past evolution as imprinted in its stellar populations. We build a simple yet comprehensive galaxy chemical evolution model, which is constrained by the gas-phase metallicities, stacked spectra and photometry of galaxies to reach a full description of the galaxies' past star formation and chemical evolution histories in different environments. We reproduce the `downsizing' formation of galaxies in both their star formation histories and chemical evolution histories at $z\sim0.73$ so that more massive galaxies tend to grow their stellar mass and become enriched in metals earlier than less massive ones. In addition, the current gas-phase metallicity of a galaxy and its past evolution correlate with the environment it inhabits. Galaxies in groups, especially massive groups that have X-ray counterparts, tend to have higher gas-phase metallicities and are enriched in metals earlier than field galaxies of similar stellar mass. Galaxies in the highest stellar mass bin and located in X-ray groups exhibit a more complex and varied chemical composition. Strangulation due to interactions with the group environment, leading to an early cessation of gas supply, may have driven the faster mass growth and chemical enrichment observed in group galaxies. Additionally, the removal of metal-enriched gas could play a key role in the evolution of the most massive galaxies. Alternative mechanisms other than environmental processes are also discussed.</description>

      <title>The cross-correlation between soft X-rays and galaxies A new benchmark for galaxy evolution models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents the construction and validation of complete stellar mass-selected, volume-limited galaxy samples using the Legacy Survey (data release 10) galaxy catalogs, covering $\sim16,800$ deg$^2$ of extra-galactic sky, and extending to redshift $z&lt;0.35$. We measure the correlation function of these galaxies with tiny statistical uncertainties at the percent level and systematic uncertainties up to 5\%. A 4-parameter halo occupation distribution (HOD) model is fitted to retrieve the population of host halos, yielding results on the stellar to halo mass relation consistent with the current models of galaxy formation and evolution. Using these complete galaxy samples, we measure and analyze the cross-correlation (X-corr) between galaxies and all soft X-ray photons observed by SRG/eROSITA in the 0.5-2 keV band over $\sim13,000$ deg$^2$. The cross correlation measurements have unprecedented sub-percent statistical uncertainty and ~5-10\% systematic uncertainty.
  An extension to the halo model is introduced to interpret the X-corr, decomposing contributions from X-ray point sources, hot gas (CGM), satellites, and the 2-halo term. For low stellar mass thresholds ($\log M^*/M_{\odot}&gt;$ 10, 10.25, 10.5), we find that the point source emission dominates the X-corr at small separation ($r&lt;80$kpc). Then, in the range ($80&lt;r&lt;2$Mpc), the emission from large halos hosting satellite galaxies dominates. Finally, on scales beyond that considered here ($r&gt;2$Mpc), the 2-halo term becomes dominant. Interestingly, there is no scale at which the CGM dominates. In the range ($20&lt;r&lt;200$kpc), the CGM contributes to more than 10\% of the signal. Progressively, with the minimum stellar mass increasing, the CGM emission increases. We constrain the $M_{500c}-L_X$ scaling relation slope, $1.629^{+0.091}_{-0.089}$, at the 5\% level using the samples with the lowest mass threshold.</description>

      <title>FUV to FIR SED modelling of NGC 205</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New far ultraviolet imaging of the galaxy NGC 205 is presented, which shows the emission is significantly offset ($\sim5^{\prime\prime}$ NW) from the optical and infrared centers of the galaxy. Spectral energy distribution (SED) modelling is applied to investigate the spatial dependence of the star formation history (SFH) of NGC 205, using data from far ultraviolet to far infrared. The SED model includes young and old stellar populations, gas emission, dust emission and dust absorption. The old stellar population has a total mass of $1.1\times10^8$ M$_{\odot}$ whereas the young population has a much smaller total mass of 3200 M$_{\odot}$. The best forms of SFH for old and young stars are found to be exponentially declining bursts with start times $t_0$ yr ago and e-folding times $\tau$ yr. The old stellar population has uniform $t_0$=9.5 Gyr, with $\tau$ decreasing with radius from 1 Gyr to 500 Myr. The young stellar population has $t_0$=900 Myr and $\tau$=800 Myr, both uniform across NGC 205. The young and old stellar mass surface densities are exponential in radius with scale lengths of 40 and 110 pc, respectively. The dust heating has a $\sim$40\% contribution from young stars and $\sim$60\% from old stars.</description>

      <title>Backlighting extended gas halos around luminous red galaxies: kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect from DESI Y1 x ACT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gas density profile around galaxies, shaped by feedback and affecting the galaxy lensing signal, is imprinted on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) by the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (kSZ). We precisely measure this effect ($S/N\approx 10$) via velocity stacking with $825,283$ spectroscopically confirmed luminous red galaxies (LRG) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Y1 survey, which overlap with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Data Release 6 temperature maps over $\geq 4,000 \text{deg}^2$. We explore the kSZ dependence with various galaxy parameters. We find no significant trend with redshift, but clear trends with stellar mass and absolute magnitude in $g$, $r$, and $z$ bands. We highlight new challenges when comparing data and hydrodynamical simulations. Our simple and most conservative analysis suggests that the gas is more extended than the dark matter (99.5% confidence, i.e. PTE = 0.005). It also hints at a preference for galaxy formation models with more feedback (Illustris $z=0.5$, PTE = 0.37) rather than less (Illustris TNG $z=0.8$, PTE = 0.045), though with less statistical significance. In all cases, a free multiplicative amplitude was fit to the simulated profiles, and further modeling work is required to firm up these conclusions. We find consistency between kSZ profiles around spectroscopic and photometric LRG, with comparable statistical power, thus increasing our confidence in the photometric analysis. Additionally, we present the first kSZ measurement around DESI Y1 bright galaxy sample (BGS) and emission-line galaxies (ELG), whose features match qualitative expectations. Finally, we forecast $S/N \sim 50$ for future stacked kSZ measurements using data from ACT, DESI Y3, and Rubin Observatory. These measurements will serve as an input for galaxy formation models and baryonic uncertainties in galaxy lensing.</description>

      <title>A New Hope for Obscured AGN: The PRIMA-NewAthena Alliance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the AGN-galaxy co-evolution, feedback processes, and the evolution of Black Hole Accretion rate Density (BHAD) requires accurately estimating the contribution of obscured Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). However, detecting these sources is challenging due to significant extinction at the wavelengths typically used to trace their emission. We evaluate the capabilities of the proposed far-infrared observatory PRIMA and its synergies with the X-ray observatory NewAthena in detecting AGN and in measuring the BHAD. Starting from X-ray background synthesis models, we simulate the performance of NewAthena and of PRIMA in Deep and Wide surveys. Our results show that the combination of these facilities is a powerful tool for selecting and characterising all types of AGN. While NewAthena is particularly effective at detecting the most luminous, the unobscured, and the moderately obscured AGN, PRIMA excels at identifying heavily obscured sources, including Compton-thick AGN (of which we expect 7500 detections per deg$^2$). We find that PRIMA will detect 60 times more sources than Herschel over the same area and will allow us to accurately measure the BHAD evolution up to z=8, better than any current IR or X-ray survey, finally revealing the true contribution of Compton-thick AGN to the BHAD evolution.</description>

      <title>What's kickin' in partial tidal disruption events?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stars partially destroyed by a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in a partial tidal disruption event (TDE) can be ejected from the SMBH. Previous investigations attributed this positive-energy/velocity kick to asymmetries in the mass lost by the star near pericenter. We propose that asymmetric mass loss is not predominantly responsible for "kicking" the star, and that these kicks instead arise from the combination of a) the reformation of the core following an initial phase of quasi-ballistic motion, and b) the differential shear between the unbound and marginally bound (to the SMBH) material during this phase. We predict that the kick speed $v_{\rm kick}$ is weakly dependent on the stellar properties, and for SMBH masses $M_{\bullet} \gtrsim 10^{3} M_{\odot}$, $v_{\rm kick}$ is independent of SMBH mass, is not limited to the stellar escape speed $v_{\rm esc}$, and is related to the surviving core mass $M_{\rm c}$ approximately as $v_{\rm kick} \simeq 0.45 \left(M_{\rm c}/M_{\star}\right)^{-1/3}$, where $M_{\star}$ is the original stellar mass. For $M_{\bullet} \lesssim 10^{3} M_{\odot}$, we find that the maximum-attainable kick speed depends on SMBH mass, satisfies $v_{\rm kick, max} \simeq 0.4 \, v_{\rm esc}\left(M_{\bullet}/M_{\star}\right)^{1/6}$, and is reached for core masses that satisfy $M_{\rm c}/M_{\star} \lesssim 1.7\left(M_{\bullet}/M_{\star}\right)^{-1/2}$. This model predicts that massive stars with $M_{\star}\gtrsim few\times 10 M_{\odot}$ could be ejected at speeds $\gtrsim (1-2)\times 10^3$ km s$^{-1}$ if stripped of $\gtrsim 50\%$ of their mass.</description>

      <title>A Spectroscopic Survey of Metal-Poor OB Stars in Local Dwarf Galaxy NGC 3109</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As JWST uncovers increasingly strong evidence that metal-poor, massive stars in early galaxies dominated reionization, observational constraints on the properties of such stars are more relevant than ever before. However, spectra of individual O- and B-type stars are rare at the relevant metallicities ($\lesssim 0.2$ $Z_\odot$), leaving models of stellar evolution and ionizing flux poorly constrained by data in this regime. We present new medium-resolution ($R\sim 4000)$ Keck/DEIMOS optical spectra of 17 OB stars in the local low-metallicity ($0.12$ $Z_\odot$) dwarf galaxy NGC 3109. We assign spectral types to the stars and present new criteria for selecting O stars using optical and NUV photometry from Hubble Space Telescope imaging. We fit the spectra and photometry with grids of stellar atmosphere models to measure stellar temperatures, surface gravities, luminosities, radii, and masses. We find evidence of strong mass loss via radiation-driven stellar winds in two O stars, one of which is the hottest, youngest, and most massive star confirmed in the host galaxy to date. Though its spectrum does not meet conventional Wolf-Rayet spectral classification criteria, this metal-poor O If star produces strong He II 4686 emission and its evolutionary status is ambiguous. This work nearly doubles the number of OB stars with measured parameters in NGC 3109, including ten stars with no previously reported parameters, four with no published spectroscopy, and four binary candidates. This large sample of OB stellar parameters provides a new observational testbed to constrain the stellar astrophysics that drove cosmic reionization and influenced the evolution of the earliest galaxies.</description>

      <title>Spectropolarimetry of A Nuclear Transient AT2023clx: Revealing The Geometrical Alignment between The Transient Outflow and The Nuclear Dusty Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AT2023clx, which occurred in NGC3799 with a Low-Ionization Nuclear Emission-Line Region (LINER), is one of the most nearby nuclear transients classified as a tidal disruption event (TDE). We present three-epoch spectropolarimetric follow-up observations of AT2023clx. We detected two polarization components; one is a constant polarization of $\sim 1\%$ originated from an aspherical outflow associated with the transient, while the other is a blue-excess polarization up to $\sim 2\%$ originated from a nuclear dusty environment via light echoes. Between the two epochs, the polarization angle flipped by 90 degrees, indicating that the direction of the outflow was aligned perpendicular to the dust plane. Such polarization features -- the blue excess and the 90-degree flip -- have never been observed in previous TDE polarization samples, highlighting unique mechanisms behind AT2023clx. We propose possible scenarios to naturally explain the polarization features: the disruption of a star captured by a nuclear dusty cloud around the black hole or a star formed within the cloud. Given the LINER nature of NGC3799, the dusty region may possibly be linked to a torus or disk associated with a weak Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN). Furthermore, as a more speculative scenario, the event might have been triggered by AGN-like activity, potentially linked to changing-look AGNs or ambiguous nuclear transients.</description>

      <title>An Upper Limit on the Interstellar Meteoroid Flux at Video Sizes from the Global Meteor Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Material arriving at our solar system from the Galaxy may be detected at Earth in the form of meteors ablating in our atmosphere. Here we report on a search for interstellar meteors within the highest-quality events in the Global Meteor Network (GMN) database. No events were detected that were conclusively hyperbolic with respect to the Sun; however, our search was not exhaustive and examined only the top 57% of events, with a deeper examination planned for future work.
  This study's effective meteoroid mass limit is 6.6 +/- 0.8 x 10^{-5} kg (5 millimeter diameter at a density of 1000 kg m^{-3}). Theoretical rates of interstellar meteors at these sizes range from 3 to 200 events globally per year. The highest rates can already be largely excluded by this study, while at the lowest rates GMN would have to observe for 25 more years to be 50% confident of seeing at least one event. GMN is thus well positioned to provide substantial constraints on the interstellar population at these sizes over the coming years. This study's results are statistically compatible with a rate of interstellar meteors at the Earth at less than 1 per million meteoroid impacts at Earth at millimeter sizes, or a flux rate of less than 8 +/- 2 x 10^{-11} per sq. km per hour at the 95% confidence level.</description>

      <title>Classification of Radio Sources Through Self-Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The morphology of radio galaxies is indicative, for instance, of their interaction with their surroundings. Since modern radio surveys contain a large number of radio sources that will be impossible to analyse and classify manually, it is important to develop automatic schemes. Unlike other fields, which benefit from established theoretical frameworks and simulations, for radio galaxies there are no such comprehensive models, posing unique challenges for data analysis. In this study, we investigate the classification of radio galaxies from the LOFAR Two-meter Sky Survey Data Release 2 (LoTSS-DR2) using self-supervised learning. Our classification strategy involves three main steps: (i) self-supervised pre-training; (ii) fine-tuning using a labelled subsample created from the learned representations; and (iii) final classification of the selected unlabelled sample. To enhance morphological information in the representations, we developed an additional random augmentation. Our results demonstrate that the learned representations contain rich morphological information, enabling the creation of a labelled subsample that effectively captures the morphological diversity within the unlabelled sample. Additionally, the classification of the unlabelled sample into 12 morphological classes yields robust class probabilities. We successfully demonstrate that a subset of radio galaxies from LoTSS-DR2, encompassing diverse morphologies, can be classified using self-supervised learning. The methodology developed here bridges the gap left by the absence of simulations and theoretical models, offering a framework that can readily be applied to astronomical image analyses in other wavebands.</description>

      <title>A JWST project on 47 Tucanae. Binaries among multiple populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Almost all globular clusters (GCs) contain multiple populations consisting of stars with varying helium and light-element abundances. These populations include first-population stars, which exhibit similar chemical compositions to halo-field stars with comparable [Fe/H], and second-population stars, characterized by enhanced He and N abundances along with reduced levels of O and C. Nowadays, one of the most intriguing open questions about GCs pertains to the formation and evolution of their multiple populations. Recent works based on N-body simulations of GCs show that the fractions and characteristics of binary stars can serve as dynamic indicators of the formation period of multiple-population in GCs and their subsequent dynamical evolution. Nevertheless, the incidence of binaries among multiple populations is still poorly studied. Moreover, the few available observational studies are focused only on the bright stars of a few GCs. In this work, we use deep images of the GC 47 Tucanae collected with the JWST and HST to investigate the incidence of binaries among multiple populations of M-dwarfs and bright main-sequence stars. To reach this objective, we use UV, optical, and near infrared filters to construct photometric diagrams that allow us to disentangle binary systems and multiple populations. Moreover, we compared these observations with a large sample of simulated binaries. In the cluster central regions, the incidence of binaries among first-population stars is only slightly higher than that of second-population stars. In contrast, in the external regions, the majority (&gt;85%) of the studied binaries are composed of first population stars. Results are consistent with the GC formation scenarios where the second-population stars originate in the cluster's central region, forming a compact and dense stellar group within a more extended system of first-population stars</description>

      <title>The physical association of planetary nebula NGC 2818 with open cluster NGC 2818A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planetary nebulae (PNe) that are physical members of open star clusters (OCs) are valuable for stellar evolution studies. They are extremely rare, with only three such instances confirmed in our Galaxy. Here, we confirm the physical association of PN NGC 2818 with OC NGC 2818A, an association long debated in the literature, adding a fourth object to the sample of rare OC-PN pairs. The physical properties of the PN can then be linked to those of its progenitor star. Using GHOST/Gemini high-resolution nebular spectra, we measured the PN systemic radial velocity to compare it with that of the putative host cluster, determined from Gaia. We estimated the physical parameters of both the OC and the PN using our data, together with estimates from previous studies and theoretical cluster isochrones and evolutionary tracks to show they are compatible. The precise, systemic radial velocity of the PN that was determined, is consistent among the errors with that of the OC and its 1 km/s associated velocity dispersion, a primary requirement for cluster membership. We have determined other physical parameters of the PN and the OC, such as age and distance, which also match within the errors. These results present compelling evidence for the physical association of the PN and the OC. The PN age was found to be 11 kyr and the effective temperature of its central star was estimated as 130 kK. The initial and final masses of the progenitor star were determined to be 2.33$\pm$0.10 Msol and 0.58$\pm$0.10 Msol respectively. We plotted the resulting data point on the latest initial-to-final-mass relation. This new data point agrees with the previously published trends and further delineates the 'kink' found at relatively low initial masses. All four OC-PN associations, identified thus far, share a number of common properties. These rare cases merit detailed OC-PN studies and work to further extend the sample.</description>

      <title>Systematic Reanalysis of KMTNet Microlensing Events, Paper II: Two New Planets in Giant-Source Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we continue to apply the updated KMTNet tender-love care (TLC) photometric pipeline to historical microlensing events. We apply the pipeline to a subsample of events from the KMTNet database, which we refer to as the giant source sample. Leveraging the improved photometric data, we conduct a systematic search for anomalies within this sample. The search successfully uncovers four new planet-like anomalies and recovers two previously known planetary signals. After detailed analysis, two of the newly discovered anomalies are confirmed as clear planets: KMT-2019-BLG-0578 and KMT-2021-BLG-0736. Their planet-to-host mass ratios are $q\sim4\times10^{-3}$ and $q\sim1\times10^{-4}$, respectively. Another event, OGLE-2018-BLG-0421 (KMT-2018-BLG-0831), remains ambiguous. Both a stellar companion and a giant planet in the lens system could potentially explain the observed anomaly. The anomaly signal of the last event, MOA-2022-BLG-038 (KMT-2022-BLG-2342), is attributed to an extra source star. Within this sample, our procedure doubles the number of confirmed planets, demonstrating a significant enhancement in the survey sensitivity.</description>

      <title>The Age of the Universe with Globular Clusters III: Gaia distances and hierarchical modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the third article in a series aimed at computing accurate and precise ages of galactic globular clusters from their full color-magnitude diagram in order to estimate the age of the Universe and in turn constrain the cosmological model. We update previous constraints using additional data and an improved methodology which allows us to vary the helium abundance and the reddening law in addition to the usual parameters (age, metallicity, alpha enhancement, distance and absorption) in the analysis. Even with the additional degrees of freedom, using the full color-magnitude diagram, now described as a Gaussian mixture Bayesian hierarchical model, a tight constraint on the age(s) of the globular clusters and on the other parameters can be obtained, and the statistical errors are fully subdominant to the systematic errors. We find that the age of the oldest globular clusters is $t_{\rm GC} = 13.39 \pm 0.10 ({\rm stat.}) \pm 0.23 ({\rm sys.})$ Gyr, resulting in an age of the Universe $t_{\rm U}=13.57^{+ 0.16}_{-0.14} ({\rm stat})\pm 0.23 ({\rm sys.})$ and a robust 95\% confidence upper limit of $t_U^{\leq}=13.92_{-0.1}^{+0.13}({\rm stat}) \pm{0.23} ({\rm sys})$. This is fully compatible with our previous estimates and with the model-dependent, Cosmic Microwave Background-derived age for the Universe of $t_{\rm U} =13.8 \pm 0.02$ Gyr for a $\Lambda$CDM model.</description>

      <title>Effect of ultralight dark matter on compact binary mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing catalogue of gravitational wave events enables a statistical analysis of compact binary mergers, typically quantified by the merger rate density. This quantity can be influenced by ambient factors, following which, in this work we have investigated the impact of dark matter environment on the merger statistics. We construct a baseline astrophysical model of compact binary mergers and extend it by incorporating a model of ultra light dark matter, which affects the orbital evolution of binaries through accretion and dynamical friction. Our analysis of the merged population of binary progenitors demonstrates that, compared to the baseline model, ULDM can significantly alter the merger statistics when its ambient density becomes larger than 104GeV/cm3. A comparison with the gravitational wave data from the GWTC-3 catalogue provides insight into potential observational signatures of the ULDM in merger events, leading to possible constraints on the existence and density of dark matter distribution in galaxies.</description>

      <title>Spectral classification of young stars using conditional invertible neural networks II. Application to Trumpler 14 in Carina</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an updated version of our deep learning tool that predicts stellar parameters from the optical spectra of young low-mass stars with intermediate spectral resolution. We adopt a conditional invertible neural network (cINN) architecture to infer the posterior distribution of stellar parameters and train our cINN on two Phoenix stellar atmosphere model libraries (Settl and Dusty). Compared to the cINNs presented in our first study, the updated cINN considers the influence of the relative flux error on the parameter estimation and predicts an additional fourth parameter, veiling. We test the performance of cINN on synthetic test models to quantify the intrinsic error of the cINN as a function of relative flux error and on 36 class III template stars to validate the performance on real spectra. Using our cINN, we estimate the stellar parameters of young stars in Trumpler 14 (Tr14) in the Carina Nebula Complex, observed with VLT-MUSE, and compare them with those derived using the classical template fitting method. We provide Teff, log g, Av, and veiling values measured by our cINN as well as stellar ages and masses derived from the HR diagram. Our parameter estimates generally agree well with those measured by template fitting. However, for K- and G-type stars, the Teff derived from template fitting is, on average, 2-3 subclasses hotter than the cINN estimates, while the corresponding veiling values from template fitting appear to be underestimated compared to the cINN predictions. We obtain an average age of 0.7(+3.2)(-0.6) Myr for the Tr14 stars. By examining the impact of veiling on the equivalent width-based classification, we demonstrate that the main cause of temperature overestimation for K- and G-type stars in the previous study is that veiling and effective temperature are not considered simultaneously in their process.</description>

      <title>Stellar-wind feedback and magnetic fields around young compact star clusters: 3D MHD simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context: The environments of young star clusters are shaped by the interactions of the powerful winds of massive stars, and their feedback on the cluster birth cloud. Several such clusters show diffuse gamma-ray emission on the degree scale, which hints at ongoing particle acceleration. Aims: To date, particle acceleration and transport in star-cluster environments are not well understood. A characterisation of magnetic fields and flow structures is necessary to progress toward physical models. Previous work has largely focused on 100 pc scale feedback or detailed modelling of wind interaction of just a few stars. We aim to bridge this gap. We focus in particular on compact clusters to study collective effects arising from stellar-wind interaction. Objects in this class include Westerlund 1 and R136. Methods: We perform 3D ideal-MHD simulations of compact, young, massive star clusters. Stellar winds are injected kinetically for 46 individual very massive stars (M &gt; 40 Msun), distributed in a spherical region of radius 0.6 - 1 pc. We include a sub-population of five magnetic stars with increased dipole field strengths of 0.1 - 1 kG. We study the evolving superbubble over several 100 kyrs. Results: The bulk flow and magnetic fields show an intricate, non-uniform morphology, which is critically impacted by the relative position of individual stars. The cluster wind terminates in a strong shock, which is non-spherical and, like the flow, has non-uniform properties. The magnetic field is both composed of highly tangled sections and coherent quasi-radial field-line bundles. Steep particle spectra in the TeV domain arise naturally from the variation of magnetic field magnitude over the cluster-wind termination shock. This finding is consistent with gamma-ray observations. The scenario of PeV particle acceleration at the cluster-wind termination shock is deemed unlikely.</description>

      <title>Wandering intermediate-mass black holes in Milky Way-mass galaxies in cosmological simulations: myth or reality?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we address the following question: ``can we use the current cosmological simulations to identify intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) and quantify a putative population of wandering IMBHs?''. We compare wandering-IMBH counts in different simulations with different sub-grid methods and post-processing recipes, the ultimate goal being to aid future wandering-IMBH detection efforts. In particular, we examine simulations in which IMBHs are identified as BH seeds forming at high redshift and those in which they are identified using star clusters as proxies, which implicitly appeals to a stellar dynamical formation channel. In addition, we employ the extremely high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamical ``zoom-in'' simulation GigaEris with the star cluster proxies method to identify IMBHs. We find consistent counts of wandering high-redshift IMBHs across most of the different cosmological simulations employed so far in the literature, despite the different identification approaches, resulting in 5 to 18 wandering IMBHs per Milky Way-sized galaxy at $z \geq 3$. Nevertheless, we argue this is only coincidental, as a significant discrepancy arises when examining the formation sites and the mass ranges of the wandering IMBHs. Furthermore, we cannot determine how many of the IMBHs identified at high redshift in GigaEris will be wandering IMBHs at $z = 0$ as opposed to how many will accrete to the central supermassive BH, promoting its growth. All of this casts doubts on the ability of current cosmological simulations to inform observational searches for wandering IMBHs.</description>

      <title>Polarized synchrotron data and the structure of the Galactic magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The polarized synchrotron data of the northern C-BASS survey show a surprisingly low linear polarization fraction, $\Pi\simeq 3\%$, while the magnetic field polarization features coherent structures over rather large angular scales. The low polarization degree points to a strong dominance of the turbulent magnetic field -- in agreement with the observation that the total synchrotron intensity is much larger than expected from the regular component in current models for the Galactic magnetic field (GMF). In contrast, studies of cosmic ray propagation employing these GMF models suggest that cosmic rays propagate anisotropically, what in turn requires weak turbulent fields. As a solution to this contradicting requirements, we suggest that the GMF consists of three components with different levels of turbulence: a disk dominated by the turbulent field, a halo dominated by the regular field, plus an extended turbulent halo field.</description>

      <title>Scaling Relations in the Phase-Space Structure of Dark Matter Haloes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present new scaling relations for the isotropic phase-space distribution functions (DFs) and energy distributions of simulated dark matter haloes. These relations are inspired by those for the singular isothermal sphere with density profile $\rho(r)\propto r^{-2}$, for which the DF satisfies $f(E) \propto r_{\max}^{-2}(E)$ and the energy distribution satisfies $dM/dE \propto r_{\max}(E)$, with $r_{\max}(E)$ being the radius where the gravitational potential equals energy $E$. For the simulated haloes, we find $f(E)\propto r_{\max}^{-2.08}(E)$ and $dM/dE \propto r_{\max}(E)$ across broad energy ranges. In addition, the proportionality coefficients depend on the gravitational constant and the parameters of the best-fit Navarro-Frenk-White density profile. These scaling relations are satisfied by haloes over a wide mass range and provide an efficient method to approximate their DFs and energy distributions. Understanding the origin of these relations may shed more light on halo formation.</description>

      <title>Association between Recurrent Novae and Nova Super-Remnants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17652v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nova super-remnants (NSRs) are substantially extended structures (up to ~130 parsecs across) encompassing recurrent novae. NSRs grow as a result of frequent nova eruptions transporting vast quantities of the locally surrounding interstellar medium away from the binary system over many millennia into a thin high-density shell, as the central white dwarf grows towards the Chandrasekhar limit. The prototypical NSR, first identified as such in 2014, is situated in the Andromeda Galaxy and belongs to the annually erupting nova, M31N 2008-12a (or '12a'). In this short review, modelling of evolving NSRs (including the 12a NSR) will be outlined as motivation towards searching for more of these phenomena in the Galaxy and beyond. The latest developments in this upcoming subfield of nova research will then be presented including the discovery of two new Galactic nova super-remnants (and their consequent modelling) and the first survey undertaken with the sole purpose of finding NSRs in the Andromeda Galaxy and the Large Magellanic Cloud.</description>

      <title>Alpha-element abundance patterns in star-forming regions of the local Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: (Abridged) We reassess the alpha-element abundance ratios (Ne/O, S/O, Ar/O) with respect to metallicity in ~1000 spectra of Galactic and extragalactic HII regions and star-forming galaxies (SFGs) of the local Universe. Using the DEep Spectra of Ionised REgions Database (DESIRED) Extended project (DESIRED-E), which includes spectra with direct electron temperature determinations, we homogeneously derive physical conditions and chemical abundances for all objects. Various ionisation correction factor (ICF) schemes are analyzed for Ne, S, and Ar to identify the most reliable abundance estimates. Our findings indicate that one of the tested ICF schemes better reproduces the Ne/O, S/O, and Ar/O trends. Ne/O ratios in HII regions display large dispersion and no clear dependence on O/H, suggesting that current ICF(Ne) schemes fail for these objects. However, SFGs show consistent linear relations with slightly positive slopes for log(Ne/O) vs. 12+log(O/H) or 12+log(Ne/H), likely influenced by metallicity-dependent O dust depletion and ICF effects. The log(S/O) vs. 12+log(O/H) distribution is largely constant, especially for HII regions or combined samples (SFGs + HII regions). Conversely, log(S/O) vs. 12+log(S/H) shows a tight linear fit with a positive slope, flattening at 12+log(S/H) &lt; 6.0, suggesting S contributions from SNe Ia. For log(Ar/O) vs. 12+log(O/H), similar trends emerge for HII regions and SFGs, independent of ionisation degree or ICF(Ar). A slight log(Ar/O) decrease with increasing 12+log(O/H) contrasts with log(Ar/O) vs. 12+log(Ar/H), which shows a small positive slope, indicating a possible minor Ar contribution from SNe Ia.</description>

      <title>Linking stellar populations to HII regions across nearby galaxies. II. Infrared Reprocessed and UV Direct Radiation Pressure in HII Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radiation pressure is a key mechanism by which stellar feedback disrupts molecular clouds and drives HII region expansion. This includes direct radiation pressure exerted by UV photons on dust grains, pressure associated with photoionization, and infrared (IR) radiation pressure on grains due to dust-reprocessed IR photons. We present a new method that combines high resolution mid-IR luminosities from JWST-MIRI, optical attenuation and nebular line measurements from VLT-MUSE, and HST H$\alpha$-based region sizes to estimate the strength of radiation pressure in $\approx 18,000$ HII regions across 19 nearby star-forming galaxies. This is the most extensive and direct estimate of these terms beyond the Local Group to date. In the disks of galaxies, we find that the total reprocessed IR pressure is on average 5% of the direct UV radiation pressure. This fraction rises to 10% in galaxy centers. We expect reprocessed IR radiation pressure to dominate over UV radiation pressure in regions where $L_{\rm F2100W}/L_{\rm H\alpha}^{\rm corr} \gtrsim 75$. Radiation pressure due to H ionizations is lower than pressure on dust in our sample, but appears likely to dominate the radiation pressure budget in dwarf galaxies similar to the Small Magellanic Cloud. The contribution from all radiation pressure terms appears to be subdominant compared to thermal pressure from ionized gas, reinforcing the view that radiation pressure is most important in compact, heavily embedded, and young regions.</description>

      <title>Dissecting the formation of gas-versus-star counter-rotating galaxies from the NewHorizon simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: (Reduced)Using the NewHorizon simulation, we have studied ten gas-versus-star counter-rotating galaxies in field environments with a stellar mass of M*~[1-5]x10^10 Msun. For all of them, the retrograde accretion of gas either from gas stripping from a nearby companion or from the circumgalactic medium is the starting point of the formation process. This is followed by the co-existence of two distinct disks of gas rotating in opposite directions, the pre-existing one in the inner parts and the accreted gas in the outer parts of the galaxy. The latter progressively replaces the former leading to the final gas-star kinetic misalignment configuration. During the process, the star formation is first enhanced and then progressively decreases. We roughly estimate that a higher fraction of the pre-existing gas is converted into stars rather than being expelled. We also found that the black hole activity (BH) tends to be enhanced during the removal of the pre-existing gas. Furthermore, our analysis suggests that the formation of a counter-rotating gas component is always accompanied with the formation of counter-rotating stellar disks. These stellar disks can have diverse properties but host in general a younger and more metal rich population of stars with respect to the main disc, depending on the star formation history and BH activity. The central part of counter-rotating disks tend also to be characterized by a younger population, an enhanced star formation rate and a higher metallicity than their outer parts. The high metallicity comes the progressive metal enrichment of the accreted gas by mixing with the pre-existing gas and by supernovae activity as it sinks toward the center of the galaxy. In case of major mergers, a large amount of accreted stars from the companion would be distributed at large distances from the remnant center due to conservation of the initial orbital angular momentum.</description>

      <title>Turbulence in virtual: Origin of the variance and skewness of density function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Turbulence is a complex phenomenon that plays a critical role in the interstellar medium (ISM). Previous simulations and observations show that the probability density function (PDF) of gas density in isothermal and compressible systems under turbulence exhibits a near lognormal shape, with a strong empirical relation between the variance ($\sigma^2$) and Mach number ($M$). In this work, we aim to explain the $\sigma^2$-$M$ relation and the deviation from the lognormal shape from a thermodynamic and cascading perspective. By introducing a virtual dissipation process, during which turbulent entropy and structural dissipation are assumed to be coupled, we derive the empirical relation $ \sigma^2 = \ln(1 + M)^2 $. Additionally, by introducing a delay parameter $q$ for the local gas temperature, we derive the deviation from the empirical relation at high $M$. We further argue that the exponential tails of PDFs (on the $s = \ln(\rho)$ scale) arise from the convolution of PDF kernels, which can be skewed at both the low-$s$ and high-$s$ ends. Skewness has limited influence on the $\sigma^2$-$M$ relation. Two density-fraction strategies--the mass-fraction and volume-fraction approaches--are introduced to explain the physical origins of the low-$s$ and high-$s$ skewed PDF kernels. These two types of PDF kernels are dual to each other and exhibit highly symmetric mathematical structures. We speculate that the high-$s$ skewed PDF kernels are physical and may be analogous to the high-density tails of column-density PDFs in molecular clouds, which are influenced by gravity. Inspired by this, we propose a form of an "isothermal" turbulent system that likely favors the volume-fraction strategy.</description>

Abstract: Turbulence is a mysterious phenomenon in physical systems and plays a critical role in the interstellar medium (ISM). Previous simulations and observations have shown that the probability density functions (PDFs) of gas densities in supersonic systems tend to be skewed, exhibiting low-density exponential tails on the $s = \ln{\rho}$ scale. In this work, we argue that these exponential tails originate from the convolution of PDF kernels with skewed tails, which can appear at both ends of the PDF. We introduce two density-fraction strategies -- the mass-fraction and volume-fraction approaches -- to explain the physical origins of the low-$s$ and high-$s$ skewed PDF kernels. The PDF kernels constructed in this work satisfy the relation that its structural entropy equals the PDF variance, as we proposed in Paper I. These two types of PDF kernels define two spaces of skewed PDFs, which are dual to each other and possess highly symmetric mathematical structures. We thus speculate that the high-$s$ skewed PDF kernels are physical and may be related to the power-law tails of the column-density PDFs (on the $\rho$ scale) of molecular clouds, which are shaped by both turbulence and gravity. Inspired by this, we further construct a form of an `isothermal' turbulent system that likely favors the volume-fraction strategy.</description>

      <title>JWST's little red dots: an emerging population of young, low-mass AGN cocooned in dense ionized gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: JWST has uncovered large numbers of compact galaxies at high redshift with broad hydrogen/helium lines. These include the enigmatic population known as "little red dots" (LRDs). Their nature is debated, but they are thought to be powered by supermassive black holes (SMBHs) or intense star formation. They exhibit unusual properties for SMBHs, such as black holes that are overmassive for their host galaxies and extremely weak X-ray and radio emission. Using the highest-quality JWST spectra, we show here that the lines are broadened by electron scattering with a narrow intrinsic line core. The data require high electron column densities and compact sizes (light days), which, when coupled with their high luminosities can only be explained by SMBH accretion. The narrow intrinsic cores of the lines imply upper limits on the black hole masses of $10^{5-7}$ $M_{\odot}$, two orders of magnitude lower than previous estimates. These are among the lowest mass SMBHs known at high redshift and suggest that this is a population of young, rapidly growing SMBHs. They are enshrouded in a dense cocoon of ionized gas, probably related to their youth, from which they are accreting close to the Eddington limit. Reprocessed nebular emission from the dense cocoon dominates the optical spectrum, explaining most LRD spectral characteristics and helping to suppress radio and X-ray emission.</description>

      <title>The resolved star-formation efficiency of early-type galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how and why star formation varies between galaxies is fundamental to our comprehension of galaxy evolution. In particular, the star-formation efficiency (SFE; star-formation rate or SFR per unit cold gas mass) has been shown to vary substantially both across and within galaxies. Early-type galaxies (ETGs) constitute an extreme case, as about a quarter have detectable molecular gas reservoirs but little to no detectable star formation. In this work, we present a spatially-resolved view of the SFE in ten ETGs, combining state-of-the-art Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) observations. Optical spectroscopic line diagnostics are used to identify the ionized emission regions dominated by star-formation, and reject regions where the ionization arises primarily from other sources. We identify very few regions where the ionization is consistent with pure star formation. Using ${\rm H}\alpha$ as our SFR tracer, we find that previous integrated measurements of the star-formation rate based on UV and 22$\mu$m emission are systematically higher than the SFR measured from ${\rm H}\alpha$. However, for the small number of regions where ionization is primarily associated with star formation, the SFEs are around 0.4 dex higher than those measured in star-forming galaxies at a similar spatial resolution (with depletion times ranging from $10^8$ to $10^{10}$ yr). Whilst the SFE of ETGs is overall low, we find that the SFEs of individual regions within ETGs can be similar to, or higher than, similar sized regions within star-forming galaxies.</description>

      <title>Probing the He II reionization ERa via Absorbing C IV Historical Yield (HIERACHY) III: The C IV absorber catalog and initial results on cosmic abundance evolution at $z\approx 3-5$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As part of the HIERACHY program, we collect the high-SN and high-spectral resolution optical spectra of 25 quasars at $z\approx4-5$ to constrain the C IV evolution at $z\approx 3-5$. In this paper, we report a catalog of 626 (1263) C IV absorption systems (components) at $z\approx3-5$ with a 50% completeness column density of log$(N_{\rm CIV}/\rm cm^{-2}) \approx 12.3$. The HIERACHY/MIKE C IV sample is one of the best C IV absorber samples optimized to study the IGM during the He II reionization epoch. Using 557 (1090) intervening absorption systems (components), we found the column density distribution function of C IV absorption systems with log$(N_{\rm CIV}/\rm cm^{-2})\gtrsim 12.3$ has a broken power-law shape, with the turn-over column density log$(N_{\rm crit}/\rm cm^{-2}) = 13.35^{+0.20}_{-0.19}$, which is close to or smaller than the detection limit of most literature samples. We also found that both comoving path length number density $dn/dX$ and cosmic abundance $\Omega$ for C IV absorption systems with log$(N_{\rm CIV}/\rm cm^{-2})&gt; 13.2$ show an increase (at the 2.2$\sigma$ and 1.4$\sigma$ levels, respectively) from redshift $z\approx5$ to 3, while absorption systems with log$(N_{\rm CIV}/\rm cm^{-2})= 12.3-13.2$ exhibit a constant $dn/dX$ and $\Omega_{\rm CIV}$.</description>

      <title>On the correlation between Ly$\alpha$ forest opacity and galaxy density in late reionization models</title>

Abstract: The relationship between Ly$\alpha$ forest opacity and local galaxy density (the opacity-density relation) is a key observational test of late reionization models. Using narrow-band surveys of z=5.7 Ly$\alpha$ emitters centered on quasar sight lines, Christenson et al. (2023) showed that two of the most transmissive forest segments at this redshift intersect galaxy underdensities. This is in tension with models of a strongly fluctuating ionizing background, including some late reionization models, which predict that the vast majority of these segments should intersect overdensities where the ionizing intensity is strongest. We use radiative transfer simulations to explore in detail the opacity-density relation in late reionization models. Fields like the one toward quasar PSO J359-06 -- the more underdense of the two transmissive sight lines in Christenson et al. (2023) -- typically contain recently reionized gas in cosmic voids where the hot temperatures and low densities enhance Ly$\alpha$ transmission. The opacity-density relation's transmissive end is sensitive to the amount of neutral gas in voids, and its morphology, set by the reionization source clustering. These effects are, however, degenerate. We demonstrate that models with very different source clustering can yield similar opacity-density relations when their reionization histories are calibrated to match Ly$\alpha$ forest mean flux measurements at z&lt;6. In models with fixed source clustering, a lower neutral fraction increases the likelihood of intersecting hot, recently reionized gas in voids, increasing the likelihood of observing PSO J359-06. For instance, the probability of observing this field is 15% in a model with neutral fraction $x_{\rm HI}=5\%$ at z=5.7, three times more likely than in a model with $x_{\rm HI}=15\%$. The opacity-density relation may thus provide a complementary probe of reionization's end.</description>

      <title>$\texttt{synax}$: A Differentiable and GPU-accelerated Synchrotron Simulation Package</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce synax, a novel library for automatically differentiable simulation of Galactic synchrotron emission. Built on the JAX framework, synax leverages JAX's capabilities, including batch acceleration, just-in-time compilation, and hardware-specific optimizations (CPU, GPU, TPU). Crucially, synax uses JAX's automatic differentiation (AD) mechanism, enabling precise computation of derivatives with respect to any model parameters. This feature facilitates powerful inference algorithms, such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) and gradient-based optimization, which enables inference over models that would otherwise be computationally prohibitive. In its initial release, synax supports synchrotron intensity and polarization calculations down to GHz frequencies, alongside several models of the Galactic magnetic field (GMF), cosmic ray (CR) spectra, and thermal electron density fields. We demonstrate the transformative potential of AD for tasks involving full posterior inference using gradient-based techniques or Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) optimization. Notably, we show that GPU acceleration brings a twenty-fold enhancement in efficiency, while HMC achieves a two-fold improvement over standard random walk Metropolis-Hastings (RWMH) when performing inference over a four-parameter test model. HMC still works on a more complex, 16-parameter model while RWMH fails to converge. Additionally, we showcase the application of synax in optimizing the GMF based on the Haslam 408 MHz map, achieving residuals with a standard deviation below 1 K.</description>

      <title>The rate of extreme coronal line emitters in the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey LOWZ sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extreme coronal line emitters (ECLEs) are a rare class of galaxy that exhibit strong, high-ionization iron coronal emission lines in their spectra. In some cases, these lines are transient and may be the result of tidal disruption event (TDEs). To test this connection, we calculate the rate of variable ECLEs (vECLEs) at redshift $\sim0.3$. We search for ECLEs in the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) LOWZ sample and discover two candidate ECLEs. Using follow-up spectra from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument and Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph, and mid-infrared observations from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, we determine that one of these galaxies is a vECLE. Using this galaxy, we calculate the galaxy-normalized vECLE rate at redshift $\sim0.3$ to be $R_\mathrm{G}=1.6~^{+3.8}_{-1.4}\times10^{-6}~\mathrm{galaxy}^{-1}~\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ and the mass-normalized rate to be $R_\mathrm{M}=7~^{+16}_{-6}\times10^{-18}~\mathrm{M_\odot^{-1}}~\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. This is then converted to a volumetric rate of $R_\mathrm{V}=1.8~^{+4.5}_{-1.5}\times10^{-9}~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-3}~\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. Formally, the LOWZ vECLE rates are $2-4$ times lower than the rates calculated from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Legacy sample at redshift $\sim0.1$. However, given the large uncertainties on both measurements, they are consistent with each other at $1\sigma$. Both the galaxy-normalized and volumetric rates are one to two orders of magnitude lower than TDE rates from the literature, consistent with vECLEs being caused by $5-20$ per cent of all TDEs.</description>

      <title>Extended mass and spheroidal deformation effects on epicyclic frequencies and periapsis shift in quasi-circular orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13334v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of extended mass and spheroidal deformation on the periapsis shift of quasi-circular orbits inside a gravitating mass distribution in the Newtonian framework. Focusing on the internal gravitational potential of a spheroidal body with both homogeneous and inhomogeneous density profiles, we elucidate how the ratio of local density to average density governs the extended mass effect on the periapsis shift. By analyzing the orbital angular frequency, along with the radial and vertical epicyclic frequencies, we demonstrate that in the uniform density case (i.e., the Maclaurin spheroid), where the potential takes the form of a harmonic oscillator, the periapsis exhibits a constant retrograde shift of $-\pi$. In contrast, in regions where density inhomogeneity and spheroidal deformation (in both prolate and oblate forms) are significant, the periapsis shift varies with the guiding orbital radius due to local density contrast and deformation effects. The results indicate that oblate deformation suppresses the extended mass effect associated with the ratio of local density to average density, whereas prolate deformation amplifies it. Furthermore, by varying the density distribution parameters, we establish the conditions for orbital stability and identify the emergence of marginally stable orbits.</description>

      <title>Generative AI for Validating Physics Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present generative artificial intelligence (AI) to empirically validate fundamental laws of physics, focusing on the Stefan-Boltzmann law linking stellar temperature and luminosity. Our approach simulates counterfactual luminosities under hypothetical temperature regimes for each individual star and iteratively refines the temperature-luminosity relationship in a deep learning architecture. We use Gaia DR3 data and find that, on average, temperature's effect on luminosity increases with stellar radius and decreases with absolute magnitude, consistent with theoretical predictions. By framing physics laws as causal problems, our method offers a novel, data-driven approach to refine theoretical understanding and inform evidence-based policy and practice.</description>
