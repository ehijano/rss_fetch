      <title>Optimal Investment in Equity and Credit Default Swaps in the Presence of Default</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an equity market subject to risk from both unhedgeable shocks and default. The novelty of our work is that to partially offset default risk, investors may dynamically trade in a credit default swap (CDS) market. Assuming investment opportunities are driven by functions of an underlying diffusive factor process, we identify the certainty equivalent for a constant absolute risk aversion investor with a semi-linear partial differential equation (PDE) which has quadratic growth in both the function and gradient coefficients. For general model specifications, we prove existence of a solution to the PDE which is also the certainty equivalent. We show the optimal policy in the CDS market covers not only equity losses upon default (as one would expect), but also losses due to restricted future trading opportunities. We use our results to price default dependent claims though the principal of utility indifference, and we show that provided the underlying equity market is complete absent the possibility of default, the equity-CDS market is complete accounting for default. Lastly, through a numerical application, we show the optimal CDS policies are essentially static (and hence easily implementable) and that investing in CDS dramatically increases investor indirect utility.</description>

      <title>Kullback-Leibler Barycentre of Stochastic Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04860v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem where an agent aims to combine the views and insights of different experts' models. Specifically, each expert proposes a diffusion process over a finite time horizon. The agent then combines the experts' models by minimising the weighted Kullback--Leibler divergence to each of the experts' models. We show existence and uniqueness of the barycentre model and prove an explicit representation of the Radon--Nikodym derivative relative to the average drift model. We further allow the agent to include their own constraints, resulting in an optimal model that can be seen as a distortion of the experts' barycentre model to incorporate the agent's constraints. We propose two deep learning algorithms to approximate the optimal drift of the combined model, allowing for efficient simulations. The first algorithm aims at learning the optimal drift by matching the change of measure, whereas the second algorithm leverages the notion of elicitability to directly estimate the value function. The paper concludes with an extended application to combine implied volatility smile models that were estimated on different datasets.</description>
