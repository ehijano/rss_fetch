      <title>High-order Discontinuous Galerkin solver based on Jacobi polynomial expansion for compressible flows on unstructured meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the Jacobi polynomial expansion, an arbitrary high-order Discontinuous Galerkin solver for compressible flows on unstructured meshes is proposed in the present work. First, we construct orthogonal polynomials for 2D and 3D isoparametric elements using the 1D Jacobi polynomials. We perform modal expansions of the state variables using the orthogonal polynomials, enabling arbitrary high-order spatial discretization of these variables. Subsequently, the discrete governing equations are derived by considering the orthogonality of the Euler equations' residuals and the test functions. On this basis, we develop a high-order Discontinuous Galerkin solver that supports various element types, including triangles, quadrilaterals, tetrahedra, hexahedra, etc. An improved shock-capturing scheme has been adopted to capture shock discontinuities within the flow field. The variable's gradients at the discontinuous elements are reconstructed by its adjacent elements, and the slope limiter is applied to modify the state variables, smoothing the state variables and enhancing the robustness of the solver. The convergence rates of solvers of different orders have been verified by a benchmark case, and the CPU costs are given to prove that high-precision algorithms have higher computational efficiency under the same error level. Finally, several two- and three-dimensional compressible fluid dynamics problems are studied, compared with literature and experimental results, the effectiveness and accuracy of the solver were verified.</description>

      <title>A novel discontinuous-Galerkin deterministic neutronics model for Fusion applications: development and benchmarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron interactions in a fusion power plant play a pivotal role in determining critical design parameters such as coil-plasma distance and breeding blanket composition. Fast predictive neutronic capabilities are therefore crucial for an efficient design process. For this purpose, we have developed a new deterministic neutronics method, capable of quickly and quickly assessing the neutron response of a fusion reactor, even in three-dimensional geometry. It uses a novel combination of arbitrary-order discontinuous Galerkin spatial discretization, discrete-ordinates angular and multigroup energy discretizations, arbitrary-order anisotropic scattering, and matrix-free iterative solvers, allowing for fast and accurate solutions. One, two, and three-dimensional models are implemented. Cross sections can be obtained from standard databases or from Monte-Carlo simulations. Benchmarks and literature tests were performed, concluding with a successful blanket simulation.</description>

      <title>ACTest: A testing toolkit for analytic continuation methods and codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ACTest is an open-source toolkit developed in the Julia language. Its central goal is to automatically establish analytic continuation testing datasets, which include a large number of spectral functions and the corresponding Green's functions. These datasets can be used to benchmark various analytic continuation methods and codes. In ACTest, the spectral functions are constructed by a superposition of randomly generated Gaussian, Lorentzian, $\delta$-like, rectangular, and Rise-And-Decay peaks. The spectra can be positive definite or non-positive definite. The corresponding energy grids can be linear or non-linear. ACTest supports both fermionic and bosonic Green's functions on either imaginary time or Matsubara frequency axes. Artificial noise can be superimposed on the synthetic Green's functions to simulate realistic Green's functions obtained by quantum Monte Carlo calculations. ACTest includes a standard testing dataset, namely ACT100. This built-in dataset contains 100 testing cases that cover representative analytic continuation scenarios. Now ACTest is fully integrated with the ACFlow toolkit. It can directly invoke the analytic continuation methods as implemented in the ACFlow toolkit for calculations, analyze calculated results, and evaluate computational efficiency and accuracy. ACTest comprises many examples and detailed documentation. The purpose of this paper is to introduce the major features and usages of the ACTest toolkit. The benchmark results on the ACT100 dataset for the maximum entropy method, which is probably the most popular analytic continuation method, are also presented.</description>

      <title>Improved Initial Guesses for Numerical Solutions of Kepler's Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical solutions of Kepler's Equation are critical components of celestial mechanics software, and are often computation hot spots. This work uses symbolic regression and a genetic learning algorithm to find new initial guesses for iterative Kepler solvers for both elliptical and hyperbolic orbits. The new initial guesses are simple to implement, and result in modest speed improvements for elliptical orbits, and major speed improvements for hyperbolic orbits.</description>

      <title>Minimizing Nature's Cost: Exploring Data-Free Physics-Informed Neural Network Solvers for Fluid Mechanics Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel approach for fluid dynamic simulations by harnessing the capabilities of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) guided by the newly unveiled principle of minimum pressure gradient (PMPG). In a PINN formulation, the physics problem is converted into a minimization problem (typically least squares). The PMPG asserts that for incompressible flows, the total magnitude of the pressure gradient over the domain must be minimum at every time instant, turning fluid mechanics into minimization problems, making it an excellent choice for PINNs formulation. Following the PMPG, the proposed PINN formulation seeks to construct a neural network for the flow field that minimizes Nature's cost function for incompressible flows in contrast to traditional PINNs that minimize the residuals of the Navier-Stokes equations. This technique eliminates the need to train a separate pressure model, thereby reducing training time and computational costs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach through a case study of inviscid flow around a cylinder, showing its ability to capture the underlying physics, while reducing computational cost and training time. The proposed approach outperforms the traditional PINNs approach in terms of Root Mean Square Error, training time, convergence rate, and compliance with physical metrics. While demonstrated on a simple geometry, the methodology is extendable to more complex flow fields (e.g., Three-Dimensional, unsteady, viscous flows) within the incompressible realm, which is the region of applicability of the PMPG.</description>

      <title>Optical absorption spectroscopy probes water wire and its ordering in a hydrogen-bond network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Water wires, quasi-one-dimensional chains composed of hydrogen-bonded (H-bonded) water molecules, play a fundamental role in numerous chemical, physical, and physiological processes. Yet direct experimental detection of water wires has been elusive so far. Based on advanced $ab$ $initio$ many-body theory that includes electron-hole interactions, we report that optical absorption spectroscopy can serve as a sensitive probe of water wires and their ordering. In both liquid and solid water, the main peak of the spectrum is discovered to be a charge transfer exciton. In water, the charge transfer exciton is strongly coupled to the H-bonding environment where the exciton is excited between H-bonded water molecules with a large spectral intensity. In regular ice, the spectral weight of the charge transfer exciton is enhanced by a collective excitation occurring on proton-ordered water wires, whose spectral intensity scales with the ordering length of water wire. The spectral intensity and excitonic interaction strength reaches its maximum in ice XI, where the long-range ordering length yields the most pronounced spectral signal. Our findings suggest that water wires, which widely exist in important physiological and biological systems and other phases of ice, can be directly probed by this approach.</description>

      <title>Optimal convergence in finite element fully discrete error analysis and a novel fast solver for the Doyle-Fuller-Newman model of lithium-ion batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the convergence of a backward Euler finite element discretization applied to a multi-domain and multi-scale elliptic-parabolic system, derived from the Doyle-Fuller-Newman model for lithium-ion batteries. Our analysis establishes optimal-order error estimates for variables in the norms $l^2(H^1)$ and $l^2(L^2(H^q_r))$, $q=0,1$. To enhance computational efficiency, we introduce a novel scale-decoupled solver that balances rapid convergence with reduced memory requirements. Numerical experiments using realistic battery parameters validate the theoretical error rates and highlight the superior performance of the proposed solver compared to existing algorithms.</description>

      <title>Distinctive Electronic Characteristics and Ultra-high Thermoelectric Power Factor in Be-Fe Intermetallics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beryllium (Be) alloys are indispensable in cutting-edge applications due to their unique advantages. However, the scientific understanding about their structure and property is deficient, which greatly restricts their applications within a narrow field. In this work, a systematic investigation on the structure and properties of Be-Fe binary was carried out with first-principles unbiased evolutionary algorithms. Five new intermetallics unreported before, including insulating Be11Fe and Be4Fe, metallic Be3Fe, and metastable BeFe and BeFe2 were discovered, among which Be11Fe has a unique clathrate structure and is an electride. Surprisingly, we found that Fe unexpectedly acts as an anion in all known Be-Fe intermetallics, and its valence state can even reach -5, leading to the complete filling of its 3d orbitals. Most of these compounds exhibiting a gap or pseudogap at the Fermi level. Specifically, the band gap is determined as 0.22 eV and 0.85 eV for Be11Fe and Be4Fe at the level of single-shot GW, respectively. This is the first report of insulating phases in Be-based intermetallics. We also discovered that Be11Fe exhibits an impressive thermoelectric power factor of 178 ${\mu}W cm^{-1}K^2$ at room temperature, to our best knowledge, the highest among known semiconductors under ambient conditions, indicating its potential for waste heat harvesting and active cooling. These findings will deepen our understanding of Be-based and Fe-based compounds, and expand the application fields of Be-based alloys to a brand-new realm.</description>

      <title>High-Performances AlGaN-based DUV-LED via Under-Level Multiple Quantum Well Configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low internal and external quantum efficiencies in high Aluminium content AlGaN-based deep-ultraviolet light-emitting diode (DUV-LED) occurred due to strong polarization effects, spontaneous and piezoelectric polarization, at the interface between two materials. It also leads to a low carrier confinement and Quantum Confined Stark Effect (QCSE), contributing to the efficiency droop of the DUV-LED. This work demonstrates an under-level MQW configuration implemented in a DUV-LED with a 257 nm emission wavelength. Three DUV-LED structures, above-, same- and under-level MQW were investigated, covering important optoelectronics properties such as energy band diagram, carrier concentrations, radiative recombination rates and electric field distribution. It is found that the quantum efficiencies, luminescence intensity and light output power of the under-level configuration has been enhanced by nine-, ten- and five-folds, relative to the above-level MQW configuration.</description>

Abstract: The paper gathers and unifies mechanical stability conditions for all symmetry classes of 3D and 2D materials under arbitrary load. The methodology is based on the spectral decomposition of the fourth-order stiffness tensors mapped to a second-order tensors using orthonormal (Mandel) notation, and the verification of the positivity of the so-called Kelvin moduli. An explicit set of stability conditions for 3D and 2D crystals of higher symmetry is also included, as well as a Mathematica notebook that allows mechanical stability analysis for crystals, stress-free and stressed, of arbitrary symmetry under arbitrary loads.</description>

      <title>Interpolatory dynamical low-rank approximation for the 3+3d Boltzmann-BGK equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce two novel interpolatory dynamical low-rank (DLR) approximation methods for the efficient time integration of the Boltzmann-BGK equation. Both methods overcome limitations of classic DLR schemes based on orthogonal projections for nonlinear equations. In particular, we demonstrate that the proposed methods can efficiently compute solutions to the full Boltzmann-BGK equation without restricting to e.g. weakly compressible or isothermal flow. The first method we propose directly applies the recently developed interpolatory projector-splitting scheme on low-rank matrix manifolds. The second method is a variant of the rank-adaptive basis update and Galerkin scheme, where the Galerkin step is replaced by a collocation step, resulting in a new scheme we call basis update and collocate (BUC). Numerical experiments in both fluid and kinetic regimes demonstrate the performance of the proposed methods. In particular we demonstrate that the methods can be used to efficiently compute low-rank solutions in the six-dimensional (three spatial and three velocity dimensions) setting on a standard laptop.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-energy physics requires the generation of large numbers of simulated data samples from complex but analytically tractable distributions called matrix elements. Surrogate models, such as normalizing flows, are gaining popularity for this task due to their computational efficiency. We adopt an approach based on Flow Annealed importance sampling Bootstrap (FAB) that evaluates the differentiable target density during training and helps avoid the costly generation of training data in advance. We show that FAB reaches higher sampling efficiency with fewer target evaluations in high dimensions in comparison to other methods.</description>

      <title>Simulation of two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy on a near-term quantum computer using a probe qubit protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) is a powerful tool for exploring quantum effects in energy transport within photosynthetic systems and investigating novel material properties. However, simulating the dynamics of these experiments poses significant challenges for classical computers due to the large system sizes and long timescales involved. This paper introduces the probe qubit protocol (PQP)-for quantum simulation of 2DES on near-term quantum devices-addressing these challenges. The PQP offers several enhancements over standard methods, notably reducing computational resources by requiring only a single-qubit measurement per circuit run and achieving Heisenberg scaling in detection frequency resolution, without the need to apply expensive controlled evolution operators in the quantum circuit. The implementation of the PQP protocol requires only one additional ancilla qubit, the probe qubit, with one-to-all connectivity and two-qubit interactions between each system and probe qubits. We evaluate the computational resources necessary for this protocol in detail, demonstrating its function as a dynamic frequency-filtering method through numerical simulations. We find that simulations of the PQP on classical and quantum computers enable a reduction on the number of measurements, i.e. simulation runtime, and memory savings of several orders of magnitude relatively to standard quantum simulation protocols of 2DES. The paper discusses the applicability of the PQP on near-term quantum devices and highlights potential applications where this spetroscopy simulation protocol could provide significant speedups over standard approaches such as the quantum simulation of 2DES applied to the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex in green sulphur bacteria.</description>

      <title>A Multi-agent Framework for Materials Laws Discovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uncovering the underlying laws governing correlations between different materials properties, and the structure-composition-property relationship, is essential for advancing materials theory and enabling efficient materials design. With recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in large language models (LLMs), symbolic regression has emerged as a powerful method for deriving explicit formulas for materials laws. LLMs, with their pre-trained, cross-disciplinary knowledge, present a promising direction in "AI for Materials". In this work, we introduce a multi-agent framework based on LLMs specifically designed for symbolic regression in materials science. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework using the glass-forming ability (GFA) of metallic glasses as a case study, employing three characteristic temperatures as independent variables. Our framework derived an interpretable formula to describe GFA, achieving a correlation coefficient of up to 0.948 with low formula complexity. This approach outperforms standard packages such as GPlearn and demonstrates a ~30% improvement over random generation methods, owing to integrated memory and reflection mechanisms. The proposed framework can be extended to discover laws in various materials applications, supporting new materials design and enhancing the interpretation of experimental and simulation data.</description>

      <title>Kinetic surface model in FESTIM: Verification and Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The open-source code FESTIM (Finite Element Simulation of Tritium In Materials) is a powerful user-friendly software for hydrogen transport simulations. Up to now, it was capable of addressing various hydrogen transport problems with surface processes dependent on the concentration of solute species. However, the kinetics of surface hydrogen concentration should be considered under certain conditions. The recent 1.3 release of FESTIM introduced a new kinetic surface model, implemented in a flexible way for various applications. The correctness of the implementation is first proven using the method of manufactured solutions. Then, reliability of the model is demonstrated by reproducing four experimental cases on dynamics of hydrogen isotope retention in different materials. An additional cross-code comparison with two other simulation packages, MHIMS and TESSIM-X, shows an excellent agreement and strengthens the validity of the model.</description>

      <title>Non-Linear Super-Stencils for Turbulence Model Corrections</title>

Abstract: Accurate simulation of turbulent flows remains a challenge due to the high computational cost of direct numerical simulations (DNS) and the limitations of traditional turbulence models. This paper explores a novel approach to augmenting standard models for Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations using a Non-Linear Super-Stencil (NLSS). The proposed method introduces a fully connected neural network that learns a mapping from the local mean flow field to a corrective force term, which is added to a standard RANS solver in order to align its solution with high-fidelity data. A procedure is devised to extract training data from reference DNS and large eddy simulations (LES). To reduce the complexity of the non-linear mapping, the dimensionless local flow data is aligned with the local mean velocity, and the local support domain is scaled by the turbulent integral length scale. After being trained on a single periodic hill case, the NLSS-corrected RANS solver is shown to generalize to different periodic hill geometries and different Reynolds numbers, producing significantly more accurate solutions than the uncorrected RANS simulations.</description>

      <title>dCG -- differentiable connected geometries for AI-compatible multi-domain optimization and inverse design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05833v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the domain of geometry and topology optimization, discovering geometries that optimally satisfy specific problem criteria is a complex challenge in both engineering and scientific research. In this work, we propose a new approach for the creation of multidomain connected geometries that are designed to work with automatic differentiation. We introduce the concept of differentiable Connected Geometries (dCG), discussing its theoretical aspects and illustrating its application through a simple toy examples and a more sophisticated photonic optimization task. Since these geometries are built upon the principles of automatic differentiation, they are compatible with existing deep learning frameworks, a feature we demonstrate via the application examples. This methodology provides a systematic way to approach geometric design and optimization in computational fields involving dependent geometries, potentially improving the efficiency and effectiveness of optimization tasks in scientific and engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of States and Quasiparticles in Many-body Downfolding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the principles of many-body Hamiltonian complexity reduction via downfolding on an effective low-dimensional representation. We present a unique measure of fidelity between the effective (reduced-rank) description and the full many-body treatment for arbitrary (i.e., ground and excited) states. When the entire problem is mapped on a system of interacting quasiparticles [npj Computational Materials 9 (1), 126, 2023], the effective Hamiltonians can faithfully reproduce the physics only when a clear energy scale separation exists between the subsystems and its environment. We also demonstrate that it is necessary to include quasiparticle renormalization at distinct energy scales, capturing the distinct interaction between subsystems and their surrounding environments. Numerical results from simple, exactly solvable models highlight the limitations and strengths of this approach, particularly for ground and low-lying excited states. This work lays the groundwork for applying dynamical downfolding techniques to problems concerned with (quantum) interfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16559v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A theory of the absorption of a laser field by an atomic or condensed matter medium is presented for the case where the medium is also interacting with a strong electromagnetic field. The rotating wave approximation is not assumed for the latter. It is shown that in the weak probe limit the Lindblad master equation reduces to a smaller system of linear equations for the relevant steady state coherences. In this limit, the complex susceptibility of the medium can be expressed in terms of individual contributions of decaying dressed states, the latter being eigenstates of a non-Hermitian Floquet Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Lindblad pseudomode theory for open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new framework to study the dynamics of open quantum systems with linearly coupled Gaussian baths. Our approach replaces the continuous bath with an auxiliary discrete set of pseudomodes with dissipative dynamics, but we further relax the complete positivity requirement in the Lindblad master equation and formulate a quasi-Lindblad pseudomode theory. We show that this quasi-Lindblad pseudomode formulation directly leads to a representation of the bath correlation function in terms of a complex weighted sum of complex exponentials, an expansion that is known to be rapidly convergent in practice and thus leads to a compact set of pseudomodes. The pseudomode representation is not unique and can differ by a gauge choice. When the global dynamics can be simulated exactly, the system dynamics is unique and independent of the specific pseudomode representation. However, the gauge choice may affect the stability of the global dynamics, and we provide an analysis of why and when the global dynamics can retain stability despite losing positivity. We showcase the performance of this formulation across various spectral densities in both bosonic and fermionic problems, finding significant improvements over conventional pseudomode formulations.</description>

      <title>Single-snapshot machine learning for super-resolution of turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern machine-learning techniques are generally considered data-hungry. However, this may not be the case for turbulence as each of its snapshots can hold more information than a single data file in general machine-learning settings. This study asks the question of whether nonlinear machine-learning techniques can effectively extract physical insights even from as little as a {\it single} snapshot of turbulent flow. As an example, we consider machine-learning-based super-resolution analysis that reconstructs a high-resolution field from low-resolution data for two examples of two-dimensional isotropic turbulence and three-dimensional turbulent channel flow. First, we reveal that a carefully designed machine-learning model trained with flow tiles sampled from only a single snapshot can reconstruct vortical structures across a range of Reynolds numbers for two-dimensional decaying turbulence. Successful flow reconstruction indicates that nonlinear machine-learning techniques can leverage scale-invariance properties to learn turbulent flows. We also show that training data of turbulent flows can be cleverly collected from a single snapshot by considering characteristics of rotation and shear tensors. Second, we perform the single-snapshot super-resolution analysis for turbulent channel flow, showing that it is possible to extract physical insights from a single flow snapshot even with inhomogeneity. The present findings suggest that embedding prior knowledge in designing a model and collecting data is important for a range of data-driven analyses for turbulent flows. More broadly, this work hopes to stop machine-learning practitioners from being wasteful with turbulent flow data.</description>

Abstract: Quantum state tomography (QST) is an essential technique for characterizing quantum states. However, practical implementations of QST are significantly challenged by factors such as shot noise, attenuation, and Raman scattering, especially when photonic qubits are transmitted through optical fibers alongside classical signals. In this paper, we present a numerical framework to simulate and evaluate the efficiency of QST under these realistic conditions. The results reveal how the efficiency of QST is influenced by the power of the classical signal. By analyzing the fidelity of reconstructed states, we provide insights into the limitations and potential improvements for QST in noisy environments.</description>

      <title>Single-fluid simulation of partially-ionized, non-ideal plasma facilitated by a tabulated equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a single-fluid approach for the simulation of partially-ionized plasmas (PIPs) which is designed to capture the non-ideal effects introduced by neutrals while remaining close in computational efficiency to single-fluid MHD. This is achieved using a model which treats the entire partially-ionized plasma as a single mixture, which renders internal ionization/recombination source terms unnecessary as both the charged and neutral species are part of the mixture's conservative system. Instead, the effects of ionization and the differing physics of the species are encapsulated as material properties of the mixture. Furthermore, the differing dynamics between the charged and neutral species is captured using a relative-velocity quantity, which impacts the bulk behavior of the mixture in a manner similar to the treatment of the ion-electron relative-velocity as current in MHD. Unlike fully-ionized plasmas, the species composition of a PIP changes rapidly with its thermodynamic state. This is captured through a look-up table referred to as the tabulated equation of state (TabEoS), which is constructed prior to runtime using empirical physicochemical databases and efficiently provides the ionization fraction and other material properties of the PIP specific to the thermodynamic state of each computational cell. Crucially, the use of TabEoS also allows our approach to self-consistently capture the non-linear feedback cycle between the PIP's macroscopic behavior and the microscopic physics of its internal particles, which is neglected in many fluid simulations of plasmas today.</description>
