      <title>PT-symmetric branched optical lattices: Spectral properties and stability of solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate branched PT-symmetric optical lattices. We consider both the linear and nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with a PT-symmetric periodic potential on the graph and solve them by imposing weighted vertex boundary conditions. A constraint derived from these vertex conditions determines the exceptional point of the system. In the PT unbroken phase, this constraint enforces PT-symmetric boundary conditions at the vertices, ensuring a purely real spectrum; its violation leads to the emergence of complex eigenvalues in the linear regime. In the nonlinear regime, the same constraint determines the linear stability of solitons: satisfying the constraint yields stable solitons, whereas violating it corresponds to unstable solitons.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Step Jamming in Nanometer-Scale KPZ-like Rough Surfaces under Interface-Limited Crystal Growth and Retreat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate an intrinsic step-jamming phenomenon at the nanometer scale on Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ)-like kinetically roughened crystal surfaces that arises during interface-limited steady crystal growth or retreat. Monte Carlo simulations using the Metropolis algorithm on a restricted solid-on-solid (RSOS) lattice model demonstrate that intrinsic step jamming persists on surfaces below 20 nm. In the present model, transport processes such as surface and volume diffusion are excluded, as are elastic interactions, step-step repulsion or attraction, and stoichiometric effects. We show that intrinsic step jamming arises from asymmetric fluctuations in atomic attachment and detachment driven by biased transition probabilities under the SOS restriction, leading to collective step congestion. Asymmetric fluctuations also determine whether adatom or hole clusters grow or recede. This mechanism bears close similarity to jamming phenomena in the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP), including multi-lane variants. In contrast, symmetric thermal fluctuations generate adatom or hole clusters on terraces, thereby suppressing intrinsic step jamming. Possible routes to suppress intrinsic step jamming, including experimentally accessible strategies, are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Multiple double-valley and single-valley dark solitons in the complex modified Korteweg-de Vries equation: shape-preserving collisions and shape-altering collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The shape-preserving and shape-altering collisions of dark solitons are investigated in the complex modified Korteweg-de Vries equation. The obtained dark soliton solutions are classified into two distinct types, referred to as type-I and type-II dark solitons, which exhibit fundamentally different structural and dynamical characteristics. A single type-I dark soliton is symmetric about its center and admits three distinct valley profiles, namely single-valley, double-valley, and flat-bottom structures, whereas a single type-II dark soliton only supports a single-valley profile. These two types of dark solitons differ in their phase behaviors as the spatial variable varies from $-\infty$ to $+\infty$, as well as in their velocity--amplitude relations. For multiple pure type-I dark solitons, collisions are shape-preserving; however, a nontrivial collective effect is revealed in which modifying the parameters of one soliton can induce changes in the profiles and amplitudes of the other solitons, even though all collisions remain elastic in nature. In contrast, multiple pure type-II dark solitons behave independently, undergoing only phase shifts without any modification of their shapes or amplitudes. When type-I and type-II dark solitons coexist, their interactions lead to genuine shape-altering collisions, where the valley structures and amplitudes of type-I dark solitons are modified, while type-II solitons remain unaffected except for phase shifts. Asymptotic analysis further shows that the influence of type-II dark solitons on type-I dark solitons is confined to the pre-collision stage and disappears after the interaction.</description>

      <title>A split-step Christov method for approximating rational PDE solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04013v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rational solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs) are notoriously difficult to approximate via spectral Fourier methods due to their algebraically slow decay rate. In this work we discuss approximating rational PDE solutions in a basis of orthogonal functions known as the Fourier series, allowing for the computation of its spectrum via the fast Fourier transform. Spectral differentiation matrices are derived. Several explicit fourth-order split-step integrators are derived and their performance compared. As an application, rogue wave solutions in a family of nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations are explored. Perturbing the constant background is found to generate rogue wave-like structures. The effects of higher-order dispersion and generalized nonlinearities are also examined.</description>
