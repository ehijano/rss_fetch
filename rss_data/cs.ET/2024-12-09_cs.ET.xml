      <title>Mixed Delay/Nondelay Embeddings Based Neuromorphic Computing with Patterned Nanomagnet Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Patterned nanomagnet arrays (PNAs) have been shown to exhibit a strong geometrically frustrated dipole interaction. Some PNAs have also shown emergent domain wall dynamics. Previous works have demonstrated methods to physically probe these magnetization dynamics of PNAs to realize neuromorphic reservoir systems that exhibit chaotic dynamical behavior and high-dimensional nonlinearity. These PNA reservoir systems from prior works leverage echo state properties and linear/nonlinear short-term memory of component reservoir nodes to map and preserve the dynamical information of the input time-series data into nondelay spatial embeddings. Such mappings enable these PNA reservoir systems to imitate and predict/forecast the input time series data. However, these prior PNA reservoir systems are based solely on the nondelay spatial embeddings obtained at component reservoir nodes. As a result, they require a massive number of component reservoir nodes, or a very large spatial embedding (i.e., high-dimensional spatial embedding) per reservoir node, or both, to achieve acceptable imitation and prediction accuracy. These requirements reduce the practical feasibility of such PNA reservoir systems. To address this shortcoming, we present a mixed delay/nondelay embeddings-based PNA reservoir system. Our system uses a single PNA reservoir node with the ability to obtain a mixture of delay/nondelay embeddings of the dynamical information of the time-series data applied at the input of a single PNA reservoir node. Our analysis shows that when these mixed delay/nondelay embeddings are used to train a perceptron at the output layer, our reservoir system outperforms existing PNA-based reservoir systems for the imitation of NARMA 2, NARMA 5, NARMA 7, and NARMA 10 time series data, and for the short-term and long-term prediction of the Mackey Glass time series data.</description>

      <title>Cutting is All You Need: Execution of Large-Scale Quantum Neural Networks on Limited-Qubit Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement in Quantum Computing (QC), particularly through Noisy-Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, has spurred significant interest in Quantum Machine Learning (QML) applications. Despite their potential, fully-quantum QML algorithms remain impractical due to the limitations of current NISQ devices. Hybrid quantum-classical neural networks (HQNNs) have emerged as a viable alternative, leveraging both quantum and classical computations to enhance machine learning capabilities. However, the constrained resources of NISQ devices, particularly the limited number of qubits, pose significant challenges for executing large-scale quantum circuits.
  This work addresses these current challenges by proposing a novel and practical methodology for quantum circuit cutting of HQNNs, allowing large quantum circuits to be executed on limited-qubit NISQ devices. Our approach not only preserves the accuracy of the original circuits but also supports the training of quantum parameters across all subcircuits, which is crucial for the learning process in HQNNs. We propose a cutting methodology for HQNNs that employs a greedy algorithm for identifying efficient cutting points, and the implementation of trainable subcircuits, all designed to maximize the utility of NISQ devices in HQNNs. The findings suggest that quantum circuit cutting is a promising technique for advancing QML on current quantum hardware, since the cut circuit achieves comparable accuracy and much lower qubit requirements than the original circuit.</description>

      <title>PERCY: A Multimodal Dataset and Conversational System for Personalized and Emotionally Aware Human-Robot Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of conversational agents into our daily lives has become increasingly common, yet many of these agents cannot engage in deep interactions with humans. Despite this, there is a noticeable shortage of datasets that capture multimodal information from human-robot interaction dialogues. To address this gap, we have developed a Personal Emotional Robotic Conversational sYstem (PERCY) and recorded a novel multimodal dataset that encompasses rich embodied interaction data. The process involved asking participants to complete a questionnaire and gathering their profiles on ten topics, such as hobbies and favourite music. Subsequently, we initiated conversations between the robot and the participants, leveraging GPT-4 to generate contextually appropriate responses based on the participant's profile and emotional state, as determined by facial expression recognition and sentiment analysis. Automatic and user evaluations were conducted to assess the overall quality of the collected data. The results of both evaluations indicated a high level of naturalness, engagement, fluency, consistency, and relevance in the conversation, as well as the robot's ability to provide empathetic responses. It is worth noting that the dataset is derived from genuine interactions with the robot, involving participants who provided personal information and conveyed actual emotions.</description>

      <title>Cross-modal semantic segmentation for indoor environmental perception using single-chip millimeter-wave radar raw data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of firefighting and rescue operations, a cross-modal semantic segmentation model based on a single-chip millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar for indoor environmental perception is proposed and discussed. To efficiently obtain high-quality labels, an automatic label generation method utilizing LiDAR point clouds and occupancy grid maps is introduced. The proposed segmentation model is based on U-Net. A spatial attention module is incorporated, which enhanced the performance of the mode. The results demonstrate that cross-modal semantic segmentation provides a more intuitive and accurate representation of indoor environments. Unlike traditional methods, the model's segmentation performance is minimally affected by azimuth. Although performance declines with increasing distance, this can be mitigated by a well-designed model. Additionally, it was found that using raw ADC data as input is ineffective; compared to RA tensors, RD tensors are more suitable for the proposed model.</description>

      <title>FAMES: Fast Approximate Multiplier Substitution for Mixed-Precision Quantized DNNs--Down to 2 Bits!</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18055v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A widely-used technique in designing energy-efficient deep neural network (DNN) accelerators is quantization. Recent progress in this direction has reduced the bitwidths used in DNN down to 2. Meanwhile, many prior works apply approximate multipliers (AppMuls) in designing DNN accelerators to lower their energy consumption. Unfortunately, these works still assume a bitwidth much larger than 2, which falls far behind the state-of-the-art in quantization area and even challenges the meaningfulness of applying AppMuls in DNN accelerators, since a high-bitwidth AppMul consumes much more energy than a low-bitwidth exact multiplier! Thus, an important problem to study is: Can approximate multipliers be effectively applied to quantized DNN models with very low bitwidths? In this work, we give an affirmative answer to this question and present a systematic solution that achieves the answer: FAMES, a fast approximate multiplier substitution method for mixed-precision DNNs. Our experiments demonstrate an average 28.67% energy reduction on state-of-the-art mixed-precision quantized models with bitwidths as low as 2 bits and accuracy losses kept under 1%. Additionally, our approach is up to 300x faster than previous genetic algorithm-based methods.</description>

      <title>MQFL-FHE: Multimodal Quantum Federated Learning Framework with Fully Homomorphic Encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01858v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) in federated learning (FL) has led to significant advances in data privacy. However, during the aggregation phase, it often results in performance degradation of the aggregated model, hindering the development of robust representational generalization. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal quantum federated learning framework that utilizes quantum computing to counteract the performance drop resulting from FHE. For the first time in FL, our framework combines a multimodal quantum mixture of experts (MQMoE) model with FHE, incorporating multimodal datasets for enriched representation and task-specific learning. Our MQMoE framework enhances performance on multimodal datasets and combined genomics and brain MRI scans, especially for underrepresented categories. Our results also demonstrate that the quantum-enhanced approach mitigates the performance degradation associated with FHE and improves classification accuracy across diverse datasets, validating the potential of quantum interventions in enhancing privacy in FL.</description>
