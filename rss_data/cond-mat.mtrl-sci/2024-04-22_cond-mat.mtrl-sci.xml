      <title>Semitransparent perovskite solar cells with an evaporated ultra-thin perovskite absorber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal halide perovskites are of great interest for application in semitransparent solar cells due to their tunable bandgap and high performance. However, fabricating high-efficiency perovskite semitransparent devices with high average visible transmittance (AVT) is challenging because of their high absorption coefficient. Here, we adopt a co-evaporation process to fabricate ultrathin CsPbI3 perovskite films. Due to the smooth surface and orientated crystal growth of the evaporated perovskite films, we are able to achieve 10 nm thin films with compact and continuous morphology without pinholes. When integrated into a p-i-n device structure of glass/ITO/PTAA/perovskite/PCBM/BCP/Al/Ag with an optimized transparent electrode, these ultrathin layers result in an impressive open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.08 V and a fill factor (FF) of 80%. Consequently, a power conversion efficiency of 3.6% with an AVT above 50% is demonstrated, achieved in the 10 nm semitransparent perovskite solar cells, which is the first report for a perovskite device of 10 nm active layer with higher VOC, FF and AVT. These findings demonstrate that evaporation process is a possible way for compact ultrathin perovskite film, which has the potential for future smart windows, light emitting diodes, and tandem device applications.</description>

      <title>Alloyed Re$_x$Mo$_{1-x}$S$_2$ Nanoflakes with Enlarged Interlayer Distances for Hydrogen Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molybdenum sulfide (MoS$_2$) has attracted significant attention due to its great potential as a low-cost and efficient catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction. Developing a facile, easily upscalable, and inexpensive approach to produce catalytically active nanostructured MoS$_2$ with a high yield would significantly advance its practical application. Colloidal synthesis offers several advantages over other preparation techniques to overcome the low reaction yield of exfoliation and drawbacks of expensive equipment and processes used in chemical vapor deposition. In this work, we report an efficient synthesis of alloyed Re$_x$Mo$_{1-x}$S$_2$ nanoflakes with an enlarged interlayer distance, among which the composition Re$_{0.55}$Mo$_{0.45}$S$_2$ exhibits excellent catalytic performance with overpotentials as low as 79 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and a small Tafel slope of 42 mV/dec. Density functional theory calculations prove that enlarging the distance between layers in the Re$_x$Mo$_{1-x}$S$_2$alloy can greatly improve its catalytic performance due to a significantly reduced free energy of hydrogen adsorption. The developed approach paves the way to design advanced transition metal dichalcogenide-based catalysts for hydrogen evolution and to promote their large-scale practical application.</description>

      <title>Exploring interlayer coupling in the twisted bilayer PtTe$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated interlayer interactions in the bilayer PtTe$_{2}$ system, which influence the electronic energy bands near the Fermi levels. Our diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) calculations for the high-symmetry bilayer stackings (AA, AB, AC) manifest distinct interlayer binding characteristics among the stacking modes by revealing significantly different interlayer separations depending on the stackings, which is critical to understanding the interlayer coupling of the twisted bilayers consisting of various local stacking arrangements. Furthermore, a comparison between the interlayer separations obtained from DMC and density functional theory (DFT) shows that meta-GGA-based vdW-DFT results agree with DMC for different layer stackings, including twisted bilayers, but only the ground-state AA stacking matches well with GGA-based DFT predictions. This underscores the importance of accurate exchange-correlation potentials even for capturing the stacking-dependent interlayer binding properties. We further show that the variability in DFT-predicted interlayer separations is responsible for the large discrepancy of band structures in the 21.79$^{\circ}$-twisted bilayer PtTe$_{2}$, affecting its classification as metallic or semiconducting. These results demonstrate the importance of obtaining a correct description of stacking-dependent interlayer coupling in modeling delicate bilayer systems at finite twists.</description>

      <title>Tuning exciton emission via ferroelectric polarization at a heterogeneous interface between a monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide and a perovskite oxide membrane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the integration of a thin BaTiO$_3$ (BTO) membrane with monolayer MoSe$_2$ in a dual gate device that enables in-situ manipulation of the BTO ferroelectric polarization with a voltage pulse. While two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) offer remarkable adaptability, their hybrid integration with other families of functional materials beyond the realm of 2D materials has been challenging. Released functional oxide membranes offer a solution for 2D/3D integration via stacking. 2D TMD excitons can serve as a local probe of the ferroelectric polarization in BTO at a heterogeneous interface. Using photoluminescence (PL) of MoSe$_2$ excitons to optically readout the doping level, we find that the relative population of charge carriers in MoSe$_2$ depends sensitively on the ferroelectric polarization. This finding points to a promising avenue for future-generations versatile sensing devices with high sensitivity, fast read-out, and diverse applicability for advanced signal processing.</description>

      <title>Nonlocality and Strength of Interatomic Interactions Inducing the Topological Phonon Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the phonon behavior in semiconductors from a topological physics perspective provides more opportunities to uncover extraordinary physics related to phonon transport and electron-phonon interactions. While various kinds of topological phonons have been reported in different crystalline solids, their microscopic origin has not been quantitatively uncovered. In this work, four typical analytical interatomic force constant (IFC) models are employed for wurtzite GaN and AlN to help establish the relationships between phonon topology and real-space IFCs. In particular, various nearest neighbor IFCs, i.e., different levels of nonlocality, and IFC strength controlled by characteristic coefficients, can be achieved in these models. The results demonstrate that changes in the strength of both the IFCs and nonlocal interactions can induce phonon phase transitions in GaN and AlN, leading to the disappearance of existing Weyl phonons and the appearance of new Weyl phonons. These new Weyl phonons are the result of a band reversal and have a Chern number of 1. Most of them are located in the kz=0 plane in pairs, while some of them are inside or at the boundary of the irreducible Brillouin zone. Among the various Weyl points observed, certain ones remain identical in both materials, while others exhibit variability depending on the particular case. Compared to the strength of the IFC, nonlocal interactions show much more significant effects in inducing the topological phonon phase transition, especially in cases modeled by the IFC model and SW potential. The larger number of 3NN atoms provides more space for variations in the topological phonon phase of wurtzite AlN than in GaN, resulting in a greater abundance of changes in AlN.</description>

      <title>Mixed polytype/polymorph formation and its effects on the electronic properties in InSe films grown by molecular beam epitaxy on GaAs(111)B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The top-down synthesis of inherently ferroelectric semiconductors and their integration with traditional material platforms have the potential to enable new low power logic devices, and to harness the bulk photoelectric effect for more efficient photovoltaic cells. InSe is a layered van der Waals compound exhibiting multiple polytypes, with semiconducting gamma-InSe revealing a non-centrosymmetric space group and showing a high carrier mobility at room temperature. Here we report the growth of InSe films on close to lattice matched semi-insulating GaAs(111)B substrates by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Excellent nucleation behavior resulted in the growth of smooth, single phase InSe films. The dominant polytype determined from X-ray diffraction was the targeted gamma-InSe, however Raman spectroscopy revealed spatial variations in the overall low-intensity non-centrosymmetric vibration modes. Transmission electron microscopy uncovered the presence of the three bulk polytypes beta, gamma, and epsilon-InSe coexisting in the films arranging in nanosized domains. The different polytypes can be interpreted as sequences of stacking faults and rotational twin boundaries of gamma-InSe made from individual non-centrosymmetric Se-In-In-Se layers with P-6m2 symmetry. A second, centrosymmetric Se-In-In-Se layer polymorph was identified with P-3m symmetry, which is typically not present in InSe bulk phases. First principles calculations revealed small formation energy differences between the InSe polymorphs and polytypes, yet sizeable differences in their electronic properties. Nanoscale domain sizes of varying polytypes thus resulted in sizeable electronic disorder in the grown films that dominated the electronic transport properties. Our results indicate that bottom-up thin film synthesis is a viable synthesis route towards stabilization of InSe polytypes not present in the bulk.</description>

      <title>Topological magnon in exchange frustration driven incommensurate spin spiral of a kagome lattice YMn$_6$Sn$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: YMn$_6$Sn$_6$ consists of two types of Mn-based kagome planes stacked along $c$-axis having a complex magnetic interactions. We report a spin reconstruction in YMn$_6$Sn$_6$ from ferromagnet (FM) into a combination of two incommensurate spin spirals (SSs) originating from two different type of Mn kagome planes driven by frustrated magnetic exchanges along the $c$-axis with inclusion of Hubbard U. The pitch angle and wave vector of the incommensurate SSs are $\sim$89.3$^{\circ}$ and $\sim$ (0 0 0.248) respectively which are in excellent agreement with experiment. We employed an effective model Hamiltonian constructed out of exchange interactions to capture experimentally observed non-equivalent nature of the two incommensurate SSs which also explain FM-SS crossover due to antiferromagntic spin exchange with correlation. We further report the existence of topological magnon with spin-orbit coupling in incommensurate SS phase of YMn$_6$Sn$_6$ by calculating the topological invariants and Berry curvature profile. The location of Dirac magnon in energy landscape at 73 meV matches with another experimental report. We demonstrate the accuracy of our results by highlighting experimental features in YMn$_6$Sn$_6$.</description>

      <title>Temperature and Pressure Dependent Luminescence Mechanism of Zinc-Blende Structured ZnS:Mn Nanophosphor under UV and X-ray Excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comprehensive photoluminescence and mechanoluminescence analysis of ZnS:Mn2+ nano-phosphor with zinc blende structure is presented. The sample containing quantum dot-sized nanocrystallites were synthesized by the chemical precipitation method and shows excellent orange luminescence at ambient conditions related to the 4T1-&gt;6A1 transition. The sample shows stable and identical luminescence behavior under both UV and X-ray excitation at ambient conditions and also shows excellent self-powered mechanoluminescence properties. The pressure and temperature-induced luminescence mechanism of the phosphor is also established. The shift of the 4T1-&gt;6A1 luminescence band of Mn2+ with both pressure and temperature and the luminescence mechanism is explained via the d5 Tanabe Sugano diagram. The broad luminescence band of 4T1-&gt;6A1 transition shifts from visible to near-infrared range at a rate of -35.8 meV/GPa with the increase of pressure and it is subsequently quenched completely at a pressure of 16.41 GPa due to a reversible phase transition from zinc blende to rocksalt phase. The high-pressure and temperature-dependent decay kinetics measurements of the sample luminescence are also reported.</description>

      <title>Understanding the anomalous thermoelectric behaviour of Fe-V-W-Al based thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated the thermoelectric and thermal behaviour of Fe-V-W-Al based thin films prepared using radio frequency magnetron sputtering technique at different base pressures (0.1 ~ 1.0 X 10-2 Pa) and on different substrates (n, p and undoped Si). Interestingly, at lower base pressure, formation of bcc type of Heusler structure was observed in deposited samples, whereas at higher base pressure, we have noted the development of non-Heusler amorphous structure in these samples. Our findings indicates that the moderately oxidized Fe-V-W-Al amorphous thin film deposited on n-Si substrate, possesses large magnitude of absoulte S ~ 1098 microvolt per kelvin near room temperature, which is almost the double the previously reported value for thin films. Additionally, the power factor indicated enormously large values ~ 33.9 milliwatt per meter per kelvin sqaure near 320 K. The thermal conductivity of the amorphous thin film is also found to be 2.75 watt per meter per kelvin, which is quite lower compared to bulk alloys. As a result, the maximum figure of merit is estimated to be extremely high i.e. ~ 3.9 near 320 K, which is among one of the highest reported values so far. The anomalously large value of Seebeck coefficient and power factor has been ascribed to formation of amorphous structure and composite effect of thin film and substrate.</description>

      <title>2D synthetic ferrimagnets by magnetic proximity coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proximity effects allow for the adjustment of magnetic properties in a physically elegant way. If two thin ferromagnetic (FM) films are brought into contact, electronic coupling alters their magnetic exchange interaction at their interface. For a low-TC rare-earth FM coupled to a 3d transition metal FM, even room temperature magnetism is within reach. In addition, magnetic proximity coupling is particularly promising for increasing the magnetic order of metastable materials such as europium monoxide (EuO) beyond their bulk TC, since neither the stoichiometry nor the insulating properties are modified.
  We investigate the magnetic proximity effect at Fe/EuO and Co/EuO interfaces using hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. By exciting the FM layers with circularly polarized light, magnetic dichroism is observed in angular dependence on the photoemission geometry. In this way, the depth-dependence of the magnetic signal is determined element-specifically for the EuO and 3d FM parts of the bilayers. In connection with atomistic spin dynamics simulations, the thickness of EuO layer is found to be crucial, indicating that the observed antiferromagnetic proximity coupling is a short-ranged and genuine interface phenomenon. This fact turns the bilayer into a strong synthetic ferrimagnet. The increase in magnetic order in EuO occurs in a finite spatial range and is therefore particularly strong in the 2D limit-a counterintuitive but very useful phenomenon for spin-based device applications.</description>

      <title>Enhanced interlayer electron transfer by surface treatments in mixed-dimensional van der Waals semiconductor heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the excitonic species in WS$_{2}$ monolayers transferred onto III-V semiconductor substrates with different surface treatments. When the III-V substrates were covered with amorphous native oxides, negatively charged excitons dominate the spectral weight in low-temperature near-resonance photoluminescence (PL) measurements. However, when the native oxides of the III-V substrates were reduced, neutral excitons begin to dominate the spectral weight, indicating a reduction in the electron density in the WS$_{2}$ monolayers. The removal of the native oxides enhanced the electron transfer from the WS$_{2}$ monolayer to the III-V substrate. In addition, an additional shoulder-like PL feature appeared $\sim$50 meV below the emission of neutral excitons, which can be attributed to the emission of localized excitons. When the III-V substrate surface was passivated by sulfur after the reduction of the native oxides, neutral excitons still dominated the spectral weight. However, the low energy PL shoulder disappeared again, suggesting the effective delocalization of excitons through the substrate surface passivation. Surface engineering of the semiconductor substrates for two-dimensional (2D) materials can provide a novel approach to control the carrier density of the 2D materials, to implement deterministic carrier localization or delocalization for the 2D materials, and to facilitate the interlayer transfer of charge, spin, and valley currents. These findings open the avenue for novel device concepts and phenomena in mixed-dimensional semiconductor heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Bloch equations in Terahertz magnetic-resonance ellipsometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A generalized approach derived from Blochs equation of motion of nuclear magnetic moments is presented to model the frequency, magnetic field, spin density, and temperature dependencies in the electromagnetic permeability tensor for materials with magnetic resonances. The resulting tensor model predicts characteristic polarization signatures which can be observed, for example, in fully polarization-resolved Mueller matrix element spectra measured across magnetic resonances as a function of frequency, magnetic field, magnetic moment density, and temperature. When augmented with thermodynamic considerations and suitable Hamiltonian description of the magnetic eigenvalue spectrum, important parameters such as zero-frequency magnetization, spectral amplitude distribution, relaxation time constants, and geometrical orientation parameters of the magnetic moment density can be obtained from comparing the generalized model approach to experimental data. We demonstrate our approach by comparing model calculations with full Mueller matrix element spectra measured at oblique angle of incidence in the terahertz spectral range, across electron spin resonance quintuplet transitions observed in wurtzite-structure GaN doped with iron. Measurements were performed by ellipsometry, using a superconducting cryostat magnet at magnetic fields of 7.23 T and at temperatures of 20 K and 30 K. We detail the occurrence of linear and circular birefringence and dichroism associated with each of the zero-field split spin transitions in the S = 5/2 defect system. We derive the spectral dependence of the magnetic susceptibility function and obtain the temperature and magnetic field dependence of the spin Hamiltonian. Our model correctly predicts the complexity of the polarization signatures observed in the 15 independent elements of the normalized Mueller matrix for both positive and negative magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Perspective on descriptors of mechanical behavior of cubic transition-metal carbides and nitrides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cubic rocksalt structured transition-metal carbides, nitrides, and related alloys (TMC/Ns) are attractive for a wide variety of applications, notably as hard, wear-resistant material. To-date, valence electron concentration (VEC) is used as a good indicator of stability and mechanical properties of these refractory compounds. In this perspective, we argue for the need for electronic descriptors beyond VEC to explain and predict the mechanical behavior of the cubic TMC/Ns. As such, we point out that descriptors that highlight differences between constituent have been underused, along with semi-empirical models of mechanical properties. Additionally, it appears promising to partition VEC into contribution to ionic, covalent, and metallic bonds and we suggest that such partition could provide more insight into predicting mechanical properties in the future.</description>

      <title>Circular Photocurrents in Centrosymmetric Semiconductors with Hidden Spin Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Centrosymmetric materials with site inversion asymmetries possess hidden spin polarization, which remains challenging to be converted into spin currents because the global inversion symmetry is still conserved. This study demonstrates the spin-polarized DC circular photocurrents (CPC) in centrosymmetric transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) at normal incidence without applying electric bias. The global inversion symmetry is broken by using a spatially-varying circularly polarized light beam, which could generate spin gradient owing to the hidden spin polarization. The dependences of CPC on electrode configuration, illumination position, and beam spot size indicate an emergence of circulating electric current under spatially inhomogeneous light, which is associated with the spin-to-charge conversion through the inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE). The CPC is subsequently utilized to probe the spin polarization and ISHE under different excitation wavelengths and temperatures. The results of this study demonstrate the feasibility of using centrosymmetric materials with hidden spin polarization and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) for spintronic device applications.</description>

      <title>Tribo-piezoelectric Nanogenerators for Energy Harvesting: a first-principles study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are highly promising candidates for various applications due to their unique electrical, optical, mechanical, and chemical properties. Furthermore, heterostructures consisting of TMDs with metals, oxides, and conductive materials have attracted significant research interest due to their exceptional electronic properties. In this study, we utilized density functional theory to investigate those electronic and transport properties, which are relevant for the application of tribo-piezoelectricity in creating novel nanogenerators: an interdisciplinary approach with promising implications. The results of the study demonstrate that the enhancement of charge transfer between layers and the orbital contribution to the Fermi level under applied strain in MoS/IrO, MoS/TiO, MoS/WTe, and MoTe/WS heterostructures is noteworthy. Additionally, non-equilibrium Green's function calculations of electron transport properties provide valuable insights into the behavior of these materials under different conditions. While MoS/IrO and MoS/TiO hetero-bilayers are unsuitable due to their tendency to exhibit large current flow with increasing voltage, others like MoS/WTe and MoTe/WS hetero bilayers show promise due to their ability to prevent voltage drop. The presented innovative concept of utilizing compressive strain of TMD bilayers to generate a tribo-piezoelectric effect for nanogenerators has a potential to contribute to the development of efficient and sustainable energy harvesting devices.</description>

      <title>Wrinkling instability of 3D auxetic bilayers in tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bilayers (soft substrates coated with stiff films) are commonly found in nature with examples including skin tissue, vesicles, or organ membranes. They exhibit various types of instabilities when subjected to compression, depending on the contrast in material properties between the two components. We present wrinkling instabilities for 3D hyperelastic bilayer systems, including auxetics (materials with negative Poisson's ratio), under uni-axial tension. In tension, a soft bilayer can experience large lateral contraction, and we find that with an adequate contrast in the Poisson ratios, compressive stresses may develop and generate wrinkles aligned with the tensile direction. We rely on an analytic modelling of the phenomenon, and validate it with a user-defined Python script with periodic boundary conditions and constitutive relation implementation in advanced Finite Element simulations. Our findings reveal that wrinkles are observed when the Poisson ratio of the substrate is greater than that of the film. As the two Poisson ratios converge to a common value, the critical stretch of instability shoots up rapidly, and the wrinkling disappears. We also confirm these results by asymptotic analysis. This wrinkling analysis has significant potential in controlling surface patterns of auxetic skin grafts and hydrogel organ patches under mechanical loads. Moreover, the asymptotic expressions in this work can be used under finite strain for buckling-based metrology applications.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Co-navigation: Dynamic Designing of the Materials Digital Twins via Active Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific advancement is universally based on the dynamic interplay between theoretical insights, modelling, and experimental discoveries. However, this feedback loop is often slow, including delayed community interactions and the gradual integration of experimental data into theoretical frameworks. This challenge is particularly exacerbated in domains dealing with high-dimensional object spaces, such as molecules and complex microstructures. Hence, the integration of theory within automated and autonomous experimental setups, or theory in the loop automated experiment, is emerging as a crucial objective for accelerating scientific research. The critical aspect is not only to use theory but also on-the-fly theory updates during the experiment. Here, we introduce a method for integrating theory into the loop through Bayesian co-navigation of theoretical model space and experimentation. Our approach leverages the concurrent development of surrogate models for both simulation and experimental domains at the rates determined by latencies and costs of experiments and computation, alongside the adjustment of control parameters within theoretical models to minimize epistemic uncertainty over the experimental object spaces. This methodology facilitates the creation of digital twins of material structures, encompassing both the surrogate model of behavior that includes the correlative part and the theoretical model itself. While demonstrated here within the context of functional responses in ferroelectric materials, our approach holds promise for broader applications, the exploration of optical properties in nanoclusters, microstructure-dependent properties in complex materials, and properties of molecular systems.

      <title>Anisotropic electron-phonon interactions in 2D lead-halide perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional hybrid organic-inorganic metal halide perovskites offer enhanced stability for perovskite-based applications. Their crystal structure's soft and ionic nature gives rise to strong interactions between charge carriers and ionic rearrangements. Here, we investigate the interaction of photo-generated electrons and ionic polarizations in single-crystal 2D perovskite butylammonium lead iodide, varying the inorganic lammelae thickness in the 2D single crystals. We determined the directionality of the transition dipole moments of the relevant phonon modes (in the 0.3-3 THz range) by angle-and-polarization dependent THz transmission measurements. We find a clear anisotropy of the in-plane photoconductivity, with a 10% reduction along the axis parallel with the transition dipole moment of the most strongly coupled phonon. Detailed calculations, based on Feynman polaron theory, indicate that the anisotropy originates from directional electron-phonon interactions.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Limits of Charge Carrier Mobilities in Layered Halide Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Layered halide perovskites have emerged as potential alternatives to three-dimensional halide perovskites due to their improved stability and larger material phase space, allowing fine-tuning of structural, electronic, and optical properties. However, their charge carrier mobilities are significantly smaller than that of three-dimensional halide perovskites, which has a considerable impact on their application in optoelectronic devices. Here, we employ state-of-the-art ab initio approaches to unveil the electron-phonon mechanisms responsible for the diminished transport properties of layered halide perovskites. Starting from a prototypical ABX$_{3}$ halide perovskite, we model the case of $n=1$ and $n=2$ layered structures and compare their electronic and transport properties to the three-dimensional reference. The electronic and phononic properties are investigated within density functional theory (DFT) and density functional perturbation theory (DFPT), while transport properties are obtained via the ab initio Boltzmann transport equation. The vibrational modes contributing to charge carrier scattering are investigated and associated with polar-phonon scattering mechanisms arising from the long-range Fr\"ohlich coupling and deformation potential scattering processes. Our investigation reveals that the lower mobilities in layered systems primarily originates from the increased electronic density of states at the vicinity of the band edges, while the electron-phonon coupling strength remains similar. Such increase is caused by the dimensionality reduction and the break in octahedra connectivity along the stacking direction. Our findings provide a fundamental understanding of the electron-phonon coupling mechanisms in layered perovskites and highlight the intrinsic limitations of the charge carrier transport in these materials.</description>

Abstract: La$_{0.58}$Ca$_{0.4}$Co$_{0.2}$Fe$_{0.8}$O$_{3-\delta}$ (L58CCF) was synthesized and evaluated as a cathode electrode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFC) based on the Y$_2$O$_3$-stabilized ZrO$_2$ (YSZ) electrolyte. The effect of sintering temperature on the L58CCF performance was investigated. The best Area specific resistances (ASRs) for the L58CCF sintered at 950 $^{\circ}$C were 1.218, 0.447, 0.228, 0.156, 0.099 $\Omega.cm^{2}$ at 600, 650, 700, 750, 800 $^{\circ}$C, respectively.</description>

      <title>Influence of strain and point defects on the electronic structure and related properties of (111)NiO epitaxial films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (111)NiO epitaxial films are grown on c-sapphire substrates at various growth temperatures ranging from room-temperature to 600C using pulsed laser deposition (PLD) technique. Two series of samples, where different laser fluences are used to ablate the target, are studied here. Films grown with higher laser fluence, are found to be embedded with Ni-clusters crystallographically aligned with the (111)NiO matrix. While the layers grown with lower laser energy density exhibit p-type conductivity specially at low growth temperatures. X-ray diffraction study shows the coexistence of biaxial compressive and tensile hydrostatic strains in these samples, which results in an expansion of the lattice primarily along the growth direction. This effective uniaxial expansion {epsilon}_perpendicular increases with the reduction of the growth temperature. Band gap of these samples is found to decrease linearly with {epsilon}_perpendicular. This result is validated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Experimental findings and the theoretical study further indicate that V_Ni + O_I and V_O + Ni_I complexes exist as the dominant native defects in samples grown with Ni-deficient (low laser fluence) and Ni-rich (high laser fluence) conditions, respectively. P-type conductivity observed in the samples grown in Ni-deficient condition is more likely to be resulting from V_Ni + O_I defects than Ni-vacancies (V_Ni).</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-guided accelerated discovery of structure-property correlations in lean magnesium alloys for biomedical applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnesium alloys are emerging as promising alternatives to traditional orthopedic implant materials thanks to their biodegradability, biocompatibility, and impressive mechanical characteristics. However, their rapid in-vivo degradation presents challenges, notably in upholding mechanical integrity over time. This study investigates the impact of high-temperature thermal processing on the mechanical and degradation attributes of a lean Mg-Zn-Ca-Mn alloy, ZX10. Utilizing rapid, cost-efficient characterization methods like X-ray diffraction and optical, we swiftly examine microstructural changes post-thermal treatment. Employing Pearson correlation coefficient analysis, we unveil the relationship between microstructural properties and critical targets (properties): hardness and corrosion resistance. Additionally, leveraging the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), we pinpoint the dominant microstructural factors among closely correlated variables. Our findings underscore the significant role of grain size refinement in strengthening and the predominance of the ternary Ca2Mg6Zn3 phase in corrosion behavior. This suggests that achieving an optimal blend of strength and corrosion resistance is attainable through fine grains and reduced concentration of ternary phases. This thorough investigation furnishes valuable insights into the intricate interplay of processing, structure, and properties in magnesium alloys, thereby advancing the development of superior biodegradable implant materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide effective tight-binding models of monolayer and bilayer hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) informed by ab initio density functional theory calculations within the local density approximation using maximally localized Wannier functions centered at the boron and nitrogen sites. An effective intra-layer tight-binding model with up to four distant hopping neighbors captures the band energies near the K-point and M-point in the Brillouin zone, including the indirect nature of the band gap for certain stackings. We then propose a two-center interlayer tight-binding model that can be used for any stacking in bilayer h-BN based on the relative distance between two atomic sites which can be used to model twisted h-BN structures.</description>

      <title>Elucidating Structure Formation in Highly Oriented Triple Cation Perovskite Films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metal halide perovskites are an emerging class of crystalline semiconductors of great interest for application in optoelectronics. Their properties are dictated not only by their composition, but also by their crystalline structure and microstructure. While significant efforts were dedicated to the development of strategies for microstructural control, significantly less is known about the processes that govern the formation of their crystalline structure in thin films, in particular in the context of crystalline orientation. In this work, we investigate the formation of highly oriented triple cation perovskite films fabricated by utilizing a range of alcohols as an antisolvent. Examining the film formation by in-situ grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering reveals the presence of a short-lived highly oriented crystalline intermediate, which we identify as FAI-PbI2-xDMSO. The intermediate phase templates the crystallisation of the perovskite layer, resulting in highly oriented perovskite layers. The formation of this DMSO containing intermediate is triggered by the selective removal of DMF when alcohols are used as an antisolvent, consequently leading to differing degrees of orientation depending on the antisolvent properties. Finally, we demonstrate that photovoltaic devices fabricated from the highly oriented films, are superior to those with a random polycrystalline structure in terms of both performance and stability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the functionality of the $\mathrm{Cr}$-doped $\mathrm{RuO_{2}}$ as an electrode of the magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ), motivated by the recent experiment showing that $\mathrm{Cr}$-doping into the rutile-type $\mathrm{RuO_{2}}$ will be an effective tool to control its antiferromagnetic order and the resultant magnetotransport phenomena easily. We perform first-principles calculation of the tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) effect in the MTJ based on the $\mathrm{Cr}$-doped $\mathrm{RuO_{2}}$ electrodes. We find that a finite TMR effect appears in the MTJ originating from the momentum-dependent spin splitting in the electrodes, which suggests that $\mathrm{RuO_{2}}$ with Cr-doping will work as the electrode of the MTJ. We also show that this TMR effect can be qualitatively captured using the local density of states inside the tunnel barrier.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the electrochemical sodium-ion kiinetics and distribution of relaxation time (DRT) analysis of a newly designed mixed polyanionic NaFe$_{1.6}$V$_{0.4}$(PO$_{4}$)(SO$_{4}$)$_{2}$@CNT composite as a cathode. The specific capacity of 104 mAhg$^{-1}$ is observed at 0.1~C with the average working voltage of $\sim$3~V. Intriguingly, a remarkable rate capability and reversibility are demonstrated up to very high current rate of 25~C. The long cycling test up to 10~C shows high capacity retention even after 2000 cycles. The detailed analysis of galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) data reveal the diffusion coefficient of 10$^{-8}$--10$^{-11}$ cm$^{2}$s$^{-1}$. We find excellent stability in the thermal testing between 25--55$^\circ$C temperatures and 80\% capacity retention up to 100 cycles at 5~C. Further, we analyse the individual electrochemical processes in the time domain using the novel DRT technique at different temperatures. The {\it ex-situ} investigation shows the stable and reversible structure, morphology and electronic states of the long cycled cathode material. More importantly, we demonstrate relatively high specific energy of $\approx$155 Wh kg$^{-1}$ (considering the total active material loading of both the electrodes) at 0.2~C for full cell battery having excellent rate capability up to 10~C and long cyclic stability at 1~C.</description>

      <title>Hall mass and transverse Noether spin currents in noncollinear antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Noncollinear antiferromagnets (AFMs) in the family of Mn$_3X$ ($X$=Ir, Sn, Ge, Pt, etc.) have recently attracted attention in the emerging field of antiferromagnetic spintronics because of their various interesting transport, magnetic, and optical properties. Due to the noncollinear magnetic order, the localized electron spins on different magnetic sublattices are not conserved even when spin-orbit coupling is neglected, making it difficult to understand the transport of spin angular momentum. Here we study the conserved Noether current associated with spin-rotation symmetry of the local spins in noncollinear AFMs. We found that a Hall component of the d.c. spin current can be created by a longitudinal driving force associated with a propagating spin wave, and is proportional to a response coefficient that we denote as the Hall (inverse) mass. Such a Hall spin current can be generated by spin pumping in a ferromagnet (FM)-noncollinear AFM bilayer structure as we demonstrated numerically. Finally we showed that the Hall mass is an isotropic quantity, similar to the isotropic spin Hall conductivity, and should generally exist in noncollinear AFMs and their polycrystals. Our results shed light on the potential of noncollinear AFMs in manipulating the polarization and flow of spin currents in general spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Fast current-induced skyrmion motion in synthetic antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions are topological magnetic textures that hold great promise as nanoscale bits of information in memory and logic devices. Although room-temperature ferromagnetic skyrmions and their current-induced manipulation have been demonstrated, their velocity has been limited to about 100 meters per second. In addition, their dynamics are perturbed by the skyrmion Hall effect, a motion transverse to the current direction caused by the skyrmion topological charge. Here, we show that skyrmions in compensated synthetic antiferromagnets can be moved by current along the current direction at velocities of up to 900 meters per second. This can be explained by the cancellation of the net topological charge leading to a vanishing skyrmion Hall effect. Our results open an important path toward the realization of logic and memory devices based on the fast manipulation of skyrmions in tracks.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a new machine learning-based approach to investigate anisotropic yield surfaces of sheet metals by means of virtual experiments. The new sampling approach is based on the machine learning technique known as active learning, which has been adapted to efficiently sample virtual experiments with respect to the full stress state in order to identify parameters of anisotropic yield functions. The approach was employed to sample virtual experiments based on the crystal plasticity finite element method (CPFEM) for a DX56D deep drawing steel and compared with two state-of-the-art sampling methods taken from the literature. The resulting points on the initial yield surface for all three sampling methods were used to identify parameters of the anisotropic yield functions Hill48, Yld91, Yld2004-18p and Yld2004-27p. The results show that the new machine learning-based sampling approach has a higher sampling efficiency than the two state-of-the-art sampling methods. Consequently, fewer computationally expensive crystal plasticity simulations are required. By comparing different variants of the Hill48, Yld91, Yld2004-18p and Yld2004-27p yield surfaces, it was also found that identifying parameters of anisotropic yield functions based on virtual experiments sampled within the full stress state can lead to a degraded representation of the in-plane anisotropy. With respect to DX56D deep drawing steel, this degradation was observed for the Yld2004-18p yield function. As a consequence, the representation of the in-plane anisotropy must be carefully reviewed when taking the full stress state into account. In this context, Yld2004-27p was identified as being sufficiently flexible to simultaneously represent the plastic anisotropy of DX56D with respect to the in-plane and out-of-plane behaviour with high accuracy.</description>

      <title>Platinum-absorbed Defective 2D Monolayer Boron Nitride: A Promising Electrocatalyst for O2 Reduction Reaction</title>

Abstract: The large bandgap and strong covalent bonds of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) had long been thought to be chemically inert. Due to its inertness with saturated robust covalent bonds, the pristine 2D monolayer hBN cannot be functionalized for applications of energy conversion. Therefore, it is necessary to make the 2D hBN chemically reactive for potential applications. Here, we have computationally designed a single nitrogen (N) and boron (B) di-vacancy of the 2D monolayer hBN, noted by VBN defective-BN (d-BN), to activate the chemical reactivity, which is an effective strategy to use the d-BN for potential applications. Single Pt atom absorbed on the defective area of the VBN d-BN acts as a single-atom catalyst which exhibits distinctive performances for O2 reduction reaction (ORR). First-principles based dispersion-corrected periodic hybrid Density Functional Theory (DFT-D) method has been employed to investigate the equilibrium structure and properties of the Pt-absorbed 2D defective boron nitride (Pt-d-BN). The present study shows the semiconducting character of Pt-d-BN with an electronic bandgap of 1.30 eV, which is an essential aspect of the ORR. The ORR mechanism on the surface of 2D monolayer Pt-d-BN follows a 4e-reduction route because of the low barriers to OOH formation and dissociation, H2O2 instability and water production at the Pt-d-BN surface. Here, both the dissociative and associative ORR mechanisms have been investigated, and it is found that results for both mechanisms with the ORR pathways are almost equally favorable. Therefore, it can be mentioned here that the 2D monolayer Pt-d-BN exhibits a high selectivity for the four-electron reduction pathway. According to the calculations of the relative adsorption energy of each step in ORR, the Pt-d-BN is anticipated to exhibit substantial catalytic activity.</description>

Abstract: In-plane anomalous Hall effect (IPAHE) is an unconventional anomalous Hall effect (AHE) with the Hall current flows in the plane spanned by the magnetization or magnetic field and the electric field. Here,we predict a stable two-dimensional ferromagnetic monolayer $\mathrm{Mn}_{3}\mathrm{Si}_{2}\mathrm{Te}_{6}$ with collinear ordering of Mn moments in the basal plane. Moreover, we reveal that the monolayer $\mathrm{Mn}_{3}\mathrm{Si}_{2}\mathrm{Te}_{6}$ possesses a substantial periodic IPAHE due to the threefold rotational symmetry, which can be switched by changing the magnetization orientation by external magnetic fields. In addition, we briefly discuss the impacts of moderate strains on the electronic states and AHE, which lead to a near quantized Hall conductivity. Our work provides a potential platform for realizing a sizable and controllable IPAHE that greatly facilatates the application of energy-efficient spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Probing the shape of the Weyl Fermi surface of NbP using transverse electron focusing</title>

Abstract: The topology of the Fermi surface significantly influences the transport properties of a material. Firstly measured through quantum oscillation experiments, the Fermi surfaces of crystals are now commonly characterized using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), given the larger information volume it provides. In the case of Weyl semimetals, ARPES has proven remarkably successful in verifying the existence of the Weyl points and the Fermi arcs, which define a Weyl Fermi surface. However, ARPES is limited in resolution, leading to significant uncertainty when measuring relevant features such as the distance between the Weyl points. While quantum oscillation measurements offer higher resolution, they do not reveal insights into the cross-sectional shape of a Fermi surface. Moreover, both techniques lack critical information about transport, like the carriers mean free path. Here, we report measurements unveiling the distinctive peanut-shaped cross-section of the Fermi surface of Weyl fermions and accurately determine the separation between Weyl points in the Weyl semimetal NbP. To surpass the resolution of ARPES, we combine quantum oscillation measurements with transverse electron focusing (TEF) experiments, conducted on microstructured single-crystals. The TEF spectrum relates to the Fermi surface shape, while the frequency of the quantum oscillations to its area. Together, these techniques offer complementary information, enabling the reconstruction of the distinctive Weyl Fermi surface geometry. Concurrently, we extract the electrical transport properties of the bulk Weyl fermions. Our work showcases the integration of quantum oscillations and transverse electron focusing in a singular experiment, allowing for the measurements of complex Fermi surface geometries in high-mobility quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Note: Applying the Brillouin Zone and Band Gap Leveraging AB Initio Calculation for Digital Well-Being: In-Depth Analysis of Band Structures in Information Spaces Insights from Solid-State Physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The efforts of this Note are aimed at understanding various phenomena in digital space that are incomplete and difficult to define, and to translate them into language from research fields that are based on existing large-scale experimental data. Information diffusion and user behavior patterns in digital space are often hard to intuitively capture, and the principles and mechanisms behind them are difficult to articulate. To address this challenge, we have drawn on first-principles methods in physics, particularly solid state physics. This approach is known to be effective in analyzing the behavior of real physical materials at the atomic level and in understanding the electronic properties and bonding structures of materials. We have attempted to apply physical concepts based on first-principles calculations, in particular concepts such as first Brillouin zones, band gaps, and reciprocal lattice vectors, to digital space as a metaphor. This theoretical framework allows us to quantitatively and logically infer the behavior and trends of incomplete and ambiguous digital data and phenomena. For example, the "first Brillouin zone" of information in digital media indicates the potential sphere of influence of that information, and the band gap defines the threshold of influence for the information to be widely accepted. In addition, the reciprocal lattice vector serves as a boundary that indicates the limits of information characteristics and is an indicator of the degree to which a particular piece of information resonates with users. With this theoretical supplement, our research goes beyond the mere analysis of phenomena in the digital space and provides new methods for understanding and predicting the behavior of imperfect data and uncertain digital media.</description>

      <title>Ultrahigh Stability of O-Sublattice in $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently reported remarkably high radiation tolerance of $\gamma$/$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ double-polymorphic structure brings this ultrawide bandgap semiconductor to the frontiers of power electronics applications that are able to operate in challenging environments. Understanding the mechanism of radiation tolerance is crucial for further material modification and tailoring of the desired properties. In this study, we employ machine-learning-enhanced atomistic simulations to assess the stability of both the gallium (Ga) and oxygen (O) sublattices under various levels of damage. Our study uncovers the remarkable resilience and stability of the O-sublattice, attributing this property to the strong tendency of recovery of the O defects, especially within the stronger disordered regions. Interestingly, we observe the opposite behavior of the Ga defects that display enhanced stability in the same regions of increased disorder. Moreover, we observe that highly defective $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ is able to transform into $\gamma$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ upon annealing due to preserved lattice organization of the O-sublattice. This result clearly manifests that the ultrahigh stability of the O-sublattice provides the backbone for the exceptional radiation tolerance of the $\gamma$/$\beta$ double-polymorphic structure. These computational insights closely align with experimental observations, opening avenues for further exploration of polymorphism in Ga$_2$O$_3$ and potentially in analogous polymorphic families spanning a broad range of diverse materials of complex polymorphic nature.</description>

      <title>Study of Entropy-Driven Polymorphic Stability for Aspirin Using Accurate Neural Network Interatomic Potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we present a systematic computational investigation to analyze the long debated crystal stability of two well known aspirin polymorphs, labeled as Form I and Form II. Specifically, we developed a strategy to collect training configurations covering diverse interatomic interactions between representative functional groups in the aspirin crystals. Utilizing a state-of-the-art neural network interatomic potential (NNIP) model, we developed an accurate machine learning potential to simulate aspirin crystal dynamics under finite temperature conditions with $\sim$0.46 kJ/mol/molecule accuracy. Employing the trained NNIP model, we performed thermodynamic integration to assess the free energy difference between aspirin Forms I and II, accounting for the anharmonic effects in a large supercell consisting of 512 molecules. For the first time, our results convincingly demonstrated that Form I is more stable than Form II at 300 K, ranging from 0.74 to 1.83 kJ/mol/molecule, aligning with the experimental observations. Unlike the majority of previous simulations based on (quasi)harmonic approximations in a small super cell, which often found the degenerate energies between aspirin I and II, our findings underscore the importance of anharmonic effects in determining polymorphic stability ranking. Furthermore, we proposed the use of rotational degrees of freedom of methyl and ester/phenyl groups in the aspirin crystal, as characteristic motions to highlight rotational entropic contribution that favors the stability of Form I. Beyond the aspirin polymorphism, we anticipate that such entropy-driven stabilization can be broadly applicable to many other organic systems and thus our approach, suggesting our approach holds a great promise for stability studies in small molecule drug design.</description>

      <title>d-wave Eliashberg theory with phonon softening describes superconductivity in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_x$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.05763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a mathematical description, based on d-wave Eliashberg theory, of the strong correlation between the experimentally observed softening of Raman modes associated with in-plane oxygen motions and the corresponding superconducting critical temperature $T_c$, as a function of oxygen doping $x$, in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_x$. The theoretical model provides a direct link between physical trends of soft optical $A_g$ (in-plane) oxygen modes, the level of oxygen doping $x$, and the superconducting $T_c$. Different regimes observed in the trend of $T_c$ vs doping can be related to corresponding regimes of optical phonon softening in the Raman spectra. These results provide further evidence related to the physical origin of high-temperature superconductivity in rare-earth cuprate oxides and to the significant role of electron-phonon coupling therein.</description>

Abstract: Topological quantum materials can exhibit unconventional surface states and anomalous transport properties. Still, their applications in spintronic devices are restricted as they require the growth of high-quality thin films with bulk-like properties. Here, we study 10--30 nm thick epitaxial ferromagnetic Co$_{\rm 2}$MnGa films with high structural order and very high values of the anomalous Hall conductivity, $\sigma_{\rm xy}=1.35\times10^{5}$ $\Omega^{-1} m^{-1}$ and the anomalous Hall angle, $\theta_{\rm H}=15.8\%$, both comparable to bulk values. We observe a dramatic crystalline orientation dependence of the Gilbert damping constant of a factor of two and a giant intrinsic spin Hall conductivity, $\mathit{\sigma_{\rm SHC}}=(6.08\pm 0.02)\times 10^{5}$ ($\hbar/2e$) $\Omega^{-1} m^{-1}$, an order of magnitude higher than literature values of multilayer Co$_{\rm 2}$MnGa stacks [1-3] and single-layer Ni, Co, Fe [4], and Ni$_{\rm 80}$Fe$_{\rm 20}$~[4,5]. As a consequence, spin-orbit-torque driven auto-oscillations of a 30 nm thick magnetic film are observed for the first time, at an ultralow threshold current density of $J_{th}=6.2\times10^{11}$ $Am^{-2}$. Theoretical calculations of the intrinsic spin Hall conductivity, originating from a strong Berry curvature, corroborate the results and yield values comparable to the experiment. Our results open up for the design of spintronic devices based on single layers of magnetic topological quantum materials.</description>

Abstract: Long-period moir\'e superlattices at the twisted interface of van der Waals heterostructures relax into preferential-stacking domains separated by dislocation networks. Here, we develop a mesoscale theory for dislocations in the networks formed in twistronic bilayers with parallel (P) and antiparallel (AP) alignment of unit cells across the twisted interface. For P bilayers we find an exact analytical displacement field across partial dislocations and determine analytic dependences of energy per unit length and width on orientation and microscopic model parameters. For AP bilayers we formulate a semi-analytical approximation for displacement fields across perfect dislocations, establishing parametric dependences for their widths and energies per unit length. In addition, we find regions in parametric space of crystal thicknesses and moir\'e periods for strong and weak relaxation of moir\'e pattern in multilayered twistronic heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Ionic conductivity of a lithium-doped deep eutectic solvent: Glass formation and rotation-translation coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep eutectic solvents with admixed lithium salts are considered as electrolytes in electrochemical devices like batteries or supercapacitors. Compared to eutectic mixtures of hydrogen-bond donors and lithium salts, their raw-material costs are significantly lower. Not much is known about the glassy freezing and rotation-translation coupling of such systems. Here we investigate these phenomena by applying dielectric spectroscopy to the widely studied deep eutectic solvent glyceline, to which 1 and 5 mol% LiCl were added. Our studies cover a wide temperature range, including the deeply supercooled state. The temperature dependences of the detected dipolar reorientation dynamics and of the ionic dc conductivity reveal the signatures of glassy freezing. In comparison to pure glyceline, lithium admixture leads to a reduction of ionic conductivity, which is accompanied by a slowing down of the rotational dipolar motions. However, this reduction is much smaller than for DESs, where one main component is a lithium salt, which we trace back to the smaller glass-transition temperatures of the lithium-doped DESs. In contrast to pure glyceline, the ionic and dipolar dynamics become increasingly decoupled at low temperatures and obey a fractional Debye-Stokes-Einstein relation as previously found in other glass-forming liquids. The obtained results demonstrate the relevance of decoupling effects and of the glass transition for the enhancement of the technically relevant ionic conductivity in such lithium-doped DESs.</description>

Abstract: We study the symmetry requirements for topologically protected spin-polarized Weyl points in 2D altermagnets. The topology is characterized by a quantized $\pi$-Berry phase and the degeneracy is protected by spin-space group symmetries. Gapped phases with finite Chern and/or spin/chirality Chern numbers emerge under different symmetry-breaking mass terms. We investigate the surface and transport properties of these gapped phases using representative electronic tight-binding and magnonic linear spin-wave models. In particular, we calculate the electronic and magnonic Hall currents and discuss implications for experiments.</description>

Abstract: The fully nonlinear (geometric and material) system of Field Dislocation Mechanics is reviewed to establish an exact analogy with the equations of ideal magnetohydrodynamics (ideal MHD) under suitable physically simplifying circumstances. Weak solutions with various conservation properties have been established for ideal MHD recently by Faraco, Lindberg, and Szekelyhidi using the techniques of compensated compactness of Tartar and Murat and convex integration; by the established analogy, these results would seem to be transferable to the idealization of Field Dislocation Mechanics considered. A dual variational principle is designed and discussed for this system of PDE, with the technique transferable to the study of MHD as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling ion correlations in inhomogeneous polymers and soft matters with spatially varying ionic strength or dielectric permittivity remains a great challenge. Here, we develop a new theory which systematically incorporates electrostatic fluctuations into the self-consistent field theory for polymers. Applied to polyelectrolyte brushes, the theory predicts that ion correlations induce non-monotonic change of the brush height: collapse followed by reexpansion. The scaling analysis elucidates the competition between the repulsive osmotic pressure due to translational entropy and the attraction induced by ion correlations. We also clarify the absence of causal relationship between the brush collapse-reexpansion and the inversion of the surface electrostatic potential. Furthermore, strong ion correlations can trigger microphase separation, either in the lateral direction as pinned micelles or in the normal direction as oscillatory layers. Our theoretical predictions are in good agreement with the experimental results reported in the literature.</description>
