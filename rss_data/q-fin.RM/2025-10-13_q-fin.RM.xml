      <title>Empirical estimator of diversification quotient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20385</link>

Abstract: The Diversification Quotient (DQ), introduced by Han et al. (2025), is a recently proposed measure of portfolio diversification that quantifies the reduction in a portfolio's risk-level parameter attributable to diversification. Grounded in a rigorous theoretical framework, DQ effectively captures heavy tails, common shocks, and enhances efficiency in portfolio optimization. This paper further explores the convergence properties and asymptotic normality of empirical DQ estimators based on Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES), with explicit calculation of the asymptotic variance. In contrast to the diversification ratio (DR) proposed by Tasche (2007), which may exhibit diverging asymptotic variance due to its lack of location invariance, the DQ estimators demonstrate greater robustness under various distributional settings. We further verify their asymptotic properties under elliptical distributions through simulation, and construct confidence intervals for DQ estimates using AR-GARCH models with a residual-based bootstrap on real financial data. These results establish a solid statistical foundation for applying DQ in financial risk management and decision-making.</description>

      <title>A General CoVaR Based on Entropy Pooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21904v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a general CoVaR framework that extends the traditional CoVaR by incorporating diverse expert views and information, such as asset moment characteristics, quantile insights, and perspectives on the relative loss distribution between two assets. To integrate these expert views effectively while minimizing deviations from the prior distribution, we employ the entropy pooling method to derive the posterior distribution, which in turn enables us to compute the general CoVaR. Assuming bivariate normal distributions, we derive its analytical expressions under various perspectives. Sensitivity analysis reveals that CoVaR exhibits a linear relationship with both the expectations of the variables in the views and the differences in expectations between them. In contrast, CoVaR shows nonlinear dependencies with respect to the variance, quantiles, and correlation within these views.
  Empirical analysis of the US banking system during the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes demonstrates the effectiveness of the general CoVaR when expert views are appropriately specified. Furthermore, we extend this framework to a general $\Delta$CoVaR, which allows for the assessment of risk spillover effects from various perspectives.</description>
