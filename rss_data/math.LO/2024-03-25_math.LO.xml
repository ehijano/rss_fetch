      <title>On a relation between $\lambda$-full well-ordered sets and weakly compact cardinals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove, via transfinite recursion, the existence, inside any linearly ordered set of appropriate regular cardinality $\lambda$, of a particular kind of well-ordered subsets characterized by the property of $\lambda$-fullness. Let $H$ be a set of regular cardinals: by using our results about well-ordered $\lambda$-full sets we show that if $\inf H$ is a weakly compact cardinal, then, for every LOTS $X$, $H$-compactness is equivalent to the nonexistence of gaps of types in $H$.</description>

      <title>Cyclic Group Spectra for Some Small Relation Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The question of characterizing the (finite) representable relation algebras in a ``nice" way is open. The class $\mathbf{RRA}$ is known to be not finitely axiomatizable in first-order logic. Nevertheless, it is conjectured that ``almost all'' finite relation algebras are representable.
  All finite relation algebras with three or fewer atoms are representable. So one may ask, Over what cardinalities of sets are they representable? This question was answered completely by Andr\'eka and Maddux (``Representations for small relation algebras,'' \emph{Notre Dame J. Form. Log.}, \textbf{35} (1994)); they determine the spectrum of every finite relation algebra with three or fewer atoms.
  In the present paper, we restrict attention to cyclic group representations, and completely determine the cyclic group spectrum for all seven symmetric integral relation algebras on three atoms. We find that in some instances, the spectrum and cyclic spectrum agree; in other instances, the spectra disagree for finitely many $n$; finally, for other instances, the spectra disagree for infinitely many $n$. The proofs employ constructions, SAT solvers, and the probabilistic method.</description>

      <title>Many-one reducibility with realizability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we propose a new classification of $\Sigma^0_2$ formulas under the realizability interpretation of many-one reducibility (i.e., Levin reducibility). For example, ${\sf Fin}$, the decision of being eventually zero for sequences, is many-one/Levin complete among $\Sigma^0_2$ formulas of the form $\exists n\forall m\geq n.\varphi(m,x)$, where $\varphi$ is decidable. The decision of boundedness for sequences ${\sf BddSeq}$ and posets ${\sf PO}_{\sf top}$ are many-one/Levin complete among $\Sigma^0_2$ formulas of the form $\exists n\forall m\geq n\forall k.\varphi(m,k,x)$, where $\varphi$ is decidable. However, unlike the classical many-one reducibility, none of the above is $\Sigma^0_2$-complete. The decision of non-density of linear order ${\sf NonDense}$ is truly $\Sigma^0_2$-complete.</description>

      <title>Back-and-forth equivalent group von Neumann algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that if $G$ and $H$ are $\alpha$-back-and-forth equivalent groups (in the sense of computable structure theory) for some ordinal $\alpha \geq \omega$, then their group von Neumann algebras $L(G)$ and $L(H)$ are also $\alpha$-back-and-forth equivalent. In particular, if $G$ and $H$ are $\omega$-back-and-forth-equivalent groups, then $L(G)$ and $L(H)$ are elementarily equivalent; this is known to fail under the weaker hypothesis that $G$ and $H$ are merely elementarily equivalent. We extend this result to crossed product von Neumann algebras associated to Bernoulli actions of back-and-forth equivalent groups.</description>

      <title>Foulis-Holland theorem for implicative-orthomodular lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of distributivity for implicative-orthomodular lattices, proving an analogue result of the Foulis-Holland theorem. Based on this result, we characterize the distributive implicative-orthomodular lattices. Moreover, we define the center of an implicative-orthomodular lattice as the set of all elements that commute with all other elements, and we prove that the center is an implicative-Boolean algebra. Additionally, we give new characterizations of implicative-orthomodular lattices.</description>

      <title>Dense metrizable subspaces in powers of Corson compacta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize when the countable power of a Corson compactum has a dense metrizable subspace and construct consistent examples of Corson compacta whose countable power does not have a dense metrizable subspace. We also give several remarks about ccc Corson compacta and, as a byproduct, we obtain a new proof of Kunen and van Mill's characterization of when a Corson compactum supporting a strictly positive measure is metrizable.</description>

      <title>Recursive Analogues of Shrewdness and Subtlety, with Applications to Fine Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We share both recent and older, well-known results regarding the notions of stable ordinals and shrewd cardinals. We then argue that $\Sigma_2$-nonprojectible ordinals may be considered as recursive analogues to subtle cardinals, a highly combinatorial type of cardinal related to Jensen's fine structure, due to the latter possessing a characterisation in terms of shrewdnesss.</description>

      <title>Forcing with Language Fragments, Extending Namba Forcing, and Models of Theories with Constraints in Interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01213v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a forcing framework based on the idea of amalgamating language fragments into a theory with a canonical Henkin model. We then demonstrate the usefulness of this framework by applying it to both the extended Namba problem and the analysis of models of certain theories with constraints in interpretation (TCIs). The foundations for a theory of TCIs and their models are laid in parallel to the development of our framework, and are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>On some Fraisse limits with free amalgamation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07616v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the first section of this work we discuss some curiosities around stable Kim-forking. In the second section we give a general way of building some known and some new examples of NSOP1 theories as the limit of some Fraisse class satisfying some strong conditions. These limits will satisfy existence, that Kim independence and algebraic independence coincide over arbitrary sets, that forcing base monotonicity on Kim-independance gives forking independence, and they come with a stationary independence relation. This study is based on the results of Baudish, Ramsey, Chernikov and Kruckman.</description>

      <title>Modal logic, fundamentally</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-classical generalizations of classical modal logic have been developed in the contexts of constructive mathematics and natural language semantics. In this paper, we discuss a general approach to the semantics of non-classical modal logics via algebraic representation theorems. We begin with complete lattices $L$ equipped with an antitone operation $\neg$ sending $1$ to $0$, a completely multiplicative operation $\Box$, and a completely additive operation $\Diamond$. Such lattice expansions can be represented by means of a set $X$ together with binary relations $\vartriangleleft$, $R$, and $Q$, satisfying some first-order conditions, used to represent $(L,\neg)$, $\Box$, and $\Diamond$, respectively. Indeed, any lattice $L$ equipped with such a $\neg$, a multiplicative $\Box$, and an additive $\Diamond$ embeds into the lattice of propositions of a frame $(X,\vartriangleleft,R,Q)$. Building on our recent study of "fundamental logic", we focus on the case where $\neg$ is dually self-adjoint ($a\leq \neg b$ implies $b\leq\neg a$) and $\Diamond \neg a\leq\neg\Box a$. In this case, the representations can be constrained so that $R=Q$, i.e., we need only add a single relation to $(X,\vartriangleleft)$ to represent both $\Box$ and $\Diamond$. Using these results, we prove that a system of fundamental modal logic is sound and complete with respect to an elementary class of bi-relational structures $(X,\vartriangleleft, R)$.</description>

      <title>Beatty Sequences for a Quadratic Irrational: Decidability and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\alpha$ and $\beta$ belong to the same quadratic field. We show that the inhomogeneous Beatty sequence $(\lfloor n \alpha + \beta \rfloor)_{n \geq 1}$ is synchronized, in the sense that there is a finite automaton that takes as input the Ostrowski representations of $n$ and $y$ in parallel, and accepts if and only if $y = \lfloor n \alpha + \beta \rfloor$. Since it is already known that the addition relation is computable for Ostrowski representations based on a quadratic number, a consequence is a new and rather simple proof that the first-order logical theory of these sequences with addition is decidable. The decision procedure is easily implemented in the free software Walnut.
  As an application, we show that for each $r \geq 1$ it is decidable whether the set $\{ \lfloor n \alpha + \beta \rfloor \, : \, n \geq 1 \}$ forms an additive basis (or asymptotic additive basis) of order $r$. Using our techniques, we also solve some open problems of Reble and Kimberling, and give an explicit characterization of a sequence of Hildebrand et al.</description>

      <title>Free Doubly-Infinitary Distributive Categories are Cartesian Closed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10447v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We delve into the concept of categories with products that distribute over coproducts, which we call doubly-infinitary distributive categories. We show various instances of doubly-infinitary distributive categories aiming for a comparative analysis with established notions such as extensivity, infinitary distributiveness, and cartesian closedness. Our exploration reveals that this condition represents a substantial extension beyond the classical understanding of infinitary distributive categories. Our main theorem establishes that free doubly-infinitary distributive categories are cartesian closed. We end the paper with remarks on non-canonical isomorphisms, open questions, and future work.</description>
