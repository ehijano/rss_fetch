      <title>Strain Modulated Catalytic Activity of Pt2XSe3 (X = Hg, Zn) for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The catalytic properties of Pt2XSe3 (X = Hg, Zn) in hydrogen-electrode- (HER-) based catalysts have been investigated based on state-of-the-art ab initio simulations. Our results show that the late transition metal sites (Hg and Zn) exhibit the best activity for HER in an acidic environment. Furthermore, lattice stretching and compression can effectively modulate the H binding energy, achieving almost thermoneutral adsorption at 3% compressive strain. The changes are attributed to the modulation in the d-band centers of late transition metal sites, as well as the depletion of charge population on bonding states, contributing to the destabilization of the H-metal bonds. Our contribution explores strain engineering as an effective strategy to tailor the activity of 2D mineral-based catalyst materials for HER, advancing our understanding of how mechanical manipulation can effectively modulate the catalytic properties of these materials.</description>

      <title>Strong coupling of chiral magnons in altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets recently are identified as a new class of magnets that break the time-reversal symmetry without exhibiting net magnetization. The role of the dipole-dipole interaction (DDI) on their dynamical properties however is yet to be addressed. In this work, we show that the DDI can induce the strong coupling between exchange magnons with opposite chiralities in altermagnets, manifesting as a significant level repulsion in the magnon spectrum. Crucially, the predicted magnon-magnon coupling is highly anisotropic, and observable in practical experiments. These exotic features are absent in conventional antiferromagnets. Our findings open a new pathway for quantum magnonic information processing based on altermagnetism.</description>

      <title>High-Entropy Solid Electrolytes Discovery: A Dual-Stage Machine Learning Framework Bridging Atomic Configurations and Ionic Transport Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid development of computational materials science powered by machine learning (ML) is gradually leading to solutions to several previously intractable scientific problems. One of the most prominent is machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), which expedites the study of dynamical methods for large-scale systems. However, a promising field, high-entropy (HE) solid-state electrolytes (SEs) remain constrained by trial-and-error paradigms, lacking systematic computational strategies to address their huge and high-dimensional composition space. In this work, we establish a dual-stage ML framework that combines fine-tuned MLIPs with interpretable feature-property mapping to accelerate the high-entropy SEs discovery. Using Li$_3$Zr$_2$Si$_2$PO$_{12}$ (LZSP) as a prototype, the fine-tuned CHGNet-based relaxation provides atomic structure for each configuration, the structure features - mean squared displacement (SF-MSD) model predicts the ionic transport properties and identifies critical descriptors. The theoretical studies indicate that the framework can satisfy the multiple requirements including computational efficiency, generalization reliability and prediction accuracy. One of the most promising element combinations in the quinary HE-LZSP space containing 4575 compositions is identified with a high ionic conductivity of 4.53 mS/cm as an application example. The framework contains generalizability and extensibility to other SE families.</description>

      <title>AI-predicted PT-symmetric magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parity-time-reversal-symmetric odd-parity antiferromagnetic (AFM1) materials are of interest for their symmetry-enabled quantum transport and optical effects. These materials host odd-parity terms in their band dispersion, leading to asymmetric energy bands and enabling responses such as the magnetopiezoelectric effect, nonreciprocal conductivity, and photocurrent generation. In addition, they may support a nonlinear spin Hall effect without spin-orbit coupling, offering an efficient route to spin current generation. We identify 23 candidate AFM1 materials by combining artificial intelligence, density functional theory (DFT), and symmetry analysis. Using a graph neural network model and incorporating AFM1-specific symmetry constraints, we screen Materials Project compounds for high-probability AFM1 candidates. DFT calculations show that AFM1 has the lowest energy among the tested magnetic configurations in 23 candidate materials. These include 3 experimentally verified AFM1 materials, 10 synthesized compounds with unknown magnetic structures, and 10 that are not yet synthesized.</description>

      <title>Self-patterning of Liquid Field's Metal for Enhanced Performance of Two-dimensional Semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals semiconductors show promise for atomically thin flexible and transparent optoelectronic devices in future technologies.However, developing high-performance field-effect transistors (FETs) based on 2D materials is impeded by two key challenges, the high contact resistance at the 2D semiconductors-metal interface and the limited effective doping strategies. Here, we present a novel approach to overcome these challenges using self-propagating liquid Fields metal, a eutectic alloy with a low melting point of approximately 62 C. By modifying pre-patterned electrodes on WSe2 FETs through the deposition of Fields metal onto contact pad edges followed by vacuum annealing, we create new semimetal electrodes that seamlessly incorporate the liquid metal into 2D semiconductors. This integration preserves the original electrode architecture while transforming to semimetal compositions of Fields metal such as Bi, In, and Sn modifies the work functions to 2D semiconductors, resulting in reduced contact resistance without inducing Fermi-level pinning and charge carrier mobilities. Our method enhances the electrical performance of 2D devices and opens new avenues for designing high-resolution liquid metal circuits suitable for stretchable, flexible, and wearable 2D semiconductor applications.</description>

      <title>Temperature- and charge carrier density-dependent electronic response in methylammonium lead iodide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding carrier dynamics in photoexcited metal-halide perovskites is key for optoelectronic devices such as solar cells (low carrier densities) and lasers (high carrier densities). Trapping processes at low carrier densities and many-body recombination at high densities can significantly alter the dynamics of photoexcited carriers. Combining optical-pump/THz probe and transient absorption spectroscopy we examine carrier responses over a wide density range (10^14-10^19 cm-3) and temperatures (78-315K) in the prototypical methylammonium lead iodide perovskite. At densities below ~10^15 cm-3 (room temperature, sunlight conditions), fast carrier trapping at shallow trap states occurs within a few picoseconds. As excited carrier densities increase, trapping saturates, and the carrier response stabilizes, lasting up to hundreds of picoseconds at densities around ~10^17 cm-3. Above 10^18 cm-3 a Mott transition sets in: overlapping polaron wavefunctions lead to ultrafast annihilation through an Auger recombination process occurring over a few picoseconds. We map out trap-dominated, direct recombination-dominated, and Mott-dominated density regimes from 78-315 K, ultimately enabling the construction of an electronic phase diagram. These findings clarify carrier behavior across operational conditions, aiding material optimization for optoelectronics operating in the low (e.g. photovoltaics) and high (e.g. laser) carrier density regimes.</description>

      <title>Ab Initio Prediction of Large Thermoelectric Effect in Distorted Heusler Alloy Ti-Fe-Sb Compound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermoelectric figure of merit of the Heusler alloy TiFe$_{1.5}$Sb was investigated by first-principles calculations of lattice thermal conductivity. The electronic thermal conductivity, electrical conductivity, and Seebeck coefficient are calculated by semi-classical Boltzmann transport theory. TiFe$_{1.5}$Sb was found to be thermally and dynamically stable, as confirmed by its phonon dispersion. Additionally, the small phonon band gap between acoustic and optical modes enhances phonon scattering, leading to a low lattice thermal conductivity of 0.703 W/mK at 300 K. Our study also reveals that TiFe$_{1.5}$Sb is a non-magnetic semiconductor. Notably, it demonstrates a significant longitudinal thermoelectric effect, with a Seebeck coefficient of 359.4 $\mu$V/K at 300 K. The combination of low lattice thermal conductivity and a high Seebeck coefficient results in a high thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) of 0.88 and 0.91 at 300 K and 500 K, respectively. These findings highlight the considerable potential of TiFe$_{1.5}$Sb as a promising material for thermoelectric device applications.</description>

      <title>First principles investigation of zb-TiSn: A promising narrow bandgap semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated the structural stability of a binary compound TiSn in the zincblende symmetry. The phonon dispersion studies confirms that, TiSn with a nominal composition of 1:1 can exist in zincblende form. No imaginary frequencies are observed indicating the stable bonding nature of Ti-Sn. From the First principles calculations based on density functional theory, the resulting electronic band structure had revealed that zb-TiSn, is a narrow band gap semiconductor with an energy gap of 0.3 eV with GGA- PBE. The bonding nature is identified as polar covalent, determined from charge density difference plots and Bader charge analysis. Further more, the linear optical properties of zb-TiSn are derived from the Khon-Sham eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>G-type Antiferromagnetic BiFeO$_3$ is a Multiferroic $g$-wave Altermagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: G-type antiferromagnetic BiFeO$_3$ is shown to be an altermagnet. We present the band structure using an unconventional scheme designed to highlight the distinctive spin splitting which is characteristic of altermagnets. We define and show plots of the spin-splitting function in reciprocal space. We show that the nodal surfaces of the spin-splitting function that follow from symmetry can be classified into two types, which we call symmetry-enforced and continuity-enforced. We describe the spin-splitting function with a simple parametrization in a basis of symmetry-adapted plane waves. Using group-theory analysis based on irreducible representations of the crystallographic Laue group, we confirm that the altermagnetism of G-type BiFeO$_3$ is $g$-wave and present a complete classification table for the general three-dimensional case. Finally, we discuss the effect of ferroelectric switching on the altermagnetic order, and identify three classes of ferroelectric altermagnets.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric performance of Ni-Au metallic alloys determined by resonant scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a theoretical study of the electronic structure and transport properties of Ni-Au alloys, recently identified as excellent thermoelectric metals with a power factor significantly exceeding that of conventional semiconductor thermoelectrics. Using first-principles calculations based on the Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker method combined with the coherent-potential approximation (KKR-CPA) and the Kubo-Greenwood formalism, we demonstrate the key role of resonant scattering in determining the thermoelectric properties of these alloys. This is supported by calculated densities of states, Bloch spectral functions, electrical conductivity, and thermopower. Alloying Ni with Au not only induces resonant scattering but also leads to the formation of a flat band below the Fermi level. The combination of these two features results in high thermopower, arising from a transition between resonant and weak scattering regimes near the Fermi level. Our findings are further compared with analogous calculations for constantan, a Ni-Cu alloy long regarded as a reference thermoelectric metal. We show that differences between the Ni-Au and Ni-Cu systems explain why Ni-Au exhibits nearly twice the thermopower of Ni-Cu. Finally, we simulate the effect of lattice parameter variation on the thermoelectric performance of Ni-Au and suggest that this is a promising pathway for further enhancement, for example through additional alloying or layer deposition.</description>

      <title>teMatDb: A High-Quality Thermoelectric Material Database with Self-Consistent ZT Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a curated thermoelectric material database, teMatDb, constructed by digitizing literature-reported data. It includes temperature-dependent thermoelectric properties (TEPs), Seebeck coefficient, electrical resistivity, thermal conductivity, and figure of merit (ZT), along with metadata on materials and their corresponding publications. A self-consistent ZT (Sc-ZT) filter set was developed to measure ZT errors by comparing reported ZT's from figures with ZT's recalculated from digitized TEPs. Using this Sc-ZT protocol, we generated tMatDb272, comprising 14,717 temperature-property pairs from 272 high-quality TEP sets across 262 publications. The method identifies various types of ZT errors, such as resolution error, publication bias, ZT overestimation, interpolation and extrapolation error, and digitization noise, and excludes inconsistent samples from the dataset. teMatDb272 and the Sc-ZT filtering framework offer a robust dataset for data-driven and machine-learning-based materials design, device modeling, and future thermoelectric research.</description>

      <title>C-BerryANC: A first-principle C++ code to calculate Berry Curvature dependent anomalous Nernst conductivity in any material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The anomalous Nernst conductivity (ANC) is a key transport property in magnetic and topological materials, arising from the Berry curvature ($\boldsymbol\Omega$) of electronic bands. It offers deep insight into the underlying topology and thermoelectric behavior. While Wannier interpolation have become popular for calculating ANC due to their computational efficiency, their accuracy critically depends on the quality of the Wannierization, which can be challenging for entangled bands or materials with complex band crossings. These limitations highlight the need for a direct first-principles approach to reliably compute ANC from ab-initio electronic structures. Here, we present a C++ based code named C-BerryANC that calculates $\boldsymbol\Omega$-dependent ANC by directly using the eigenvalues and momentum-matrices obtained from DFT calculations. Presently, the code is interfaced with WIEN2k package which uses all-electron approach and full-potential linearized augmented plane wave (FP-LAPW) based method. For efficiently handling dense k-mesh, calculation of $\boldsymbol\Omega$ is made parallel over k-points using the OpenMP method. Additionally, the code stores band-resolved components of $\boldsymbol\Omega$ in binary files thereby reducing the memory occupancy and providing fast post-process option to compute ANC for any range of chemical potential and temperature values. Also, as compilation of C++ modules produce executable files which are in machine level language, computational speed of C-BerryANC is very fast. The code is benchmarked over some well-known materials exhibiting ANC. These includes- Pd, Fe$_3$Al &amp; Co$_2$FeAl. The obtained values of ANC is found to in good agreement with the previously reported data. This highlights the accuracy, efficieny and reliability of the C-BerryANC code.</description>

      <title>Review of point defect structures in hexagonal close packed metals and across the Periodic Table</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive ab initio dataset of formation energies and elastic properties of intrinsic point defects across all the transition and rare earth hexagonal close packed (hcp) metals, as well as metalloid elements with hcp crystal structure. Point defect properties appear weakly correlated with the c/a ratio of the hcp lattice. Instead, it is the position of an element in the Periodic Table that primarily defines the relaxation volume tensor, elastic dipole tensor and formation energy of a point defect. This suggests that the local variations in the electronic structure and interatomic bonding at the core of a defect dominate its properties, as opposed to long-range elastic deformations. Across all the metals, we find that the relaxation volumes of vacancies and self-interstitial defects are correlated with atomic volumes, with values of -0.35 and 1.46 atomic volumes for a vacancy and a self-interstitial defect, respectively, providing a universally good approximation independent of the crystal structure. This study complements and completes the existing point defect databases spanning body-centred cubic and face-centred cubic metals.</description>

      <title>Structural, magnetic, and nanoacoustic characterization of Co/Pt superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superlattices presenting a spatial modulation of the elastic properties appear as a main tool to reach the THz regime in nanoacoustic devices. The exploration of alternative materials with multifunctional properties remains a fertile domain of research. In this work, we study the structural, magnetic, and acoustic characteristics of nanometric superlattices made of Pt/Co.
  The samples present a well defined periodicity, as determined by X-ray reflectometry, whereas scanning transmission electron microscopy with local compositional analysis reveals that the superlattices present a modulation in composition instead of sharp interfaces. The policrystalline nature of the superlattices is evidenced both by X ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. Magnetization measurements show a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy for the higher Co concentrations. Picosecond acoustic experiments evidence that the studied samples support short-lived acoustic modes up to 900 GHz, and up to 7 acoustic echoes at lower frequencies.These are promising results for the development of magnetoacoustic devices working at ultrahigh frequencies.</description>

      <title>Disorder-Induced Suppression of Antiferromagnetic Magnon Transport in Cr2O3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the impact of spin disorder associated with structural defects on antiferromagnetic magnon transport by probing the spin-flop transition of Cr2O3 using spin Seebeck effect measurements. By fabricating homoepitaxial Cr2O3 films grown on smooth Cr2O3 crystals, we systematically vary the thickness of the films in which the presence of point defects modulates the spin-flop transition field. We find that magnon propagation through the film is entirely suppressed for film thickness greater than 3 nm, revealing the pivotal role of disorder in governing antiferromagnetic magnon transport.</description>

      <title>In-depth Investigation of Conduction Mechanism on Defect-induced Proton-conducting Electrolytes BaHfO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study utilizes first-principles computational methods to comprehensively analyze the impact of A-site doping on the proton conduction properties of BaHfO$_3$. The goal is to offer theoretical support for the advancement of electrolyte materials for solid oxide fuel cells. Our research has uncovered that BaHfO$_3$ demonstrates promising potential for proton conduction, with a low proton migration barrier of 0.28 eV, suggesting efficient proton conduction can be achieved at lower temperatures. Through A-site doping, particularly with low-valence state ions and the introduction of Ba vacancies, we can effectively decrease the formation energy of oxygen vacancies (Evac), leading to an increase in proton concentration. Additionally, our study reveals that the primary mechanism for proton migration in BaHfO$_3$ is the Grotthuss mechanism rather than the Vehicle mechanism. Examination of the changes in lattice parameters during proton migration indicates that while doping or vacancy control strategies do not alter the mode of H+ migration, they do influence the migration pathway and barrier. These findings provide valuable insights into optimizing the proton conduction properties of BaHfO$_3$ through A-site doping and lay a solid theoretical foundation for the development of novel, highly efficient Solid oxide fuel cell electrolyte materials.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-broken charge-ordered ground state in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ Kagome metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The newly discovered family of non-magnetic Kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=K,Rb,Cs) offers a unique platform for studying the interplay between a charge density wave transition with superconductivity, non-trivial topology, and spontaneous time-reversal symmetry.Despite characterizing the charge density wave phase is crucial to understand and model all these exotic properties, it remains unresolved. In this work, we use first-principles calculations of the free-energy, incorporating both ionic kinetic energy and anharmonic effects, to resolve the atomistic phase diagram of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ and its charge ordering structure. Our results reveal a competition between metastable stacking orders of the reconstructed vanadium Kagome layers, which are energetically favored to form exclusively a triangular-hexagonal arrangement, allowing the possibility of competitive different domains and chiral order. Consistent with experimental observations, we find that the $2\times2\times2$ and $2\times2\times4$ modulations are nearly degenerate in free energy, and are abruptly melted into the high-symmetry hexagonal phase around 90 K. The transition is first-order but compatible with a measurable phonon-softening. Remarkably, even if the six-fold and inversion symmetry are intrinsically broken by the out-of-plane stacking, this does not lead to measurable anisotropy in the in-plane conductivity as suggested by measurements.</description>

      <title>Composition dependent $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ band parameters for wurtzite (Al,Ga)N alloys from density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: UV emitters based on the semiconductor alloy aluminium gallium nitride, (Al,Ga)N, have attracted significant interest in recent years due to their potential for optoelectronic devices. To guide the design of such devices with improved efficiencies, theoretical frameworks based on so-called k.p methods have found widespread application in the literature. Given that k.p models are empirical in nature, parameters such as effective masses or crystal field splitting energies of (Al,Ga)N alloys have to be provided as input from first-principles calculations or experiment. Although these parameters are available for GaN and AlN, detailed information on their composition dependence is sparse. Here, we address this question and provide (Al,Ga)N band parameters for widely used k.p Hamiltonians. We start from density functional theory (DFT) to sample the electronic structure of (Al,Ga)N alloys over the full composition range. The k.p parameters are treated as free parameters to reproduce the DFT data. For GaN and AlN the parameters extracted here agree well with literature values. When turning to the composition dependence of the k.p parameters, our calculations show that most parameters deviate significantly from a linear interpolation of the GaN and AlN values, an approximation widely made in the literature. Moreover, to describe changes in the band parameters with Al content, composition dependent bowing parameters have to be considered for an accurate description of the DFT data. Finally, our analysis also provides initial insight into consequences of the nonlinear composition dependence of the k.p parameters for the electronic structure of (Al,Ga)N alloys. We find that in particular the band ordering is affected by the nonlinear evolution of the crystal field splitting energy with composition, an important aspect for the light polarization characteristics of high Al content (Al,Ga)N alloys.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a response-augmented machine learning (ML) approach to the energetics of electrified metal surfaces. We leverage local descriptors to learn the work function as the first-order energy change to introduced bias charges and stabilize this learning through Born effective charges. This permits the efficient extension of ML interatomic potential architectures to include finite bias effects up to second-order. Application to OH at Cu(100) rationalizes the experimentally observed pH-dependence of the preferred adsorption site in terms of a non-Nernstian charge-induced site switching.</description>

      <title>Giant spontaneous polarization in zincblende III-V semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of ferroelectricity in wurtzite nitrides has paved the way for measuring and understanding spontaneous polarization in III-V semiconductors. However, the calculation of polarization effects at heterointerfaces - crucial for numerous electronic and photonic applications - remains a topic of debate. The need for a reference structure to calculate spontaneous polarization has led to discussions over whether to use the zincblende or layered hexagonal structures as the reference for wurtzite crystals. In this work, we argue that the layered hexagonal structure is not only a better reference due to its vanishing formal polarization but also the only physically correct choice for the wurtzite system. This follows from the fact that spontaneous polarization is rigorously defined through the ferroelectric switching. Applying this definition, we extend our analysis to III-V zincblende semiconductors and reveal that their spontaneous polarization is approximately three times larger than that of wurtzite, thereby refuting the longstanding assumption that it is zero. Through this example, we illustrate that spontaneous polarization is not inherently linked to charge density at interfaces.</description>

      <title>Design Rules for Optimizing Quaternary Mixed-Metal Chalcohalides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quaternary mixed-metal M(II)2M(III)Ch2X3 chalcohalides are an emerging material class for photovoltaic absorbers that combines the beneficial optoelectronic properties of lead-based halide perovskites with the stability of metal chalcogenides. Inspired by the recent discovery of lead-free mixed-metal chalcohalides materials, we utilized a combination of density functional theory and machine learning to determine compositional trends and chemical design rules in the lead-free and lead-based materials spaces. We explored a total of 54 M(II)2M(III)Ch2X3 materials with M(II) = Sn, Pb, M(III) = In, Sb, Bi, Ch = S, Se, Te, and X = Cl, Br, I per phase (Cmcm, Cmc21 , and P21/c). The P21/c phase is the equilibrium phase at low temperatures, followed by Cmc21 and Cmcm. The fundamental band gaps in Cmcm and Cmc21 are smaller than those in P21/c, but direct band gaps are more common in Cmcm and Cmc21. The effective electron masses in P21/c are significantly larger compared to Cmcm and Cmc21, while the effective hole masses are nearly the same across all three phases. Using random forest regression, we found that the two electron acceptor sites (Ch and X) are crucial in shaping the properties of mixed-metal chalcohalide compounds. Furthermore, the electron donor sites (M(II) and M(III)) can be used to finetune the material properties to desired applications. These design rules enable precise tailoring of mixed-metal chalcohalide compounds for a variety of applications.</description>

      <title>Laser-dressed partial density of states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The manipulation of material properties by laser light holds great promise for the development of future technologies. However, the full picture of the electronic response to laser driving remains to be uncovered. We present a novel approach to reveal details of the electron dynamics of laser-dressed materials, which consists of calculating and analysing the time-dependent partial density of states (PDOS) of materials during their interaction with a driving electromagnetic field. We show that the laser-dressed PDOS provides information about the structure of the bonds that form the laser-dressed electron density, analogous to the information that a PDOS can provide about the electron structure in a field-free case. We illustrate how our method can provide insights into the electron dynamics of materials in a site- and orbital-selective manner with calculations for a laser-dressed wurtzite ZnO crystal. Our work provides an analytical tool for the interpretation of subcycle-resolved experiments on laser-dressed materials and for the development of strategies for optical manipulation of material properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The local environment of Mn atoms in stoichiometric and off-stoichiometric (with Mn excess) Ni-Mn-Ga Heusler alloys was investigated using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and interpreted with the help of Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods. In cubic austenite, the significant amount of structural defects was observed in $^{55}$Mn NMR experiments and interpreted using DFT calculations as individual antisite defects or defects accompanying anti-phase boundaries. The spectrum of non-modulated martensite was similar to that of austenite, albeit with increasing disorder due to excess Mn. In 10M modulated martensite, the main lines were split. The splitting is ascribed to structural modulation and quantitative analysis shows that the amplitude of modulation evolves with temperature and its magnitude is in agreement with diffraction data.</description>

      <title>Analysis of real-space transport channels for electrons and holes in halide perovskites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting and explaining charge carrier transport in halide perovskites is a formidable challenge because of the unusual vibrational and electron-phonon coupling properties of these materials. This study explores charge carrier transport in two prototypical halide perovskite materials, MAPbBr$_3$ and MAPbI$_3$, using a dynamic disorder model. Focusing on the role of real-space transport channels, we analyze temporal orbital occupations to assess the impact of material-specific on-site energy levels and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) strengths. Our findings reveal that both on-site energies and SOC magnitude significantly influence the orbital occupation dynamics, thereby affecting charge dispersal and carrier mobility. In particular, energy gaps across on-site levels and the halide SOC strength govern the filling of transport channels over time. This leads us to identify the $pp\pi$ channel as a critical bottleneck for charge transport and to provide insights into the differences between electron and hole transport across the two materials.</description>

      <title>Crystallographic control of hydrogen ingress in bcc-Iron: Insights from ab initio simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen uptake into body-centered cubic (bcc) iron as a root cause for subsequent hydrogen embrittlement, is initiated at the surface. In this paper, we quantify how readily H diffuses from the surface into the bulk. We consider a set of low-index, vicinal and general Fe surfaces and treat H-permeation as a two-step process. First, density-functional calculations determine the adsorption energy of an isolated H atom at every crystallographically distinct surface site. Second, for each adsorption site we map the minimum-energy pathway that carries the atom beneath the surface and into the lattice. Across all ten orientations studied, a clear trend emerges: sites that bind hydrogen most weakly (highest adsorption energy) are the starting point of the lowest-barrier diffusion channels into the metal interior. Thus, the least-favorable adsorption pockets act as gateways for efficient subsurface penetration. These insights provide a practical design rule: suppressing or minimizing exposure of such high-energy adsorption motifs - through appropriate surface texturing or orientation control - should make bcc-iron components less susceptible to hydrogen uptake and the associated embrittlement.</description>

      <title>Impact of anharmonicity on the carrier mobility of the Pb-free CsSnBr$_3$ perovskite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charge carrier mobilities are critical parameters in halide perovskite solar cells, governing their average carrier velocity under an applied electric field and overall efficiency. Recent advances in first-principles calculations of electron-phonon interactions and carrier mobilities have enabled predictive computations for perovskite solar cells. However, the flexible octahedral frameworks and cationic displacements in these materials challenge the harmonic approximation, leading to significant difficulties in accurately calculating transport properties. To address these issues, we combine temperature-dependent effective potentials with the ab initio Boltzmann transport equations to compute carrier mobilities in a representative lead-free perovskite, CsSnBr$_3$. At room temperature, the electron/hole Hall mobilities in CsSnBr$_3$ are 106/256 cm$^2$/Vs when neglecting anharmonic effects and 59/145 cm$^2$/Vs when included. This overestimation of the harmonic approximation arises from the neglect of scattering coming from soft modes. We provide a workflow for performing first-principles carrier mobility calculations in anharmonic systems, advancing the predictive modeling of perovskite solar cells.</description>

      <title>Auger parameter analysis for TiN and AlN thin films via combined in-situ XPS and HAXPES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Auger parameter analysis provides in-depth information about the electronic and chemical bonding properties of TiN and AlN thin films, which are relevant across a wide range of technologies. Meaningful interpretation and analysis of the Auger parameter of these materials have been hindered due to, among other reasons, the absence of reliable references. Here we present a comprehensive study of Auger parameters for TiN and AlN thin films using a dual-source lab-based XPS/HAXPES system equipped with Al Ka and Cr Ka x-ray sources. Due to a large spread of excitation x-ray energy, bulk- and surface-sensitive core-level photoelectrons and Auger transitions are probed. This allows us to study a wide range of Auger and core-level emission lines of TiN and AlN. These measurements can serve as references for further identification of chemical state changes, oxidation state or any deviations in the local chemical environment in these materials. UHV sample transfer was employed to minimise surface contamination. Additionally, we demonstrate how common procedures such as ambient air exposure and Ar+ sputter-etching influence the Auger parameters, highlighting the importance of surface preparation in spectroscopic analysis.</description>

      <title>Structure and Elastic properties of Titanium MXenes: evaluation of COMB3, REAXFF and MEAM force fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Titanium carbide and nitride MXenes are two-dimensional inorganic materials that exhibit noteworthy physical and chemical properties. These materials are considered for a variety of technological applications, ranging from energy harvesting to optical and biomedical applications. Given the growing interest in titanium MXenes, there is an expanding demand for computational studies to predict physical properties and behaviors under diverse physical conditions. Complex and large-scale systems necessitate computational methodologies that surpass the constraints imposed by ab initio calculations. In this regard, it is imperative to ascertain the reliability of the computational tools employed to simulate and predict the physical properties of titanium MXenes. In this study, the ability of three known classical molecular dynamics (MD) potentials to provide the structural and elastic properties of titanium carbide and nitride MXenes is evaluated. The MD potentials that were the focus of this study include the Charge-Optimized Many-Body (COMB3), the Reactive Force Field (REAXFF) and the Modified Embedded Atom Method (MEAM). These three potentials possess two or more sets of parameters, herein referred to as force fields, capable of simulating Ti-C and Ti-N systems. The MD results for the lattice parameter and thickness of the MXenes are then compared to those from DFT calculations found in the literature. A total of ten force fields were considered; of these, two REAXFF and two MEAM ones were identified as the most adequate to simulate both the structure and elastic properties of titanium MXenes. Additionally, the values for the linear compressibility of MXenes are presented for the first time. Consequently, researchers can utilize the obtained results to design novel MD-based computational studies of titanium MXenes, leveraging the established relative validity of the available force fields.</description>

      <title>Degradation of methylparaben by anodic oxidation, electro-Fenton, and photoelectro-Fenton using carbon felt-BDD cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, the comparative efficiency of different electrochemical advanced oxidation processes, such as anodic oxidation with electrogenerated H2O2 (AO- H2O2), electro-Fenton (EF), and its combination with UV irradiation (photoelectron-Fenton (PEF)), was investigated for the removal of methylparaben (MP) using a carbon felt cathode and a boron-doped diamond anode. The EF process achieved a higher MP removal efficiency than the AO-H2O2 process for all applied current densities. The total organic carbon (TOC) removal after 6 h of treatment at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 reached 75.0% and 91.9% for the AO- H2O2 and EF processes, respectively. The combination of EF and UV light improved the efficiency of the EF process. The PEF process achieved a TOC removal of 84.6% in only 2 h at 5 mA cm-2 and 96.8% after 6 h of treatment. Furthermore, based on identifying oxidation reaction intermediates and short-chain carboxylic acids generated during the treatment, a reaction pathway for methylparaben mineralization by hydroxyl radicals was proposed.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Memory Effects in the Dynamics of Two-Level System Defect Ensembles Using Broadband, Cryogenic Transient Dielectric Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-level system defects (TLSs) in dielectrics are believed to be the primary source of decoherence in superconducting circuits. However, the precise origin of these defects, including their atomistic morphology, frequency distributions, and dipole moments, remains relatively unexplored. A significant reason for this lack of understanding is that TLS defects are currently probed with resonators or qubits that require complex multi-stage fabrication processes. These probes are packaged, cooled in a dilution refrigerator, and measured to infer their corresponding coherence times. However, even frequency-tunable probes only gather information about TLS defects within their mode volume and a narrow bandwidth around their resonance frequency. As a result, a detailed understanding of the atomistic origins of TLS defects in isolated materials and interfaces is currently lacking, making it challenging to design the next generation of superconducting devices and dielectric materials from first principles. Here, we introduce a novel approach that enables probing the cryogenic dielectric response of TLS defect ensembles using a broadband 3D waveguide. This technique provides evidence of memory effects in the dynamics of TLS defect ensembles that may enable the extraction of critical information about the origins of the underlying TLS defects and their interactions. Importantly, this novel spectroscopy technique can be used at all stages of fabrication and ultimately inform mitigation strategies to reduce the impact of TLS defects on superconducting circuits. As a result, this technique will help usher in a new understanding of the atomistic origin of TLS defects, which will have profound consequences for quantum information science and the broader materials science community.</description>

      <title>Mechanochemical feedback drives complex inertial dynamics in active solids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active solids combine internal active driving with elasticity to realize states with nonequilibrium mechanics and autonomous motion. They are often studied in overdamped settings, e.g., in soft materials, and the role of inertia is less explored. We construct a model of a chemically active solid that incorporates mechanochemical feedback and show that, when feedback overwhelms mechanical damping, autonomous inertial dynamics can spontaneously emerge through sustained consumption of chemical fuel. By combining numerical simulations, analysis and dynamical systems approaches, we show how active feedback drives complex nonlinear dynamics on multiple time-scales, including limit cycles and chaos. Our results suggest design principles for creating ultrafast actuators and autonomous machines from soft, chemically-powered solids.</description>

      <title>Thermal Conductivity above 2000 W/m.K in Boron Arsenide by Nanosecond Transducer-less Time-Domain Thermoreflectance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cubic boron arsenide (c-BAs) has been theoretically predicted to exhibit thermal conductivity \k{appa} comparable to that of diamond, yet experimental measurements have plateaued at ~1300W/mK. We report room-temperature \k{appa} exceeding 2000W/mK in c-BAs, on par with single-crystal diamond. This finding is enabled by high-quality single crystals and a newly developed nanosecond, transducer-less time-domain thermoreflectance technique that allows spatial mapping of \k{appa} without metal transducers. Thermal conductivity correlates with crystal quality, as evidenced by stronger photoluminescence and longer photoluminescence lifetimes. However, the observed nanosecond lifetimes remain shorter than expected for an indirect bandgap semiconductor, suggesting room for further crystal quality improvement and higher \k{appa}. These results challenge current theoretical models and highlight c-BAs as a promising material for next-generation electronics.</description>

      <title>Quantum spin Hall effects in van der Waals materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect, first predicted in graphene by Kane and Mele in 2004, has emerged as a prototypical platform for exploring spin-orbit coupling, topology, and electronic interactions. Initially realized experimentally in quantum wells exhibiting characteristic QSH signatures, the field has since expanded with the discovery of van der Waals (vdW) materials. This review focuses on vdW systems, which offer unique advantages: their exposed surfaces enable a combination of surface-sensitive spectroscopic and microscopic tools for comprehensive detection of the QSH state; mechanical stacking with other vdW layers facilitates symmetry engineering and proximity effects; and moir\'e engineering introduces layer skyrmion topological phases and strong correlation effects. We highlight two monolayer families, 1T$^\prime$-MX$_2$ and MM$^\prime$X$_4$, represented by WTe$_2$ and TaIrTe$_4$, respectively. These materials exhibit QSH phases intertwined with or in close proximity to other quantum phases, such as excitonic insulators, charge density waves, and superconductivity. Their low crystal symmetry and topology enable rich quantum geometrical responses, ranging from nonlinear Hall effects to circular photogalvanic effects. We also discuss moir\'e systems, which combine topology with flatband physics and enhanced correlations, driving spontaneous symmetry breaking and transitions from QSH to quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) states. Remarkably, fractionalized QAH and QSH states have recently been observed in moir\'e systems, significantly advancing the field of condensed matter physics. Finally, we explore emerging applications of QSH and derived materials, such as using nonlinear Hall effects for quantum rectification in microwave energy harvesting and harnessing fractional anomalous states for topological quantum computing.</description>

Abstract: The Institute for Solid State Physics (ISSP) at The University of Tokyo has been carrying out a software development project named ``the Project for Advancement of Software Usability in Materials Science (PASUMS)". Since the launch of PASUMS, various open-source software programs have been developed/advanced, including ab initio calculations, effective model solvers, and software for machine learning. We also focus on activities that make the software easier to use, such as developing comprehensive computing tools that enable efficient use of supercomputers and interoperability between different software programs. We hope to contribute broadly to developing the computational materials science community through these activities.</description>

      <title>Getting out of a tight spot: Cooperative unclogging of hydrogel particles in disordered porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use event-driven pore network modeling to study the transport of hydrogel particles through disordered porous media -- a process that underlies diverse applications. By simulating particle advection, deformation, and clogging at the pore scale, we identify a dimensionless "squeezing parameter" that quantitatively predicts the depth to which particles penetrate into a given medium across diverse conditions. Our simulations also uncover a surprising cooperative effect: adding more particles enables them to penetrate deeper into the medium. This phenomenon arises because individual particles redirect fluid to adjacent throats, forcing nearby particles through tight pores that they would otherwise clog. Altogether, these results help to establish a quantitative framework that connects microscopic particle mechanics to macroscopic transport behavior.</description>

      <title>Generalized many-body exciton g-factors: magnetic hybridization and non-monotonic Rydberg series in monolayer WSe\textsubscript{2}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magneto-optics of low dimensional semiconductors, such as monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides, offers a vast playground for exploring complex quantum phenomena. However, current \textit{ab initio} approaches fail to capture important experimental observations related to brightening of excitonic levels and their g-factor dependence. Here, we develop a robust and general first principles framework for many-body exciton g-factors by incorporating off-diagonal terms for the spin and orbital angular momenta of single-particle bands and many-body states for magnetic fields pointing in arbitrary spatial directions. We implement our framework using many-body perturbation theory via the GW-Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) and supplement our analysis with robust symmetry-based models, establishing a fruitful synergy between many-body GW-BSE and group theory. Focusing on the archetypal monolayer WSe\textsubscript{2}, we accurately reproduce the known results of the low-energy excitons including the Zeeman splitting and the dark/grey exciton brightening. Furthermore, our theory naturally reveals fundamental physical mechanisms of magnetic-field hybridization of higher-energy excitons (s- and p-like) and resolves the long-standing puzzle of the experimentally measured non-monotonic Rydberg series (1s--4s) of exciton g-factors. Our framework offers a comprehensive approach to investigate, rationalize, and predict the non-trivial interplay between magnetic fields, angular momenta, and many-body exciton physics in van der Waals systems.</description>

      <title>Ligand-SOC enhanced $4f^5$ Kitaev antiferromagnet: Application to $\mathrm{SmI}_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for Kitaev quantum spin liquids (Kitaev-QSLs) in real materials has mainly focused on $4d$- and $5d$-electron honeycomb systems. A recent experimental study on the $4f^5$ honeycomb iodide $\mathrm{SmI}_3$ reported the absence of long-range magnetic order down to $0.1\ \text{K}$, suggesting a possible Kitaev-QSL phase. Motivated by the interplay between the complex exchange processes inherent to the $4f^5$ multi-electron configuration and the strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) of the iodine ligands, we systematically investigate the effective exchange interactions in $\mathrm{SmI}_3$ using the strong coupling expansion method. Our findings reveal that bond-dependent SOCs (bond-SOCs), extracted from relativistic density functional theory (DFT) calculations, significantly enhance the antiferromagnetic (AFM) Kitaev interaction, driving the system close to the AFM Kitaev point. A microscopic analysis based on the Slater-Koster approach further indicates that the strong SOC of the iodine ligands (ligand-SOC) is the origin of bond-SOCs and plays a pivotal role in mediating the superexchange processes. Additionally, we identify a spin-flop transition induced by the bond-SOCs, where the enhanced AFM Kitaev interactions shift the AFM order from the out-of-plane $[1, 1, 1]$-direction to an in-plane orientation, breaking the $C_3$ rotational symmetry. Linear spin-wave theory (LSWT) further predicts the emergence of gapless modes following the spin-flop transition, indicating enhanced fluctuations and increased instability near the AFM Kitaev point. Our results highlight the crucial role of strong ligand-SOC in stabilizing the dominant AFM Kitaev interactions in $\mathrm{SmI}_3$ and provide valuable insights for discovering new $f$-electron Kitaev-QSL candidates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a novel approach to process the DIC measurements of multiple biaxial stretching protocols. In particular, we develop a optimization-based approach, which calculates the smoothed nodal displacements using a moving least-squares algorithm subject to positive strain constraints. As such, physically consistent displacement and strain fields are obtained. Then, we further deploy a data-driven workflow to heterogeneous material modeling from these physically consistent DIC measurements, by estimating a nonlocal constitutive law together with the material microstructure. To demonstrate the applicability of our approach, we apply it in learning a material model and fiber orientation field from DIC measurements of a porcine tricuspid valve anterior leaflet. Our results demonstrate that the proposed DIC data processing approach can significantly improve the accuracy of modeling biological materials.</description>

      <title>Degradation-Aware and Machine Learning-Driven Uncertainty Quantification in Crystal Plasticity Finite Element: Texture-Driven Plasticity in 316L Stainless Steel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mechanical properties and long-term structural reliability of crystalline materials are strongly influenced by microstructural features such as grain size, morphology, and crystallographic texture. These characteristics not only determine the initial mechanical behavior but also govern the progression of degradation mechanisms, such as strain localization, fatigue damage, and microcrack initiation under service conditions. Variability in these microstructural attributes, introduced during manufacturing or evolving through in-service degradation, leads to uncertainty in material performance. Therefore, understanding and quantifying microstructure-sensitive plastic deformation is critical for assessing degradation risk in high-value mechanical systems. This study presents a first-of-its-kind machine learning-driven framework that couples high-fidelity crystal plasticity finite element (CPFE) simulations with data-driven surrogate modeling to accelerate degradation-aware uncertainty quantification in welded structural alloys. Specifically, the impact of crystallographic texture variability in 316L stainless steel weldments, characterized via high-throughput electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), is examined through CPFE simulations on calibrated representative volume elements (RVEs). A polynomial chaos expansion-based surrogate model is then trained to efficiently emulate the CPFE response using only 200 simulations, reducing computational cost by several orders of magnitude compared to conventional Monte Carlo analysis. The surrogate enables rapid quantification of uncertainty in stress-strain behavior and identifies texture components such as Cube and Goss as key drivers of degradation-relevant plastic response.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Anisotropy and Absence of Long-Range Order in the Triangular Magnet NdMgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rare-earth triangular-lattice magnet NdMgAl11O19 offers an ideal platform for examining the interplay of crystal electric field effects, geometric frustration, and weak exchange interactions. Using high-quality single crystals, we measured magnetic susceptibility and magnetization down to 1.8 K, while specific heat was measured down to 45 mK. The system exhibits uniaxial anisotropy along the c-axis, with a ground-state Kramers doublet. A Curie-Weiss temperature of -0.38 K indicates weak antiferromagnetic interactions, while a specific heat anomaly at 81 mK suggests weak magnetic correlations with no long-range magnetic order. The absence of long-range magnetic order down to 45 mK makes it a very interesting material, which is highly frustrated but weakly correlated. Under external fields, the Zeeman splitting of the ground-state doublet leads to a field-tunable Schottky anomaly, with the specific heat peak shifting to 0.65 meV at 3 T, with g ~ 3.7. A Brillouin function fit to magnetization yields g ~ 3.72, confirming the quasi-paramagnetic nature of NdMgAl11O19. These findings highlight NdMgAl11O19 as a promising candidate to investigate quantum spin liquid and exotic spin states in frustrated triangular magnets.</description>

Abstract: We derive the coupled-cluster doubles (CCD) amplitude equations by introduction of the particle-hole-time decoupled electronic self-energy. This leads to an alternative ground state correlation energy obtained from the Green's function formalism which is exactly of the form obtained in coupled-cluster doubles theory. We demonstrate the relationship to the ionization potential/electron affinity equation-of-motion coupled-cluster doubles (IP/EA-EOM-CCD) eigenvalue problem by coupling the reverse-time self-energy contributions while maintaining particle-hole separability. The formal relationships established are demonstrated by exact solution of the Hubbard dimer.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature spin-lifetime anisotropy exceeding 60 in bilayer graphene spin valves proximity coupled to WSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A spin lifetime anisotropy between in-plane and out-of-plane spins in bilayer graphene (BLG) can be achieved by spin-orbit proximity coupling of graphene to transition metal dichalcogenides. This coupling reduces the in-plane spin lifetime due to proximity-induced spin scattering, while the out-of-plane spin lifetime remains largely unaffected. We show that at room temperature spin lifetime anisotropy exceeds 60 in a bilayer graphene lateral spin valve proximity coupled to WSe$_2$. The out-of-plane spin lifetime of about 250 ps closely matches that of a BLG reference region not in contact with WSe$_2$. In contrast, the estimated in-plane spin lifetime of less than 4 ps leads to a complete suppression of the in-plane spin signal at the ferromagnetic Co/MgO spin detector. The proximity coupling of WSe$_2$ to BLG is particularly promising, as it does not compromise the charge carrier mobility within the graphene channel.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic properties of La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$MnO$_{3}$ (LSMO) are highly sensitive to various factors such as the Sr doping level $x$, lattice strain, and oxygen stoichiometry due to the strongly correlated nature of $3d$ electrons. For the development of energy-efficient spintronic devices with ultra-low magnetic damping of LSMO, a thorough understanding of its complex magnetization dynamics is of great importance. In this work, we have measured ferromagnetic resonance of LSMO thin films on Nb-doped SrTiO$_3$ (Nb-STO) substrates over a wide temperature and frequency range and observed an anomalous increase in the Gilbert damping constant and a decrease in the effective saturation magnetization at temperatures below 100 K. The anomalies become more pronounced as the LSMO thickness decreases while they are not observed for LSMO on (LaAlO$_3$)$_{0.3}$(Sr$_2$TaAlO$_6$)$_{0.7}$ substrates with relatively small epitaxial strain. The results suggest that the epitaxial strain-induced magnetically dead layer at the LSMO/Nb-STO interface acts as a spin sink and leads to the anomalies in the magnetization dynamics.</description>

      <title>Revealing molecule-internal mechanisms that control phonon heat transport through single-molecule junctions by a genetic algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurements of the thermal conductance of single-molecule junctions have recently been reported for the first time. It is presently unclear, how much the heat transport can be controlled through molecule-internal effects. The search for molecules with lowest and highest thermal conductance is complicated by the gigantic chemical space. Here we describe a systematic search for molecules with a low or a high phononic thermal conductance using a genetic algorithm. Beyond individual structures of well performing molecules, delivered by the genetic algorithm, we analyze patterns and identify the different physical and chemical mechanisms to suppress or enhance phonon heat flow. In detail, mechanisms revealed to reduce phonon transport are related to the choice of terminal linker blocks, substituents and corresponding mass disorder or destructive interference, meta couplings and molecule-internal twist. For a high thermal conductance, the molecules should instead be rather uniform and chain-like. The identified mechanisms are systematically analyzed at different levels of theory, and their significance is classified. Our findings are expected to be important for the emerging field of molecular phononics.</description>

      <title>Numerical Analysis of Damage Evolution in Open Hole CFRP Laminates Modified with Electrospun Self Healing Diels Alder Interleaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study analyzes open hole carbon fiber reinforced polymer CFRP laminates modified with electrospun interleaves containing Diels Alder-based self-healing agents. It develops a high-fidelity simulation framework to investigate the quasistatic tensile behavior of these composites. The study uses Hashin's failure criteria to capture intralaminar damage and surface-based cohesive contact interactions to model interlaminar delamination. Two interleave configurations are examined: solution electrospinning (SEP) for full thickness coverage and melt electrospinning (MEP) for localized reinforcement. Results show good agreement with experimental data, capturing key failure mechanisms like matrix cracking, fiber breakage, and delamination. The study emphasizes the importance of spatially resolved cohesive properties and meshing strategies in accurately simulating damage progression.</description>

      <title>Universal Symmetries in Twisted Moir\'e Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional multi-layer materials with an induced moir\'e pattern, either due to strain or relative twist between layers, provide a versatile platform for exploring strongly correlated and topological electronic phenomena. While these systems offer unprecedented tunability, their theoretical description remains challenging due to their complex atomic structures and large unit cells. A notable example is twisted bilayer graphene, where even the relevant symmetry group remains unsettled despite its critical role in constructing effective theories. Here, we focus on twisted bilayer graphene and use a combination of analytical methods, molecular dynamics simulations, and first-principles calculations to show that twisted atomic configurations with distinct microscopic symmetries converge to a universal interlayer structure that governs the low-energy physics. This emergent universality provides a robust foundation for symmetry-respecting models and offers insight into the role of commensurability in real twisted moir\'e systems.</description>

      <title>Density-Functional Green Function Theory: Dynamical exchange-correlation field in lieu of self-energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The one-particle Green function of a many-electron system is traditionally formulated within the self-energy picture. A different formalism was recently proposed, in which the self-energy is replaced by a dynamical exchange-correlation field, which acts on the Green function locally in both space and time. It was found that there exists a fundamental quantity, referred to as the dynamical exchange-correlation hole, which can be interpreted as effective density fluctuations induced in a many-electron system when a hole or an electron is introduced into the system, as in photoemission and inverse photoemission experiments. The dynamical exchange-correlation potential is simply the Coulomb potential of this exchange-correlation hole, which fulfils a sum rule and an exact constraint, identical to those satisfied by the static exchange-correlation hole in density-functional theory. The proposed formalism has been applied to a number of model systems such as the half-filled one-dimensional Hubbard model, the one-dimensional antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model, and the single-impurity Anderson model. The dynamical exchange-correlation hole and field of the homogeneous electron gas have also been studied with the view of constructing a density-functional approximation such as the local-density approximation. The availability of simple but accurate approximations for the exchange-correlation potential would circumvent costly computations of the traditional self-energy. The formalism may also provide new perspectives and insights into the many-body problem.</description>

Abstract: The study of effective potential for the scalar Lee-Wick pseudo-electrodynamics in one-loop is presented in this letter. The planar and non-local Lee-Wick pseudo-electrodynamics is so coupled to a complex scalar field sector in 1+2 dimensions, where we achieve the Lee-Wick pseudo-scalar electrodynamics. The effective action formalism is applied such that the quantum corrections are examined in one loop to the scalar effective potential as function of the classical field, of the Lee-Wick mass, and also of the coupling constants of this model. The instability of the effective potential is investigated due to Lee-Wick mass.</description>

      <title>Yielding and memory in a driven mean-field model of glasses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Glassy systems reveal a wide variety of generic behaviors inherited from their intrinsically-disordered, non-equilibrium nature. These include universal non-phononic vibrational spectra, and driven phenomena such as thermal and mechanical annealing, yielding transitions and memory formation, all linked to the underlying complex energy landscape of glasses. Yet, a unified theory of such diverse glassy phenomena is currently lacking. Here, we study a recently introduced mean-field model of glasses, shown to reproduce the universal non-phononic vibrational spectra of glasses, under oscillatory driving forces. We show that the driven mean-field model, admitting a Hamiltonian formulation in terms of a collection of random-stiffness anharmonic oscillators with disordered interactions, naturally predicts the salient dynamical phenomena in cyclically deformed glasses. Specifically, it features a yielding transition as a function of the amplitude of the oscillatory driving force, characterized by an absorbing-to-diffusive transition in the system's microscopic trajectories and large-scale hysteresis. The model also reveals dynamic slowing-down from both sides of the transition, as well as mechanical and thermal annealing effects that mirror their glass counterparts. We demonstrate a non-equilibrium ensemble equivalence between the driven post-yielding dynamics at fixed quenched disorder and quenched disorder averages of the non-driven system. Finally, mechanical memory formation is demonstrated, in which memories can be stored in the model and subsequently extracted. Overall, the mean-field model offers a theoretical framework that unifies a broad range of glassy behaviors.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Transport in Carbon Quantum Dot Electronic Devices: Experiment and Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carbon quantum dots (CQDs) are a promising material for electronic applications due to their easy fabrication and interesting semiconductor properties. Further, CQDs exhibit quantum confinement and charging effects, which may lead not only to improved performances but also to devices with novel functionalities. Here, we investigate the electronic transport of CQDs embedded on epoxy polymer. Our samples are coupled to interdigitated electrodes with individually addressable microelectrodes. Remarkably, the current-voltage characteristics show strongly nonlinear regimes at room temperature, ranging from Schottky diode to Coulomb blockade and even negative differential conductance behavior. We propose a master equation theoretical framework which allows us to compute current curves that agree well with the observations. This model emphasizes the importance of interacting dots and electron traps in generating a cohesive picture that encompasses all transport regimes. Overall, our results suggest that CQDs constitute a versatile materials platform for 3D integrated electronic purposes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for analyzing aperiodically ordered photonic time quasicrystals (PTQCs), which are the temporal analogs of spatial photonic quasicrystals. Using a general two-symbol substitutional sequence to model temporal modulations, we extend the trace and anti-trace map formalism used for spatial photonic quasicrystals to the temporal domain. Focusing on the Thue-Morse sequence as a representative example, we examine the band structure and wave-transport properties, discussing their physical origins and highlighting both similarities and key differences with conventional periodic photonic time crystals. Furthermore, we investigate the peculiar features of PTQCs, such as multiscale spectral response and localization effects. Our findings provide valuable insights into the complex interplay between aperiodic order and wave dynamics in time-varying media, highlighting its potential to enable the development of advanced photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Sublimation of orientated amino acid films for reliable, amplified piezoelectric performance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biomolecular crystals, such as amino acids, peptides, and proteins, have emerged as potential next generation piezoelectric materials due to their low-cost, biocompatibility, eco-friendliness, and reduced permittivity versus ceramics. However, many challenges have limited their acceleration into mainstream sensing applications. Their natural self-assembly from saturated solutions into polycrystalline films reduces their effective piezoelectric output, and results in high variability within individual samples, and across sample batches when scaled-up. Here we validate the sublimation of a variety of amino acids onto conductive substrates as an effective technique for overcoming these challenges. This solvent-free crystallisation technique results in polycrystalline films with uniformly orientated crystals, and a resulting piezoelectric response that exceeds that of single crystals. We report a maximum piezoelectric response of 9.6 pC/N in films of L-Valine, which matches the predicted single crystal response, and a maximum voltage output of 4.6 V. For L-Methionine and L-Valine sublimated films the material properties are consistent at all points on the piezoelectric films and repeatable across any number of films grown under the same conditions.</description>

      <title>Many-body localization in a quantum Ising model with the long-range interaction: Accurate determination of the transition point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many-body localization (MBL) transition emerges at strong disorder in interacting systems, separating chaotic and reversible dynamics. Although the existence of MBL transition within the macroscopic limit in spin chains with a short-range interaction was proved rigorously, the transition point is not found yet because of the dramatic sensitivity of the transition point to the chain length at computationally accessible lengths, possible due to local fluctuations destroying localization. Here we investigate MBL transition in the quantum Ising model (Ising model in a transverse field) with the long-range interaction suppressing the fluctuations similarly to that for the second-order phase transitions. We estimate the MBL threshold within the logarithmic accuracy using exact results for a somewhat similar localization problem on a Bethe lattice problem and show that our expectations are fully consistent with the estimate of the transition point using exact diagonalization. In spite of unlimited growing of the critical disorder within the thermodynamic limit, this result offers the opportunity to probe the critical behavior of the system near the transition point. Moreover, the model is relevant for the wide variety of physical systems with the long-range dipole-dipole, elastic or indirect exchange interactions.</description>

Abstract: Curved polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) exhibit distinctive geometric and electronic structures, rendering them highly promising in addressing issues of solubility and air stability, which are faced for large linear arene $\pi$-conjugated organic semiconductors. In this study, a series of surface-curved PAHs and the heteroatom doped derivatives are selected and designed, and the relationship between electronic structure and charge transport properties of these molecules is investigated by using density functional theory (DFT). And the effects of sulfur/oxygen, nitrogen and boron doping on the charge transport performance of curved PAH semiconductors are explored. The results show that curved PAHs exhibit improved solubility and stability, with the degree of molecular curvature significantly affecting the material's transport properties.</description>

      <title>Biaxial characterization of soft elastomers: experiments and data-adaptive configurational forces for fracture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the fracture mechanics of soft solids remains a fundamental challenge due to their complex, nonlinear responses under large deformations. While multiaxial loading is key to probing their mechanical behavior, the role of such loading in fracture processes is still poorly understood. Here, we present a combined experimental-computational framework to investigate fracture in soft elastomers under equi-biaxial loading. We report original equi-biaxial quasi-static experiments on five elastomeric materials, revealing a spectrum of material and fracture behavior, from brittle-like to highly deformable response with crack tip strains exceeding 150 %. Motivated by these observations, we develop a hybrid computational testbed that mirrors the experimental setup and enables virtual biaxial tests. Central to this framework are two components: a data-adaptive formulation of hyperelastic energy functions that flexibly captures material behavior, and a post-processing implementation of the Configurational Force Method, providing a computationally efficient estimate of the J-integral at the crack tip. Our data-adaptive framework for hyperelastic energy functions proves versatility to capture with high accuracy the hyperelastic behavior observed in the biaxial experiments. This is important because accurately capturing the constitutive behaviour of soft solids is key for a reliable application of the Configurational Force Method to soft solids. In the limit of crack onset, a critical value of the crack tip configurational force allows for a criterion of fracture toughness. Together, our experimental, theoretical, and computational contributions offer a new paradigm for characterizing and designing soft materials with tailored fracture properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.03180v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Periodic plasmonic arrays making possible excitations of surface lattice resonances (SLRs) or quasi-resonant features are of great importance for biosensing and other applications. Fabrication of such arrays over a large area is typically very costly and time-consuming when performed using conventional electron beam lithography and other methods, which reduce application prospects. Here, we propose a technique of double femtosecond pulse (~ 170 fs) laser-assisted structuring of thin (~ 32 nm) Au films deposited on a glass substrate and report a single-step fabrication of homogeneous and highly ordered Au-based Laser Induced Periodic Surface Structures (LIPSS) over a large area. Our experimental results unveil the key importance of the interpulse delay as the determining factor rendering possible the homogeneity of laser induced structures and confirm that highly ordered, functional LIPSS occur solely upon double pulse irradiation under a specific interpulse delay range. A theoretical investigation complements experimental results providing remarkable insights on the structure formation mechanism. Ellipsometric measurements show that such LIPSS structures can exhibit highly valuable plasmonic features in light reflection. In particular, we observed ultranarrow resonances associated with diffraction-coupled SLRs, which are of paramount importance for biosensing and other applications. The presented data suggest that femtosecond double pulse structuring of thin metal films can serve as a valuable and low-cost tool for a large-scale fabrication of highly ordered functional elements and structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are promising systems for quantum technologies, including quantum metrology and sensing. A promising strategy for the achievement of high sensitivity to external fields relies on the exploitation of large ensembles of NV centers, whose fabrication by ion implantation is upper limited by the amount of radiation damage introduced in the diamond lattice. In this works we demonstrate an approach to increase the density of NV centers upon the high-fluence implantation of MeV N2+ ions on a hot target substrate (&gt;550 {\deg}C). Our results show that, with respect to room-temperature implantation, the high-temperature process increases the vacancy density threshold required for the irreversible conversion of diamond to a graphitic phase, thus enabling to achieve higher density ensembles. Furthermore, the formation efficiency of color centers was investigated on diamond substrates implanted at varying temperatures with MeV N2+ and Mg+ ions revealing that the formation efficiency of both NV centers and magnesium-vacancy (MgV) centers increases with the implantation temperature.</description>

      <title>Connected Network Model for the Mechanical Loss of Amorphous Materials</title>

Abstract: Dissipation in amorphous solids at low frequencies is commonly attributed to activated transitions of isolated two-level systems (TLS) that come in resonance with elastic or electric fields. Materials with low mechanical or dielectric loss are urgently needed for applications in gravitational wave detection, high precision sensors, and quantum computing. Using atomistic modeling, we explore the energy landscape of amorphous silicon and titanium dioxide, and find that the pairs of energy minima that constitute single TLS form a sparsely connected network with complex topologies. Motivated by this observation, we develop an analytically tractable theory for mechanical loss of the full network from a nonequilibrium thermodynamic perspective. We demonstrate that the connectivity of the network introduces new mechanisms that can both reduce low frequency dissipation through additional low energy relaxation pathways, and increase dissipation through a broad distribution of energy minima. As a result, the connected network model predicts mechanical loss with distinct frequency profiles compared to the isolated TLS model. This not only calls into question the validity of the TLS model, but also gives us many new avenues and properties to analyze for the targeted design of low mechanical loss materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01369v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The idea to extract information on magnetically different phases from magnetic measurements is very attractive and many efforts have been made in this area. One of the most popular direction is to use the Preisach model formalism to analyze the 2D Preisach distribution function (PDF) obtained either from first order reversal curves (FORC) or minor loops. Here we present an alternative a much simpler procedure -- the analysis of the derivative of the saturation magnetization loop, the differential susceptibility curve. It follows the Lorentzian shape with very high accuracy for ferromagnetic polycrystalline materials. This allows decomposing any differential susceptibility curve of a complex multi-phase material into individual components representing different magnetic phases by Lorenzian peaks -- in the same way as it is done in X-ray diffraction analysis of materials. We show that the minor differential susceptibility curves also have the Lorenzian shape that can facilitate calculation of the Preisach distribution function from the experimental curves and reduce noise in the resulting PDF.</description>

      <title>+SSLIP: Automated Radon-Assisted and Rotation-Corrected Identification of Complex HCP Slip System Activity Fields from DIC Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identification of crystallographic slip in metals and alloys is crucial to understand and improve their mechanical behavior. Recently, a novel slip system identification framework, termed SSLIP (for Slip Systems based Local Identification of Plasticity), was introduced to leap from conventional trace-based identification to automated, point-by-point identification, exploiting the full deformation kinematics. Using sub-micron-scale Digital Image Correlation (DIC) deformation fields aligned to Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) data, SSLIP matches the measured in-plane displacement gradient tensor to the kinematics of the optimal combination of multiple slip system activities, at each DIC datapoint. SSLIP was demonstrated to be successful on virtual and experimental case studies of FCC and BCC metals. However, for more challenging HCP crystal structures, the complete identification of all slip systems was found to be more challenging, posing limitations on automation and flexibility. To extend the capabilities of SSLIP, we propose an extended framework, hereinafter referred to as the +SSLIP method, which includes (i) a preselection of slip systems using a Radon transform, (ii) robustness to measured rigid body rotation by simultaneous identification of the local rotation field, (iii) identification of the two best matching slip systems for each data point, and (iv) a procedure to determine groups of slip systems with in-plane displacement gradient tensors that cannot be discriminated. This procedure yields the full (HCP) slip system activity maps for every slip system in each grain. The resulting objective identification method does not rely on the Schmid factor to select which slip system is active at each point. We show how slip systems from multiple slip families are successfully identified on virtual and real experiments on a Zn polycrystalline coating.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium chemical short-range order in metallic alloys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15474v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metallic alloys are routinely subjected to nonequilibrium processes during manufacturing, such as rapid solidification and thermomechanical processing. It has been suggested in the high-entropy alloy literature that chemical short-range order (SRO) could offer a ''new knob'' to tailor materials properties. While evidence of the effect of SRO on materials properties accumulates, the state of SRO evolution during alloy manufacturing remains obscure. Here, we employ high-fidelity atomistic simulations to track SRO evolution during the solidification and thermomechanical processing of alloys. Our investigation reveals that alloy processing can lead to nonequilibrium steady-states of SRO that are different from any equilibrium state. The mechanism behind nonequilibrium SRO formation is shown to be an inherent ordering bias present in nonequilibrium events. These results demonstrate that conventional manufacturing processes provide pathways for tuning SRO that lead to a broad nonequilibrium spectrum of SRO states beyond the equilibrium design space of alloys.</description>

      <title>A phenomenological magnetomechanical model for hysteresis loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08323v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we propose a simple phenomenological model for magnetization curves of stressed samples. The effect of stress is introduced by scaling the arctangent function argument (magnetic field) proportionally to stress. The magnetization curve is modelled by one or two arctangent functions. Despite of its simplicity, the model gives a very good agreement with experimental curves, reproducing all stress-induced features usually observed on the magnetization curves including the common crossover point and constricted hysteresis loops. The popular effective field concept in this model is just a consequence of a simple scaling of the magnetic field. We show that the differential susceptibility is inversely proportional to the applied stress for all magnetization values. We propose to analyze the field and differential susceptibility as a function of magnetization in contrast to convenient M(H) loops.</description>

      <title>Elastic tensor-derived properties of composition-dependent disordered refractory binary alloys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The elastic tensor provides valuable insight into the mechanical behavior of a material with lattice strain, such as disordered binary alloys. Density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) based on density functional theory (DFT) provides a powerful mechanism for computing and probing the microscopic features of elastic tensor-related properties. Here we present results for the rigid-ion and relaxed-ion elastic tensors computed using DFPT, for a comprehensive set of structural refractory body-centered cubic (BCC) binary alloys of molybdenum (Mo), niobium (Nb), tantalum (Ta), and tungsten (W). For the first time, we have mapped the heterogeneity in elastic constants and shear modulus and associated relaxation fields at each lattice site by computing the force response internal strain tensor ($\Lambda$) and displacement response internal strain tensors ($\Gamma$). Derived properties -- the bulk modulus ($B$), shear modulus ($G$), Young's modulus ($E$), Poisson's ratio ($\nu$), Pugh's ratio ($B/G$), Cauchy pressure and elastic anisotropy -- are reported as a function of composition for all refractory binaries. The computed mechanical properties data for the refractory binary alloys at systematically-varied Mo, Nb, Ta, and W compositions are in excellent agreement with available experimental data.</description>

      <title>SymmCD: Symmetry-Preserving Crystal Generation with Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03638v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generating novel crystalline materials has the potential to lead to advancements in fields such as electronics, energy storage, and catalysis. The defining characteristic of crystals is their symmetry, which plays a central role in determining their physical properties. However, existing crystal generation methods either fail to generate materials that display the symmetries of real-world crystals, or simply replicate the symmetry information from examples in a database. To address this limitation, we propose SymmCD, a novel diffusion-based generative model that explicitly incorporates crystallographic symmetry into the generative process. We decompose crystals into two components and learn their joint distribution through diffusion: 1) the asymmetric unit, the smallest subset of the crystal which can generate the whole crystal through symmetry transformations, and; 2) the symmetry transformations needed to be applied to each atom in the asymmetric unit. We also use a novel and interpretable representation for these transformations, enabling generalization across different crystallographic symmetry groups. We showcase the competitive performance of SymmCD on a subset of the Materials Project, obtaining diverse and valid crystals with realistic symmetries and predicted properties.</description>

      <title>Triplet Excitons Reconcile Charge Generation and Recombination in Low-Offset Organic Solar Cells: Efficiency Limits from a 5-State Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The power conversion efficiency of organic solar cells has recently improved beyond 20%. The active layers of these devices comprise of at least two organic semiconductors, forming a type II heterojunction. Hereby, the device performance is determined by the kinetic interplay of various species, including localized excitons, charge transfer states as well as charge-separated states. However, a model which describes all relevant photovoltaic measures has yet to be developed. Herein, we present a comprehensive 5-state rate model which includes both singlet and triplet charge transfer states and takes into account the formation, re-splitting and decay of the local triplet state, parametric in the respective energy offset. We show that this model not only describes key device properties such as charge generation efficiency, photoluminescence, electroluminescence and Langevin reduction factor simultaneously but also elucidate how these vary across material combinations based on the D:A interfacial energy offset alone. We find that the electroluminescence and Langevin reduction factor depend strongly on the triplet properties and that the triplet decay becomes the dominant charge recombination pathway for systems with moderate offset, in full agreement to previous experimental results. Validation against literature data demonstrates the model's ability to predict the device efficiency accurately. Subsequently, we identify material combinations with singlet exciton to charge transfer state energetic offset of roughly 150meV as particularly promising. Our model explains further why recent certified efficiency records for binary blends remain at ca. 20% if no further means to improve photon and charge carrier harvesting are taken.</description>

      <title>Isolated nearly flat higher Chern band in monolayer transition metal trihalides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07551v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interplay between non-trivial topology and strong electron interaction can generate a variety of exotic quantum matter. Here we theoretically propose that monolayer transition metal trihalides MoF$_3$ and W$X_3$ ($X$= Cl, Br, I) have isolated nearly flat band near the Fermi level with higher Chern number $\mathcal{C}=+3$ and $\mathcal{C}=-2$, respectively. The nontrivial topology of these flat Chern bands originates from the effective $sd^2$ hybridization of transition metal atom, which transform the apparent atomic $d$ orbitals on a hexagonal lattice into $(s, p_+, p_-)$ orbitals on a triangular lattice. Interestingly, the quantum geometry of flat Chern bands in these materials are comparable with those in moir\'e systems exhibiting fractional Chern insulator state. The Hofstadter butterfly of such flat Chern bands are further studied. These natural materials, if realized experimentally, could offer new platforms to explore correlated phenomena driven by flat Chern band with higher Chern number.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The efficient detection of the magnetism in 2D antiferromagnetic (AFM) insulators is crucial for the advancement of 2D AFM spintronics and remains a challenging problem. In this letter, we introduce the magnon nonlinear Hall current, a second-order Hall response of collective spin excitations in ordered magnets, as a novel probe for 2D layered AFM insulators. We theoretically demonstrate that the nonlinear Hall effect is intrinsically coupled to the underlying spin configuration. In particular, it exhibits a pronounced layer dependence in layered antiferromagnets, enabling direct characterization of the nature and strength of interlayer magnetic coupling in multilayer AFM insulators. Furthermore, we show that a a slight external field perturbation can induce and manipulate the magnon nonlinear Hall response. Our work establishes a novel approach for exploring 2D antiferromagnetism and holds great promise for AFM spintronic applications</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce MolMiner, a fragment-based, geometry-aware, and order-agnostic autoregressive model for molecular design. MolMiner supports conditional generation of molecules over twelve properties, enabling flexible control across physicochemical and structural targets. Molecules are built via symmetry-aware fragment attachments, with 3D geometry dynamically updated during generation using forcefields. A probabilistic conditioning mechanism allows users to specify any subset of target properties while sampling the rest. MolMiner achieves calibrated conditional generation across most properties and offers competitive unconditional performance. We also propose improved benchmarking methods for both unconditional and conditional generation, including distributional comparisons via Wasserstein distance and calibration plots for property control. To our knowledge, this is the first model to unify dynamic geometry, symmetry handling, order-agnostic fragment-based generation, and high-dimensional multi-property conditioning.</description>

      <title>Orbital Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state in 2H-NbS2 flakes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry breaking in a layered superconductor with Ising spin-orbit coupling has offered an opportunity to realize unconventional superconductivity. To be more specific, orbital Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state, exhibiting layer-dependent finite-momentum pairing, may emerge in transition metal dichalcogenides materials (TMDC) in the presence of an in-plane magnetic field. Orbital FFLO state can be more robust against the magnetic field than the conventional superconducting state with zero-momentum pairing. This feature renders its potential in field-resilient superconducting functionality. Although, orbital FFLO state has been reported in NbSe2 and MoS2, it is not yet clear if orbital FFLO state can be extended to other TMDC superconductor. Here, we report the observation of orbital FFLO state in 2H-NbS2 flakes and its dependence on the thickness of flake. We conclude that the relatively weak interlayer coupling is instrumental in stabilizing orbital FFLO state at higher temperature with respect to the critical temperature and lower magnetic field with respect to paramagnetic limit in NbS2 in comparison to its NbSe2 counterpart.</description>

      <title>Electrochemically induced hyperfluorescence based on the formation of charge-transfer excimers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03728v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Used extensively in sensing applications, the application of solution-state electrochemiluminescent devices (ECLDs) in lighting and displays has been constrained by their low luminance and short operational lifetime. Here, we report a record improvement in the luminance, efficiency, and operational longevity of ECLDs by introducing electrochemically induced hyperfluorescence (ECiHF) and demonstrate its use in a calligraphic display. We use the double-decker arrangement assumed by the electron donor and acceptor segments of the molecule TpAT-tFFO to realize thermally activated delayed fluorescence from an electrogenerated charge-transfer (CT) excimer state and a subsequent energy transfer to the rubrene emitter TBRb. ECLDs based on this strategy achieve an unprecedented luminance of &gt;6,200 cd/m2 and their operational lifetime is more than 10-fold longer than all previous ECLDs with meaningful efficiency or brightness. We identify energy level alignment between excimer and emitter as a crucial factor for efficient ECiHF; spectroelectrochemical analysis reveals that devices with energy gaps &lt; 0.4 eV operate on a pure excimer mechanism across a wide range of frequencies. Our findings highlight the potential of ECiHF for improving ECLDs and pave the way to commercial applications of this form of fluid light.</description>
