      <title>Theoretical Study of Reactivity Indices and Rough Potential Energy Curves for the Dissociation of 59 Fullerendiols in Gas-Phase and in Aqueous Solution with an Implicit Solvent Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Buckminsterfullerene, C$_{60}$, has not only a beautiful truncated icosahedral (soccerball) shape, but simple H\"uckel calculations predict a three-fold degenerate lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) which can accomodate up to six electrons making it a good electron acceptor. Experiments have confirmed that C60 is a radical sponge and it is now sold for use in topical cosmetics. Further medical uses require functionalization of C60 to make it soluble and one of the simplest functionalization is to make C60(OH)n fullerenols. A previous article [Adv. Quant. Chem. 8, 351 (2023)] studied reactivity indices for the successive addition of the $^\bullet$OH radical to ($^\bullet$)C$_{60}$(OH)$_n$ in gas phase. [($^\bullet$)C$_{60}$(OH)$_n$ is only a radical when n is an odd number.] This present article extends this previous work by examining various aspects of how the reaction, changes in aqueous solution. One obvious difference between C$_{60}$ and their various isomers of C$_{60}$(OH)$_2$ is the presence of a dipole. As fullerendiols are nearly spherical, their change in dipole moment in going from gas to aqueous phase may be estimated using back-of-the-envellope calculations with the Onsager model. The result is remarkably similar to what is obtained using density-functional theory (DFT) and the more sophisticated solvation model based upon the quantum mechanical density (SMD). Calculation of fullerendiol C-O bond energies and reactivity indices using with the SMD approach confirm that the general conclusions from the earlier work regarding gas-phase reactivity still hold in the aqueous phase.</description>

      <title>Introduction to machine learning potentials for atomistic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning potentials have revolutionised the field of atomistic simulations in recent years and are becoming a mainstay in the toolbox of computational scientists. This paper aims to provide an overview and introduction into machine learning potentials and their practical application to scientific problems. We provide a systematic guide for developing machine learning potentials, reviewing chemical descriptors, regression models, data generation and validation approaches. We begin with an emphasis on the earlier generation of models, such as high-dimensional neural network potentials (HD-NNPs) and Gaussian approximation potential (GAP), to provide historical perspective and guide the reader towards the understanding of recent developments, which are discussed in detail thereafter. Furthermore, we refer to relevant expert reviews, open-source software, and practical examples - further lowering the barrier to exploring these methods. The paper ends with selected showcase examples, highlighting the capabilities of machine learning potentials and how they can be applied to push the boundaries in atomistic simulations.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of mixtures containing amines. XVII. Excess molar enthalpy and volume measurements for benzylamine + heptane or + 1-alkanol mixtures at 298.15 K. Application of the DISQUAC and ERAS models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excess molar enthalpies, $H_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$, at 298.15 K and 0.1 MPa have been measured by means of a Tian-Calvet microcalorimeter for the systems benzylamine (phenylmethanamine) + heptane, or + methanol, or + 1-propanol, or + 1-pentanol, or + 1-heptanol, or + 1-decanol. In addition, excess molar volumes, $V_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$, at the same conditions have been also determined using a densimeter Anton Paar model DSA 5000 for the benzylamine + heptane mixture. The $H_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ of this solution is large and positive since at 298.15 K the system temperature is close to its upper critical solution temperature. Thus, systems with n-alkanes show positive deviations from the Raoult's law. The measured $|V_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}|$ values are low, indicating the existence of large structural effects. $H_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ values of mixtures involving 1-alkanols are large and negative. That is, interactions between unlike molecules are dominant and the systems are characterized by negative deviations from Raoult's law. It is shown that the enthalpy of the hydrogen bonding between molecules of 1-alkanol and benzyalmine are more negative than those between 1-alkanol molecules. The $V_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ values of the systems with 1-alkanols are also large and negative, and are determined mainly by interactional effects since they increase in line with $H_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ and with the alcohol size. The different contributions to $H_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ have been evaluated. The systems have been studied using the DISQUAC and ERAS models. ERAS describes correctly the $V_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ function. DISQUAC largely improves ERAS results on $H_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ or on excess molar heat capacities at constant pressure for the mixtures with 1-alkanols, which underlines that physical interactions are very relevant in such solutions.</description>

      <title>Chemical interaction and molecular growth of a highly dipolar merocyanine molecule on metal surfaces: A photoelectron spectroscopy study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growth and ordering of molecules on surfaces is an intriguing research topic as insights gained here can be of significant relevance for organic electronic devices. While often simple, rigid molecules are employed as model systems, we show results for a highly dipolar merocyanine which is studied on top of Au(100), Ag(100) and Cu(100) metal single crystals. Film thicknesses ranging from submonolayer to multilayer regimes are analyzed using UV (UPS) and X ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). For the monolayer regime, there is strong indication of face on orientation, with both of the molecules sulfur atoms bonding to the metal surfaces. Here, on Ag and Au(100) the sulfur atoms lose some or all of their intrinsic charges due to a charge transfer with the substrate, while on Cu(100) a strong metal sulfur bond forms. The interaction between the substrate and the molecules can also be seen in the intensity and width of the highest occupied molecular orbital features in UPS. Upon multilayer deposition, a gradual lowering in ionization energy is observed, likely due to the formation of antiparallel dimers followed by an increased charge carrier delocalization due to the formation of an extended molecular aggregate for thicker layers. Interestingly, on Cu(100) the aggregated phase is already observed for much lower deposition, showing the importance of substrate-molecule interaction on the subsequent film growth. Therefore, this study offers a detailed understanding of the interface formation and electronic structure evolution for merocyanine films on different metal surfaces.</description>

      <title>Operando Ultrafast Damage-free Diffraction-Enhanced X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy for Chemical Reactivity of Polymer in Solvents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chemical recycling of plastics to its constituent monomers is a promising solution to develop a sustainable circular plastic economy. An in-situ X-ray absorption spectra (XAS) characterization is an important way to understand the deconstruction process. However, radiation damage, and long acquisition time, prevent such characterization for fast chemical process. Here, we present a novel experimental technique, which we name Diffraction-Enhanced X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (DE-XAS), where the plastic material is supported on a graphene layer covering a periodic pattern of holes in a perforated SiNx membrane. The XAS is obtained by measuring the energy-dependent intensity of the X-ray diffracted beams going through the plastic film over the holes in the SiNx membrane. Our method decreases beam damage by orders of magnitude while providing good signal/noise ratio data. We demonstrate the suppression of beam damage with samples of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and the operando characterization of polymer deconstruction process in acid with polydiketoenamine (PDK). This proof-of-concept of the DE-XAS technique shows its great potential for studying fast chemical processes, picoseconds to nanoseconds, using fast CCD detectors with short readout time. We believe the DE-XAS technique offers opportunities for studies of chemical reactions, e.g., photoresist, and many others.</description>

      <title>Testing quantum master equations for complete positivity: A direct approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While quantum master equations (QMEs) are the primary workhorse in quantum information science, quantum optics, spectroscopy, and quantum thermodynamics, verifying complete positivity of the associated $N$-level quantum dynamical maps remains an outstanding challenge for $N\ge 3$. We address this challenge by establishing a direct mapping between the Liouvillian and Kossakowski matrices of an arbitrary Markovian QME. The mapping relies on the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse of a rectangular matrix composed of the structure constants of SU$(N)$. As an application, we establish complete positivity of the quantum optical Bloch-Redfield QME for a three-level V-system driven by incoherent light. Our approach makes it possible to test QMEs for complete positivity without solving them, and to restore complete positivity by keeping only non-negative eigenvalues of the Kossakowski matrix.</description>

      <title>Disentangling collective coupling in vibrational polaritons with double quantum coherence spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vibrational polaritons are formed by strong coupling of molecular vibrations and photon modes in an optical cavity. Experiments have demonstrated that vibrational strong coupling can change molecular properties and even affect chemical reactivity. However, the interactions in a molecular ensemble are complex, and the exact mechanisms that lead to modifications are not fully understood yet. We simulate two-dimensional infrared spectra of molecular vibrational polaritons based on the double quantum coherence technique to gain further insight into the complex many-body structure of these hybrid light-matter states. Double quantum coherence uniquely resolves the excitation of hybrid light-matter polaritons and allows to directly probe the anharmonicities of the resulting states. By combining the cavity Born-Oppenheimer Hartree-Fock ansatz with a full quantum dynamics simulation of the corresponding eigenstates, we go beyond simplified model systems. This allows us to study the influence of self-polarization and the response of the electronic structure to the cavity interaction on the spectral features even beyond the single-molecule case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Properly spin-adapted coupled-cluster theory for general open-shell configurations remains an active area of research in electronic structure theory. In this contribution we examine Lindgren's normal-ordered exponential ansatz to correlate specific spin states using spin-free excitation operators, with the aid of automatic equation generation software. We present an intermediately normalised and size-extensive reformulation of the unlinked working equations, and analyse the performance of the method with single and double excitations for simple molecular systems in terms of accuracy and size-consistency.</description>

      <title>A General and Transferable Local Hybrid Functional for Electronic Structure Theory and Many-Fermion Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21727v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Density functional theory has become the workhorse of quantum physics, chemistry, and materials science. Within these fields, a broad range of applications needs to be covered. These applications range from solids to molecular systems, from organic to inorganic chemistry, or even from electrons to other fermions such as protons or muons. This is emphasized by the plethora of density functional approximations that have been developed for various cases. In this work, a new local hybrid exchange-correlation density functional is constructed from first principles, promoting generality and transferability. We show that constraint satisfaction can be achieved even for admixtures with full exact exchange, without sacrificing accuracy. The performance of the new functional for electronic structure theory is assessed for thermochemical properties, excitation energies, M\"ossbauer isomer shifts, NMR spin--spin coupling constants, NMR shieldings and shifts, magnetizabilities, as well as EPR hyperfine coupling constants. Here, the new density functional shows excellent performance throughout all tests and is numerically robust only requiring small grids for converged results. Additionally, the functional can be easily generalized to arbitrary fermions as shown for electron-proton correlation energies. Therefore, we outline that density functionals generated in this way are general purpose tools for quantum mechanical studies.</description>

      <title>Variational Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution for Matrix Product State Ansatz with Tests on Transcorrelated Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The matrix product state (MPS) ansatz offers a promising approach for finding the ground state of molecular Hamiltonians and solving quantum chemistry problems. Building on this concept, the proposed technique of quantum circuit MPS (QCMPS) enables the simulation of chemical systems using a relatively small number of qubits. In this study, we enhance the optimization performance of the QCMPS ansatz by employing the variational quantum imaginary time evolution (VarQITE) approach. Guided by McLachlan's variational principle, the VarQITE method provides analytical metrics and gradients, resulting in improved convergence efficiency and robustness of the QCMPS. We validate these improvements numerically through simulations of $\rm H_2$, $\rm H_4$, and $\rm LiH$ molecules. Additionally, given that VarQITE is applicable to non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, we evaluate its effectiveness in preparing the ground state of transcorrelated (TC) Hamiltonians. This approach yields energy estimates comparable to the complete basis set (CBS) limit while using even fewer qubits. Specifically, we perform simulations of the beryllium atom and $\rm LiH$ molecule using only three qubits, maintaining high fidelity with the CBS ground state energy of these systems. This qubit reduction is achieved through the combined advantages of both the QCMPS ansatz and transcorrelation. Our findings demonstrate the potential practicality of this quantum chemistry algorithm on near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Dissipative split-charge formalism: Ohm's law, Nyquist noise, and non-contact friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The split-charge equilibration method is extended to describe dissipative charge transfer similarly as the Drude model, whereby the generic frequency-dependent dielectric permitivitties or conductivities of dielectrics and metals can be mimicked. To demonstrate the feasibility of the approach, a resistor-capacitor circuit is simulated using an all-atom representation for resistor and capacitor. The simulated dynamics reproduce the expected charging process and Nyquist noise, the latter resulting from the thermal voltages acting on individual split charges. The method bears promise to model friction caused by the motion of charged particles past metallic or highly polarizable media.</description>
