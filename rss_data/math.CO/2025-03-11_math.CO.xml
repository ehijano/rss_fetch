      <title>Probabilistic Entry Swapping Bijections for Non-Attacking Fillings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-attacking fillings are combinatorial objects central to the theory of Macdonald polynomials. A probabilistic bijection for partition-shaped non-attacking fillings was introduced by Mandelshtam (2024) to prove a compact formula for symmetric Macdonald polynomials. In this work, we generalize this probabilistic bijection to composition-shaped non-attacking fillings. As an application, we provide a bijective proof to extend a symmetry theorem for permuted-basement Macdonald polynomials established by Alexandersson (2019), proving a version with fewer assumptions.</description>

      <title>Characterizing optimal monitoring edge-geodetic sets for some structured graph classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $G=(V,E)$, a set $S\subseteq V$ is said to be a monitoring edge-geodetic set if the deletion of any edge in the graph results in a change in the distance between at least one pair of vertices in $S$. The minimum size of such a set in $G$ is called the monitoring edge-geodetic number of $G$ and is denoted by $meg(G)$.
  In this work, we compute the monitoring edge-geodetic number efficiently for the following graph classes: distance-hereditary graphs, $P_4$-sparse graphs, bipartite permutation graphs, and strongly chordal graphs. The algorithms follow from structural characterizations of the optimal monitoring edge-geodetic sets for these graph classes in terms of \emph{mandatory vertices} (those that need to be in every solution). This extends previous results from the literature for cographs, interval graphs and block graphs.</description>

      <title>On the coefficients of Tutte polynomials with one variable at 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Denote the Tutte polynomial of a graph $G$ and a matroid $M$ by $T_G(x,y)$ and $T_M(x,y)$ respectively. $T_G(x,1)$ and $T_G(1,y)$ were generalized to hypergraphs and further extended to integer polymatroids by K\'{a}lm\'{a}n \cite{Kalman} in 2013, called interior and exterior polynomials respectively. Let $G$ be a $(k+1)$-edge connected graph of order $n$ and size $m$, and let $g=m-n+1$. Guan et al. (2023) \cite{Guan} obtained the coefficients of $T_G(1,y)$: \[[y^j]T_G(1,y)=\binom{m-j-1}{n-2} \text{ for } g-k\leq j\leq g,\] which was deduced from coefficients of the exterior polynomial of polymatroids. Recently, Chen and Guo (2025) \cite{Chen} further obtained \[[y^j]T_G(1,y)=\binom{m-j-1}{n-2}-\sum_{i=k+1}^{g-j}\binom{m-j-i-1}{n-2}|\mathcal{EC}_i(G)|\] for $g-3(k+1)/2&lt; j\leq g$, where $\mathcal{EC}_i(G)$ denotes the set of all minimal edge cuts with $i$ edges. In this paper, for any matroid $M=(X,rk)$ we first obtain \[[y^j]T_M(1,y)=\sum_{t=j}^{|X|-r}(-1)^{t-j}\binom{t}{j}\sigma_{r+t}(M),\] where $\sigma_{r+t}(M)$ denotes the number of spanning sets with $r+t$ elements in $M$ and $r=rk(M)$. Moveover, the expression of $[x^i]T_M(x,1)$ is obtained immediately from the duality of the Tutte polynomial. As applications of our results, we generalize the two aforementioned results on graphs to the setting of matroids. This not only resolves two open problems posed by Chen and Guo in \cite{Chen} but also provides a purely combinatorial proof that is significantly simpler than their original proofs.</description>

      <title>Sets of equiangular lines in dimension $18$ constructed from $A_9 \oplus A_9 \oplus A_1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2023, Greaves et~al.\ constructed several sets of 57 equiangular lines in dimension 18. Using the concept of switching root introduced by Cao et~al.\ in 2021, these sets of equiangular lines are embedded in a lattice of rank 19 spanned by norm 3 vectors together with a switching root. We characterize this lattice as an overlattice of the root lattice $A_9\oplus A_9\oplus A_1$, and show that there are at least $246896$ sets of 57 equiangular lines in dimension $18$ arising in this way, up to isometry. Additionally, we prove that all of these sets of equiangular lines are strongly maximal. Here, a set of equiangular lines is said to be strongly maximal if there is no set of equiangular lines properly containing it even if the dimension of the underlying space is increased. Among these sets, there are ones with only six distinct Seidel eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>Deterministically approximating the volume of a Kostka polytope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The volumes of Kostka polytopes appear naturally in questions of random matrix theory in the context of the randomized Schur-Horn problem, i.e., evaluating the probability density that a random Hermitian matrix with fixed spectrum has a given diagonal. We give a polynomial-time deterministic algorithm for approximating the volume of a ($\Omega(n^2)$ dimensional) Kostka polytope $\mathrm{GT}(\lambda, \mu)$ to within a multiplicative factor of $\exp(O(n\log n))$, when $\lambda$ is an integral partition with $n$ parts, with entries bounded above by a polynomial in $n$, and $\mu$ is an integer vector lying in the interior of the Schur-Horn polytope associated to $\lambda$. The algorithm thus gives asymptotically correct estimates of the log-volume of Kostka polytopes corresponding to such $(\lambda, \mu)$. Our approach is based on a partition function interpretation of the continuous analogue of Schur polynomials, and an associated maximum entropy principle.</description>

      <title>Theoretical and Computational Approaches to Determining Sets of Orders for $(k,g)$-Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cage Problem requires for a given pair $k \geq 3, g \geq 3$ of integers the determination of the order of a smallest $k$-regular graph of girth $g$. We address a more general version of this problem and look for the $(k,g)$-spectrum of orders of $(k,g)$-graphs: the (infinite) list of all orders of $(k,g)$-graphs. By establishing these spectra we aim to gain a better understanding of the structure and properties of $(k,g)$-graphs and hope to use the acquired knowledge in both determining new orders of smallest $k$-regular graphs of girth $g$ as well as developing a set of tools suitable for constructions of extremal graphs with additional requirements. We combine theoretical results with computer-based searches, and determine or determine up to a finite list of unresolved cases the $(k,g)$-spectra for parameter pairs for which the orders of the corresponding cages have already been established.</description>

      <title>Simplices in $t$-intersecting families for vector spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $V$ be an $n$-dimensional vector space over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ and ${V\brack k}$ denote the family of all $k$-dimensional subspaces of $V$. A family $\mathcal{F}\subseteq {V\brack k}$ is called $k$-uniform $r$-wise $t$-intersecting if for any $F_1, F_2, \dots, F_r \in \mathcal{F}$, we have $\dim\left(\bigcap_{i=1}^r F_i \right) \geq t$. An $r$-wise $t$-intersecting family $\{X_1, X_2, \dots, X_{r+1}\}$ is called a $(r+1,t)$-simplex if $\dim\left(\bigcap_{i=1}^{r+1} X_i \right) &lt; t$, denoted by $\Delta_{r+1,t}$. Notice that it is usually called triangle when $r=2$ and $t=1$. For $k \geq t \geq 1$, $r \geq 2$ and $n \geq 3kr^2 + 3krt$, we prove that the maximal number of $\Delta_{r+1,t}$ in a $k$-uniform $r$-wise $t$-intersecting subspace family of $V$ is at most $n_{t+r,k}$, and we describe all the extreme families. Furthermore, we have the extremal structure of $k$-uniform intersecting families maximizing the number of triangles for $n\geq 2k+9$ as a corollary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kuratowski's theorem says that the minimal (under subgraph containment) graphs that are not planar are the subdivisions of $K_5$ and of $K_{3,3}$. Here we study the minimal (under subdigraph containment) strongly-connected digraphs that are not planar. We also find the minimal strongly-connected non-outerplanar digraphs and the minimal strongly-connected non-series-parallel digraphs.</description>

      <title>Eulerian magnitude homology: diagonality, injective words, and regular path homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we explore the algebraic structure and combinatorial properties of eulerian magnitude homology. First, we analyze the diagonality conditions of eulerian magnitude homology, providing a characterization of complete graphs. Then, we construct the regular magnitude-path spectral sequence as the spectral sequence of the (filtered) injective nerve of the reachability category, and explore its consequences. Among others, we show that such spectral sequence converges to the complex of injective words on a digraph, and yields characterization results for the regular path homology of diagonal directed graphs.</description>

      <title>Minors in small-set expanders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study large minors in small-set expanders. More precisely, we consider graphs with $n$ vertices and the property that every set of size at most $\alpha n / t$ expands by a factor of $t$, for some (constant) $\alpha &gt; 0$ and large $t = t(n)$. We obtain the following:
  * Improving results of Krivelevich and Sudakov, we show that a small-set expander contains a complete minor of order $\sqrt{n t / \log n}$.
  * We show that a small-set expander contains every graph $H$ with $O(n \log t / \log n)$ edges and vertices as a minor. We complement this with an upper bound showing that if an $n$-vertex graph $G$ has average degree $d$, then there exists a graph with $O(n \log d / \log n)$ edges and vertices which is not a minor of $G$. This has two consequences: (i) It implies the optimality of our result in the case $t = d^c$ for some constant $c &gt; 0$, and (ii) it shows expanders are optimal minor-universal graphs of a given average degree.</description>

      <title>On the one-dimensional extensions of $q$-matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In classical matroid theory, extensions are the inverse operation of restrictions for matroids. In particular, extensions to a ground set with one additional element are called single-element extensions. In this paper we introduce a $q$-analogue of single-element extensions for $q$-matroids, which we call one-dimensional extensions. To enumerate such extensions, we establish a $q$-analogue of modular cuts and define a certain function which we call a modular cut selector. It assigns each newly appearing one-dimensional subspace to a modular cut. By using these notion, we establish the one-to-one correspondence between one-dimensional extensions and modular cut selectors. As an application, we develop a classification algorithm for $q$-matroids. Furthermore, by computation, we classify all the $q$-matroids on ground spaces over $\mathbb{F}_2$ of dimension $4$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by a work of Fu-So-Song, we associate a symmetric matrix $A$ to a plane vector sequence $v$ and give a formula to find the signature of $A$ in terms of the sequence $v$. When $A$ is nonsingular, we interpret the relation between $A$ and $A^{-1}$ from a topological viewpoint. Finally, we associate an omnioriented quasitoric orbifold $X$ of real dimension four to the sequence $v$ and show that $A^{-1}$ is the intersection matrix of the characteristic suborbifolds of $X$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given two affine permutations, some results of Lascoux and Deodhar, and independently Jacon-Lecouvey, allow to decide if they are comparable for the strong Bruhat order. These permutations are associated with tuples of core partitions, and the preceding problem is equivalent to compare the Young diagrams in each components for the inclusion. Using abaci, we give an easy rule to compute these Young diagrams one another. We deduce a procedure to compare, for the Bruhat order, two affine permutations in the window notation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that, for any $\{2,3\}$-generated perfect group $P$, there exists a 2-arc-transitive graph which has full automorphism group isomorphic to $P\wr A_5=P^5{:} A_5$ and is a cover of the Petersen graph. This particularly shows that there are infinitely many $2$-arc-transitive normal covers of the Petersen graph. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first known examples of 2-arc-transitive non-trivial covers of 2-arc-transitive graphs with non-solvable transformation groups. Moreover, these graphs are non-Cayley graphs, and have girth 10.</description>

      <title>The maximum number of cliques in disjoint copies of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of determining the maximum number of copies of $T$ in an $H$-free graph, for any graphs $T$ and $H$, was considered by Alon and Shikhelman. This is a variant of Tur\'{a}n's classical extremal problem. We show lower and upper bounds for the maximum number of $s$-cliques in a graph with no disjoint copies of arbitrary graph. 
We also determine the maximum number of $s$-cliques in an $n$-vertex graph that does not contain a disjoint union of $k$ paths of length two when $k=2,3$, or $s\geqslant k+2$, or $n$ is sufficiently large, this partly confirms a conjecture posed by Chen, Yang, Yuan, and Zhang \cite{2024Chen113974}.</description>

      <title>Minimum size of insertion/deletion/substitution balls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $n,q,t,s,p$ be non-negative integers where $n\geq s$ and $q\geq 1$. For $\mathbf{x}\in A_{q}^{n}\triangleq\{ 0,1,\ldots,q-1 \}^{n}$, let the $t$-insertion $s$-deletion $p$-substitution ball of $\mathbf{x}$, denoted by $\mathcal{B}_{t,s,p}(\mathbf{x})$, be the set of sequences in $A_{q}^{n+t-s}$ which can be obtained from $\mathbf{x}$ by performing $t$ insertions, $s$ deletions, and at most $p$ substitutions. We establish that for any $\mathbf{x}\in A_{q}^{n}$, $|\mathcal{B}_{t,s,p}(\mathbf{x})|\geq\sum_{i=0}^{t+p}\binom{n+t-s}{i}(q-1)^{i}$, with equality holding if and only if $t=s=0\vee s=p=0\vee s+p\geq n\vee r(\mathbf{x})=1$. Here, $r(\mathbf{x})$ denotes the number of runs in $\mathbf{x}$, and a run in $\mathbf{x}$ is a maximum continuous subsequence of identical symbols.</description>

      <title>Nearly Hamilton cycles in sublinear expanders, and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop novel methods for constructing nearly Hamilton cycles in sublinear expanders with good regularity properties, as well as new techniques for finding such expanders in general graphs. These methods are of independent interest due to their potential for various applications to embedding problems in sparse graphs. In particular, using these tools, we make substantial progress towards a twenty-year-old conjecture of Verstra\"ete, which asserts that for any given graph $F$, nearly all vertices of every $d$-regular graph $G$ can be covered by vertex-disjoint $F$-subdivisions. This significantly extends previous work on the conjecture by Kelmans, Mubayi and Sudakov, Alon, and K\"uhn and Osthus. Additionally, we present applications of our methods to two other problems.</description>

      <title>Near Triple Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce near triple arrays as binary row-column designs with at most two consecutive values for the replication numbers of symbols, for the intersection sizes of pairs of rows, pairs of columns and pairs of a row and a column. Near triple arrays form a common generalization of such well-studied classes of designs as triple arrays, (near) Youden rectangles and Latin squares.
  We enumerate near triple arrays for a range of small parameter sets and show that they exist in the vast majority of the cases considered. As a byproduct, we obtain the first complete enumerations of $6 \times 10$ triple arrays on $15$ symbols, $7 \times 8$ triple arrays on $14$ symbols and $5 \times 16$ triple arrays on $20$ symbols.
  Next, we give several constructions for families of near triple arrays, and e.g. show that near triple arrays with 3 rows and at least 6 columns exist for any number of symbols. Finally, we investigate a duality between row and column intersection sizes of a row-column design, and covering numbers for pairs of symbols by rows and columns. These duality results are used to obtain necessary conditions for the existence of near triple arrays. This duality also provides a new unified approach to earlier results on triple arrays and balanced grids.</description>

      <title>Counting for rigidity under projective transformations in the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $P$ be a set of points and $L$ a set of lines in the (extended) Euclidean plane, and $I \subseteq P\times L$, where $i =(p,l) \in I$ means that point $p$ and line $l$ are incident. The incidences can be interpreted as quadratic constraints on the homogeneous coordinates of the points and lines. We study the space of incidence preserving motions of the given incidence structure by linearizing the system of quadratic equations. The Jacobian of the quadratic system, our projective rigidity matrix, leads to the notion of independence/dependence of incidences. Column dependencies correspond to infinitesimal motions. Row dependencies or self-stresses allow for new interpretations of classical geometric incidence theorems. We show that self-stresses are characterized by a 3-fold balance. As expected, infinitesimal (first order) projective rigidity as well as second order projective rigidity imply projective rigidity but not conversely. Several open problems and possible generalizations are indicated.</description>

      <title>On average orders of automorphism groups of bilinear maps over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\varphi:V\times V\to W$ be a bilinear map of finite vector spaces $V$ and $W$ over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$. We present asymptotic bounds on the number of isomorphism classes of bilinear maps under the natural action of $\mathrm{GL}(V)$ and $\mathrm{GL}(W)$, when $\dim(V)$ and $\dim(W)$ are linearly related.
  As motivations and applications of the results, we present almost tight upper bounds on the number of $p$-groups of Frattini class $2$ as first studied by Higman (Proc. Lond. Math. Soc., 1960). Such bounds lead to answers for some open questions by Blackburn, Neumann, and Venkataraman (Cambridge Tracts in Mathematics, 2007). Further applications include sampling matrix spaces with the trivial automorphism group, and asymptotic bounds on the number of isomorphism classes of finite cube-zero commutative algebras.</description>

      <title>Playing Sudoku on random 3-regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sudoku number $s(G)$ of graph $G$ with chromatic number $\chi(G)$ is the smallest partial $\chi(G)$-colouring of $G$ that determines a unique $\chi(G)$-colouring of the entire graph. We show that the Sudoku number of the random $3$-regular graph $\mathcal{G}_{n,3}$ satisfies $s(\mathcal{G}_{n,3}) \leq (1+o(1))\frac{n}{3}$ asymptotically almost surely. We prove this by analyzing an algorithm which $3$-colours $\mathcal{G}_{n,3}$ in a way that produces many locally forced vertices, i.e., vertices which see two distinct colours among their neighbours. The intricacies of the algorithm present some challenges for the analysis, and to overcome these we use a non-standard application of Wormald's differential equations method that incorporates tools from finite Markov chains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let \( \mathcal{F} \) be a family of graphs. The generalized Tur\'an number \( \operatorname{ex}(n, K_r, \mathcal{F}) \) is the maximum number of $K_r$ in an \( n \)-vertex graph that does not contain any member of \( \mathcal{F} \) as a subgraph. Recently, Alon and Frankl initiated the study of Tur\'an problems with bounded matching number. In this paper, we determine the generalized Tur\'an number of \( C_{\geq k} \) with bounded matching number.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is cyclically $c$-edge-connected if there is no set of fewer than $c$ edges that disconnects $G$ into at least two cyclic components. We prove that if a $(k, g)$-cage $G$ has at most $2M(k, g) - g^2$ vertices, where $M(k, g)$ is the Moore bound, then $G$ is cyclically $(k - 2)g$-edge-connected, which equals the number of edges separating a $g$-cycle, and every cycle-separating $(k - 2)g$-edge-cut in $G$ separates a cycle of length $g$. In particular, this is true for unknown cages with $(k, g) \in \{(3, 13), (3, 14), (3, 15), (4, 9), (4, 10)$, $(4, 11),$ $(5, 7), (5, 9), (5, 10), (5, 11), (6, 7), (9, 7)\}$ and also the potential missing Moore graph with degree $57$ and diameter $2$.

      <title>On the expressive power of $2$-edge-colourings of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a finite set of $2$-edge-coloured graphs $\mathcal F$ and a hereditary property of graphs $\mathcal{P}$, we say that $\mathcal F$ expresses $\mathcal{P}$ if a graph $G$ has the property $\mathcal{P}$ if and only if it admits a $2$-edge-colouring not having any graph in $\mathcal F$ as an induced $2$-edge-coloured subgraph. We show that certain classic hereditary classes are expressible by some set of $2$-edge-coloured graphs on three vertices. We then initiate a systematic study of the following problem. Given a finite set of $2$-edge-coloured graphs $\mathcal F$, structurally characterize the hereditary property expressed by $\mathcal F$. In our main results we describe all hereditary properties expressed by $\mathcal F$ when $\mathcal F$ consists of 2-edge-coloured graphs on three vertices and (1) patterns have at most two edges, or (2) $\mathcal F$ consists of both monochromatic paths and a set of coloured triangles.
  On the algorithmic side, we consider the $\mathcal F$-free colouring problem, i.e., deciding if an input graph admits an $\mathcal F$-free $2$-edge-colouring. It follows from our structural characterizations, that for all sets considered in (1) and (2) the $\mathcal F$-free colouring problem is solvable in polynomial time. We complement these tractability results with a uniform reduction to boolean constraint satisfaction problems which yield polynomial-time algorithms that recognize most graph classes expressible by a set $\mathcal F$ of $2$-edge-coloured graphs on at most three vertices. Finally, we exhibit some sets $\mathcal F$ such that the $\mathcal F$-free colouring problem is NP-complete.</description>

      <title>On relative simple Heffter spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the concept of a relative Heffter space which simultaneously generalizes those of relative Heffter arrays and Heffter spaces. Given a subgroup $J$ of an abelian group $G$, a relative Heffter space is a resolvable configuration whose points form a half-set of $G\setminus{J}$ and whose blocks are all zero-sum in $G$. Here we present two infinite families of relative Heffter spaces satisfying the additional condition of being simple. As a consequence, we get new results on globally simple relative Heffter arrays, on mutually orthogonal cycle decompositions and on biembeddings of cyclic cycle decompositions of the complete multipartite graph into an orientable surface.</description>

      <title>A new density limit for unanimity in majority dynamics on random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Majority dynamics is a process on a simple, undirected graph $G$ with an initial Red/Blue color for every vertex of $G$. Each day, each vertex updates its color following the majority among its neighbors, using its previous color for tie-breaking. The dynamics achieves \textit{unanimity} if every vertex has the same color after finitely many days, and such color is said to \textit{win}.
  When $G$ is a $G(n,p)$ random graph, L. Tran and Vu (2019) found a codition in terms of $p$ and the initial difference $2\Delta$ beteween the sizes of the Red and Blue camps, such that unanimity is achieved with probability arbitrarily close to 1. They showed that if $p\Delta^2 \gg1 $, $p\Delta \geq 100$, and $p\geq (1+\varepsilon) n^{-1}\log n$ for a positive constant $\varepsilon$, then unanimity occurs with probability $1 - o(1)$. If $p$ is not extremely small, namely $p &gt; \log^{-1/16} n $, then Sah and Sawhney (2022) showed that the condition $p\Delta^2 \gg 1$ is sufficient.
  If $n^{-1}\log^2 n \ll p \ll n^{-1/2}\log^{1/4} n$, we show that $p^{3/2}\Delta \gg n^{-1/2}\log n$ is enough. Since this condition holds if $p\Delta \geq 100$ for $p$ in this range, this is an improvement of Tran's and Vu's result. For the closely related problem of finding the optimal condition for $p$ to achieve unanimity when the initial coloring is chosen uniformly at random among all possible Red/Blue assignments, our result implies a new lower bound $p \gg n^{-2/3}\log^{2/3} n$, which improves upon the previous bound of $n^{-3/5}\log n$ by Chakraborti, Kim, Lee and T. Tran (2021).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates quasi-isometries between graphs with variable edge lengths. A quasi-isometry is a mapping between metric spaces that approximately preserves distances, allowing for a bounded amount of additive and multiplicative distortion. Recently, Nguyen, Scott, and Seymour conjectured that, by appropriately adjusting the edge lengths of the target graph along with modifying the additive distortion constant, the multiplicative distortion factor could be eliminated. We disprove this conjecture.</description>

      <title>Balanced genus and a lower bound theorem for balanced 3- and 4-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new PL invariant, called the balanced genus, for balanced normal $d$-pseudomanifolds. As a key result, we establish that for any 3-manifold $M$ that is not a sphere, the balanced genus satisfies the lower bound $\mathcal{G}_M \geq m+3$, where $m$ is the rank of its fundamental group. Furthermore, we prove that a 3-manifold $M$ is homeomorphic to the 3-sphere if and only if its balanced genus $\mathcal{G}_M$ is at most 3.
  For 4-manifolds, we establish a similar characterization: if $M$ is not homeomorphic to a sphere, then its balanced genus is bounded below by $\mathcal{G}_M \geq 2\chi(M) + 5m + 11$, where $m$ is the rank of $\pi_1(M)$. Additionally, we prove that a 4-manifold $M$ is PL-homeomorphic to the 4-sphere if and only if its balanced genus satisfies $\mathcal{G}_M \leq 2\chi(M) + 10$.
  We believe that the balanced genus provides a new perspective in combinatorial topology and will inspire further developments in the field. To this end, we outline several research directions for future exploration.</description>

      <title>The connectivity carcass of a vertex subset in a graph: both odd and even case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G=(V,E)$ be an undirected unweighted multi-graph and $S\subseteq V$ be a subset of vertices called the Steiner set. A set of edges with the least cardinality whose removal disconnects $S$, that is, there is no path between at least one pair of vertices from $S$, is called a Steiner mincut for $S$ or simply an $S$-mincut. Connectivity Carcass is a compact data structure storing all $S$-mincuts in $G$ announced by Dinitz and Vainshtein in an extended abstract by Dinitz and Vainshtein in 1994. The complete proof of various results of this data structure for the simpler case when the capacity of $S$-mincut is odd appeared in the year 2000 in SICOMP. Over the last couple of decades, there have been attempts towards the proof for the case when the capacity of $S$-mincut is even, but none of them met a logical end. We present the following results.
  - We present the first complete, self-contained exposition of the connectivity carcass which covers both even and odd cases of the capacity of $S$-mincut.
  - We derive the results using an alternate and much simpler approach. In particular, we derive the results using submodularity of cuts -- a well-known property of graphs expressed using a simple inequality.
  - We also show how the connectivity carcass can be helpful in efficiently answering some basic queries related to $S$-mincuts using some additional insights.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning meets Algebraic Combinatorics: A Suite of Datasets Capturing Research-level Conjecturing Ability in Pure Mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With recent dramatic increases in AI system capabilities, there has been growing interest in utilizing machine learning for reasoning-heavy, quantitative tasks, particularly mathematics. While there are many resources capturing mathematics at the high-school, undergraduate, and graduate level, there are far fewer resources available that align with the level of difficulty and open endedness encountered by professional mathematicians working on open problems. To address this, we introduce a new collection of datasets, the Algebraic Combinatorics Dataset Repository (ACD Repo), representing either foundational results or open problems in algebraic combinatorics, a subfield of mathematics that studies discrete structures arising from abstract algebra. Further differentiating our dataset collection is the fact that it aims at the conjecturing process. Each dataset includes an open-ended research-level question and a large collection of examples (up to 10M in some cases) from which conjectures should be generated. We describe all nine datasets, the different ways machine learning models can be applied to them (e.g., training with narrow models followed by interpretability analysis or program synthesis with LLMs), and discuss some of the challenges involved in designing datasets like these.</description>

      <title>A conjecture on monomial realizations and polyhedral realizations for crystal bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crystal bases are powerful combinatorial tools in the representation theory of quantum groups $U_q(\mathfrak{g})$ for a symmetrizable Kac-Moody algebras $\mathfrak{g}$. The polyhedral realizations are combinatorial descriptions of the crystal base $B(\infty)$ for Verma modules in terms of the set of integer points of a polyhedral cone, which equals the string cone when $\mathfrak{g}$ is finite dimensional simple. It is a fundamental and natural problem to find explicit forms of the polyhedral cone. The monomial realization expresses crystal bases $B(\lambda)$ of integrable highest weight representations as Laurent monomials with double indexed variables. In this paper, we give a conjecture between explicit forms of the polyhedral cones and monomial realizations. We prove the conjecture is true when $\mathfrak{g}$ is a classical Lie algebra, a rank $2$ Kac-Moody algebra or a classical affine Lie algebra.</description>

      <title>A Quadratic Vertex Kernel and a Subexponential Algorithm for Subset-FAST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the Subset Feedback Arc Set in Tournaments, Subset-FAST problem we are given as input a tournament $T$ with a vertex set $V(T)$ and an arc set $A(T)$, along with a terminal set $S \subseteq V(T)$, and an integer $ k$. The objective is to determine whether there exists a set $ F \subseteq A(T) $ with $|F| \leq k$ such that the resulting graph $T-F $ contains no cycle that includes any vertex of $S$. When $S=V(T)$ this is the classic Feedback Arc Set in Tournaments (FAST) problem. We obtain the first polynomial kernel for this problem parameterized by the solution size. More precisely, we obtain an algorithm that, given an input instance $(T, S, k)$, produces an equivalent instance $(T',S',k')$ with $k'\leq k$ and $V(T')=O(k^2)$.
  It was known that FAST admits a simple quadratic vertex kernel and a non-trivial linear vertex kernel. However, no such kernel was previously known for Subset-FAST. Our kernel employs variants of the most well-known reduction rules for FAST and introduces two new reduction rules to identify irrelevant vertices. As a result of our kernelization, we also obtain the first sub-exponential time FPT algorithm for Subset-FAST.</description>

      <title>Geometric realizations of dichotomous ordinal graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A dichotomous ordinal graph consists of an undirected graph with a partition of the edges into short and long edges. A geometric realization of a dichotomous ordinal graph $G$ in a metric space $X$ is a drawing of $G$ in $X$ in which every long edge is strictly longer than every short edge. We call a graph $G$ pandichotomous in $X$ if $G$ admits a geometric realization in $X$ for every partition of its edge set into short and long edges. We exhibit a very close relationship between the degeneracy of a graph $G$ and its pandichotomic Euclidean or spherical dimension, that is, the smallest dimension $k$ such that $G$ is pandichotomous in $\mathbb{R}^k$ or the sphere $\mathbb{S}^k$, respectively. First, every $d$-degenerate graph is pandichotomous in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ and $\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$ and these bounds are tight for the sphere and for $\mathbb{R}^2$ and almost tight for $\mathbb{R}^d$, for $d\ge 3$. Second, every $n$-vertex graph that is pandichotomous in $\mathbb{R}^k$ has at most $\mu kn$ edges, for some absolute constant $\mu&lt;7.23$. This shows that the pandichotomic Euclidean dimension of any graph is linearly tied to its degeneracy and in the special cases $k\in \{1,2\}$ resolves open problems posed by Alam, Kobourov, Pupyrev, and Toeniskoetter. Further, we characterize which complete bipartite graphs are pandichotomous in $\mathbb{R}^2$: These are exactly the $K_{m,n}$ with $m\le 3$ or $m=4$ and $n\le 6$. For general bipartite graphs, we can guarantee realizations in $\mathbb{R}^2$ if the short or the long subgraph is constrained: namely if the short subgraph is outerplanar or a subgraph of a rectangular grid, or if the long subgraph forms a caterpillar.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.01674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An enumerative theory of triangulations of simplicial complexes has been developed by Stanley. A key role in his theory is played by the local $h$-polynomial of a triangulation of a simplex. This paper develops a parallel theory, in which the role of the local $h$-polynomial is played by a simpler invariant, namely the theta polynomial. This allows one to deduce unimodality and gamma-positivity properties of $h$-polynomials of triangulations of simplicial complexes from corresponding properties of theta polynomials, which are studied here in some detail. To mention one concrete application, the $h$-polynomial of the antiprism triangulation of any simplicial homology sphere is shown to be gamma-positive, thus confirming Gal's conjecture in a new special case.</description>

Abstract: Bukh and Conlon used random polynomial graphs to give effective lower bounds on $\mathrm{ex}(n,\mathcal{T}^\ell)$, where $\mathcal{T}^\ell$ is the $\ell$th power of a balanced rooted tree $T$. We extend their result to give effective lower bounds on $\mathrm{ex}(G_{n,p},\mathcal{T}^\ell)$, which is the maximum number of edges in a $\mathcal{T}^\ell$-free subgraph of the random graph $G_{n,p}$. Analogous bounds for generalized Tur\'an numbers in random graphs are also proven.</description>

Abstract: Improving a 2003 result of Bohman and Holzman, we show that for $n \geq 1$, the Shannon capacity of the complement of the $2n+1$-cycle is at least $(2^{r_n} + 1)^{1/r_n} = 2 + \Omega(2^{-r_n}/r_n)$, where $r_n = \exp(O((\log n)^2))$ is the number of partitions of $2(n-1)$ into powers of $2$. We also discuss a connection between this result and work by Day and Johnson in the context of graph Ramsey numbers.</description>

      <title>Slab tilings, flips and the triple twist</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A \textit{domino} is a $2\times 1\times 1$ parallelepiped formed by the union of two unit cubes and a \textit{slab} is a $2\times 2\times 1$ parallelepiped formed by the union of four unit cubes. We are interested in tiling regions formed by the finite union of unit cubes. Domino tilings have been studied before; here we investigate \textit{slab tilings}. As for domino tilings, a flip in a slab tiling is a local move: two neighboring parallel slabs are removed and placed back in a different position.
  Inspired by the twist for domino tilings, we construct a flip invariant for slab tilings: the \textit{triple twist}, assuming values in $\mathbb{Z}^3$. We show that if the region is a large box then the triple twist assumes a large number of possible values, roughly proportional to the fourth power of the volume. We also give examples of smaller regions for which the set of tilings is connected under flips, so that the triple twist assumes only one value.</description>

      <title>Minimal codes from hypersurfaces in even characteristic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02278v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The setting of projective systems can be used to study the parameters of a projective linear code $\mathcal{C}$. This can be done by considering the intersections of the point set $\Omega$ defined by the columns of a generating matrix for $\mathcal{C}$ with the hyperplanes of a projective space. In particular, $\mathcal{C}$ is minimal if $\Omega$ is cutting, i.e., every hyperplane is spanned by its intersection with $\Omega$. Minimal linear codes have important applications for secret sharing schemes and secure two-party computation. In this article we first investigate the properties of some algebraic hypersurfaces $\mathcal{V}_{\varepsilon}^r$ related to certain quasi-Hermitian varieties of $\mathrm{PG}(r,q^2)$, with $q=2^e$, $e&gt;1$ odd. These varieties give rise to a new infinite family of linear codes which are minimal except for $r=3$ and $e\equiv 1 \pmod 4$. In the case $r \in \{3,4\}$, we exhibit codes having at most 6 non-zero weights whose we provide the complete list. As a byproduct, we obtain $(r+1)$-dimensional codes with just $3$ non-zero weights. We point out that linear codes with few weights are also important in authentication codes and association schemes. In the last part of the paper we consider an extension of the notion of being cutting with respect to subspaces other than hyperplanes and introduce the definition of cutting gap in order to characterize and measure what happens when this property is not satisfied. Finally, we then apply these notions to Hermitian codes and to the codes related to $\mathcal{V}_\varepsilon^r$ discussed before.</description>

Abstract: Let $U$ be a uniform matroid. For all positive integers $n$ and $r$ with $n \ge r$, what is the maximum number of bases of an $n$-element, rank-$r$ matroid without $U$ as a minor? We show that this question arises by restricting the problem of determining the Tur\'an number of a daisy hypergraph to the family of matroid basis hypergraphs. We then answer this question for several interesting choices of $U$.</description>

Abstract: An $\mathbb{F}_q$-linear code of minimum distance $d$ is called complete if it is not contained in a larger $\mathbb{F}_q$-linear code of minimum distance $d$. In this paper, we classify $\mathbb{F}_q$-linear complete symmetric rank-distance (CSRD) codes in $M_{3\times 3}(\mathbb{F}_q)$ up to equivalence. This includes the classification of $\mathbb{F}_q$-linear maximum symmetric rank-distance (MSRD) codes in $M_{3\times 3}(\mathbb{F}_q)$. Our approach is mainly geometric, and our results contribute towards the classification of nets of conics in $\mathrm{PG}(2, q)$.</description>

      <title>Positionality of Dumont--Thomas numeration systems for integers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Introduced in 2001 by Lecomte and Rigo, abstract numeration systems provide a way of expressing natural numbers with words from a language $L$ accepted by a finite automaton. As it turns out, these numeration systems are not necessarily positional, i.e., we cannot always find a sequence $U=(U_i)_{i\ge 0}$ of integers such that the value of every word in the language $L$ is determined by the position of its letters and the first few values of $U$. Finding the conditions under which an abstract numeration system is positional seems difficult in general. In this paper, we thus consider this question for a particular sub-family of abstract numeration systems called Dumont--Thomas numeration systems. They are derived from substitutions and were introduced in 1989 by Dumont and Thomas. We exhibit conditions on the underlying substitution so that the corresponding Dumont--Thomas numeration is positional. We first work in the most general setting, then particularize our results to some practical cases. Finally, we link our numeration systems to existing literature, notably properties studied by R\'{e}nyi in 1957, Parry in 1960, Bertrand-Mathis in 1989, and Fabre in 1995.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2007.08715v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a generalization of Sperner's lemma for a triangulation $T$ of $(m+1)$-discs $D$ whose vertices are colored in $n+2$ colors. A proper coloring of $T$ on the boundary of $D$ determines a simplicial mapping $f:S^m \to S^n$ and the element $x=[f]$ in $\pi_m(S^n)$. For any $x$ in this homotopy group we define a non-negative integer $\mu(x)$. For some cases this invariant can be found explicitly. Namely, if $m=n$ then this number is the Brouwer degree of the mapping $f$. For the case $m=3, n=2$ we found a lower bound for $\mu(x)$, where $x$ is the Hopf invariant, and proved that $\mu(1)=\mu(2)=9$.
  The main result of this paper is the theorem that the number of fully colored $n$-simplexes in $T$ is not less than $\mu([f])$. To prove this theorem we use a generalization of Pontryagin's theorem for manifolds with respect to their boundaries.</description>

      <title>The uniform asymptotics for real double Hurwitz numbers with triple ramification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.03671v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of counting real ramified coverings of the complex projective line $\mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^1$ by real Riemann surfaces of genus $g$, where the ramification profiles over $0$ and $\infty$ are $\lambda$ and $\mu$ respectively, and the ramification profiles over other real branch points consist of either $(3,1,\ldots,1)$ or $(2,1,\ldots,1)$. The solutions to this problem are called real double Hurwitz numbers with triple ramification and are denoted by $H^{\mathbb{R}}_g(\lambda,\mu;\Lambda^-_{s,t},\Lambda^+_{s,t})$.
  We apply a modified version of the tropical computaton developed by Markwig and Rau for real Hurwitz numbers to compute $H^{\mathbb{R}}_g(\lambda,\mu;\Lambda^-_{s,t},\Lambda^+_{s,t})$. Based on a generalization of Rau's zigzag number, we introduce a combinatorial invariant that serves as the lower bound for $H^{\mathbb{R}}_g(\lambda,\mu;\Lambda^-_{s,t},\Lambda^+_{s,t})$. We obtain a uniform lower bound for the large degree and large genus logarithmic asymptotics of these combinatorial invariants. Our uniform lower bound implies the following results. (1). We establish a uniform lower bound for the large degree and large genus logarithmic asymptotics of $H^{\mathbb{R}}_g(\lambda,\mu;\Lambda^-_{s,t},\Lambda^+_{s,t})$ and its complex counterparts. In particular, we give a partial answer to an open question proposed by Dubrovin, Yang and Zagier on the uniform bound for simple Hurwitz numbers. (2). We obtain the logarithmic equivalence between $H^{\mathbb{R}}_g(\lambda,\mu;\Lambda^-_{s,t},\Lambda^+_{s,t})$ and its complex counterparts as the degree tends to infinity and only simple branch points are added. (3). As the genus tends to infinity and only simple branch points are added, we show that the logarithms of $H^{\mathbb{R}}_g(\lambda,\mu;\Lambda^-_{s,t},\Lambda^+_{s,t})$ and its complex counterparts are of the same order.</description>

      <title>The set-theoretic Yang-Baxter equation, Kimura semigroups and functional graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.06700v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the category of solutions of the set-theoretic Yang-Baxter equation of Frobenius-Separability (FS) type is equivalent to the category of pointed Kimura semigroups. As applications, all involutive, idempotent, nondegenerate, surjective, finite order, unitary or indecomposable solutions of FS type are classified. For instance, if $|X| = n$, then the number of isomorphism classes of all such solutions on $X$ that are (a) left non-degenerate, (b) bijective, (c) unitary or (d) indecomposable and left-nondegenerate is: (a) the Davis number $d(n)$, (b) $\sum_{m|n} \, p(m)$, where $p(m)$ is the Euler partition number, (c) $\tau(n) + \sum_{d|n}\left\lfloor \frac d2\right\rfloor$, where $\tau(n)$ is the number of divisors of $n$, or (d) the Harary number $\mathfrak{c} (n)$. The automorphism groups of such solutions can also be recovered as automorphism groups $\mathrm{Aut}(f)$ of sets $X$ equipped with a single endo-function $f:X\to X$. We describe all groups of the form $\mathrm{Aut}(f)$ as iterations of direct and (possibly infinite) wreath products of cyclic or full symmetric groups, characterize the abelian ones as products of cyclic groups, and produce examples of symmetry groups of FS solutions not of the form $\mathrm{Aut}(f)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.09190v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the property of (almost) complete intersection of LSS-ideals of graphs of some special forms, like trees, unicyclic, and bicyclic graphs. Further, we give a sufficient condition for the complete intersection property of twisted LSS-ideals in terms of a new graph theoretical invariant called twisted positive matching decomposition number denoted by tpmd. We also study the regularity of powers of LSS-ideals and make observations related to the Koszul property of the quotients of the same.</description>

      <title>Scalar extensions of quiver representations over $\mathbb{F}_1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $V$ and $W$ be quiver representations over $\mathbb{F}_1$ and let $K$ be a field. The scalar extensions $V^K$ and $W^K$ are quiver representations over $K$ with a distinguished, very well-behaved basis. We construct a basis of $\mathrm{Hom}_{KQ}(V^K,W^K)$ generalising the well-known basis of the morphism spaces between string and tree modules. We use this basis to give a combinatorial characterisation of absolutely indecomposable representations. Furthermore, we show that indecomposable representations with finite nice length are absolutely indecomposable. This answers a question of Jun and Sistko.</description>

      <title>Spread-out percolation on transitive graphs of polynomial growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a vertex-transitive graph of superlinear polynomial growth. Given $r&gt;0$, let $G_r$ be the graph on the same vertex set as $G$, with two vertices joined by an edge if and only if they are at graph distance at most $r$ apart in $G$. We show that the critical probability $p_c(G_r)$ for Bernoulli bond percolation on $G_r$ satisfies $p_c(G_r) \sim 1/\mathrm{deg}(G_r)$ as $r\to\infty$. This extends work of Penrose and Bollob\'as-Janson-Riordan, who considered the case $G=\mathbb{Z}^d$.
  Our result provides an important ingredient in parallel work of Georgakopoulos in which he introduces a new notion of dimension in groups. It also verifies a special case of a conjecture of Easo and Hutchcroft.</description>

      <title>Linear Recurrence Sequence Automata and the Addition of Abstract Numeration Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Abstract numeration systems encode natural numbers using radix ordered words of an infinite regular language and linear recurrence sequences play a key role in their valuation. Sequence automata, which are deterministic finite automata with an additional linear recurrence sequence on each transition, are introduced to compute various $\ZZ$-rational non commutating formal series in abstract numeration systems. Under certain Pisot conditions on the recurrence sequences, the support of these series is regular. This property can be leveraged to derive various synchronized relations including a deterministic finite automaton that computes the addition relation of various Dumont-Thomas numeration systems and regular finite automata converting between various numeration systems. A practical implementation for Walnut is provided.</description>

      <title>Strategies in a mis\`ere two-player tree searching game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyse a misere tree searching game, where players take turns to guess vertices in a tree with a secret `poisoned' vertex. After each turn, the guessed vertex is removed from the tree and the game continues on the component containing the poisoned vertex, and as soon as a player guesses the poisoned vertex, they lose. We describe and prove the solution when the game is played on a path graph, both between two optimal players and between a player who makes their decisions uniformly at random and an opponent who plays to exploit this. We show that, with two perfect players, the solution involves different guessing strategies depending on the value of n modulo 4. We then show that, with a random and an exploitative player, the probability that the exploitative player wins approaches a constant (approximately 0.599) as n increases, and that the vertices one away from the leaves of the path are always optimal guesses for them. We also solve the game played on a star graph, and briefly discuss the possibility for extending the analysis to more general trees.</description>

      <title>The{N/D}-Conjecture for Nonresonant Hyperplane Arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies Bernstein--Sato polynomials $b_{f,0}$ for homogeneous polynomials $f$ of degree $d$ with $n$ variables. It is open to know when $-{n\over d}$ is a root of $b_{f,0}$. For essential indecomposable hyperplane arrangements, this is a conjecture by Budur, Musta\c{t}\u{a} and Teitler and implies the strong topological monodromy conjecture for arrangements. U. Walther gave a sufficient condition that a certain differential form does not vanish in the top cohomology group of Milnor fiber. We use Walther's result to verify the $n\over d$-conjecture for weighted hyperplane arrangements satisfying the nonresonant condition. We also give some essential indecomposable homogeneous polynomials $f$ such that $-{n\over d}$ is not a root of $b_{f,0}$. This leads to a conjectural sufficient condition for $b_{f,0}(-{n\over d})=0$.</description>

      <title>A Permutation-Free Length 3 Decimal Check Digit Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06641v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1969 J. Verhoeff provided the first examples of a decimal error detecting code using a single check digit to provide protection against all single, transposition and adjacent twin errors. The three codes he presented are length 3-digit codes with 2 information digits. Existence of a 4-digit code would imply the existence of 10 such disjoint 3-digit codes. Apparently, not even a pair of such disjoint 3-digit codes is known. The code developed herein, has the property that the knowledge of any two digits is sufficient to determine the entire codeword even though their positions were unknown. This fulfills Verhoeff's desire to eliminate "cyclic errors". Phonetic errors, where 2 digit pairs of the forms X0 and 1X are interchanged, are also eliminated.</description>

      <title>Generalized Hofstadter functions $G$, $H$ and beyond: numeration systems and discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12615v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hofstadter's $G$ function is recursively defined via $G(0)=0$ and then $G(n)=n-G(G(n-1))$. Following Hofstadter, a family $(F_k)$ of similar functions is obtained by varying the number $k$ of nested recursive calls in this equation. We study here some Fibonacci-like sequences that are deeply connected with these functions $F_k$. In particular, the Zeckendorf theorem can be adapted to provide digital expansions via sums of terms of these sequences. On these digital expansions, the functions $F_k$ are acting as right shifts of the digits. These Fibonacci-like sequences can be expressed in terms of zeros of the polynomial $X^k{-}X^{k-1}{-}1$. Considering now the discrepancy of each function $F_k$, i.e., the maximal distance between $F_k$ and its linear equivalent, we retrieve the fact that this discrepancy is finite exactly when $k \le 4$. Thanks to that, we solve two twenty-year-old OEIS conjectures stating how close the functions $F_3$ and $F_4$ are from the integer parts of their linear equivalents. Moreover we establish that $F_k$ can coincide exactly with such an integer part only when $k\le 2$, while $F_k$ is almost additive exactly when $k \le 4$. Finally, a nice fractal shape a la Rauzy has been encountered when investigating the discrepancy of $F_3$. Almost all this article has been formalized and verified in the Coq/Rocq proof assistant.</description>

      <title>Frobenius subalgebra lattices in tensor categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19876v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores Frobenius subalgebra posets within abelian monoidal categories and shows that they form lattices under certain conditions, including all semisimple tensor categories. Furthermore, it extends Watatani's theorem on the finiteness of intermediate subfactors, proving that these lattices are finite under weak positivity constraints, encompassing all semisimple tensor categories as well. The primary tools employed in this paper are semisimplification and a concept of formal angle. Additionally, we have broadened several intermediate results, such as the exchange relation theorem and Landau's theorem, to apply to abelian monoidal categories. Key applications of our findings include a stronger version of the Ino-Watatani result: we show that the finiteness of intermediate C*-algebras holds in a finite-index unital irreducible inclusion of C*-algebras without requiring the simple assumption. Moreover, for a finite-dimensional semisimple Hopf algebra H, we demonstrate that H* contains a finite number of Frobenius subalgebra objects in Rep(H). Finally, we explore a range of applications, including abstract spin chains, vertex operator algebras, and speculations on quantum arithmetic involving the generalization of Ore's theorem, Euler's totient and sigma functions, and RH.</description>

      <title>Upper tail bounds for irregular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note we consider the upper tail large deviations of subgraph counts for irregular graphs $\mathrm{H}$ in $\mathbb{G}(n,p)$, the sparse Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph on $n$ vertices with edge connectivity probability $p \in (0,1)$. For $n^{-1/\Delta} \ll p \ll 1$, where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree of $\mathrm{H}$, we derive the upper tail large deviations for any irregular graph $\mathrm{H}$. On the other hand, we show that for $p$ such that $1 \ll n^{v_\mathrm{H}} p^{e_\mathrm{H}} \ll (\log n)^{\alpha^{*}_{\mathrm{H}}/\left(\alpha^{*}_{\mathrm{H}}-1\right)}$, where $v_\mathrm{H}$ and $e_\mathrm{H}$ denote the number of vertices and edges of $\mathrm{H}$, and $\alpha^*_{\mathrm{H}}$ denotes the fractional independence number, the upper tail large deviations of the number of unlabelled copies of $\mathrm{H}$ in $\mathbb{G}(n,p)$ is given by that of a sequence of Poisson random variables with diverging mean. Restricting to the $r$-armed star graph we further prove a localized behavior in the intermediate range of $p$ (left open by the above two results) and show that the mean-field approximation is asymptotically tight for the logarithm of the upper tail probability.</description>
