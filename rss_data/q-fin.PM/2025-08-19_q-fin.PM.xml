      <title>Optimal Portfolio Construction -- A Reinforcement Learning Embedded Bayesian Hierarchical Risk Parity (RL-BHRP) Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a two-level, learning-based portfolio method (RL-BHRP) that spreads risk across sectors and stocks, and adjusts exposures as market conditions change. Using U.S. Equities from 2012 to mid-2025, we design the model using 2012 to 2019 data, and evaluate it out-of-sample from 2020 to 2025 against a sector index built from exchange-traded funds and a static risk-balanced portfolio. Over the test window, the adaptive portfolio compounds wealth by approximately 120 percent, compared with 101 percent for the static comparator and 91 percent for the sector benchmark. The average annual growth is roughly 15 percent, compared to 13 percent and 12 percent, respectively. Gains are achieved without significant deviations from the benchmark and with peak-to-trough losses comparable to those of the alternatives, indicating that the method adds value while remaining diversified and investable. Weight charts show gradual shifts rather than abrupt swings, reflecting disciplined rebalancing and the cost-aware design. Overall, the results support risk-balanced, adaptive allocation as a practical approach to achieving stronger and more stable long-term performance.</description>

      <title>High order universal portfolios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13564v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Cover universal portfolio (UP from now on) has many interesting theoretical and numerical properties and was investigated for a long time. Building on it, we explore what happens when we add this UP to the market as a new synthetic asset and construct by recurrence higher order UPs. We investigate some important theoretical properties of the high order UPs and show in particular that they are indeed different from the Cover UP and are capable to break the time permutation invariance. We show that under some perturbation regime the second high order UP has better Sharp ratio than the standard UP and briefly investigate arbitrage opportunities thus created. Numerical experiences on a benchmark from the literature confirm that high order UPs improve Cover's UP performances.</description>
