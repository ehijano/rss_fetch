      <title>Contrasting results of surface metrology techniques for three-dimensional human fingerprints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fingerprints, otherwise known as dermatoglyphs, are most commonly thought of in the context of identification, but have myriad other roles in human biology. They are formed by the restricted ability of ridges and furrows of the epidermis to flatten. The patterns these ridges and furrows make can be represented as 2D fingerprints, but also as 3D structures with cross-sectional shapes that may add new levels of detail to identification, forensic, and behavioral uses/studies. Surface metrology techniques better allow for the quantification of these features, though it is unclear what tool and what scale is most appropriate. A Sensofar S Neox white light reflectance confocal microscope and a Gelsight Mobile 2 were used to independently measure the surface roughness of the fingerprints of four individuals from preserved cadaveric remains. Scale-sensitive fractal analyses (SSFA) were performed on the data from the S Neox (a small area), Gelsight (a larger area), and the same Gelsight datasets cropped down to the size of the S Neox scan size. Though fewer SSFA parameters identified differences between individuals from the smaller, extracted Gelsight area, all three forms of measurement found significant differences between some individuals from the study. No significant differences were found that differ between fingers themselves. Though only an initial step, these data suggest that a variety of surface metrology techniques may be useful in differentiating individuals.</description>

      <title>A comparative analysis of metamodels for lumped cardiovascular models, and pipeline for sensitivity analysis, parameter estimation, and uncertainty quantification</title>

Abstract: Zero-dimensional (0D) cardiovascular models are reduced-order models used to study global circulation dynamics and transport. They provide estimates of biomarkers (such as pressure, flow rates, and concentrations) for surgery planning and boundary conditions for high-fidelity 3D models. Although their computational cost is low, tasks like parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification require many model evaluations, making them computationally expensive. This motivates building metamodels. In this work, we propose a pipeline from 0D models to metamodel building for tasks such as sensitivity analysis, parameter estimation, and uncertainty quantification. Three strategies are explored: Neural Networks, Polynomial Chaos Expansion, and Gaussian Processes, applied to three different 0D models. The first model predicts portal vein pressure after surgery, considering liver hemodynamics and global circulation. The second simulates whole-body circulation under pulmonary arterial hypertension before and after shunt insertion. The third assesses organ blood perfusion after revascularization surgery, focusing on contrast agent transport, requiring specific metamodel treatment. Metamodels are trained and tested on synthetic data. Neural networks proved the most efficient in terms of result quality, computational time, and ease for parameter estimation, sensitivity analysis, and uncertainty quantification. Finally, we demonstrate the full pipeline with a neural network as the emulator.</description>

      <title>Non-local impact of distal airway constrictions on patterns of inhaled particle deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03760v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Airway constriction and blockage in obstructive lung diseases cause ventilation heterogeneity and create barriers to effective drug deposition. Established computational particle-deposition models have not accounted for these impacts of disease. We present a new particle-deposition model that calculates ventilation based on the resistance of each airway, such that ventilation responds to airway constriction. The model incorporates distal airway constrictions representative of cystic fibrosis, allowing us to investigate the resulting impact on patterns of deposition. Unlike previous models, our model predicts how constrictions affect deposition in airways throughout the lungs, not just in the constricted airways. Deposition is reduced in airways directly distal and proximal to constrictions. When constrictions are clustered together, central-airways deposition can increase significantly in regions away from constrictions, but distal-airways deposition in those regions remains largely unchanged. We use our model to calculate lung clearance index (LCI), a clinical measure of ventilation heterogeneity, after applying constrictions of varying severities in one lobe. We find an increase in LCI coinciding with significantly reduced deposition in the affected lobe. Our results show how the model provides a framework for development of computational tools that capture the impacts of airway disease, which could significantly affect predictions of regional dosing.</description>
