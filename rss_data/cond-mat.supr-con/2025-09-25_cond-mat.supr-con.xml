      <title>Revisiting dissipation-driven phase transition in a Josephson junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite extensive experimental and theoretical work over several decades, Schmid-Bulgadaev quantum phase transition remains a subject of debate. Here we revisit this problem by performing systematic experiments on low-frequency current-voltage characteristics of Josephson junctions over a wide range of parameters. The experiments are conducted in a true resistive environment formed by a metallic on-chip resistor located near the junction. Over the parameter range of the experiment, we find that the transition occurs when the resistance crosses the quantum value $h/(4e^2)\simeq 6.5$ k$\Omega$ for Cooper pairs, as originally predicted. The temperature $T$ of the experiment is naturally non-zero, but our basic theoretical modeling corroborates that the observations under these conditions can serve as the basis for the conclusions made, in particular, the crossover resistance from superconducting to insulating regime is the same as that at $T=0$.</description>

      <title>Effect of C additives with 0.5% in weight on structural, optical and superconducting properties of Ta-Nb-Hf-Zr-Ti high entropy alloy films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the superconducting (SC) properties of Ta-Nb-Hf-Zr-Ti high-entropy alloy (HEA) thin films with 0.5% weight C additives. The C additives stabilize the structural properties and enhance the SC critical properties, including $\mu_0$Hc$_2$ (13.45 T) and Tc (7.5 K). The reflectance of the C-added HEA film is enhanced in the low-energy region, resulting in a higher optical conductivity, which is consistent with the lower electrical resistivity. In addition, we observed SC vortices in the C-added HEA film using magnetic force microscopy. The magnetic penetration depths ($\lambda$) of the pure HEA and C-added HEA films were estimated from their Meissner force curves by comparing them with those of a reference Nb film. At 4.2 K, the {\lambda} of the C-added film is 360 nm, shorter than that of the pure HEA film (560 nm), indicating stronger superconductivity against an applied magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Distinct orbital contributions to electronic and magnetic structures in La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-T$_c$ superconductivity has recently been discovered in Ruddlesden-Popper phase nickelates under pressure, where the low-energy electronic structure is dominated by Ni $d_{x^2 - y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals. However, the respective roles of these orbitals in superconductivity remain unclear. Here, by combining X-ray absorption, electron energy loss spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations on La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$ single crystals, we identify ligand holes in the $p_{x,y}$ orbitals of planar oxygen and the $p_z$ orbitals of apical oxygen, which hybridize with the Ni $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals, respectively. These ligand holes enable orbital-selective O K-edge resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) study, which reveals that $d_{x^2-y^2}$ states dominate the low-energy charge excitations and are more itinerant. We also observe a $\sim$0.1 eV bimagnon through RIXS and Raman spectroscopy, which leads to an interlayer superexchange interaction J$_z$ of $\sim$50 meV. Our results reveal distinct contributions of Ni $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals to the electronic and magnetic structure and provide direct experimental insights to understand the RP-phase nickelate superconductors.</description>

      <title>Ambient-pressure superconductivity above 22 K in hole-doped YB2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies of hydrogen-dominant (superhydride) materials, such as LaH10 have led to putative discoveries of near-room temperature superconductivity at high pressures, with a superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of 250 K observed at 170 GPa. While these findings are promising, achieving such high superconductivity requires challenging experimental conditions typically exceeding 100 GPa. In this study, we utilize first-principles calculations and Migdal-Eliashberg theory to examine the superconducting properties of the stable boron-based compound YB2 at atmospheric pressure, where yttrium and boron atoms form a layered structure. Our results indicate that YB2 exhibits a Tc of 2.14 K at 0 GPa. We find that doping with additional electrons (0 to 0.3) leads to a monotonic decrease in Tc as the electron concentration increases. Conversely, introducing holes significantly enhances Tc, raising it to 22.83 K. Although our findings do not surpass the superconducting temperature of the well-known MgB2, our doping strategy highlights a method for tuning electron-phonon coupling strength in metal borides. This insight could be valuable for future experi-mental applications. Overall, this study not only deepens our understanding of YB2 superconducting properties but also contributes to the ongoing search for high-temperature superconductors.</description>

      <title>Field-resilient superconducting coplanar waveguide resonators made of Nb, NbTi, and NbTiN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting coplanar waveguide (SCPW) resonators with high internal quality factors (\Q_i) are essential for quantum information applications, but suffer severe Qi degradation under magnetic fields due to quasiparticle generation and vortex-induced losses. We fabricated and characterized Nb, NbTi, and NbTiN SCPW resonators with varying film thicknesses under different temperatures and in-plane magnetic fields (\(B_{\parallel}\)). Temperature-dependent transmission measurements agree well with Mattis-Bardeen theory, revealing kinetic inductance parameters. Comparative analysis shows that 45-nm-thick NbTi resonators maintain \(Q_i = 1.01 \times 10^{4}\) at (\(B_{\parallel}\)) = 0.4 T, satisfying the dual requirements of high Qi and strong field resilience. Owing to its moderate kinetic inductance and compatibility with conventional photolithography, NbTi emerges as a practical material platform for field-resilient SCPW resonators and hybrid quantum circuits operating in magnetic environments.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature superconductivity in ultra-thin carbon nanotube zeolite composites: a conventional or unconventional superconductor?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent report of signs of room-temperature superconductivity in ultrathin single-walled carbon nanotubes (CNT) of types (2,1) and (3,0) holds significant promise for energy applications due to their ability to conduct current without dissipation. However, the McMillan Tc formula fails to calculate their superconducting transition temperatures (Tc) accurately, which raises an important question: what is the pairing mechanism driving their room-temperature superconductivity? To explore this further, we first investigate whether the strong curvature of ultrathin CNT leads to exotic phenomena in unconventional superconductors. If no evidence of these exotic characteristics is found and the McMillan formalism indicates that it is not a BCS-type superconductor, could we be observing a new class of unconventional superconductivity that functions independently of phonons and typical exotic features? In this paper, we demonstrate that factors such as the chiral angle of CNT, boron dopants and lattice regularity can be used to tune the theoretical Tc to experimental values. Our finding suggests that combining CNT with a harder substrate could be vital for further enhancing Tc while minimizing lattice distortion under doping. We propose a reconsideration of the common belief regarding whether the McMillan and BCS Tc formulas are adequate for classifying materials as BCS or non-BCS superconductors.</description>

      <title>Disorder-induced fractionalization of pair density waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of disorder on a system that in the clean limit is a pair density wave (PDW) superconductor. The charge order of the clean PDW is inevitably lost (via Imry-Ma), but the fate of the superconducting order is less clear. Here, we consider a strongly inhomogeneous limit in which the system consists of a random collection of PDW puddles embedded in a metallic background. When the puddles are dilute, they become phase coherent at low temperatures, resulting in a state that is macroscopically equivalent to a charge-$2e$ $s$-wave superconductor. This can be viewed as an example of ``order parameter fractionalization'' -- the PDW order splits into a charge-2e s-wave superconductor and a charge density wave, the latter of which is destroyed by disorder -- and stands in contrast to the ``vestigial'' charge-4e superconductivity which has been proposed to arise in weakly disordered PDWs.</description>

      <title>Uniaxial negative thermal expansion in a weak-itinerant-ferromagnetic phase of CoZr$_{2}$H$_{3.49}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discovered unique uniaxial negative thermal expansion (NTE) behavior for a weak-itinerant-ferromagnetic phase of CoZr$_{2}$H$_{3.49}$. CoZr$_{2}$ is known as a superconductor exhibiting uniaxial NTE along the $c$-axis, which is called anomalous thermal expansion (ATE). Additionally, CoZr$_{2}$ is also known as a well-absorbent of hydrogen, and hydrogen insertion raises weak-itinerant ferromagnetism instead of superconductivity. However, the influence of hydrogen insertion on ATE behavior in this system is still unclear. To investigate it, we performed powder synchrotron X-ray diffraction (SXRD) for CoZr$_{2}$H$_{3.49}$. Through Arrott plots analysis, we determined the Curie temperature ($T_{\mathrm{C}}$) to be 139 K, and the Rhodes-Wohlfarth ratio was estimated to be 3.49, which clearly exceeds 1, suggesting the itinerancy of emerging ferromagnetism. Temperature dependencies of lattice constants $a$ and $c$ were extracted from powder SXRD analyses, and we revealed that lattice constant $c$ exhibited NTE behavior below $T_{\mathrm{C}}$. The uniaxial NTE behavior along the $c$-axis can be understood by sharpening an antibonding Co3$dz^{2}$ partial density of states near the Fermi level, linked to the expansion of a one-dimensional Co-Co chain running parallel to the $c$-axis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.11769v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of easy-axis metamagnetic crossover on superconductivity in UTe$_2$ along the $a$-axis through measurements of AC susceptibility, magnetization, and the magnetocaloric effect. In ultra-clean single crystals, we identify a field-induced phase transition within the superconducting state at 5.6 T, driven by metamagnetism. This transition leads to a high-field superconducting state, significantly increasing the upper critical field to 12 T. A sudden increase in entropy at the transition suggests a self-reconstruction of the order parameter, enabling multi-component superconducting states to adapt to external perturbations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum matter phases may co-exist microscopically even when they display competing tendencies. A fundamental question is whether such a competition can be avoided through the elimination of one phase while the other one condenses into the ground state. Here, we present a high-resolution neutron spectroscopy study of the low-energy spin excitations in the high-temperature superconductor La1.855Sr0.145CuO4. In the normal state, we find low-energy magnetic fluctuations at incommensurate reciprocal lattice positions where spin-density-wave order emerges at lower Sr concentration or at high magnetic fields. While these spin excitations are largely suppressed by the emergence of the superconducting spin gap, some low-energy magnetic fluctuations persist deep inside the superconducting state. We interpret this result in terms of a dynamic competition between superconductivity and magnetism, where superconductivity impedes the condensation of low-energy magnetic fluctuations through the formation of magnetically-mediated Cooper pairs.</description>

      <title>Manipulation of Majorana wave packets at surfaces of nodal noncentrosymmetric superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nodal noncentrosymmetric superconductors can host zero-energy flat bands of Majorana surface states within the projection of the nodal lines onto the surface Brillouin zone. Thus, these systems can have stationary, localized Majorana wave packets on certain surfaces, which may be a promising platform for quantum computation. Such applications require protocols to manipulate the wave packets in order to move them without destroying their localization or coherence. As a step in this direction, we explore the idea that the surface states have a nontrivial spin polarization, which can couple for example to the magnetization of a ferromagnetic insulator in contact to the surface, via an exchange term in the Hamiltonian. Such a coupling can make the previously flat bands weakly dispersive. We aim to model the motion of spatially localized wave packets under the influence of an exchange field which is changed adiabatically. We calculate the time-evolved wave packet for a model system and discuss which factors influence the direction of motion and the broadening of the wave packet.</description>

      <title>Probing Vortex Dynamics in 2D Superconductors with Scanning Quantum Microscope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The visualization of the magnetic responses of a two-dimensional (2D) superconducting material on the nanoscale is a powerful approach to unravel the underlying supercurrent behavior and to investigate critical phenomena in reduced dimensions. In this study, scanning quantum microscopy is utilized to explore the local magnetic response of the 2D superconductor 2H-NbSe2. Our technique enables both static and dynamic sensing of superconducting vortices with high sensitivity and a spatial resolution down to 30 nm, unveiling unexpected phenomena linked to the intrinsic 2D nature of the superconductor, which are challenging to detect with more conventional local probes. Vortices do not arrange in a hexagonal lattice, but form a distorted vortex glass with expanding vortex size. A vortex can exhibit strong local dynamics due to thermal excitation. As the critical temperature is approached, a clear melting of the vortex glass is identified, leading to distinct configurations under different cooling conditions. Vortex fluctuations can also be probed through spin Hahn-echo measurements, which reveal the spin decoherence even well below the critical temperature -- and, intriguingly, enhanced decoherence at lower temperatures. Spatiotemporal microscopy of the magnetic dynamics associated with vortex excitations and fluctuations provides direct evidence of 2D superconducting phenomena at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Model for missing Shapiro steps due to bias-dependent resistance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2106.00495v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Majorana zero modes are predicted in several solid state systems such as hybrid superconductor-semiconductor structures and topological insulators coupled to superconductors. One of the expected signatures of Majorana modes is the fractional 4$\pi$ Josephson effect. Evidence in favor of this effect often comes from a.c. Josephson effect measurements and focuses on the observation of missing first or higher odd-numbered Shapiro steps. However, the disappearance of the odd Shapiro steps has also been reported in conventional Josephson junctions where no Majorana modes are expected. In this paper, we present a phenomenological model that displays suppression of the odd Shapiro steps. We perform resistively-shunted junction model calculations and introduce peaks in differential resistance as function of the bias current. In the presence of only the standard 2$\pi$ Josephson current, for chosen values of peak positions and amplitudes, we can suppress the odd Shapiro steps, or any steps, thus providing a possible explanation for the observation of missing Shapiro steps.</description>

Abstract: It is generally believed that electronic correlation, geometric frustration, and topology, \textit{individually}, can facilitate the emergence of various intriguing properties that have attracted a broad audience for both fundamental research and potential applications. Here, we report a series of unconventional Hall effects observed in a \textit{single} compound - quasi-kagome Kondo Weyl semimetal candidate Ce$_3$TiSb$_5$. In the paramagnetic phase, signature of dynamic $c$-$f$ hybridization is revealed by a reduction of anomalous Hall effect and is connected to frustration-promoted incoherent Kondo scattering. A large topological Hall effect exceeding 0.2 $\mu\Omega\cdot$cm is found at low temperatures, which should be ascribed to the non-collinear magnetic texture. In addition, a peculiar loop-shaped Hall effect with switching chirality is also seen, which is inferred to be associated with magnetic domain walls that pin history-dependent spin chirality and / or Fermi-arc surface states projected from the in-gap Weyl nodes. These exotic results place Ce$_3$TiSb$_5$ in a regime of highly-frustrated antiferromagnetic dense Kondo lattice with a nontrivial topology on an ``extended" global phase diagram, and highlight the interplay among electronic correlation, geometric frustration and topology.</description>
