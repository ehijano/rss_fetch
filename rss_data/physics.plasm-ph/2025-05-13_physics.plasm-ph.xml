      <title>Demonstration of full-scale spatio-temporal diagnostics of solid-density plasmas driven by an ultra-short relativistic laser pulse using an X-ray free-electron laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the complex plasma dynamics in ultra-intense relativistic laser-solid interactions is of fundamental importance to the applications of laser plasma-based particle accelerators, creation of high energy-density matter, understanding of planetary science and laser-driven fusion energy. However, experimental efforts in this regime have been limited by the accessibility of over-critical density and spatio-temporal resolution of conventional diagnostics. Over the last decade, the advent of femtosecond brilliant hard X-ray free electron lasers (XFELs) is opening new horizons to break these limitations. Here, for the first time we present full-scale spatio-temporal measurements of solid-density plasma dynamics, including preplasma generation with tens of nanometer-scale length driven by the leading edge of a relativistic laser pulse, ultrafast heating and ionization at the main pulse arrival, laser-driven blast shock waves and transient surface return current-induced compression dynamics up to hundreds of picoseconds after interaction. These observations are enabled by utilizing a novel combination of advanced X-ray diagnostics such as small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), resonant X-ray emission spectroscopy (RXES), and propagation-based X-ray phase-contrast imaging (XPCI) simultaneously at the European XFEL-HED beamline station.</description>

      <title>The CHIMERAS Project: Design Framework for the Collisionless HIgh-beta Magnetized Experiment Researching Astrophysical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From the near-Earth solar wind to the intracluster medium of galaxy clusters, collisionless, high-beta, magnetized plasmas pervade our universe. Energy and momentum transport from large-scale fields and flows to small scale motions of plasma particles is ubiquitous in these systems, but a full picture of the underlying physical mechanisms remains elusive. The transfer is often mediated by a turbulent cascade of Alfv{\'e}nic fluctuations as well as a variety of kinetic instabilities; these processes tend to be multi-scale and/or multi-dimensional, which makes them difficult to study using spacecraft missions and numerical simulations alone (Dorfman et al. 2023; Lichko et al. 2020, 2023). Meanwhile, existing laboratory devices struggle to produce the collisionless, high ion beta ($\beta_i \gtrsim 1$), magnetized plasmas across the range of scales necessary to address these problems. As envisioned in recent community planning documents (Carter et al. 2020; Milchberg and Scime 2020; Baalrud et al. 2020; Dorfman et al. 2023; National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine 2024, it is therefore important to build a next generation laboratory facility to create a $\beta_i \gtrsim 1$, collisionless, magnetized plasma in the laboratory for the first time. A Working Group has been formed and is actively defining the necessary technical requirements to move the facility towards a construction-ready state. Recent progress includes the development of target parameters and diagnostic requirements as well as the identification of a need for source-target device geometry. As the working group is already leading to new synergies across the community, we anticipate a broad community of users funded by a variety of federal agencies (including NASA, DOE, and NSF) to make copious use of the future facility.</description>

      <title>Can electrostatic stresses affect charged water structures in weakly ionized plasmas?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This theoretical and numerical study investigates the impact of electrostatic stresses on the shape of charged water structures (grains) in weakly ionized plasmas. We developed an analytic model to predict the conditions under which a grain in a plasma is deformed. We find that electrostatic stresses can overcome the opposing surface tension stresses on nanometer-scale grains, causing initially spherical clusters to elongate and become ellipsoidal. The exact size limit of the grain for which electrostatic stress will dominate depends on the floating potential, surface tension, and local radius of curvature. Clusters larger than this limit are not affected by electrostatic stresses due to an insufficient number of electrons on the surface. The model is compared to Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations performed with a calculated solvated electron potential on initially spherical grains of 2.5 nm radius charged with 0.5 to 1% electrons. We find excellent agreement between MD simulations and the analytic theory. We also carried out Quantum Mechanics (QM) computations showing that the surface tension increases with decreasing size of the water molecule cluster and increases even more with the addition of solvated electrons. This increase in surface tension can hinder the elongation of the grains. Our QM computations also show that on the nanosecond time scale, the binding force of electrons to water molecule clusters is stronger than the electrostatic repulsion between adjacent electrons, and thus the cluster behaves as an insulator. However, consideration of the very small conductivity of ice shows that on time scales of a fraction of a second, ice clusters behave as conductors, so their surface may be considered to be at an equipotential.</description>

      <title>A Tale of Two Polarization Paradoxes I: the Diamagnetic Polarization Paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An accurate calculation of the total polarization charge density in a plasma is essential for a self-consistent determination of the electric field. Yet, for a magnetized plasma, there are two different polarization paradoxes that are finally resolved in this work. The "diamagnetic polarization paradox'' refers to the fact that there is a paradoxical factor of 1/2 difference between the pressure-driven "diamagnetic polarization'' density calculated using the real space drift theory versus the action-angle space guiding center and gyrokinetic theory that has not been explained before. In this work, it is shown that the results of both approaches can be made consistent with one another. Half of the diamagnetic polarization is due to the transformation from the guiding center density to the real space density. The other half is due to the fact that, within the drift kinetic ordering assumptions, the guiding center density should be expressed as the gyroaverage of the density in the limit of vanishing Larmor radius. Expressions for the diamagnetic polarization density are given that are accurate to first order in amplitude and all orders in gyroradius within gyrokinetic theory for a constant magnetic field. Applications to anisotropic Maxwell-Boltzmann particle distribution functions are presented. Because the total energy and toroidal momentum are local invariants, they do not generate net polarization effects: the electric and thermodynamic polarizations must precisely cancel. In contrast, anisotropic dependance on the magnetic moment generates a net polarization proportional to the temperature anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Reduction of multiple filamentation due to atmospheric turbulence during the propagation of a laser pulse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple filamentation poses a significant challenge for laser pulse propagation in the atmosphere. This article investigates how atmospheric turbulence influences the development of modulational instability, which leads to multiple filamentations. Through various analytical approaches, we demonstrate that the growth rate of this instability decreases when the refractive index exhibits stochastic behavior.</description>

      <title>Axisymmetric Coil Winding Surfaces for Non-Axisymmetric Fusion Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellarators are fusion energy devices that confine a plasma using non-axisymmetric magnetic fields. Complex coils with tight construction tolerances are needed to create such fields. To simplify such coils, we use a method here to create filamentary curves bounded to a coil winding surface. This approach bypasses the need to find contours of the current potential in that surface while allowing gradients to be obtained for both the winding surface and the coil shapes. The parameterization of the coil curves allows the modeling of both modular and helical coils. As an application, we optimize a set of coils to reproduce a quasisymmetric stellarator equilibrium. A comparison is performed between coils parameterized in two different winding surfaces, namely an axisymmetric circular toroidal surface and a surface rescaled from the plasma boundary. Finally, an analysis is performed on the optimal distance between the plasma and the coil winding surface.</description>

      <title>Ion energy distributions from the impact of an atmospheric dielectric barrier discharge plasma jet on surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ion energy distribution functions (IEDF) have been measured for a helium atmospheric pressure dielectric barrier discharge jet expanding into the air and impacting a metal or ceramic surface. The plasma jet produces ionization waves as guided positive streamers that reach the surface. Molecular beam mass spectrometry (MBMS) with an energy filter has been used to monitor the IEDFs at a distance of 1.5 cm from the dielectric barrier discharge plasma jet exit. The species are sampled from the supersonic expanding helium beam passing into the MBMS through a 40 $\mu$m (metal) or a 50 $\mu$m (ceramic) diameter orifice. N$_2^+$, O$_2^+$, NO$^+$, O$_3^+$ and water cluster ions (H$_2$O)$_n$H$^+$ (n=1...4) are abundantly produced in the discharge. The analysis of the time-resolved IEDFs reveals that all ions are predominantly sampled at a reference energy $E_{\rm beam}$ when using the metallic orifice. This energy $E_{\rm beam}$ is determined by the seeding of the ions into the supersonic expanding helium beam into the MBMS. After the impact of the streamer, an afterglow of 10 $\mu$s is observed when ions are continuously sampled at an energy higher than $E_{\rm beam}$ by a few 0.1 eVs. This is resolved by postulating a positive space-charge region in front of a positively charged surface. The temporal sequence of the ion impact is consistent with reaction schemes in air plasmas, where O$_2^+$ and N$_2^+$ are created before the formation of NO and O$_3$, as well as larger water cluster ions.</description>

      <title>Decimetric Type-IV Radio Bursts of Solar Flares Induced by Electron Cyclotron Maser Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The radiation mechanism of decimetric wideband and pulsating radio bursts from the Sun (in terms of decimetric type-IV (t-IVdm) burst) and other flaring stars is a long-standing problem. Early investigations were based on the leading-spot hypothesis for the sun and yielded contradictory results. Here we provide essential evidence to support the scenario that these bursts are induced by the electron cyclotron maser emission (ECME) driven by energetic electrons mirrored in converging sunspot fields. This is done by analyzing 2 flare-associated t-IVdm bursts that are selected from a larger sample of 60 bursts recorded during 2010-2014, according to the levels of polarization and whether the source-field orientation can be unambiguously determined. We further modeled the transport of downward-streaming energetic electrons along a coronal loop and found most electrons get mirrored within the specific altitude range of 20-100 Mm. This explains why such bursts tend to have well-defined spectral ranges. The study greatly expands the application of ECME in solar radio astronomy and provides solar samples for similar bursts from other flaring stars.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Magnetotail from Low Altitudes: Evolution of Energetic Electron Flux During the Substorm Growth Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magnetospheric substorm, which plays a crucial role in flux and energy transport across Earth's magnetosphere, features the formation of a thin, elongated current sheet in the magnetotail during its growth phase. This phase is characterized by a decrease in the equatorial magnetic field Bz and the stretching of magnetic field lines. Observing these large-scale magnetic field reconfigurations is challenging with single-point satellite measurements, which provides only spatially-localized snapshots of system dynamics. Conversely, low-altitude spacecraft measurements of energetic electron fluxes, such as those from ELFIN, offer a unique opportunity to remotely sense the equatorial magnetic field in the magnetotail during substorms by measuring the latitudinal variations of energetic electron isotropic fluxes. Because of strong scattering caused by the curvature of magnetic field lines, energetic electrons in the magnetotail are mostly isotropic. Consequently, variations in their fluxes at low altitudes are expected to reflect the reconfiguration of the magnetotail magnetic field. To better understand the connection of electron flux variation at low altitudes and magnetic field reconfiguration during substorms, we compared low-altitude ELFIN observations with simulations from the Rice Convection Model (RCM). The RCM, which assumes fully isotropic electron distributions, provides a robust framework for describing energetic electron dynamics in the plasma sheet and determining the self-consistent magnetic field configuration during substorms. The comparison of ELFIN observations and RCM simulations confirms our interpretation of electron flux dynamics at low altitudes during the substorm growth phase and validates the use of such observations to infer magnetotail dynamics during substorms.</description>

      <title>Upper Limit of Electron Energization in the Near-Earth Plasma Sheet during Substorm Injections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Earth's magnetotail, located on the night side of the magnetosphere, is a dynamic region where magnetic field energy is released and converted into plasma heating, particle acceleration, and kinetic energy through magnetic reconnection. Recent low-altitude observations from the CIRBE CubeSat reveal that the efficiency of particle acceleration in the magnetotail can be high enough to produce relativistic and ultra-relativistic electrons with energies reaching several MeV. To investigate the underlying acceleration mechanisms, we used the Rice Convection Model (RCM) to simulate the observed magnetotail electron populations. The simulations successfully reproduced key features of CIRBE observations, including the spectral shape and energy range of accelerated electrons. This agreement between RCM results and CIRBE observations offers crucial insights into the physical processes responsible for extreme electron acceleration events in the magnetotail.</description>

      <title>Measurement of directional muon beams generated at the Berkeley Lab Laser Accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the detection of directional muon beams produced using a PW laser at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The muon source is a multi-GeV electron beam generated in a 30 cm laser plasma accelerator interacting with a high-Z converter target. The GeV photons resulting from the interaction are converted into a high-flux, directional muon beam via pair production. By employing scintillators to capture delayed events, we were able to identify the produced muons and characterize the source. Using theoretical knowledge of the muon production process combined with simulations that are in excellent agreement with the experiments, we demonstrate that the multi-GeV electron beams produce GeV-scale muons in numbers far exceeding those from cosmic background. Laser-plasma-accelerator-based muon sources can therefore enhance muon imaging applications thanks to their compactness, directionality, and high yields, which reduce the exposure time by orders of magnitude compared to cosmic ray muons. Using the Geant4-based simulation code we developed to gain insight into the experimental results, we can design future experiments and applications based on LPA-generated muons.</description>

      <title>Exploratory study of liquid metal response to rapid variation of applied magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02699v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transient plasma events, such as plasma disruptions, are anticipated in the future magnetic-confinement nuclear fusion reactors. The events are accompanied by a rapid change in the magnetic field generated by the plasma current and, accordingly, induction of strong eddy currents and Lorentz forces within the reactor structure. This work targets processes within liquid-metal components of the reactor's breeding blankets. Order-of-magnitude analysis and {exploratory} numerical simulations are performed to understand the response of liquid metal to a rapidly changing magnetic field and to evaluate the accuracy of commonly used simplifying model assumptions. The response is found to consist of two stages: an initial brief stage ($\sim 1$ ms) characterized by a rapid increase in the induced currents, forces, and fluid velocity; and a subsequent stage, which is triggered by the growing velocity of the metal and marked by reversals of Lorentz force, and oscillations and decreases in the amplitude of the induced fields. The transition to the second stage sets the upper limit of the velocity ($\sim 0.5$ m/s in our tests), to which an initially quiescent metal can be accelerated during the event. The simulations indicate that many widely used model assumptions, such as the negligible role of Joule dissipation in the heat balance and the constancy of physical property coefficients, remain valid during the response. However, the assumption of liquid metal incompressibility is found to be questionable due to the potential significant effects of pressure waves.</description>
