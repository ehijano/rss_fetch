      <title>Deep image-based Adaptive BRDF Measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient and accurate measurement of the bi-directional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) plays a key role in high quality image rendering and physically accurate sensor simulation. However, obtaining the reflectance properties of a material is both time-consuming and challenging. This paper presents a novel method for minimizing the number of samples required for high quality BRDF capture using a gonio-reflectometer setup. Taking an image of the physical material sample as input a lightweight neural network first estimates the parameters of an analytic BRDF model, and the distribution of the sample locations. In a second step we use an image based loss to find the number of samples required to meet the accuracy required. This approach significantly accelerates the measurement process while maintaining a high level of accuracy and fidelity in the BRDF representation.</description>

      <title>Shrinking: Reconstruction of Parameterized Surfaces from Signed Distance Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel method for reconstructing explicit parameterized surfaces from Signed Distance Fields (SDFs), a widely used implicit neural representation (INR) for 3D surfaces. While traditional reconstruction methods like Marching Cubes extract discrete meshes that lose the continuous and differentiable properties of INRs, our approach iteratively contracts a parameterized initial sphere to conform to the target SDF shape, preserving differentiability and surface parameterization throughout. This enables downstream applications such as texture mapping, geometry processing, animation, and finite element analysis. Evaluated on the typical geometric shapes and parts of the ABC dataset, our method achieves competitive reconstruction quality, maintaining smoothness and differentiability crucial for advanced computer graphics and geometric deep learning applications.</description>

      <title>Robust Symmetry Detection via Riemannian Langevin Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetries are ubiquitous across all kinds of objects, whether in nature or in man-made creations. While these symmetries may seem intuitive to the human eye, detecting them with a machine is nontrivial due to the vast search space. Classical geometry-based methods work by aggregating "votes" for each symmetry but struggle with noise. In contrast, learning-based methods may be more robust to noise, but often overlook partial symmetries due to the scarcity of annotated data. In this work, we address this challenge by proposing a novel symmetry detection method that marries classical symmetry detection techniques with recent advances in generative modeling. Specifically, we apply Langevin dynamics to a redefined symmetry space to enhance robustness against noise. We provide empirical results on a variety of shapes that suggest our method is not only robust to noise, but can also identify both partial and global symmetries. Moreover, we demonstrate the utility of our detected symmetries in various downstream tasks, such as compression and symmetrization of noisy shapes.</description>

      <title>RoMo: A Robust Solver for Full-body Unlabeled Optical Motion Capture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical motion capture (MoCap) is the "gold standard" for accurately capturing full-body motions. To make use of raw MoCap point data, the system labels the points with corresponding body part locations and solves the full-body motions. However, MoCap data often contains mislabeling, occlusion and positional errors, requiring extensive manual correction. To alleviate this burden, we introduce RoMo, a learning-based framework for robustly labeling and solving raw optical motion capture data. In the labeling stage, RoMo employs a divide-and-conquer strategy to break down the complex full-body labeling challenge into manageable subtasks: alignment, full-body segmentation and part-specific labeling. To utilize the temporal continuity of markers, RoMo generates marker tracklets using a K-partite graph-based clustering algorithm, where markers serve as nodes, and edges are formed based on positional and feature similarities. For motion solving, to prevent error accumulation along the kinematic chain, we introduce a hybrid inverse kinematic solver that utilizes joint positions as intermediate representations and adjusts the template skeleton to match estimated joint positions. We demonstrate that RoMo achieves high labeling and solving accuracy across multiple metrics and various datasets. Extensive comparisons show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art research methods. On a real dataset, RoMo improves the F1 score of hand labeling from 0.94 to 0.98, and reduces joint position error of body motion solving by 25%. Furthermore, RoMo can be applied in scenarios where commercial systems are inadequate. The code and data for RoMo are available at https://github.com/non-void/RoMo.</description>

      <title>ScriptViz: A Visualization Tool to Aid Scriptwriting based on a Large Movie Database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scriptwriters usually rely on their mental visualization to create a vivid story by using their imagination to see, feel, and experience the scenes they are writing. Besides mental visualization, they often refer to existing images or scenes in movies and analyze the visual elements to create a certain mood or atmosphere. In this paper, we develop ScriptViz to provide external visualization based on a large movie database for the screenwriting process. It retrieves reference visuals on the fly based on scripts' text and dialogue from a large movie database. The tool provides two types of control on visual elements that enable writers to 1) see exactly what they want with fixed visual elements and 2) see variances in uncertain elements. User evaluation among 15 scriptwriters shows that ScriptViz is able to present scriptwriters with consistent yet diverse visual possibilities, aligning closely with their scripts and helping their creation.</description>

      <title>GPUDrive: Data-driven, multi-agent driving simulation at 1 million FPS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent learning algorithms have been successful at generating superhuman planning in various games but have had limited impact on the design of deployed multi-agent planners. A key bottleneck in applying these techniques to multi-agent planning is that they require billions of steps of experience. To enable the study of multi-agent planning at scale, we present GPUDrive, a GPU-accelerated, multi-agent simulator built on top of the Madrona Game Engine that can generate over a million simulation steps per second. Observation, reward, and dynamics functions are written directly in C++, allowing users to define complex, heterogeneous agent behaviors that are lowered to high-performance CUDA. We show that using GPUDrive we can effectively train reinforcement learning agents over many scenes in the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, yielding highly effective goal-reaching agents in minutes for individual scenes and enabling agents to navigate thousands of scenarios within hours. The code base with pre-trained agents is available at \url{https://github.com/Emerge-Lab/gpudrive}.</description>
