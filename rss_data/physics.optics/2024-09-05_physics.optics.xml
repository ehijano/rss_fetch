      <title>Coherent Thermal Emission from Large-Scale Suspended Nanomechanical Membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal radiation is an abundant form of incoherent light. Generating coherent infrared light through incandescence promises a cheap alternative to the costly and epitaxially complex quantum cascade laser, however it remains a fundamental challenge. Previous approaches leveraged the spatial coherence of polaritonic excitations that occur in the thermal near-field, by diffracting them into the far-field zone via patterned micro- or nano-scatterers. This approach requires high-resolution lithography, is difficult to scale-up, and yields limited outcoupled radiation due to the intrinsically polarized nature of polaritons. We overcome these limitations and report coherent thermal emission through simple wave interference. We show that unpatterned, millimeter-scale, suspended nanomechanical membranes of SiC operate for both linear polarizations and exhibit antenna-like directionality without relying on the excitation of near-field polaritons. The ability to generate polarization-insensitive, narrowband and spatially coherent incandescent light without lithography at large scales paves the way towards democratizing thermal infrared technologies.</description>

      <title>Increased Secret Key Throughput in Twin Field Quantum Key Distribution using 4x4 Beam Splitter Detection Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twin Field Quantum key Distribution (TFQKD) has attracted recent interest due to the higher secret key capacity better than the fundamental repeaterless limit and extending the achievable distance. The key generation in TFQKD is based on the post selection of randomized phase slices. This paper describes a technique for enhancing the probability of choosing the phase slices by using four detectors at Charlie end placed after a 4x4 port beam-splitter network. Using theoretical modelling of secret keyrate and simulations using StrawberryFields, we observe an increase in secret key throughput when compared to conventional TFQKD.</description>

      <title>Sensor fusion luminescence thermometry better together</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Luminescent thermometers are highly effective in niche applications such as nanothermometry, in vivo imaging, and extreme conditions like high electromagnetic fields, radiation, and under mechanical or chemical stress. Advancing measurement precision, temperature resolution, and extending the temperature range are the main problems in this rapidly evolving research field, crucial in the work of R&amp;D industry engineers and scientific researchers. Traditionally using single parameter for sensing leads to the sensor underperformance. Sensor fusion (SF), a well-established statistical tool used to enhance precision in autonomous vehicles, navigation systems, medical imaging, and wearable devices is here engineered for luminescent thermometry, by either fusing multiple sensor probes, or observing each temperature dependent feature as a separate sensor, resulting in always increased precision and extended usable temperature range. SF is a replacement and superior alternative to multiple linear regression models as it stands out for its versatility, enabling performance limits to be reached with any sensor probe material. It is compatible with both time-resolved and steady-state readouts, used independently or in combination, with single or multiple excitations. The benefits are illustrated using probes with Mn5+, Yb3+/Er3+/Ho3+, Sm2+, and Mn4+/Ho3+/Cr3+ activator ions.</description>

      <title>Probing the chirality of a single microsphere trapped by a focused vortex beam through their orbital period</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When microspheres are illuminated by tightly focused vortex beams, they can be trapped in a non-equilibrium steady state where they orbit around the optical axis. By using the Mie-Debye theory for optical tweezers, we demonstrate that the orbital period strongly depends on the particle's chirality index. Taking advantage of such sensitivity, we put forth a method to experimentally characterize with high precision the chiroptical response of individual optically trapped particles. The method allows for an enhanced precision at least one order of magnitude larger than that of similar existing enantioselective approaches. It is particularly suited to probe the chiroptical response of individual particles, for which light-chiral matter interactions are typically weak.</description>

      <title>Large \'Etendue 3D Holographic Display with Content-adpative Dynamic Fourier Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emerging holographic display technology offers unique capabilities for next-generation virtual reality systems. Current holographic near-eye displays, however, only support a small \'etendue, which results in a direct tradeoff between achievable field of view and eyebox size. \'Etendue expansion has recently been explored, but existing approaches are either fundamentally limited in the image quality that can be achieved or they require extremely high-speed spatial light modulators.
  We describe a new \'etendue expansion approach that combines multiple coherent sources with content-adaptive amplitude modulation of the hologram spectrum in the Fourier plane. To generate time-multiplexed phase and amplitude patterns for our spatial light modulators, we devise a pupil-aware gradient-descent-based computer-generated holography algorithm that is supervised by a large-baseline target light field. Compared with relevant baseline approaches, our method demonstrates significant improvements in image quality and \'etendue in simulation and with an experimental holographic display prototype.</description>

      <title>Configurable Vibrational Coupling in Laser-Induced Microsecond Oscillations of Multi-Microbubble System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the coupled vibrational dynamics of sub-MHz self-oscillating bubbles at separations of 14 to 92 {\mu}m. Two vapor-rich microbubbles are generated via photothermal heating; their interactions are captured in real space and time via a high-speed camera. By controlling the distance between bubbles with micrometer precision, we induce in- and anti-phase hybridized vibrations, with mode frequencies varying from 0.5 to 0.8 MHz. The observed coupled modes are reproduced by the extended Rayleigh-Plesset equation that takes pressure interactions between the bubbles into account. Our findings facilitate the optimization of bubble array positioning for spatio-temporal microfluidic control.</description>

      <title>Generating customized field concentration via virtue surface transmission resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a mathematical framework for generating strong customized field concentration locally around the inhomogeneous medium inclusion via surface transmission resonance. The purpose of this paper is twofold. Firstly, we show that for a given inclusion embedded in an otherwise uniformly homogeneous background space, we can design an incident field to generate strong localized field concentration at any specified places around the inclusion. The aforementioned customized field concentration is crucially reliant on the peculiar spectral and geometric patterns of certain transmission eigenfunctions. Secondly, we prove the existence of a sequence of transmission eigenfunctions for a specific wavenumber and they exhibit distinct surface resonant behaviors, accompanying strong surface-localization and surface-oscillation properties. These eigenfunctions as the surface transmission resonant modes fulfill the requirement for generating the field concentration.</description>

      <title>Purification of Gaussian States by Photon Subtraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photon subtraction can enhance entanglement, which for pure states induces a decrease in the purity of reduced states. In contrast, by analyzing the purities of Gaussian states before and after subtracting a single photon, we prove that the purity of a Gaussian state can also be increased by less than 20%. On the one hand, it reveals that photon subtraction can reduce entanglement, and on the other hand, it reveals that it can achieve a limited amount of Gaussian state purification. Through the analysis of some examples, we demonstrate the inherent mechanism and applicable scope of photon-subtraction-based purification. In a multimode system, we find that photon subtraction can increase entanglement and purify some of the reduced states simultaneously. We thus present purification through the suppression of Gaussian noise as a new application for photon subtraction in continuous-variable quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>A Silicon Photonic Neural Network for Chromatic Dispersion Compensation in 20 Gbps PAM4 Signal at 125 km and Its Scalability up to 100 Gbps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A feed-forward photonic neural network (PNN) is tested for chromatic dispersion compensation in Intensity Modulation/Direct Detection optical links. The PNN is based on a sequence of linear and nonlinear transformations. The linear stage is constituted by an 8-tap time-delayed complex perceptron implemented on a Silicon-On-insulator platform and acting as a tunable optical filter. The nonlinear stage is provided by the square modulus of the electrical field applied at the end-of-line photodetector. The training maximizes the separation between the optical levels (i.e. the eye diagram aperture), with consequent reduction of the Bit Error Rate. Effective equalization is experimentally demonstrated for 20 Gbps 4-level Pulse Amplitude Modulated signal up to 125 km. An evolutionary algorithm and a gradient-based approach are tested for the training and then compared in terms of repeatability and convergence time. The optimal weights resulting from the training are interpreted in light of the theoretical transfer function of the optical fiber. Finally, a simulative study proves the scalability of the layout to larger bandwidths, up to 100 Gbps.</description>

      <title>On the use of a consumer-grade 360-degree camera as a radiometer for scientific applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.07103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Improved miniaturization capabilities for complex fisheye camera systems have recently led to the introduction of many compact 360-degree cameras on the consumer technology market. Designed primarily for recreational photography, several manufacturers have decided to allow users access to raw imagery for further editing flexibility, thereby offering data at sensor level that can be directly exploited for absolute-light quantification. In this study, we demonstrate methodologies to carefully calibrate a consumer-grade 360-degree camera for radiometry use. The methods include linearity analysis, geometric calibration, assessment of the illumination fall-off across the image plane, spectral-response determination, absolute spectral-radiance calibration, immersion factor determination and dark-frame analysis. Accuracy of the calibration was validated by a real-world experiment comparing sky radiance measurements with a co-localized Compact Optical Profiling System (C-OPS, Biospherical Instruments Inc.), which gave mean unbiased percentage differences of less than 21.1 %. Using the photon-transfer technique, we calculated that this camera consisting of two fisheyes with a 182$^\circ$ field of view in air (152$^\circ$ in water) has a limit of detection of at least $4.6 \times 10^{-7}$ $\mathrm{W \cdot sr^{-1} \cdot m^{-2} \cdot nm^{-1}}$ in its three spectral channels. This technology, with properly stored calibration data, may benefit researchers from multiple scientific areas interested in radiometric geometric light-field study. While some of these radiometric calibration methods are complex or costly, this work opens up possibilities for easy-to-use, inexpensive, and accessible radiance cameras.</description>

      <title>Complex Permittivity Characterization of Low-Loss Dielectric Slabs at Sub-THz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This manuscript presents a novel method for characterizing the permittivities of low-loss dielectric slabs in sub-terahertz (sub-THz) frequencies, specifically above 100 GHz using a quasi-optical system. The algorithm is introduced with detailed derivations, and the measurement sensitivity is analyzed through simulations. Subsequently, the method's validity is established via simulations, demonstrating high accuracy (error 0.1% for the loss tangent) for a 30 mm thick plate material and relatively lower accuracy (error &lt;5% for the loss tangent) for a 6 mm thick plate material. Notably, this accuracy surpasses that of the approach presented in [1] when the same window width is used to extract signals. Furthermore, a comparison between the permittivities of plexiglass with a 30 mm thickness characterized by the proposed method and the approach in [1] reveals a maximum difference in the dielectric constant of 0.011 and in loss tangent of 0.00071 from 140 to 220 GHz. Finally, the relative complex permittivities of plexiglass at 142.86 GHz obtained by both methods are compared with the reference values provided in [2], exhibiting differences of 0.06 in the dielectric constant.</description>

      <title>Pixel super-resolved lensless on-chip sensor with scattering multiplexing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.14746v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lensless on-chip microscopy has shown great potential for biomedical imaging due to its large-area and high-throughput imaging capabilities. By combining the pixel super-resolution (PSR) technique, it can improve the resolution beyond the limit of the imaging detector. However, existing PSR techniques are restricted to the feature size and crosstalk of modulation components (such as spatial light modulator), which cannot efficiently encode target information. Besides, the reconstruction algorithms suffer from the trade-off between image quality, reconstruction resolution and computational efficiency. In this work, we constructed a novel integrated lensless on-chip sensor via scattering multiplexing, and reported a robust PSR algorithm for sample reconstruction. The sensor employed a scattering layer as a modulator, which was permanently integrated with the detector. Benefiting from the high-degree-of-freedom reconstruction of the scattering layer, we realized fine wavefront modulation with a small feature size. The integration engineering avoided repetitious calibration and reduce the measurement complexity. The reported PSR algorithm combines both model-driven and data-driven strategies to efficiently exploit the high-frequency information from the fine modulation. A series of experiments validated that the reported sensor provides a low-cost solution for large-scale microscopic imaging, with significant advantages in resolution, image contrast and noise robustness.</description>

      <title>Metastable Photo-Induced Superconductivity far above $T_{\textrm{c}}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.15355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the striking discovery of metastable superconductivity in $\mathrm{K}_3\mathrm{C}_{60}$ at 100K, far above $T_{\textrm{c}}=20K$, we discuss possible mechanisms for long-lived, photo-induced superconductivity. Starting from a model of optically-driven Raman phonons coupled to inter-band electronic transitions, we develop a microscopic mechanism for photo-controlling the pairing interaction. Leveraging this mechanism, we first investigate long-lived superconductivity arising from the thermodynamic metastable trapping of the driven phonon. We then propose an alternative route, where the superconducting gap created by an optical drive leads to a dynamical bottleneck in the equilibration of quasi-particles. We conclude by discussing implications of both scenarios for experiments that can be used to discriminate between them. Our work provides falsifiable explanations for the nanosecond-scale photo-induced superconductivity found in $\mathrm{K}_3\mathrm{C}_{60}$, while simultaneously offering a theoretical basis for exploring metastable superconductivity in other quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Subtraction and Addition of Propagating Photons by Two-Level Emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coherent manipulation of quantum states of light is key to photonic quantum information processing. In this Letter, we show that a passive two-level nonlinearity suffices to implement non-Gaussian quantum operations on propagating field modes. In particular, the collective light-matter interaction can efficiently extract a single photon from a multi-photon input wave packet to an orthogonal temporal mode. We accurately describe the single-photon subtraction process by elements of an intuitive quantum-trajectory model. By employing this process, quantum information protocols gain orders of magnitude improved efficiency over heralded schemes with linear optics. The reverse process can be used to add photons one-by-one to a single wave-packet mode and compose arbitrarily large Fock states with a finite total success probability $&gt;96.7\%$.</description>

Abstract: Antiferromagnets with broken time-reversal (T) symmetry (T-odd antiferromagnets) have gained extensive attention, mainly due to their ferromagnet-like behavior despite the absence of net magnetization. However, certain types of T-odd antiferromagnets remain inaccessible by the typical ferromagnet-like phenomena (e.g., anomalous Hall effect). One such system is characterized by a T-odd scalar quantity, the magnetic toroidal monopole. To access the broken T symmetry in such a system, we employ a unique nonreciprocal optical phenomenon, electric field-induced nonreciprocal directional dichroism (E-induced NDD). We successfully detected signals of E-induced NDD in a T-odd antiferromagnet, Co2SiO4, whose magnetic structure is characterized by the magnetic toroidal monopole. Furthermore, by spatially resolving the E-induced NDD, we visualized spatial distributions of a pair of domain states related to one another by the T operation. The domain imaging revealed the inversion of the domain pattern by applying a magnetic field, which is explained by trilinear coupling attributed to the piezomagnetic effect. Our observation of E-induced NDD provides a unique approach to accessing the order parameter in T-odd antiferromagnets.</description>
