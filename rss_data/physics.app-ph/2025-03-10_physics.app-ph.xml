      <title>Pink-Beam Dark Field X-ray Microscopy: Expanding 3D/4D Imaging for Complex and Deformed Microstructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark Field X-ray Microscopy (DFXM) has advanced 3D non-destructive, high-resolution imaging of strain and orientation in crystalline materials, enabling the study of embedded structures in bulk. However, the photon-intensive nature of monochromatic DFXM limits its applicability to highly deformed or weakly crystalline structures and constrains time-resolved studies in industrially relevant materials. We present pink-beam DFXM (\pDFXM) at the ID03 beamline of ESRF, achieving a 27-fold increase in diffracted intensity while maintaining 100 nm spatial resolution. We validate \pDFXM{} by imaging a partially recrystallized aluminum grain, confirming sufficient angular resolution for microstructure mapping. The increased flux significantly enhances the diffracted signal, enabling the resolution of subgrain structures. Additionally, we image a highly deformed ferritic iron grain, previously inaccessible in monochromatic mode without focusing optics. Beyond static imaging, \pDFXM{} enables real-time tracking of grain growth during annealing, achieving hundred-millisecond temporal resolution. By combining high photon flux with non-destructive, high-resolution 3D mapping, \pDFXM{} expands diffraction-contrast imaging to poorly diffracting crystals, unlocking new opportunities for studying grain growth, fatigue, and corrosion in bulk materials.</description>

      <title>Ultra-flexible silicon foils with seamless detachability: the effect of porous multilayered structures prepared through modulated electrolyte composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comprehensive evaluation of the effect and limitations of variable current density and electrolyte composition on layer porosity and microstructure changes of porous silicon (pSi) multilayer stacks is reported. Following these results, the development and optimization of a four-layer stack architecture is reported through addition of super-low porosity layers (SLPL) on a low/high porosity layer (LPL/HLP) stack. Thermal treatment of these structures achieved excellent top and bottom surface reconstruction to form sintered porous silicon (SPS) detachable foils, enabling direct foil separation using cello tape from a smooth and specular parent substrate without the need to cut or damage it</description>

      <title>A Novel Design for SRAM Bitcell with 3-Complementary-FETs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complementary field-effect transistors (CFETs), featuring vertically stacked n/p-FETs, enhance integration density and significantly reduce the area of standard cells such as static random-access memory (SRAM). However, the advantage of area scaling through CFETs is hindered by the imbalance in N/P transistor counts (typically 4N/2P) within SRAM cells. In this work, we propose a novel 6T-SRAM design using three sets of CFETs, achieved by vertically stacking two n-FET pass-gate (PG) transistors via the CFET architecture. Through TCAD simulations, we optimize channel doping concentration and the number of top/bottom nanosheets (NS), demonstrating that junctionless accumulation mode (JAM) devices outperform inversion mode (IM) devices for PG and pull-down (PD) transistors. The proposed design achieves a 37% area reduction in SRAM standard cell layout compared to conventional CFET-based SRAM. With optimized parameters (n-type doping of \(1\times10^{15}\) cm\(^{-3}\) and '1B4T' NS configuration), the 3-CFET SRAM exhibits superior write margin (349.60 mV) and write delay (54.4 ps). This work advances SRAM design within the CFET framework, offering a scalable solution for next-generation memory technologies.</description>

      <title>Proper Characterization of Heat-to-Electric Conversion Efficiency of Liquid Thermogalvanic Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liquid thermogalvanic cells (LTCs) have emerged as a promising technology for harvesting low-grade heat due to their low cost, compact design, and high thermopower. However, discrepancies exist in quantifying their output power and efficiency. The commonly used figure of merit, ZT = S^2\sigma T/k, is based on electrolyte properties but fails to account for electrochemical reaction kinetics at the electrode interface that significantly impact performance and losses. This work establishes an experimental protocol for accurately characterizing LTC efficiency. We propose a device-level figure of merit, ZT = S^2T/RK , where R and K represent total internal resistance and thermal conductance. This formulation, derived by linearizing the Butler-Volmer relation, incorporates irreversible losses such as mass transfer and activation overpotential. Different methods for assessing LTC output power are examined, including linear sweeping voltammetry (LSV), constant resistance discharging, and constant current step discharging. LSV tends to overestimate power due to transient effects, while the latter two methods provide more accurate steady-state measurements. Additionally, heat conduction across LTCs is carefully analyzed, highlighting the significant impact of natural convection within electrolytes. Through rigorous experimental characterization, we demonstrate that the modified figure of merit is a proper efficiency indicator at the steady-state.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the production of a specified object using a combination of machining processes, including milling, shaping, and drilling, while emphasizing the critical role of fixture design in ensuring precision repeatability, and efficiency. The study outlines the systematic approach to transforming raw materials into a finished product through an optimized manufacturing sequence that minimizes waste and maximizes productivity. Different machining operations are carefully selected based on their suitability for achieving the required dimensional accuracy and surface finish. Fixtures are crucial in maintaining workpiece stability, reducing vibration, and ensuring accurate alignment during machining. This paper discusses the selection and design of fixtures, such as jigs and V-blocks, which enhance positioning accuracy and contribute to consistent machining outcomes. Additionally, the integration of CNC technology is examined, highlighting its advantages in automation, process control, and precision enhancement. The proposed methodology not only improves the efficiency of material removal but also ensures compliance with quality standards, reducing machining errors and minimizing rework. Furthermore, potential advancements in fixture automation using pneumatic actuators are considered to further streamline operations.

      <title>Virtual VNA 3.0: Unambiguous Scattering Matrix Estimation for Non-Reciprocal Systems by Leveraging Tunable and Coupled Loads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the "Virtual VNA 3.0" technique for estimating the scattering matrix of a \textit{non-reciprocal}, linear, passive, time-invariant device under test (DUT) with $N$ monomodal ports using a single measurement setup involving a vector network analyzer (VNA) with only $N_\mathrm{A}&lt;N$ ports -- thus eliminating the need for any reconnections. We partition the DUT ports into $N_\mathrm{A}$ "accessible" and $N_\mathrm{S}$ "not-directly-accessible" (NDA) ports. We connect the accessible ports to the VNA and the NDA ports to the "virtual VNA ports" of a VNA Extension Kit. This kit enables each NDA port to be terminated with three distinct individual loads or connected to neighboring DUT ports via coupled loads. We derive both a closed-form and a gradient-descent method to estimate the complete scattering matrix of the non-reciprocal DUT from measurements conducted with the $N_\mathrm{A}$-port VNA under various NDA-port terminations. We validate both methods experimentally for $N_\mathrm{A}=N_\mathrm{S}=4$, where our DUT is a complex eight-port transmission-line network comprising circulators. Altogether, the presented "Virtual VNA 3.0" technique constitutes a scalable approach to unambiguously characterize a many-port \textit{non-reciprocal} DUT with a few-port VNA (only $N_\mathrm{A}&gt;1$ is required) -- without any tedious and error-prone manual reconnections susceptible to inaccuracies. The VNA Extension Kit requirements match those for the "Virtual VNA 2.0" technique that was limited to reciprocal DUTs.</description>

      <title>Josephson traveling-wave parametric amplifier based on low-intrinsic-loss coplanar lumped-element waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Josephson traveling-wave parametric amplifier (JTWPA) based on a low-loss coplanar lumped-element waveguide architecture. By employing open-stub capacitors and Manhattan-pattern junctions, our device achieves an insertion loss below 1 dB up to 12 GHz. We introduce windowed sinusoidal modulation for phase matching, demonstrating that smooth impedance transitions effectively suppress intrinsic gain ripples. Using Tukey-windowed modulation with 8 % impedance variation, we achieve 20$-$23-dB gain over 5-GHz bandwidth under ideal matching conditions. In a more practical circuit having impedance mismatches, the device maintains 17$-$20-dB gain over 4.8-GHz bandwidth with an added noise of 0.13 quanta above standard quantum limit at 20-dB gain and $-99$-dBm saturation power, while featuring zero to negative backward gain below the bandgap frequency.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of tetracycline photocatalytic degradation using NiFe2O4/CeO2/GO nanocomposite for environmental remediation: In silico molecular docking, Antibacterial performance, degradation pathways, and DFT calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphene-based nanostructures with distinct structural and physicochemical characteristics may be able to photodegrade antibiotics effectively. Herein, this study reports the successful synthesis of NiFe2O4/CeO2/GO nanocomposite (NC) by anchoring NiFe2O4/CeO2 to the surface of GO (Graphene oxide). All state-of-the-art characterization techniques investigated the nanostructure, crystallinity, phonon modes, chemical composition analysis, elemental composition, surface area, magnetic properties, and optical band gap. Hydrothermal approach assisted NiFe2O4/CeO2/GO catalyst showed better charge carrier separation and prompted the tetracycline (TC-HCl) photocatalytic degradation under visible light. Following 90 minutes of exposure to visible light, NiFe2O4/CeO2/GO nanocomposite demonstrated superior photocatalytic activity, with a TC-HCl degradation rate of 95%. Reasonable mechanisms of tetracycline degradation were proposed where the OH and O played a leading role based on identified intermediates. Moreover, tetracycline photodegradation intermediates and the optimal pathway were identified using LC-MS spectrometry. This study also performed Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations for the prepared materials to validate the experimental data. In vitro, antibacterial studies were consistent with the molecular docking investigations of the NiFe2O4/CeO2/GO nanocomposite against DNA gyrase and FabI from Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S.aureus). Lastly, the outcomes revealed a new potential for NiFe2O4/CeO2/GO nanocomposite for improved photocatalytic performance, making it a promising photocatalyst for wastewater treatment.</description>

      <title>Geometrically Templated Dynamic Wrinkling from Suspended Poly(vinyl alcohol) Soap Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wrinkling is commonly observed as mechanical instability when a stiff thin film bound on a compliant thick substrate undergoes in-plane compression exceeding a threshold. Despite significant efforts to create a broad range of surface patterns via wrinkling, little has been studied about a dynamic and transient wrinkling process, where a suspended polymer thin film undergoes liquid-to-solid phase transitions. Here, a spontaneous wrinkling process is reported, when drying poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) soap films suspended on 3D printed wireframes with near zero or negative Gaussian curvatures. As water evaporates, a thickness gradient across the sample is developed, leading to non-uniform drying rates, and a concentration gradient between the inner and outer sides (exposed to air) of the suspended PVA soap film induces a differential osmotic pressure. Together, these effects contribute to an in-plane compressive stress, leading to the formation of surface wrinkles, whose growth is guided by the geometry of the frame. Importantly, the wrinkles evolve dynamically: the wavelength and number of the wrinkles can be tuned by altering the concentration of the PVA aqueous solutions, the initial mass, the relative humidity of the drying environment; the patterns of the resulting wrinkles can be programmed by the geometry of the wireframe.</description>

      <title>Error Source Sensitivity Analysis in Model-Based Coherence Scanning Interferometry for Thin Film Metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In semiconductor manufacturing processes, silicon dioxide films are commonly used as barrier layers, insulating layers, and protective layers. Coherence scanning interferometry (CSI) offers thin film thickness measurements with a millimeter-scale field of view and micrometer-scale lateral resolution. When the film thickness is less than the coherence length of a CSI system, a model-based film thickness measurement method is typically employed, which relies on a priori information about the thin film and the instrument. This study quantitatively analyzes how the accuracy of a priori information would affect the accuracy of thickness measurement when using a model-based CSI method. The influence factors include camera noise, numerical aperture (NA), pupil apodization, light source spectrum, and thin film refractive index. A series of SiO$_2$/Si thin films with varying thicknesses are analyzed by combining simulation and experimental approaches. The results reveal that the accuracy of thickness measurements exhibits varying sensitivity to different a priori information. The refractive index of the thin film is identified as the most sensitive source of error, where 1\% deviation in refractive index may cause 1\% relative thickness error, whereas 5\% deviation in NA results in less than 1\% relative thickness error. The simulation and experimental results show good agreement, validating the correctness and effectiveness of this study.</description>

      <title>Coexisting Euler and Stiefel-Whitney Topological Phases in Elastic Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of topological band theory in classical structures has led to the development of novel topological metamaterials with intriguing properties. While single-gap topologies are well understood, recent novel multi-gap phases have garnished increasing interest. These novel phases are characterized by invariants, such as the Euler and second Stiefel-Whitney classes, which involve Bloch eigen-subspaces of multiple bands and can change by braiding in momentum space non-Abelian charged band degeneracies belonging to adjacent energy gaps. Here, we theoretically predict and experimentally demonstrate that two of such topological phases can coexist within a single system using vectorial elastic waves. The inherent coupling between different polarization modes enables non-Abelian braiding of nodal points of multiple energy band gaps and results in coexisting Euler and Stiefel-Whitney topological insulator phases. We furthermore unveil the central role played by the topologically stable Goldstone modes' degeneracy. Our findings represent the first realization of hybrid phases in vectorial fields exhibiting topologically nontrivial Goldstone modes, paving the way for bifunctional applications that leverage the coexistence of topological edge and corner states.</description>

      <title>Superconducting Coherence Peak in Near-Field Radiative Heat Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enhancement and peaks in near-field radiative heat transfer (NFRHT) typically arise due to surface phonon-polaritons, plasmon-polaritons, and electromagnetic (EM) modes in structured materials. However, the role of material quantum coherence in enhancing near-field radiative heat transfer remains unexplored. Here, we unravel that NFRHT in superconductor-ferromagnetic systems displays a unique peak at the superconducting phase transition that originates from the quantum coherence of Bogoliubov quasiparticles in superconductors. Our theory takes into account evanescent EM radiation emanating from fluctuating currents comprising Cooper pairs and Bogoliubov quasiparticles in stark contrast to the current-current correlations induced by electrons in conventional materials. Our proposed NFRHT configuration exploits ferromagnetic resonance at frequencies deep inside the superconducting band gap to isolate this superconducting coherence peak. Furthermore, we reveal that Cooper pairs and Bogoliubov quasiparticles have opposite effects on near-field thermal radiation and isolate their effects on many-body radiative heat transfer near superconductors. Our proposed phenomenon can have applications for developing thermal isolators and heat sinks in superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>Skyrmion Molecule Lattices Enabling Stable Transport and Flexible Manipulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Skyrmions--topologically protected nanoscale spin textures with vortex-like configurations--hold transformative potential for ultra-dense data storage, spintronics and quantum computing. However, their practical utility is challenged by dynamic instability, complex interaction, and the lack of deterministic control. While recent efforts using classical wave systems have enabled skyrmion simulations via engineered excitations, these realizations rely on fragile interference patterns, precluding stable transport and flexible control. Here, we introduce a skyrmion molecule lattice, a novel architecture where pairs of spin skyrmions with opposite polarizability are symmetry-locked into stable molecule configurations. These molecules emerge as propagating eigenstates of the system, overcoming the static limitations of previous realizations. We further develop a boundary engineering technique, achieving precise control over skyrmion creation, deformation, annihilation, and polarizability inversion. As a proof of concept, we design a graphene-like acoustic surface wave metamaterial, where meta-atom pairs generate vortices with opposite orbital angular momenta, which couple to acoustic spin textures, forming skyrmion molecules. Experimental measurements confirm their stable transport and flexible control. Our work leverages the symmetry-locked molecule lattice to preserve the topological quasiparticle nature of skyrmions, offering a universal framework for their stabilization, transportation and manipulation. This bridges critical gaps in skyrmion physics, with potential impacts on wave-based sensing, information processing, and topological waveguiding.</description>

Abstract: The technological world is in search of environmentally friendly methods of generating energy for the use of the ever growing needs of power for sustainable development of visually all facet of life. Solar energy form an environmentally friendly solution for the reduction of global warming. For usage in photovoltaic applications, this work explores the production and characterisation of nanostructured cobalt sulphide (CoS) doped with dysprosium (Dy), a rare earth element. In order to increase CoS's efficiency in solar energy conversion, rare earth doping is used to improve its optical, electrical, and structural characteristics. To maximize performance, precise Dy doping doses were used in the electrochemical synthesis of the nanomaterials. UV-visible spectroscopy were among the characterization methods used to examine the optical and structural characteristics of the doped CoS nanomaterials. Significant alterations in the bandgap and optical absorption behavior are shown by the results, indicating that Dy-Doped CoS nanostructures hold great promise for enhanced photovoltaic performance. This study opens the door for the use of Dy-doped CoS in renewable energy technologies by demonstrating their viability as prospective materials for next-generation solar cells.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel method that combines spin resonance spectroscopy with transmission electron microscopy (TEM), enabling localized in-situ detection of microwave (MW)-driven spin excitations. Our approach utilizes continuous wave MW excitation at GHz frequencies, while employing the free-space electron beam as a signal receiver to sense spin precession. Spin state polarization is achieved via the magnetic field of the TEM's polepiece, while a custom-designed microresonator integrated into a TEM sample holder drives spin transitions and modulates the electron beam. This modulation enables phase-locked detection with picosecond temporal resolution, allowing the isolation of spin precession contributions to the electron beam deflection with a sensitivity of $\sim 280$ prad. The presented technique lays foundations for the MW spectroscopic in-situ exploration of spin dynamics at the nanoscale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement is a key resource in quantum technologies, enhancing precision and resolution in imaging and sensing by leveraging the cross-correlation of photon pairs. This correlation enables precise time synchronization of photons reaching the photodetectors, effectively suppressing environmental noise and improving measurement accuracy. Building on this concept, we theoretically introduce and experimentally explore phase-dependent Quantum Optical Coherence Tomography. This technique employs phase-shifted entangled photon pairs for non-invasive morphological analysis of multilayered samples. We demonstrate that applying a phase shift to entangled photon pairs in the Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer effectively eliminates artifacts (false patterns) caused by cross-reflections between different sample layers. This significantly improves the accuracy and reliability of the interferometric signal. The impact of this work extends to both the fundamental and practical domains. We show that phase-shifting entangled photon pairs in a Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer can lead to tangible advancements in quantum sensing and probing. Practically, our method addresses a key challenge in Quantum Optical Coherence Tomography by eliminating artifacts, offering promising applications in biomedical imaging and material science.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices are key components of classical communication systems and recently studied for quantum information processing. We here propose and study a hybrid quantum system composed of skyrmion qubit and a SAW cavity, which supports a number of long-lived phononic modes. The results show that the system allows for strong coupling between skyrmion qubit and single phonon of different modes. By manipulating the qubit(s) through a static magnetic field and a time-dependent modulation magnetic field, we further study the interaction between skyrmion qubit and individual phononic modes, phonon-phonon interaction, and qubit-qubit interaction, which operates in strong-coupling regime. The controllability of nanoscale skyrmion qubit and the dense phononic modes of single SAW cavity would make our system have promising applications in large-scale quantum communication and computing.</description>

      <title>Fabrication and Characterization of Impedance-transformed Josephson Parametric Amplifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a method of using a double-layer resist lift-off process to prepare the capacitor dielectric layer for fabricating impedance-engineered Josephson parametric amplifiers (IMPAs). Compared with traditional techniques, this method enhances fabrication success rate, accelerates production. The IMPA we made experimentally achieves an instantaneous bandwidth over 950 (600) MHz with a gain exceeding 10 (14) dB, along with saturation input power of -115 dBm and near quantum-limited noise. We demonstrate the negligible backaction from the IMPA on superconducting qubits, resulting in no significant degradation of the relaxation time and coherence time of the qubits. The IMPA improves the signal-to-noise ratio from 1.69 to 14.56 and enables the amplification chain to achieve a high quantum efficiency with $\eta \approx 0.26$, making it a critical necessity for large-scale quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Streaming Self-Corrected Dual-Comb Spectrometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here, we radically simplify coherently averaged dual-comb spectroscopy by introducing a real-time self-correction system: a radio frequency system-on-chip computes each incoming dual-comb interferogram's phase, frequency, and arrival time, calculates changes in the combs' carrier-envelope offset frequencies and repetition rates, and immediately phase-corrects the incoming interferogram data stream. The algorithm supports up to 0.3 GHz interferogram frequency bandwidth and thus combines fast measurement times (corresponding to high detunings) with broadband optical detection. Using the system, we achieve comb-resolved spectroscopy with Fourier-limited linewidth, coherent averaging over arbitrarily long durations, and a signal-to-noise ratio of up to 2100. Iodine and acetylene spectroscopy yields excellent agreement with literature over an optical bandwidth of more than 10 THz in the visible and near-infrared. Our approach only requires three optical and three electronic components and makes instantaneous dual-comb spectroscopy available to everyday applications.</description>

      <title>Layered Topological Antiferromagnetic Metal at Room Temperature -- YbMn$_2$Ge$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metallic antiferromagnets are essential for efficient spintronic applications due to their fast switching and high mobility, yet room-temperature metallic antiferromagnets are rare. Here, we investigate YbMn$_2$Ge$_2$, a room temperature antiferromagnet, and establish it as an exfoliable layered metal with altermagnetic surface states. Using multi-orbital Hubbard model calculations, we reveal that its robust metallic AFM ordering is stabilized by electronic correlations and a partially nested Fermi surface. Furthermore, we show that YbMn$_2$Ge$_2$ hosts symmetry-protected topological Dirac crossings, connecting unique even-order spin-polarized surface states with parabolic and inverted Mexican-hat-like dispersion. Our findings position YbMn$_2$Ge$_2$ as a promising platform for exploring the interplay of correlation, topology, and surface altermagnetism of layered antiferromagnets.</description>

      <title>Oriented 2D Ruddlesden-Popper Metal Halides by Pulsed Laser Deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) Metal Halides present unique and tunable properties, offering a plethora of applications in optoelectronics. However, the direct and oriented synthesis of these materials is challenging due to the low formation energies that result in fast, uncontrollable growth dynamics during solution-based processing. Here, we report the solvent-free growth of oriented and n = 1 2D $(\mbox{PEA})_2\mbox{PbI}_4$ RP films by pulsed laser deposition (PLD). In situ photoluminescence (PL) during PLD reveal that the n =1 RP phase of $(\mbox{PEA})_2\mbox{PbI}_4$ forms at the first stages of growth. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and grazing-incidence wide-angle scattering (GIWAXS) measurements confirm the formation of single oriented n = 1 phase of $(\mbox{PEA})_2\mbox{PbI}_4$ independent of the underlying substrate. Co-localized spatially resolved PL and AFM further validate the conformal growth of the n = 1 phase. While oriented growth is substrate-independent, the stability of the 2D films is influenced by the substrate. PLD-grown 2D RP films grown onto epitaxial $\mbox{MAPbI}_3$ films are stable over 80 days, showing no sign of cation exchange. This work highlights the potential of PLD for direct, room-temperature synthesis of 2D $(\mbox{PEA})_2\mbox{PbI}_4$ RP films on diverse substrates and demonstrates the feasibility of stable 2D/3D heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Modeling Realistic Dynamics of Nanoparticle Dimers for Magneto-Optical Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional approaches to optical matter often involve complex illumination fields with costly and unstable setups, requiring strong gradient forces, high-intensity laser spots that could harm samples, and substrate support. For binding, attractive inter-particle forces may not be sufficient to assemble systems due to unbalanced components such as centrifugal forces or collisions. In previous work, magneto-optical nanoparticles illuminated with two counter-propagating circularly polarized waves were optically bound under quasi-static conditions. However, the dynamics of such nano systems were not thoroughly considered. Here, a general framework to study magneto-optical (MO) matter is introduced, controllable by static magnetic fields. Dynamic binding between two n-doped InSb nanoparticles, which exhibit surface plasmons at THz frequencies, is recreated. Additionally, the reported examples may represent a novel approach of low-energy illumination sources without gradient components. This numerical framework, grounded in Langevin dynamics and realistic collision phenomena, serves as a robust and universal tool for exploring various optomechanical designs. The impact of thermal noise, collision types, initial conditions, and resonance excitation on a dimer system is examined. Dimers tuned initially at magneto-optical resonance can bind in stable, average positions even when particle-particle collisions are present. The current methodology provides essential knowledge for studying optical binding and the dynamics of any small-scale cluster of interacting sub-units.</description>

      <title>Infrared Bolometers Based on 40-nm-Thick Nano-Thermoelectric Silicon Membranes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: State-of the-art infrared photodetectors operating in the mid- and long-wavelength infrared (MWIR and LWIR) are largely dominated by cryogenically cooled quantum sensors when the target is the highest sensitivity and detection speeds. Nano-thermoelectrics provide a route towards competitive uncooled infrared bolometer technology that can obtain high speed and sensitivity, low-power operation, and cost-effectiveness. We demonstrate nano-thermoelectric LWIR bolometers with fast and high-sensitivity response to LWIR around 10 $\mu$m. These devices are based on ultra-thin silicon membranes that utilize the dimensional scaling of silicon nanomembranes in thermoelectric elements and are combined with metallic nanomembranes with subwavelength absorber structures. The fast device performance stems from a low heat capacity design where the thermoelectric beams act both as mechanical supports and transducer elements. Furthermore, by scaling down the thickness of the thermoelectric beams the thermal conductivity is reduced owing to enhanced phonon boundary scattering, resulting in increased sensitivity. The nano-thermoelectric LWIR bolometers are based on 40-nm-thick n- and p-type silicon membranes with LWIR (voltage) responsivities up to 1636 V/W and 1350 V/W and time constants in the range of 300-600 $\mu$s, resulting in specific detectivities up to $1.56\times10^8$ cmHz$^{1/2}$/W. We also investigate the use of a heavily doped N++ substrate to increase optical cavity back reflection, resulting in an increased Si substrate reflectance from 30% to 70%-75% for wavelengths between 8-10 $\mu$m, resulting in an increase in device responsivity by approximately 20%.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear particle motion and bursty periodic energy deposition in inductively coupled plasmas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional, electromagnetic particle-in-cell simulations are employed to study particle kinetics and power deposition in inductively coupled plasmas. We show that in the regime of low frequency ($\sim\mathrm{MHz}$) and low pressure, the motion of electrons can be highly nonlinear in the skin region near the antenna coil. Through most of the RF cycle, the electrons are strongly magnetized, with energy deposition being small. However, for a brief period around the null of the oscillating magnetic field, the electrons demagnetize, causing a jet-like current penetrating into the bulk plasma. During these brief periods the power deposition becomes high, exhibiting a periodic burst nature. Based on kinetic theory, we provide new analytical expressions for the plasma current and energy deposition. A criterion for transition between the newly identified low-frequency, periodic-burst regime and the usual anomalous non-local skin effect regime is proposed and verified using a series of fully kinetic 2D particle-in-cell simulations.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Spin Transport in a Topological Insulator Thin Film</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological insulators (TIs) are intriguing materials for advanced computing applications based on spintronics because they can host robust spin effects. For instance, TIs have intrinsically large spin generation enabled by their large spin-orbit coupling. Furthermore, topological surface states (TSS) with spin-momentum locking and Dirac dispersion lead to long spin diffusion. Future spintronic device technology will require scalable film growth of high-quality material. We grow epitaxial films of Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$Te$_{3-y}$Se$_y$ (BSTS, $x = 0.58, y = 1$) and confirm the gapless band structure with optimal doping using angle-resolved photoelectron spectra. The temperature dependence of longitudinal resistivity shows bulk transport is suppressed as temperature is decreased, and at low temperature surface transport dominates. We evaluate the spin transport properties in BSTS without using ferromagnetic tunnel contacts via a non-local resistance experiment as a function of temperature and applied charge current. As expected, these experiments reveal the necessity of decreasing the bulk conduction to best enhance the spin transport. In the TSS, we find high efficiency of charge-to-spin conversion (spin Hall angle, $\theta_{SH} \approx 1$) and spin diffusion over several microns. Further development of high-quality TIs will make them viable candidates for efficient and lossless spintronics.</description>
