      <title>Combining a ground-based UV network with satellite maps: A case study for Germany</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A study for the comprehensive information of current UV exposure for the area of Germany, based on the method for near real time calculation of UV Index maps used in the framework of the Austrian UV Monitoring Network, is presented. For the area of Germany about 22.000 surface UV Index maps were calculated for the year 2022 via the radiative transfer model libRadtran by incorporating daily forecast data for ozone, albedo and aerosols from the Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service and taking into account cloud information gathered from SEVIRI data of Meteosat Second Generation in the form of a cloud modification factor. Ground-based measurements of 17 stations of the German Solar Monitoring Network were then compared to the modelled maps. For most stations the correlation coefficient between measured and modelled UV Index (UVI) is above 0.92 and the mean difference of modelled UVI to measured UVI is smaller than 0.5 UVI. The modelling of the UVI at the high mountain station Schneefernerhaus is associated with higher uncertainties (correlation coefficient 0.85 and mean UVI difference 0.6 UVI) due to the small-scale topography with spatially highly variable albedo and clouds. Moreover, case studies for specific locations with respect to cloud conditions and topography are discussed, as well as a case study of the combination of ground-based measurements and modelled UVI maps in form of spatial correction factors.</description>

      <title>The influence of vertical resolution on internal tide energetics and subsequent effects on underwater acoustic propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Internal tide generation and breaking play a primary role in the vertical transport and mixing of heat and other properties in the ocean interior, thereby influencing climate regulation. Additionally, internal tides increase sound speed variability in the ocean, consequently impacting underwater acoustic propagation. With advancements in large-scale ocean modeling capabilities, it is essential to assess the impact of higher model resolutions (horizontal and vertical) in representing internal tides. This study investigates the influence of vertical resolution on internal tide energetics and its subsequent effects on underwater acoustic propagation in the HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM). An idealized configuration with a ridge, forced only by semidiurnal tides and having 1-km horizontal grid-spacing, is used to test two different vertical-grid discretizations, defined based on the zero-crossings of horizontal velocity eigenfunctions, with seven distinct numbers of isopycnal layers, ranging from 8 to 128. Analyses reveal that increasing the number of layers up to 48 increases barotropic-to-baroclinic tidal conversion, available potential energy, and vertical kinetic energy, reaching equilibrium afterwards with higher layer counts. Vertical shear exhibits a similar pattern but converging at 96 layers. Simulations with at least 48 layers fully resolve the available potential energy contained in the 3rd to 8th tidal baroclinic modes. Finally, sound speed variability and acoustic parameters differ for simulations with less than 48 layers. Therefore, the study concludes that a minimum vertical resolution (48 layers in this case) is required in isopycnal models to minimize the impact on internal tide properties and associated underwater acoustic propagation.</description>

      <title>Causality for Earth Science -- A Review on Time-series and Spatiotemporal Causality Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This survey paper covers the breadth and depth of time-series and spatiotemporal causality methods, and their applications in Earth Science. More specifically, the paper presents an overview of causal discovery and causal inference, explains the underlying causal assumptions, and enlists evaluation techniques and key terminologies of the domain area. The paper elicits the various state-of-the-art methods introduced for time-series and spatiotemporal causal analysis along with their strengths and limitations. The paper further describes the existing applications of several methods for answering specific Earth Science questions such as extreme weather events, sea level rise, teleconnections etc. This survey paper can serve as a primer for Data Science researchers interested in data-driven causal study as we share a list of resources, such as Earth Science datasets (synthetic, simulated and observational data) and open source tools for causal analysis. It will equally benefit the Earth Science community interested in taking an AI-driven approach to study the causality of different dynamic and thermodynamic processes as we present the open challenges and opportunities in performing causality-based Earth Science study.</description>

      <title>Implicit Assimilation of Sparse In Situ Data for Dense &amp; Global Storm Surge Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hurricanes and coastal floods are among the most disastrous natural hazards. Both are intimately related to storm surges, as their causes and effects, respectively. However, the short-term forecasting of storm surges has proven challenging, especially when targeting previously unseen locations or sites without tidal gauges. Furthermore, recent work improved short and medium-term weather forecasting but the handling of raw unassimilated data remains non-trivial. In this paper, we tackle both challenges and demonstrate that neural networks can implicitly assimilate sparse in situ tide gauge data with coarse ocean state reanalysis in order to forecast storm surges. We curate a global dataset to learn and validate the dense prediction of storm surges, building on preceding efforts. Other than prior work limited to known gauges, our approach extends to ungauged sites, paving the way for global storm surge forecasting.</description>

      <title>Streamlining Ocean Dynamics Modeling with Fourier Neural Operators: A Multiobjective Hyperparameter and Architecture Optimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training an effective deep learning model to learn ocean processes involves careful choices of various hyperparameters. We leverage DeepHyper's advanced search algorithms for multiobjective optimization, streamlining the development of neural networks tailored for ocean modeling. The focus is on optimizing Fourier neural operators (FNOs), a data-driven model capable of simulating complex ocean behaviors. Selecting the correct model and tuning the hyperparameters are challenging tasks, requiring much effort to ensure model accuracy. DeepHyper allows efficient exploration of hyperparameters associated with data preprocessing, FNO architecture-related hyperparameters, and various model training strategies. We aim to obtain an optimal set of hyperparameters leading to the most performant model. Moreover, on top of the commonly used mean squared error for model training, we propose adopting the negative anomaly correlation coefficient as the additional loss term to improve model performance and investigate the potential trade-off between the two terms. The experimental results show that the optimal set of hyperparameters enhanced model performance in single timestepping forecasting and greatly exceeded the baseline configuration in the autoregressive rollout for long-horizon forecasting up to 30 days. Utilizing DeepHyper, we demonstrate an approach to enhance the use of FNOs in ocean dynamics forecasting, offering a scalable solution with improved precision.</description>

      <title>Strongly stable dual-pairing summation by parts finite difference schemes for the vector invariant nonlinear shallow water equations -- I: Numerical scheme and validation on the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an energy/entropy stable and high order accurate finite difference method for solving the nonlinear (rotating) shallow water equations (SWE) in vector invariant form using the newly developed dual-pairing and dispersion-relation preserving summation-by-parts finite difference operators. We derive new well-posed boundary conditions for the SWE in one space dimension, formulated in terms of fluxes and applicable to linear and nonlinear SWEs. For the nonlinear SWE, entropy stability ensures the boundedness of numerical solution but does not guarantee convergence. Adequate amount of numerical dissipation is necessary to control high frequency errors which could negatively impact accuracy in the numerical simulations. Using the dual-pairing summation by parts framework, we derive high order accurate and nonlinear hyper-viscosity operator which dissipates entropy and enstrophy. The hyper-viscosity operator effectively minimises oscillations from shocks and discontinuities, and eliminates high frequency grid-scale errors. The numerical method is most suitable for the simulations of subcritical flows typically observed in atmospheric and geostrophic flow problems. We prove a priori error estimates for the semi-discrete approximations of both linear and nonlinear SWE. Convergence, accuracy, and well-balanced properties are verified via the method of manufactured solutions and canonical test problems such as the dam break and lake at rest. Numerical simulations in two-dimensions are presented which include the rotating and merging vortex problem and barotropic shear instability, with fully developed turbulence.</description>
