      <title>A generalised sigmoid population growth model with energy dependence: application to quantify the tipping point for Antarctic shallow seabed algae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sigmoid growth models are often used to study population dynamics. The size of a population at equilibrium commonly depends explicitly on the availability of resources, such as an energy or nutrient source, which is not explicit in standard sigmoid growth models. A simple generalised extension of sigmoid growth models is introduced that can explicitly account for this resource-dependence, demonstrated by three examples of this family of models of increasing mathematical complexity. Each model is calibrated and compared to observed data for algae under sea-ice in Antarctic coastal waters. It was found that through careful construction, models satisfying the proposed framework can estimate key properties of a sea-ice break-out controlled tipping point for the algae, which cannot be estimated using standard sigmoid growth models. The proposed broader family of energy-dependent sigmoid growth models likely has usage in many population growth contexts where resources limit population size.</description>

      <title>A story of viral co-infection, co-transmission and co-feeding in ticks: how to compute an invasion reproduction number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With a single circulating vector-borne virus, the basic reproduction number incorporates contributions from tick-to-tick (co-feeding), tick-to-host and host-to-tick transmission routes. With two different circulating vector-borne viral strains, resident and invasive, and under the assumption that co-feeding is the only transmission route in a tick population, the invasion reproduction number depends on whether the model system of ordinary differential equations possesses the property of neutrality. We show that a simple model, with two populations of ticks infected with one strain, resident or invasive, and one population of co-infected ticks, does not have Alizon's neutrality property. We present model alternatives that are capable of representing the invasion potential of a novel strain by including populations of ticks dually infected with the same strain. The invasion reproduction number is analysed with the next-generation method and via numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Wastewater-based Epidemiology for COVID-19 Surveillance: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pandemic of COVID-19 has imposed tremendous pressure on public health systems and social economic ecosystems over the past years. To alleviate its social impact, it is important to proactively track the prevalence of COVID-19 within communities. The traditional way to estimate the disease prevalence is to estimate from reported clinical test data or surveys. However, the coverage of clinical tests is often limited and the tests can be labor-intensive, requires reliable and timely results, and consistent diagnostic and reporting criteria. Recent studies revealed that patients who are diagnosed with COVID-19 often undergo fecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 virus into wastewater, which makes wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) for COVID-19 surveillance a promising approach to complement traditional clinical testing. In this paper, we survey the existing literature regarding WBE for COVID-19 surveillance and summarize the current advances in the area. Specifically, we have covered the key aspects of wastewater sampling, sample testing, and presented a comprehensive and organized summary of wastewater data analytical methods. Finally, we provide the open challenges on current wastewater-based COVID-19 surveillance studies, aiming to encourage new ideas to advance the development of effective wastewater-based surveillance systems for general infectious diseases.</description>
