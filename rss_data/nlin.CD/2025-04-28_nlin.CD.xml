      <title>Chaos synchronization between the Ikeda systems coupled in a star network topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The case of a star topology is studied on the example of Ikeda model-famous interdisciplinary system. The existence and stability conditions for the complete synchronization between constituent systems are found. An agreement between numerical simulations and theory is excellent. Some security implications for the computer networks are underlined.</description>

      <title>Pinning control of chimera states in systems with higher-order interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding and controlling the mechanisms behind synchronization phenomena is of paramount importance in nonlinear science. In particular, the emergence of chimera states, patterns in which order and disorder coexist simultaneously, continues to puzzle scholars, due to its elusive nature. Recently, it has been shown that higher-order (many-body) interactions greatly enhance the presence of chimera states, which are easier to be found and more persistent. In this work, we show that the higher-order framework is fertile not only for the emergence of chimera states, but also for its control. Via pinning control, a technique consisting in applying a forcing to a subset of the nodes, we are able to trigger the emergence of chimera states with only a small fraction of controlled nodes, at striking contrast with the case without higher-order interactions. We show that our setting is robust for different higher-order topologies and types of pinning control and, finally, we give a heuristic interpretation of the results via phase reduction theory. Our numerical and theoretical results provide further understanding on how higher-order interactions shape collective behaviors in nonlinear dynamics.</description>
