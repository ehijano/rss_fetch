      <title>Multifractal Dimension Spectrum Analysis for Nuclear Density Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an integral density method for calculating the multifractal dimension spectrum for the nucleon distribution in atomic nuclei. This method is then applied to analyze the non-uniformity of the density distribution in several typical types of nuclear matter distributions, including the Woods-Saxon distribution, the halo structure and the tetrahedral $\alpha$ clustering. The subsequent discussion provides a comprehensive and detailed exploration of the results obtained. The multifractal dimension spectrum shows remarkable sensitivity to the density distribution, establishing it as an effective tool for studying the distribution of nucleons in nuclear multibody systems.</description>

      <title>A new scheme for isomer pumping and depletion with high-power lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel scheme for the population and depletion of nuclear isomers. The scheme combines the $\gamma$-photons with energies $\gtrsim 10$ keV emitted during the interaction of a contemporary high-intensity laser pulse with a plasma and one or multiple photon beams supplied by intense lasers. Due to nonlinear effects, two- or multi-photon absorption dominates over the conventional multi-step one-photon process for an optimized gamma flash. Moreover, this nonlinear effect can be greatly enhanced with the help of externally supplied photons. These photons act such that the effective cross-section experienced by the $\gamma$-photons becomes tunable, growing with the intensity $I_0$ of the beam. Assuming $I_{0}\sim 10^{18}$ Wcm$^{-2}$ for the photon beam, an effective cross-section as large as $10^{-21}$ cm$^2$ to $10^{-28}$ cm$^2$ for the $\gamma-$photon can be achieved. Thus, within state-of-the-art 10 PW laser facilities, the yields from two-photon absorption can reach $10^6$ to $10^9$ isomers per shot for selected states that are separated from their ground state by E2 transitions. Similar yields for transitions with higher multipolarities can be accommodated by multi-photon absorption with additional photons provided.</description>

      <title>Astrophysics and Nuclear Physics Informed Interactions in Dense Matter: Insights from PSR J0437-4715</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how vector and isovector interactions can be determined within the density regime of neutron stars, while fulfilling nuclear and astrophysics constrains. We make use of the Chiral Mean Field (CMF) model, a SU(3) nonlinear realization of the sigma model within the mean-field approximation, for the first time within a Bayesian analysis framework. We show that neutron-matter $\chi$EFT constraints at low density are only satisfied if the vector-isovector mixed interaction term is included, e.g., a $\omega^2\rho^2$ term. We also show the behavior of the model with respect to the conformal limit. We demonstrate that the CMF model is able to predict a value for the parameter $d_c$ related to the trace anomaly and its derivative takes values below 0.2 above four times saturation density within a hadronic model that does not include a phase transition to deconfined matter. We compare these effects with results from other (non-chiral) Relativistic Mean Field models to assess how different approaches to incorporating the same physical constraints affect predictions of neutron-star properties and dense matter equations of state. We also include data from the gravitation wave event GW230529 detected by the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra collaboration and the most recent radius measurement of PSR J0437-4715 from the NASA NICER mission. Our analysis reveals that this new NICER measurement leads to an average reduction of approximately $\sim 0.15$ km radius in the posterior of the neutron-star mass-radius relationship.</description>

      <title>Neutral-current background induced by atmospheric neutrinos at large liquid-scintillator detectors: III. Quantitative calculations for reactor neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atmospheric neutrinos contribute significantly to irreducible backgrounds through their neutral-current (NC) interactions with $^{12}$C nuclei in liquid-scintillator detectors, impacting diffuse supernova neutrino background, nucleon decay, and reactor neutrinos. This paper extends our prior work by systematically studying the NC backgrounds towards the MeV region of reactor neutrinos. We employ contemporary neutrino generator models from GENIE and NuWro for calculations, with a focus on predicting NC background in experimental searches for inverse-beta-decay signals below 100 MeV visible energy. We estimate the systematic uncertainty to our estimation of the NC background using various data-driven neutrino generator models, addressing factors such as the initial neutrino-nucleon NC interaction, the nuclear model, the final-state interaction model, the nucleus deexcitation, and the secondary interaction on final-state particles.</description>

      <title>Baryon junction effects on charmonium production in pp and pPb collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we study the effects of the proton and $Pb$ internal structure on charmonium production at high multiplicities. To do this, we assume that the nucleon has an Y shape, which means that the effective quarks (quarks + antiquarks + gluons) are in the extremities of the Y, connected by gluon lines. Since the quarks are in the periphery and the gluons are in the center, as $pp$ collisions go from peripheral to more central and then to ultra-central collisions, the interactions change from quark-quark to gluon-gluon. The enhanced growth of $J/\psi$ occurs because $\sigma( g + g \to c + \bar{c}) \gg \sigma( q + \bar{q} \to c + \bar{c})$. In the $p-Pb$ collisions the enhancement is caused by the high concentration of partons in the center of the nuclei. These effects can explain the growth seen in the data and give support to the Y picture of the proton.</description>

      <title>Flavor asymmetry from the non-perturbative nucleon sea</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate, in the context of a scalar version of the chiral effective field theory, that the multi-sea quark contribution to the nucleon is significant and highly non-trivial in sharp contrast to the prediction of perturbation theory. The non-perturbative calculation is performed in the Fock sector dependent renormalization scheme on the light front, in which the non-perturbative renormalization is incorporated. The calculation suggests that a fully non-perturbative calculation of the chiral EFT is needed to obtain a robust result to be compared with the recent experimental measurement of flavor asymmetry in the proton.</description>

      <title>Quantum computation in fermionic thermal field theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal properties of quantum fields at finite temperature are crucial to understanding strongly interacting matter and recent development in quantum computing has provided an alternative and promising avenue of study. In this work, we study thermal field theories involving only fermions using quantum algorithms. We first delve into the presentations of fermion fields via qubits on digital quantum computers alongside the quantum algorithms such as quantum imaginary time evolutions employed to evaluate thermal properties of generic quantum field theories. Specifically, we show numerical results such as the thermal distribution and the energy density of thermal field theories for Majorana fermions in 1+1 dimensions using quantum simulators. In addition to free field theory, we also study the effects of interactions resulting from coupling with a spatially homogeneous Majorana field. In both cases, we show analytically that thermal properties of the system can be described using phase-space distributions, and the quantum simulation results agree with analytical and semiclassical expectations. Our work is an important step to understand thermal fixed points, preparing for quantum simulation of thermalization in real time.</description>

      <title>Truncated Partial-Wave Analysis for $\eta$-photoproduction observables via Bayesian Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10367v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A truncated partial-wave analysis is performed for $\eta$-photoproduction using the polarization observables $\sigma_0, \Sigma, T, E, F$ and $G$. Different truncation orders are analyzed for six energy bins within the range of $E^{lab}_{\gamma} \in [750, 1250]$ MeV. Bayesian statistics is combined with truncated partial-wave analysis for the first time to investigate the structure of emerging ambiguities and their relevance in comparison to each other. Marginal distributions for the electromagnetic multipole parameters are presented together with predictions for polarization observables which have not yet been measured, in order to determine promising future measurements able to remove remaining mathematical ambiguities.</description>

      <title>Auxiliary Field Quantum Monte Carlo for Dilute Neutrons on the Lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ constrained path Auxiliary Field Quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) in the pursuit of studying physical nuclear systems using a lattice formalism. Since AFQMC has been widely used in the study of condensed-matter systems such as the Hubbard model, we benchmark our method against published results for both one- and two-dimensional Hubbard model calculations. We then turn our attention to cold-atomic and nuclear systems. We use an onsite contact interaction that can be tuned in order to reproduce the known scattering length and effective range of a given interaction. Developing this machinery allows us to extend our calculations to study nuclear systems within a lattice formalism. We perform initial calculations for a range of nuclear systems from two- to few-body neutron systems.</description>

      <title>High-resolution momentum distributions from low-resolution wave functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00634v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nucleon momentum distributions calculated with a common one-body operator vary with the resolution scale (and scheme) of the Hamiltonian used. For high-resolution potentials such as Argonne $v_{18}$ (AV18) there is a high-momentum tail, reflecting short-range correlations in the nuclear wave function, which is reduced or absent for softer, lower-resolution interactions. We explore if the similarity renormalization group (SRG) can be used to quantitatively reproduce the high-resolution distributions from variational Monte Carlo at all momenta using SRG-evolved operators and empirically fit single-particle orbitals rather than a full RG evolution of many-body wave functions. The goal of this approach is to enable calculations of high-resolution distributions for a wider range of nuclei as well as for other interactions, and provides connections to phenomenological analyses of experiments.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Model of $J/\Psi$ photo-production on the nucleon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A dynamical model based on a phenomenological charm quark-nucleon($c$-N) potential $v_{cN}$ and the Pomeron-exchange mechanism is constructed to investigate the $J/\Psi$ photo-production on the nucleon from threshold to invariant mass $W=300$ GeV. The $J/\Psi$-N potential,$V_{J/\Psi N}(r)$,is constructed by folding $v_{cN}$ into the wavefunction $\Phi_{J/\Psi}(c\bar{c})$ of $J/\Psi$ within a Constituent Quark Model(CQM) of Ref.[43]. A photo-production amplitude is also generated by $v_{cN}$ by a $c\bar{c}$-loop integration over the $\gamma\rightarrow c\bar{c}$ vertex function and $\Phi_{J/\Psi}(c\bar{c})$. No commonly used Vector Meson Dominance assumption is used to define this photo-production amplitude which is needed to describe the data near the threshold. The potential $v_{cN}(r)$ is parameterized in a form such that the predicted $V_{J/\Psi N}(r)$ at large distances has the same Yukawa potential form extracted from a Lattice QCD(LQCD) calculation of Ref.[18]. The parameters of $v_{cN}$ are determined by fitting the total cross section data of JLab by performing calculations that include $J/\Psi$-N final state interactions(FSI). The resulting differential cross sections are found in good agreements with the data. It is shown that the FSI effects dominate the cross section in the very near threshold region, allowing for sensitive testing of the predicted $J/\Psi$-N scattering amplitudes. By imposing the constraints of $J/\Psi$-N potential extracted from the LQCD calculation, we have obtained three $J/\Psi$-N potentials which fit the JLab data equally well. The resulting $J/\Psi$-N scattering lengths are in the range of $a=(-0.05$ fm $\sim$ $-0.25$ fm). With the determined $v_{cN}(r)$ and the wavefunctions generated from the same CQM, the constructed model is used to predict the cross sections of photo-production of $\eta_c(1S)$ and $\Psi(2S)$ mesons for future experimental tests.</description>

      <title>Compositeness of $T_{cc}$ and $X(3872)$ by considering decay and coupled-channels effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.07038v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The compositeness of weakly bound states is discussed using the effective field theory from the viewpoint of the low-energy universality. We introduce a model with coupling of the single-channel scattering to the bare state, and study the compositeness of the bound state by varying the bare state energy. In contrast to the naive expectation that the near-threshold states are dominated by the molecular structure, we demonstrate that a non-composite state can always be realized even with a small binding energy. At the same time, however, it is shown that a fine tuning is necessary to obtain the non-composite weakly bound state. In other words, the probability of finding a model with the composite dominant state becomes larger with the decrease of the binding energy in accordance with the low-energy universality. For the application to exotic hadrons, we then discuss the modification of the compositeness due to the decay and coupled-channels effects. We quantitatively show that these contributions suppress the compositeness, because of the increase of the fraction of other components. Finally, as examples of near-threshold exotic hadrons, the structures of $T_{cc}$ and $X(3872)$ are studied by evaluating the compositeness. We find the importance of the coupled-channels and decay contributions for the structures of $T_{cc}$ and $X(3872)$, respectively.</description>

      <title>On interpretation of fluctuations of conserved charges at high T</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fluctuations of conserved charges calculated on the lattice which can be measured experimentally, are well reproduced by a hadron resonanse gas model at temperatures below T_{ch} ~ 155 MeV and radically deviate from the hadron resonance gas predictions above the chiral restoration crossover. This behavior is typically interpreted as an indication of deconfinement in the quark-gluon plasma regime. We present an argument that this interpretation may be too simple. The argument is based on the scaling of quantities with the number of colors: demonstration of deconfinement and QGP requires observable that is sensitive to N_c^2 gluons while the conserved charges are sensitive only to quarks and above T_{ch} scale as N_c^1. The latter scaling is consistent with the existence of an intermediate regime characterized by restored chiral symmetry and by approximate chiral spin symmetry which is a symmetry of confining interaction. In this regime the energy density, pressure and entropy density scale as N_c^1. In the large N_c limit this regime might become a distinct phase separated from the hadron gas and from QGP by phase transitions. A natural observable that associates with deconfinement and is directly sensitive to deconfined N_c^2-1 gluons is the Polyakov loop; in the N_c=3 world it remains very close to 0 at temperatures well above chiral crossover, reaches the value 0.5 around 3T_{ch} and the value close to 1 at temperatures ~1 GeV.</description>

      <title>Mini-jet Clustering Algorithm Using Transverse-momentum Seeds in High-energy Nuclear Collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06895v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an algorithm to detect mini-jet clusters in high-energy nuclear collisions, by selecting a high-transverse-momentum ($p_T$) particle as a seed and assigning a clustering radius ($R$) in the pseudorapidity and azimuthal-angle space. Our PYTHIA simulations for $p$+$p$ collisions show that a scheme with a seeding $p_T$ of around 0.5 GeV/$c$ and $R$ of approximately 0.6 satisfactorily identifies mini-jet clusters. The correlation between clusters obtained in PYTHIA calculations using the algorithm exhibits the proper behavior of hard-scattering-like processes, suggesting its usefulness in isolating mini-jet-like clusters from non-hard-scattering soft processes when applied to actual nuclear-collision data, thereby allowing a closer examination of both the mini-jet and the soft mechanisms.</description>

      <title>A new method for the solution of the two-body Dirac equation: Estimation of the weights of $C$, $P$ and $CP$ symmetry violating terms in positronium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new theoretical method is developed for the solution of the two-body bound-state Dirac equation for positronium. Only Coulomb potential was included in the Dirac Hamiltonian. It is shown that the two-body Dirac Hamiltonian can be written in the Hermitian matrix form of the $4\times 4$ size and contains terms, responsible for the violation of the $P$, $C$, and $CP$ symmetries. Numerical results for the energy spectrum of the para- and ortho-positronium ground states performed within the variational method using the harmonic oscillator basis functions are in good agreement with a high-precision finite-element method of T.C. Scott et al. The weights of the $P$ and $CP$ symmetry-violating components in the para-positronium ground state are identical to the weight of the $P$ symmetry-violating component of the ortho-Ps and are estimated to be 6.6E-6. The weights of the $C$ and $CP$ symmetry-violating components of the ortho-Ps are equal to the 2/3 and 1/3 parts of this value, respectively. These numbers are less by two orders of magnitude than the precision limit of current experimental facilities.</description>
