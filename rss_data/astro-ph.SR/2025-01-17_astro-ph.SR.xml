      <title>A novel q-PED method: precise physical properties of a merger-origin binary Cepheid OGLE-LMC-CEP-1347</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a double-lined binary (SB2) classical Cepheid, OGLE-LMC-CEP-1347, was discovered, with the orbital period (P$_{\rm orb} = 59$ days) five times shorter than of any binary Cepheid known before. The expected mass of the Cepheid was below $3.5$ M$_\odot$, which, if confirmed, would also probe the uncharted territory. The system configuration also pointed to the Cepheid as a merger. We present a novel method for determining precise physical parameters of binary Cepheids using both theory and observations. This q-PED method combines the measured mass ratio (q), pulsation (P), and evolutionary (E) models, and the known distance (D) supplemented with multi-band photometry. Applying it, we determined the mass of the Cepheid of $3.42 \pm 0.09$ M$_\odot$, its radius of $13.65 \pm 0.27$ R$_\odot$, the companion mass of $1.89 \pm 0.04$ M$_\odot$ and radius of $12.5 \pm 0.62$ R$_\odot$. With the current configuration, the apparent evolutionary age difference of almost $1$ Gyr between the components strongly favors the Cepheid merger origin scenario. If so, the actual age of the Cepheid would be $1.1$ Gyr, on the edge of Population II stars, indicating a significant fraction of Cepheids may be much older than typically assumed. We also applied our method to an eclipsing binary Cepheid with accurately determined physical parameters, obtaining a close agreement, which confirmed our method's reliability.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Neutrino Mass Hierarchy from Isotopic Ratios of Supernova Nucleosynthesis Products in Presolar Grains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the nucleosynthesis in a core-collapse supernova model including newly calculated neutrino-induced reaction rates with both collective and Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) neutrino-flavor oscillations considered. We show that the measurement of a pair of $^{11}$B/$^{10}$B and $^{138}$La/$^{139}$La or $^6$Li/$^7$Li and $^{138}$La/$^{139}$La in presolar grains that are inferred to have originated from core-collapse supernovae could constrain the neutrino mass hierarchy. The new shell-model and the model of quasi-particle random phase approximation in the estimate of three important neutrino-induced reactions, $\nu+^{16}$O, $\nu+^{20}$Ne, and $\nu+^{138}$Ba are applied in our reaction network. The new rates decrease the calculated $^{7}$Li/$^{6}$Li ratio by a factor of five compared with the previous study. More interestingly, these new rates result in a clear separation of the isotopic ratio of $^{11}$B/$^{10}$B between normal and inverted mass hierarchies in the O/Ne, O/C, and C/He layers where $^{138}$La abundance depends strongly on the mass hierarchy. In these layers, the sensitivity of the calculated abundances of $^{10,11}$B and $^{6,7}$Li to the nuclear reaction uncertainties is also tiny. Therefore, we propose that the $^{11}$B/$^{10}$B vs. $^{138}$La/$^{139}$La and $^6$Li/$^7$Li vs. $^{138}$La/$^{139}$La in type X silicon carbide grains sampled material from C/He layer can be used as a new probe to constrain the neutrino mass hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Long-term Simultaneous Monitoring Observations of SiO and H2O Masers toward the Mira Variable WX Serpentis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results from long-term simultaneous monitoring observations of SiO and H2O masers toward the Mira variable star WX Serpentis. This study has been conducted with 21m single-dish radio telescopes of the Korean VLBI Network from 2009 June to 2021 June. Five maser lines were considered: SiO v=1, 2, J=1-0; SiO v=1, J=2-1, 3-2, and H2O 6(1,6)-5(2,3) transitions, with the SiO maser lines distributed near the stellar velocity and the H2O maser exhibiting an asymmetric line profile with five to six peaked components. Intense H2O maser emissions suddenly appeared in 2019 September, indicating flaring. The intensity variations of SiO and H2O masers are strongly correlated with the optical light curve (OLC) of the central star, with individual phase lags; the phase lag of the H2O maser relative to the OLC is larger than that of the SiO masers. The consequent phase difference between the SiO masers and the H2O maser likely indicates that their formation regions and main driving mechanisms are different from each other. The SiO masers in WX Ser exhibit a dominant single-peak velocity distribution, similar to other Mira variable stars. However, the H2O maser displays distinct morphological features, showing a radial acceleration and preferential intensity dominance at blueshifted velocities. This suggests that the H2O maser clouds of WX Ser are moving outward, thereby developing an asymmetric outflow owing to nonuniform material ejection from the stellar atmosphere. The findings confirm that an initial asymmetric outflow structure emerged during the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch phase, specifically in the Mira variable star stage.</description>

      <title>Structure formation in O-type stars and Wolf-Rayet stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulent small-scale structures in the envelopes and winds of massive stars have long been suggested as the cause for excessive line broadening that could not be explained by other mechanisms such as thermal broadening. However, the origin of these structures, particularly in the envelope, has not been extensively studied. We study the origin of structures seen in 2D unified stellar atmosphere and wind simulations of O stars and Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. Particularly, we study whether the structure growth in the simulations is consistent with sub-surface convection, as is commonly assumed to be the origin of this turbulence. Using a linear stability analysis of the optically thick envelopes of massive stars, we identified multiple instabilities that could drive structure growth. We quantified the structure growth in the non-linear simulations of O stars and WR stars by computing density power spectra and tracking their temporal evolution. Then, we compared these results to the analytical results from the stability analysis. The stability analysis leads to two possible instabilities: the convective instability and an acoustic instability. Analytic expressions for the growth rates of these different instabilities are found. In particular, strong radiative diffusion damps the growth rate $\omega$ of the convective instability leading to a distinct $\omega \sim 1/k^2$ dependence on wavenumber $k$. From our power spectra analysis of the simulations, however, we find that structure growth rather increases with $k$ - tentatively as $\omega \sim \sqrt{k}$. Our results suggest that structures in luminous O and WR star envelopes do not primarily develop from the sub-surface convective instability. Rather the growth seems compatible with either the acoustic instability in the radiation-dominated regime or with Rayleigh-Taylor type instabilities, although the exact origin remains inconclusive for now.</description>

      <title>The White Dwarf Pareto: Tracing Mass Loss in Binary Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The white dwarf mass distribution has been studied primarily at two extremes: objects that presumably evolved as single stars and members of close binaries that likely underwent substantial interaction. This work considers the intermediate separation regime of ~1 au and demonstrates how binary interaction affects white dwarf masses. The binary mass ratio distribution is utilized for this purpose. Modeled as a truncated Pareto profile, this distribution provides insights into the populations' properties and evolutionary history. When applied to homogeneous samples of binaries with giant primaries of similar age, the distribution's shape constrains the fraction of white dwarf companions, the white dwarf mass distribution, and the properties of their progenitors. As a test case, this method is applied to a small spectroscopic sample of binaries in open clusters with red giant primaries and orbital periods between 0.5 and 20 years. The analysis reveals that white dwarfs in these systems are ~20% less massive than their isolated counterparts, with a typical mass of ~0.55 Msun. Their progenitors likely lost 80-85% of their mass, with binary interactions enhancing mass loss by an additional ~0.2 Msun. These findings highlight the utility of this approach for studying binary evolution and improving population models, particularly with future datasets from Gaia and other large-scale surveys.</description>

      <title>REsolved ALMA and SMA Observations of Nearby Stars (REASONS): A population of 74 resolved planetesimal belts at millimetre wavelengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planetesimal belts are ubiquitous around nearby stars, and their spatial properties hold crucial information for planetesimal and planet formation models. We present resolved dust observations of 74 planetary systems as part of the REsolved ALMA and SMA Observations of Nearby Stars (REASONS) survey and archival reanalysis. We uniformly modelled interferometric visibilities for the entire sample to obtain the basic spatial properties of each belt, and combined these with constraints from multi-wavelength photometry. We report key findings from a first exploration of this legacy dataset: (1) Belt dust masses are depleted over time in a radially dependent way, with dust being depleted faster in smaller belts, as predicted by collisional evolution. (2) Most belts are broad discs rather than narrow rings, with much broader fractional widths than rings in protoplanetary discs. We link broad belts to either unresolved substructure or broad planetesimal discs produced if protoplanetary rings migrate. (3) The vertical aspect ratios (h = H/R) of 24 belts indicate orbital inclinations of 1-20 degrees, implying relative particle velocities of 0.1-4 km/s, and no clear evolution of heights with system age. This could be explained by early stirring within the belt by large bodies (with sizes of at least 140 km to the size of the Moon), by inheritance of inclinations from the protoplanetary disc stage, or by a diversity in evolutionary pathways and gravitational stirring mechanisms. We release the REASONS legacy multidimensional sample of millimetre-resolved belts to the community as a valuable tool for follow-up multi-wavelength observations and population modelling studies.</description>

      <title>Background exoplanet candidates in the original Kepler field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. During the primary Kepler mission, between 2009 and 2013, about 150,000 pre-selected targets were observed with a 29.42 minute-long cadence. However, a survey of background stars that fall within the field of view (FOV) of the downloaded apertures of the primary targets has revealed a number of interesting objects. In previous papers we have presented surveys of short period Eclipsing Binaries and RR Lyrae stars.
  Aims. The current survey of the Kepler background is concentrated on identifying longer-period eclipsing binaries and pulsating stars. These will be the subject of later papers. In the course of this survey, in addition to eclipsing binaries and pulsating stars, seven exoplanet candidates have been uncovered and in this paper we report on these candidates.
  Methods. We use Lomb-Scargle (LS), light curve transit search and Phase Dispersion Minimisation (PDM) methods to reveal pixels that show significant periodicities, resulting in the identification of the seven exoplanet candidates. We have prepared the light curves for analysis using Pytransit software and cross matched the pixel coordinates with Gaia and other catalogues to identify the sources.
  Results.We identify seven Hot Jupiter exoplanet candidates with planet radii ranging from 0.8878 to 1.5174 RJup and periods ranging from 2.5089 to 4.7918 days.</description>

      <title>Direct evidence for $r$-process nucleosynthesis in delayed MeV emission from the SGR 1806-20 magnetar giant flare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of heavy elements synthesized through the rapid neutron capture process ($r$-process) has been an enduring mystery for over half a century. Cehula et al. (2024) recently showed that magnetar giant flares, among the brightest transients ever observed, can shock-heat and eject neutron star crustal material at high velocity, achieving the requisite conditions for an $r$-process. Patel et al. (in prep.) confirmed an $r$-process in these ejecta using detailed nucleosynthesis calculations. Radioactive decay of the freshly synthesized nuclei releases a forest of gamma-ray lines, Doppler broadened by the high ejecta velocities $v \gtrsim 0.1c$ into a quasi-continuous spectrum peaking around 1 MeV. Here, we show that the predicted emission properties (light-curve, fluence, and spectrum) match a previously unexplained hard gamma-ray signal seen in the aftermath of the famous December 2004 giant flare from the magnetar SGR 1806-20. This MeV emission component, rising to peak around 10 minutes after the initial spike before decaying away over the next few hours, is direct observational evidence for the synthesis of $\sim 10^{-6}M_{\odot}$ of $r$-process elements. The discovery of magnetar giant flares as confirmed $r$-process sites, contributing at least $\sim 1$-$10\%$ of the total Galactic abundances, has implications for the Galactic chemical evolution, especially at the earliest epochs probed by low-metallicity stars. It also implicates magnetars as potentially dominant sources of heavy cosmic rays. Characterization of the $r$-process emission from giant flares by resolving decay line features offers a compelling science case for NASA's forthcoming COSI nuclear spectrometer, as well as next-generation MeV telescope missions.</description>

      <title>Mining the time axis with TRON. I. Millisecond pulsars in Omega Centauri, Terzan 5 and 47 Tucanae detected through MeerKAT interferometric imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medium-timescale (minutes to hours) radio transients are a relatively unexplored population. The wide field-of-view and high instantaneous sensitivity of instruments such as MeerKAT provides an opportunity to probe this class of sources, using image-plane detection techniques. We aim to systematically mine archival synthesis imaging data in order to search for medium-timescale transients and variables that are not detected by conventional long-track image synthesis techniques. We deploy a prototype blind transient and variable search pipeline named TRON. This processes calibrated visibility data, constructs high-time cadence images, performs a search for variability on multiple timescales, and extracts lightcurves for detected sources. As proof of concept, we apply it to three MeerKAT observations of globular clusters, known to host transient or variable sources. We detect a previously known eclipsing MSP suspected to be a `black widow' system, in the globular cluster Omega Centauri, with a light curve confirming the eclipsing nature of the emission. We detect a previously known `red back' eclipsing MSP in the globular cluster Terzan 5. Using observations of the globular cluster 47 Tucanae, we detect two known millisecond pulsars (MSPs), and one previously reported MSP candidate, with hints of eclipsing behaviour.</description>

Abstract: Medium-timescale (minutes to hours) radio transients are a relatively unexplored population. The wide field-of-view and high instantaneous sensitivity of instruments such as MeerKAT provides an opportunity to probe this class of sources, using image-plane detection techniques. The previous letter in this series describes our project and associated TRON pipeline designed to mine archival MeerKAT data for transient and variable sources. In this letter, we report on a new transient, a radio flare, associated with Gaia DR3 6865945581361480448, a G type star, whose parallax places it at a distance of 1334 pc. Its duration and high degree of circular polarization suggests electron cyclotron maser instability as the mechanism, consistent with an RS CVn variable.</description>

      <title>Jet-shaped filamentary ejecta in common envelope evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conduct three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamical simulations of common envelope evolution (CEE) of a neutron star (NS) that launches jets as it spirals in inside the envelope of a rotating red supergiant (RSG) stellar envelope and find that Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities form filamentary ejecta. We first study the 3D RSG envelope properties before we launch the jets. Adding envelope rotation causes the RSG envelope to expand in the equatorial plane and contract along the poles, leading to non-radial oscillations that decay after two oscillation periods, like the radial oscillation of the non-rotating model. In addition, the envelope becomes convective with large vortices, as in the non-rotating case. Since RSG stars oscillate and have envelope convection, we strengthen the claim that there is no need to relax one-dimensional stellar models of cool giant stars when transporting them to 3D grids. When adding jets, the 3D simulations that include pre-set envelope rotation show that envelope rotation leads to more prominent spiral structures of the ejecta than in the non-rotating case. We map the envelope zones that are Rayleigh-Taylor unstable and conclude that this instability forms the filamentary ejecta, with and without envelope rotation. The jet-inflated high-pressure volumes around the NS accelerate the envelope, a process prone to Rayleigh-Taylor instability.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Bursty Star Formation in Dwarf Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dwarf galaxy star formation histories are theoretically expected to be bursty, potentially leaving distinct imprints on their chemical evolution. We propose that episodic starbursts with quiescent periods longer than $\sim$100 Myr should lead to discontinuous tracks in a dwarf galaxy's [$\alpha$/Fe]-[Fe/H] chemical abundance plane, with metallicity gaps as large as 0.3-0.5 dex at [Fe/H] = -2. This occurs due to continued Fe production by Type Ia supernovae during quiescent periods. We demonstrate that Gaussian mixture models can statistically distinguish discontinuous and continuous tracks based on the Akaike Information Criterion. Applying this method to APOGEE observations of the Sculptor dSph galaxy suggests an episodic star formation history with $\sim$300 Myr quiescent periods. While current dwarf galaxy datasets are limited by small spectroscopic sample sizes, future surveys and extremely large telescopes will enable determining large numbers of precise chemical abundances, opening up the investigation of very short timescales in early dwarf galaxy formation. This unprecedentedly high time resolution of dwarf galaxy formation in the early Universe has important implications for understanding both reionization in the early Universe and the episodic star formation cycle of dwarf galaxies.</description>

      <title>On the diversity of strongly-interacting Type IIn supernovae</title>

Abstract: Massive stars experience strong mass-loss, producing a dense, H-rich circumstellar medium (CSM). After the explosion, the collision and continued interaction of the supernova (SN) ejecta with the CSM power the light curve through the conversion of kinetic energy into radiation. When the interaction is strong, the light curve shows a broad peak and high luminosity lasting for a relatively long time. Also the spectral evolution is slower, compared to non-interacting SNe. Energetic shocks between the ejecta and the CSM create the ideal conditions for particle acceleration and production of high-energy (HE) neutrinos above 1 TeV. In this paper, we study four strongly-interacting Type IIn SNe: 2021acya, 2021adxl, 2022qml, and 2022wed to highlight their peculiar characteristics, derive the kinetic energy of the explosion and the characteristics of the CSM, infer clues on the possible progenitors and their environment and relate them to the production of HE neutrinos. The SNe analysed in this sample exploded in dwarf, star-forming galaxies and they are consistent with energetic explosions and strong interaction with the surrounding CSM. For SNe 2021acya and 2022wed, we find high CSM masses and mass-loss rates, linking them to very massive progenitors. For SN 2021adxl, the spectral analysis and less extreme CSM mass suggest a stripped-envelope massive star as possible progenitor. SN 2022qml is marginally consistent with being a Type Ia thermonuclear explosion embedded in a dense CSM. The mass-loss rates for all SNe are consistent with the expulsion of several solar masses of material during eruptive episodes in the last few decades before the explosion. Finally, we find that the SNe in our sample are marginally consistent with HE neutrino production.</description>

      <title>SN 2023ixf -- an average-energy explosion with circumstellar medium and a precursor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Abridged: The fortunate proximity of the SN2023ixf allowed astronomers to follow its evolution from almost the moment of the collapse of the progenitor's core. SN2023ixf can be explained as an explosion of a massive star with an energy of 0.7e51 erg, however with a greatly reduced envelope mass, probably because of binary interaction. In our radiative-transfer simulations, the SN ejecta of 6 Msun interact with circumstellar material (CSM) of ~0.6 Msun extending to 1.e15 cm, which results in a light curve (LC) peak matching that of SN2023ixf. The origin of this required CSM might be gravity waves originating from convective shell burning, which could enhance wind-like mass-loss during the late stages of stellar evolution. The steeply rising, low-luminosity flux during the first hours after observationally confirmed non-detection, however, cannot be explained by the collision of the energetic SN shock with the CSM. Instead, we considered it as a precursor that we could fit by the emission from ~0.5 Msun of matter that was ejected with an energy of 1.e49 erg a fraction of a day before the main shock of the SN explosion reached the surface of the progenitor. The source of this energy injection into the outermost shell of the stellar envelope could also be dynamical processes related to the convective activity in the progenitor's interior or envelope. Alternatively, the early rise of the LC could point to the initial breakout of a highly non-spherical SN shock or of fast-moving, asymmetrically ejected matter that was swept out well ahead of the SN shock, potentially in a low-energy, nearly relativistic jet. We also discuss that pre-SN outbursts and LC precursors can be used to study or to constrain energy deposition in the outermost stellar layers by the decay of exotic particles, such as axions, which could be produced simultaneously with neutrinos in the newly formed, hot neutron star.</description>

      <title>Strong constraints on a sharp change in $G$ as a solution to the Hubble tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15301v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been proposed that the gravitational constant $G$ abruptly decreased around 130 Myr ago, making Type Ia supernovae (SNe) in the Hubble flow intrinsically brighter than those in host galaxies with Cepheid distances. This would make Hubble flow SNe more distant, causing redshifts to rise slower with distance, potentially solving the Hubble tension. We explore a wide range of unattractive consequences of this ''$G$ step model'' (GSM). We find that since the luminosities of Sun-like stars scale as approximately $G^{5.6}$, the Solar luminosity would have dropped substantially 130 Myr ago in this scenario, likely pushing Earth into a planetary glaciation. However, there was no Snowball Earth episode in the last 500 Myr. The GSM also implies that the length of a year would have abruptly increased by about 10%, but the number of days per year has evolved broadly continuously according to geochronometry and cyclostratigraphy. The GSM would drastically alter stellar evolution, causing the Sun to have exhausted about 2/3 of its fuel supply rather than 1/2. This would lead make the Sun's helioseismic age exceed that of the oldest meteorite samples, but these agree excellently in practice. The expected age of the Universe also agrees well with that of the oldest Galactic stars assuming constant $G$. The GSM however implies these stars are younger, creating a lack of stars from the first 3 Gyr of cosmic history. These arguments cast severe doubt on the viability of the GSM: the solution to the Hubble tension should be sought elsewhere.</description>
