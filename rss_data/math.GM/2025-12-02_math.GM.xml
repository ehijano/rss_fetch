      <title>Structural Obstructions in Fixed-Shift Prime Correlations via Mellin-Laplace Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a Mellin-Laplace analytic framework for the fixed-shift prime correlation r_h(n) = Lambda(n) Lambda(n+h) for h not equal to 0. This sequence has no multiplicative structure, no Euler product, and no singularity at s = 1.
  For every compactly supported Mellin-Laplace admissible kernel W, the smoothed shifted sum S_{W,h}(N) admits an absolutely convergent Mellin representation that holds entirely in the half-plane Re(s) &gt; 1, with no use of analytic continuation.
  The Mellin transform of W provides quantitative vertical decay, enabling full contour control on the boundary line Re(s) = 1 + eps. A Tauberian boundary analysis shows that both components of the boundary integral grow like N^{1+eps}, while the oscillatory part contributes an unavoidable N^{1+eps} (log N)^2 term. As a result, the boundary integral cannot be decomposed into a dominant main term plus a smaller error term, revealing a structural obstruction to main-term extraction for fixed-shift correlations.
  These results give a complete analytic description of shifted prime correlations in their natural domain of convergence and clarify the analytic difficulties underlying problems such as the twin prime conjecture.</description>

      <title>Additive generator pairs of overlap functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\theta:[0,1]\rightarrow[-\infty,+\infty]$ be a function with both $\theta(x^{-})$ and $\theta(x^{+})$ existing for every $x\in [0,1]$ and $\vartheta:[-\infty,+\infty]\rightarrow[-\infty,+\infty]$ be a function. In this article we completely characterize the pair $(\theta,\vartheta)$ for the bivariate function $O_{\theta,\vartheta}: [0,1]^{2}\rightarrow[0,1]$ given by $$O_{\theta,\vartheta}(x,y)=\vartheta(\theta(x)+\theta(y))$$ being an overlap function. In particular, we give analytical expressions of some transformations for the pair $(\theta,\vartheta)$.</description>

      <title>Power of Continuous Triangular Norms with Application to Intuitionistic Fuzzy Information Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.13045v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The power operation of continuous Archimedean triangular norms (t-norms) is fundamental for generalizing the multiplication and power operations of intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs) within the framework of continuous Archimedean t-norms. However, due to the lack of systematic research on the power operation of general continuous t-norms in theory, it greatly limits the further generalization of the multiplication and power operations for IFSs via general continuous t-norms. This paper aims to investigate the power operation of continuous t-norms and develop some IF information aggregation methods. In theory, it is proved that a continuous t-norm is power stable if and only if every point is a power stable point, and if and only if it is the minimum t-norm, or it is strict, or it is an ordinal sum of strict t-norms. Moreover, the representation theorem of continuous t-norms is used to obtain the computational formula for the power of continuous t-norms. Based on the power operation of t-norms, four fundamental operations induced by a continuous t-norm for the IFSs are introduced. Furthermore, various IF aggregation operators based on these four fundamental operations, namely the IF weighted average (IFWA), IF weighted geometric (IFWG), and IF mean weighted average and geometric (IFMWAG) operators, are defined, and their properties are analyzed. In application, a new decision-making algorithm is designed based on the IFMWAG operator, which can remove the hindrance of indiscernibility on the boundaries of some classical aggregation operators. The practical applicability, comparative analysis, and advantages of the study with other decision-making methods are furnished to ascertain the efficacy of the designed method.</description>

      <title>A General Fixed-Point Theorem for Correspondences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new local condition on correspondences called the "weak local connectedness property" (WLCP) is introduced. Working in ZFC, it is shown in our main theorem that - under mild restrictions - any correspondence from a connected subset X of a real TVS to itself will have a fixed point if the WLCP holds at each point of the domain. Since the WLCP generalizes several well - known conditions on correspondences, it is utilized in this paper to gather together a sampling of several disparate fixed-point and related results that are special cases of our main theorem.</description>

      <title>Characterization of t-norms on normal convex functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17640v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Type-2 fuzzy set (T2 FS) were introduced by Zadeh in 1965, and the membership degrees of T2 FSs are type-1 fuzzy sets (T1 FSs). Owing to the fuzziness of membership degrees, T2 FSs can better model the uncertainty of real life, and thus, type-2 rule-based fuzzy systems (T2 RFSs) become hot research topics in recent decades. In T2 RFS, the compositional rule of inference is based on triangular norms (t-norms) defined on complete lattice $(L,\sqsubseteq)$ ( L is the set of all convex normal functions from [0,1] to [0,1], and , $\sqsubseteq$ is the so-called convolution order). Hence, the choice of t-norm on $(L,\sqsubseteq)$ may influence the performance of T2 RFS. Therefore, it is significant to broad the set of t-norms among which domain experts can choose most suitable one. To construct t-norms on $(L,\sqsubseteq)$, the mainstream method is convolution which is induced by two operators on the unit interval [0,1]. A key problem appears naturally, when convolution is a t-norm on $(L,\sqsubseteq)$. This paper has solved this problem completely. Moreover, note that the computational complexity of operators prevent the application of T2 RFSs. This paper also provides one kind of convolutions which are t-norms on $(L,\sqsubseteq)$ and extremely easy to calculate.</description>

      <title>A Classification of Elements of Sequence Space $Seq(\mathbb{R})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sequence space of all real-valued sequences, denoted $Seq(\mathbb{R})$, is typically investigated through the lens of infinite-dimensional vector spaces, utilizing Banach space norms or Schauder bases. This work proposes a complementary, constructive classification based instead on the asymptotic limit profile encoded by the pair $(\liminf a_n, \limsup a_n)$. We demonstrate that this perspective naturally partitions $Seq(\mathbb{R})$ into seven mutually disjoint macroscale blocks, covering behaviors from finite convergence to bounded and unbounded oscillation. For each block, we provide explicit closed-form representative sequences and establish that every constituent class possesses the cardinality of the continuum. Furthermore, we investigate the structural relationships between these blocks at two distinct levels of granularity. At the macroscale, we employ injective mappings to define an idealized connectivity graph, while at the microscale, we introduce a connection relation governed by the Hadamard (pointwise) product. This dual analysis reveals a rich directed graph structure where the block of finite convergent sequences functions both as the only block subspace and as a global attractor with no outgoing connections. Statistical comparisons between the idealized and realized adjacency matrices indicate that the pointwise product structure realizes approximately two-thirds of the theoretically possible macroscale relations. Ultimately, this partition-based framework endows the seemingly chaotic space $Seq(\mathbb{R})$ with a transparent, geometrically interpretable internal structure.</description>
