      <title>Characterisation of Front-End Electronics of ChaSTE experiment onboard Chandayaan-3 lander</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chandra Surface Thermophysical Experiment (ChaSTE) is one of the payloads flown onboard the Chandrayaan-3 lander. The objective of the experiment is in-situ investigation of thermal behaviour of outermost 100 mm layer of the lunar surface by deploying a thermal probe. The probe consists of 10 temperature sensors (Platinum RTDs) mounted at different locations along the length of the probe to measure lunar soil temperatures as a function of depth. A heater is also mounted on the probe for thermal conductivity measurements. The onboard electronics of ChaSTE has two parts, Front-End Electronics (FEE) and processing electronics (PE). The front-end electronics (FEE) card is responsible for carrying out necessary sensor signal conditioning,which includes exciting the RTD sensors,acquiring analog voltages and then converting the acquired analog signals to digital signals using an Analog to Digital Converter(ADC). The front-end card is further interfaced with the processing electronics card for digital processing and spacecraft interface.The calibration, characterisation and functional test activities of Front-End Electronics of ChaSTE were carried out with the objective of testing and ensuring proper functionality and performance.A two phase calibration process involving electronic offset correction and temperature calibration were carried out. All these activities were successfully completed and the results from them provided us with a really good understanding of the behaviour of the FEE under different thermal and electrical conditions as well as when subjected to the simulated conditions of the actual ChaSTE experiment. The performance of the ChaSTE front-end electronics was very much within the design margins and its behaviour in simulated lunar environment was as desired. The data from these activities is useful in the interpretation of the actual science data of ChaSTE.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo calculations of cryogenic photodetector readout of scintillating GaAs for dark matter detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery that GaAs(Si,B) is a bright cryogenic scintillator with no apparent afterglow offers new opportunities for detecting rare, low-energy, electronic excitations from interacting dark matter. This paper presents Monte Carlo calculations of the scintillation photon detection efficiencies of optical cavities using three current cryogenic photodetector technologies. In order of photon detection efficiency these are: (1) Ge/TES: germanium absorbers that convert interacting photons to athermal phonons that are readout by transition edge sensors, (2) KID: kinetic induction detectors that respond to the breaking of cooper pairs by a change in resonance frequency, and (3) SNSPD: superconducting nanowire single photon detectors, where a photon briefly transitions a thin wire from superconducting to normal. The detection efficiencies depend strongly on the n-type GaAs absolute absorption coefficient KA, which is a part of the narrow beam absorption that has never been directly measured. However, the high cryogenic scintillation luminosity of GaAs(Si,B) sets an upper limit on KA of 0.03/cm. Using that value and properties published for Ge/TES, KID, and SNSPD photodetectors, this work calculates that those photodetectors attached to opposing faces of a 1 cm3 cubic GaAs(Si,B) crystal in an optical cavity with gold mirrors would have scintillation photon detection efficiencies of 35%, 25%, and 8%, respectively. Larger values would be expected for lower values of KA.</description>

      <title>A novel effective technique for charge neutralization on bulk insulator surfaces in XPS measurements by introducing UV light irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When XPS analyses are performed on insulator surfaces, shift and deformation of spectra peaks typically take place due to the surface charging. To achieve reliable XPS measurements, neutralization techniques have been widely adopted but their effectiveness are still limited, and thus, new neutralization technologies are urgently needed. Here, stable XPS spectra in which all the peaks undergo a reduced and nearly constant shift without significant deformation and broadening were obtained by introducing the UV light irradiation, implying that the introduction of the UV light can not only greatly attenuate the strength but also significantly improve both the temporal stability and the spatial uniformity of the surface charging during XPS measurements. This phenomenon, referred to as UV-assisted neutralization in this article, was found as effective as the most commonly used dual beam charge neutralization. Further observations show that the suppression of the charging issue comes from the adsorption of the UV-excited photoelectrons onto the X-ray irradiation region. This neutralization method, combined with the binding energy referencing, can be expected to become a promising alternative technique for solving the charging issues in XPS measurements.</description>

      <title>INTENTAS -- An entanglement-enhanced atomic sensor for microgravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The INTENTAS project aims to develop an atomic sensor utilizing entangled Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in a microgravity environment. This key achievement is necessary to advance the capability for measurements that benefit from both entanglement-enhanced sensitivities and extended interrogation times. The project addresses significant challenges related to size, weight, and power management (SWaP) specific to the experimental platform at the Einstein-Elevator in Hannover. The design ensures a low-noise environment essential for the creation and detection of entanglement. Additionally, the apparatus features an innovative approach to the all-optical creation of BECs, providing a flexible system for various configurations and meeting the requirements for rapid turnaround times. Successful demonstration of this technology in the Einstein-Elevator will pave the way for a future deployment in space, where its potential applications will unlock high-precision quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>TALOS (Total Automation of LabVIEW Operations for Science): A framework for autonomous control systems for complex experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern physics experiments are frequently very complex, relying on multiple simultaneous events to happen in order to obtain the desired result. The experiment control system plays a central role in orchestrating the measurement setup: However, its development is often treated as secondary with respect to the hardware, its importance becoming evident only during the operational phase. Therefore, the AEgIS (Antimatter Experiment: Gravity, Interferometry, Spectroscopy) collaboration has created a framework for easily coding control systems, specifically targeting atomic, quantum, and antimatter experiments. This framework, called Total Automation of LabVIEW Operations for Science (TALOS), unifies all the machines of the experiment in a single entity, thus enabling complex high-level decisions to be taken, and it is constituted by separate modules, called MicroServices, that run concurrently and asynchronously. This enhances the stability and reproducibility of the system while allowing for continuous integration and testing while the control system is running. The system demonstrated high stability and reproducibility, running completely unsupervised during the night and weekends of the data-taking campaigns. The results demonstrate the suitability of TALOS to manage an entire physics experiment in full autonomy: being open-source, experiments other than the AEgIS experiment can benefit from it.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the spatial resolution of PET imaging system measuring polarization-correlated Compton events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies of positron emission tomography (PET) devices have shown that the detection of polarization-correlated annihilation quanta can potentially reduce the background and creation of false lines of response (LORs) leading to improved image quality. We developed a novel PET demonstrator system, capable of measuring correlated gamma photons with single-layer Compton polarimeters to explore the potential of the method. We tested the system using sources with clinically relevant activities at the University Hospital Centre Zagreb. Here we present, for the first time, the images of two Ge-68 line sources, reconstructed solely from the correlated annihilation events. The spatial resolution at two different diameters is determined and compared to the one obtained from events with photoelectric interaction.</description>

      <title>The ITS3 detector and physics reach of the LS3 ALICE Upgrade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During Large Hadron Collider (LHC) Long Shutdown 3 (LS3) (2026-28), the ALICE experiment is replacing its inner-most three tracking layers by a new detector, Inner Tracking System 3. It will be based on newly developed wafer-scale monolithic active pixel sensors, which are bent into truly cylindrical layers and held in place by light mechanics made from carbon foam. Unprecedented low values of material budget (per layer) and closeness to interaction point (19 mm) lead to a factor two improvement in pointing resolutions from very low $p_\text{T}$ (O(100MeV/$c$)), achieving, for example, 20 ${\mu}$m and 15 ${\mu}$m in the transversal and longitudinal directions, respectively, for 1 GeV/c primary charged pions. After a successful R\&amp;D phase 2019-2023, which demonstrated the feasibility of this innovational detector, the final sensor and mechanics are being developed right now. This contribution will briefly review the conceptual design and the main R&amp;D achievements, as well as the current activities and road to completion and installation. It concludes with a projection of the improved physics performance, in particular for heavy-flavour hadrons, as well as for thermal dielectrons, that will come into reach with this new detector installed.</description>

      <title>Ultra-broadband room-temperature Fourier transform spectrometer with watt-level power consumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) has matured into a versatile technique with relevance for environmental monitoring, pharmaceutical research, and food safety applications. However, compared to other spectroscopic methods, it experiences slower progress in terms of power optimization, miniaturization, and adoption by industry. To overcome this limitation, we developed an ultra-broadband room-temperature FTIR instrument relying on commercially available components that offers a spectral coverage from 1.6 $\mu$m to 31 $\mu$m (9.7-190 THz) without changing optics at a single-Watt-level of electrical power consumption. To demonstrate the capabilities of the instrument, we measured atmospheric species in multiple spectral regions with better than 1.5 cm$^{-1}$ resolution.</description>

      <title>Design of a large-scale superconducting dipole magnet for the CEE spectrometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The CSR External-target Experiment (CEE) is a large-scale spectrometer under construction at the Heavy Ion Research Facility in Lanzhou (HIRFL) for studying the phase structure of nuclear matter at high baryon density and the equation of states of nuclear matter at supra-saturation densities. One of the key components is a large acceptance dipole magnet with a central field of 0.5 T and the homogeneity of 5% within a 1 m long, 1.2 m wide, and 0.9 m high aperture. Detectors will be installed within this aperture. An innovative design for the superconducting detector magnet is proposed that goes beyond the conventional approach. The magnet is designed as a coil-dominant type, with conductors discretized on a racetrack-shaped cross-section to generate the necessary fields. A warm iron yoke is used to enhance the central field and minimize the stray field. The magnet has overall dimensions of 3.4 meters in length, 2.7 meters in height, and 4.3 meters in width. The coils will be wound using a 19-strand rope cable comprised of 12 NbTi superconducting wires and 7 copper wires. The ratio of copper to superconductor of the cable is 6.9. The keel supports serve as the primary structural support for the coils to withstand the electromagnetic force. The coils will be indirectly cooled by liquid helium within three external helium vessels. To ensure reliable protection of the magnet during a quench, an active protection method combined with quench-back effect is employed. In this paper, we mainly present the detailed design of the magnetic field, structure, quench protection and cryostat for the spectrometer magnet.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that optomechanical systems can be primary pressure sensors with uncertainty as low as 1.1 % of reading via comparison with a pressure transfer standard. Our silicon nitride and silicon carbide sensors are short-term and long-term stable, displaying Allan deviations compatible with better than 1 % precision and baseline drift significantly lower than the transfer standard. We also investigate the performance of optomechanical devices as calibrated gauges, finding that they can achieve total uncertainty less than 1 %. The calibration procedure also yields the thin-film density of our sensors with state-of-the-art precision, aiding development of other calibration-free optomechanical sensors. Our results demonstrate that optomechanical pressure sensors can achieve accuracy, precision, and drift sufficient to replace high performance legacy gauges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Space-based gravitational wave detection is based on the astrodynamical equations derived from gravitational theory to detect changes in distance between spacecraft/celestial bodies and/or their state changes caused by gravitational waves. The fundamental method involves using electromagnetic waves (including radio waves, microwaves, light waves, X-rays, gamma rays, etc.) for Doppler tracking and comparing to the stable frequency standards (sources) at both the transmitting and receiving ends. Examples include microwave Doppler tracking, optical clock gravitational wave detection, atom interferometry gravitational wave detection, and laser interferometry gravitational wave detection. If the frequency sources at both ends are not sufficiently stable, a generalized dual-path Michelson interferometer based on Doppler tracking combinations is needed. Currently, the main space-based gravitational wave detectors under construction or planning are laser interferometers, which cover medium frequency (0.1-10 Hz) and low-frequency (millihertz 0.1-100 mHz and microhertz 0.1-100 {\mu}Hz) gravitational wave detection bands. This article reviews the current status and prospects of these gravitational wave detection methods.</description>

      <title>Computing virtual dark-field X-ray microscopy images of complex discrete dislocation structures from large-scale molecular dynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark-field X-ray Microscopy (DFXM) is a novel diffraction-based imaging technique that non-destructively maps the local deformation from crystalline defects in bulk materials. While studies have demonstrated that DFXM can spatially map 3D defect geometries, it is still challenging to interpret DFXM images of the high dislocation density systems relevant to macroscopic crystal plasticity. This work develops a scalable forward model to calculate virtual DFXM images for complex discrete dislocation (DD) structures obtained from atomistic simulations. Our new DD-DFXM model integrates a non-singular formulation for calculating the local strain from the DD structures and an efficient geometrical optics algorithm for computing the DFXM image from the strain. We apply the model to complex DD structures obtained from a large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of compressive loading on a single-crystal silicon. Simulated DFXM images exhibit prominent feature contrast for dislocations between the multiple slip systems, demonstrating the DFXM's potential to resolve features from dislocation multiplication. The integrated DD-DFXM model provides a toolbox for DFXM experimental design and image interpretation in the context of bulk crystal plasticity for the breadth of measurements across shock plasticity and the broader materials science community.</description>

Abstract: Grain boundaries are dominant imperfections in nanocrystalline materials that form a complex 3-dimensional (3D) network. Solute segregation to grain boundaries is strongly coupled to the grain boundary character, which governs the stability and macroscopic properties of nanostructured materials. Here, we develop a 3-dimensional transmission electron microscopy and atom probe tomography correlation framework to retrieve the grain boundary character and composition at the highest spatial resolution and chemical sensitivity by correlating four-dimensional scanning precession electron diffraction tomography (4D-SPED) and atom probe tomography (APT) on the same sample. We obtain the 3D grain boundary habit plane network and explore the preferential segregation of Cu and Si in a nanocrystalline Ni-W alloy. The correlation of structural and compositional information reveals that Cu segregates predominantly along high angle grain boundaries and incoherent twin boundaries, whereas Si segregation to low angle and incommensurate grain boundaries is observed. The novel full 3D correlative approach employed in this work opens up new possibilities to explore the 3D crystallographic and compositional nature of nanomaterials. This lays the foundation for both probing the true 3D structure-chemistry at the sub-nanometer scale and, consequentially, tailoring the macroscopic properties of advanced nanomaterials.</description>

      <title>A Low-Temperature Tunable Microcavity featuring High Passive Stability and Microwave Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open microcavities offer great potential for the exploration and utilization of efficient spin-photon interfaces with Purcell-enhanced quantum emitters thanks to their large spectral and spatial tunability combined with high versatility of sample integration. However, a major challenge for this platform is the sensitivity to cavity length fluctuations in the cryogenic environment, which leads to cavity resonance frequency variations and thereby a lowered averaged Purcell enhancement. This work presents a closed-cycle cryogenic fiber-based microcavity setup, which is in particular designed for a low passive vibration level, while still providing large tunability and flexibility in fiber and sample integration, and high photon collection efficiency from the cavity mode. At temperatures below 10 Kelvin, a stability level of around 25 picometer is reproducibly achieved in different setup configurations, including the extension with microwave control for manipulating the spin of cavity-coupled quantum emitters, enabling a bright photonic interface with optically active qubits.</description>

      <title>Raman signal enhancement via a microring resonator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Micro-ring resonators (MRRs) "trap" incoming light, and therefore, have been shown to achieve extremely high local intensities of light. Thus, they can be used to facilitate highly non-linear optical signals. By embedding materials that host non-linear optical processes inside the MRR, we expect to observe an enhancement in the strength of the non-linear optical signal. This concept is demonstrated here by extracting the Raman signature of graphene that is placed inside a MRR. A highly doped silica MRR which features an optical bus waveguide coupled to a loop (ring) tuned to near-infrared wavelengths is used. Raman signal with an excitation wavelength of 522 nm via third harmonic generation inside the MRR is observed. Higher order Raman signal of the embedded graphene at the 1597.6 nm excitation wavelength is also observed. This work demonstrates the feasibility of the MRR as a non-linear signal enhancer using novel MRR device setups.</description>

      <title>The environmental low-frequency background for macro-calorimeters at the millikelvin scale</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many of the most sensitive physics experiments searching for rare events, like neutrinoless double beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay and dark matter interactions, rely on cryogenic macro-calorimeters operating at the mK-scale. Located underground at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory (LNGS), in central Italy, CUORE (Cryogenic Underground Observatory for Rare Events) is one of the leading experiments for the search of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay, implementing the low-temperature calorimetric technology. We present a novel multi-detector analysis to correlate environmental phenomena with the low-frequency noise of low-temperature calorimeters. Indeed, the correlation of marine and seismic data with data from a pair of CUORE detectors indicates that cryogenic detectors are sensitive not only to intense vibrations generated by earthquakes, but also to the much fainter vibrations induced by marine microseisms in the Mediterranean Sea due to the motion of sea waves. Proving that cryogenic macro-calorimeters are sensitive to such environmental sources of noise opens the possibility of studying their impact on the detectors physics-case sensitivity. Moreover, this study could pave the road for technology developments dedicated to the mitigation of the noise induced by marine microseisms, from which the entire community of cryogenic calorimeters can benefit.</description>

      <title>ETROC1: The First Full Chain Precision Timing Prototype ASIC for CMS MTD Endcap Timing Layer Upgrade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14207v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the design and characterization of the first full chain precision timing prototype ASIC, named ETL Readout Chip version 1 (ETROC1) for the CMS MTD endcap timing layer (ETL) upgrade. The ETL utilizes Low Gain Avalanche Diode (LGAD) sensors to detect charged particles, with the goal to achieve a time resolution of 40 - 50 ps per hit, and 30 - 40 ps per track with hits from two detector layers. The ETROC1 is composed of a 5 x 5 pixel array and peripheral circuits. The pixel array includes a 4 x 4 active pixel array with an H-tree shaped network delivering clock and charge injection signals. Each active pixel is composed of various components, including a bump pad, a charge injection circuit, a pre-amplifier, a discriminator, a digital-to-analog converter, and a time-to-digital converter. These components play essential roles as the front-end link in processing LGAD signals and measuring timing-related information. The peripheral circuits provide clock signals and readout functionalities. The size of the ETROC1 chip is 7 mm x 9 mm. ETROC1 has been fabricated in a 65 nm CMOS process, and extensively tested under stimuli of charge injection, infrared laser, and proton beam. The time resolution of bump-bonded ETROC1 + LGAD chipsets reaches 42 - 46 ps per hit in the beam test.</description>

Abstract: Pressurized Helium-4 (PHe) based fast neutron scintillation detector offers an useful alternative to organic liquid-based scintillator due to its relatively low response to the $\gamma$-rays compared to the latter type of scintillator. In the present work, we have investigated the capabilities of a PHe detector for the detection of fast neutrons in a mixed radiation field where both the neutrons and the $\gamma$-rays are present. Discrimination between neutrons and $\gamma$-rays is achieved by using fast-slow charge integration method. We have also conducted systematic studies of the attenuation of fast neutrons and $\gamma$-rays by high-density polyethylene (HDPE). Additionally, the simulation analyses, conducted using GEANT4, provide detailed insights into the interactions of the radiation quanta with the PHe detector.</description>

Abstract: Micro-objects levitated in a vacuum are an exciting platform for precision sensing due to their low dissipation motion and the potential for control at the quantum level. Arrays of such sensors would allow noise cancellation, directionality, increased sensitivity and in the quantum regime the potential to exploit correlation and entanglement. We use neuromorphic detection via a single event-based camera to record the motion of an array of levitated microspheres. We present a truly scalable method for arbitrary multiparticle control by implementing real-time feedback to cool the motion of three objects simultaneously, the first demonstration of neuromorphic sensing for real-time control at the microscale.</description>

Abstract: The EIC will deliver collisions of electrons with protons and nuclei at a wide variety of energies and at luminosities up to 1000 times higher than HERA. Precise measurement of both the scattered electron and the hadronic final state is crucial for the physics of the EIC, necessitating unique designs for the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters in the backward, central, and forward regions. To ensure maximal containment of energy and acceptance for the required physics processes, the ePIC detector employs calorimetry over almost the entire polar angle. These proceedings provide an overview of the current calorimeter designs being employed in ePIC.</description>

      <title>Emission of Single and Few Electrons in XENON1T and Limits on Light Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.12116v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Delayed single- and few-electron emissions plague dual-phase time projection chambers, limiting their potential to search for light-mass dark matter. This paper examines the origins of these events in the XENON1T experiment. Characterization of the intensity of delayed electron backgrounds shows that the resulting emissions are correlated, in time and position, with high-energy events and can effectively be vetoed. In this work we extend previous S2-only analyses down to a single electron. From this analysis, after removing the correlated backgrounds, we observe rates &lt; 30 events/(electron*kg*day) in the region of interest spanning 1 to 5 electrons. We derive 90% confidence upper limits for dark matter-electron scattering, first direct limits on the electric dipole, magnetic dipole, and anapole interactions, and bosonic dark matter models, where we exclude new parameter space for dark photons and solar dark photons.</description>

      <title>Measurement of three-dimensional inclusive muon-neutrino charged-current cross sections on argon with the MicroBooNE detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06413v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the measurement of the differential cross section $d^{2}\sigma (E_{\nu})/ d\cos(\theta_{\mu}) dP_{\mu}$ for inclusive muon-neutrino charged-current scattering on argon. This measurement utilizes data from 6.4$\times10^{20}$ protons on target of exposure collected using the MicroBooNE liquid argon time projection chamber located along the Fermilab Booster Neutrino Beam with a mean neutrino energy of approximately 0.8~GeV. The mapping from reconstructed kinematics to truth quantities, particularly from reconstructed to true neutrino energy, is validated within uncertainties by comparing the distribution of reconstructed hadronic energy in data to that of the model prediction in different muon scattering angle bins after applying a conditional constraint from the muon momentum distribution in data. The success of this validation gives confidence that the missing energy in the MicroBooNE detector is well-modeled within uncertainties in simulation, enabling the unfolding to a three-dimensional measurement over muon momentum, muon scattering angle, and neutrino energy. The unfolded measurement covers an extensive phase space, providing a wealth of information useful for future liquid argon time projection chamber experiments measuring neutrino oscillations. Comparisons against a number of commonly used model predictions are included and their performance in different parts of the available phase-space is discussed.</description>

      <title>Mid-infrared characterization of NbTiN superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors on silicon-on-insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15959v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors are widely used for detecting individual photons across various wavelengths from ultraviolet to near-infrared range. Recently, there has been increasing interest in enhancing their sensitivity to single photons in the mid-infrared spectrum, driven by applications in quantum communication, spectroscopy and astrophysics. Here, we present our efforts to expand the spectral detection capabilities of U-shaped NbTiN-based superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors, fabricated in a 2-wire configuration on a silicon-on-insulator substrate, into the mid-infrared range. We demonstrate saturated internal detection efficiency extending up to a wavelength of 3.5 {\mu}m for a 5 nm thick and 50 nm wide NbTiN nanowire with a dark count rate less than 10 counts per second at 0.9 K and a rapid recovery time of 4.3 ns. The detectors are engineered for integration on waveguides in a silicon-on-insulator platform for compact, multi-channel device applications.</description>
