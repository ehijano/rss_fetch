      <title>On the smallest eigenvalues of $3$-colorable graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the set of the smallest eigenvalues attained by $3$-colorable graphs is dense in $(-\infty, -\lambda^*)$, where $\lambda^* = \rho^{1/2} + \rho^{-1/2} \approx 2.01980$ and $\rho$ is the positive real root of $x^3 = x + 1$. As a consequence, in the context of spherical two-distance sets, our result precludes any further refinement of the forbidden-subgraph method through the chromatic number of signed graphs.</description>

      <title>Divisible design graphs with selfloops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a basic theory for divisible design graphs with possible selfloops (LDDG's), and describe two infinite families of such graphs, some members of which are also classical examples of divisible design graphs without loops (DDG's). Among the described theoretical results is a discussion of the spectrum, a classification of all examples satisfying certain parameter restrictions or having at most three eigenvalues, a discussion of the structure of the improper and the disconnected examples, and a procedure called dual Seidel switching which allows to construct new examples of LDDG's from others.</description>

      <title>Normal $4$-pseudomanifolds with a relative 2-skeleton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of face-number-related invariants in simplicial complexes is a central topic in combinatorial topology. Among these, the invariant $g_2$ plays a significant role. For a normal $d$-pseudomanifold $K$ ($d \geq 3$), it is known that $g_2(K) \geq g_2(lk(v, K))$ for every vertex $v$. If $K$ has at most two singularities and satisfies $g_2(K) = g_2(lk(t, K))$ for a singular vertex $t$, then $g_3(K) \geq g_3(lk(t,K))$ holds. A normal $d$-pseudomanifold $K$ is called $g_2$- and $g_3$-optimal if $g_2(K) = g_2(lk (t,K))$ and $g_3(K) = g_3(lk (t,K))$ for a singular vertex $t$.
  In this article, we establish structural results for normal $4$-pseudomanifolds under $g_2$- and $g_3$-optimality conditions. We show that if $K$ is a normal $4$-pseudomanifold with exactly one singular vertex $t$ and is $g_2$- and $g_3$-optimal at $t$, then $K$ can be obtained from boundary complexes of $5$-simplices through a sequence of operations of types vertex foldings and connected sums. When $K$ has exactly two singularities and is $g_2$- and $g_3$-optimal at one singular vertex, it is derived from the boundary complexes of $4$-simplices through a sequence of operations of types one-vertex suspensions, vertex foldings, and connected sums. Alternatively, we prove that if $K$ has two singular vertices and is $g_2$- and $g_3$-optimal at one of them, then it arises from boundary complexes of $5$-simplices through a sequence of operations of types vertex foldings, edge foldings, and connected sums.</description>

      <title>On edge-colouring-games by Erd\H{o}s, and Bensmail and Mc Inerney</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider two games proposed by Erd\H{o}s, and one game by Bensmail and Mc Inerney, all with the same setup of two players alternately colouring one edge of a clique. We give observations and particular behaviour for each of these problems, and prove a first reduction towards confirming the conjecture by Bensmail and Mc Inerney. We state a conjecture for Erd\H{o}s' game on the largest induced maximum degree, and extensions to edge-transitive and, respectively, regular graphs.</description>

      <title>Unexpectedly, a symmetry on unlabeled graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We exhibit the joint symmetric distribution of the following two parameters on the set of unlabeled, simple, connected graphs with $n$ vertices. The first parameter is the maximal number of leaves attached to a vertex. The second parameter is the size of the largest set of vertices sharing the same closed neighborhood minus $1$.
  Apparently, this is the first example of a natural, non-trivial equidistribution of graph parameters on unlabeled connected graphs on a fixed set of vertices.
  Our proof is enumerative, using the theory of species. Exhibiting an explicit bijection interchanging the two parameters remains an open problem.</description>

      <title>The Erd\H{o}s-Rado Sunflower Problem for Vector Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The famous Erd\H{o}s-Rado sunflower conjecture suggests that an $s$-sun\-flower-free family of $k$-element sets has size at most $(Cs)^k$ for some absolute constant $C$. In this note, we investigate the analog problem for $k$-spaces over the field with $q$ elements. For $s \geq k+1$, we show that the largest $s$-sunflower-free family $\mathcal{F}$ satisfies
  \[
  1 \leq |\mathcal{F}| / q^{(s-1) \binom{k+1}{2} - k} \leq (q/(q-1))^k.
  \] For $s \leq k$, we show that
  \[
  q^{-\binom{k}{2}} \leq |\mathcal{F}| / q^{(s-1) \binom{k+1}{2} - k} \leq (q/(q-1))^k.
  \] Our lower bounds rely on an iterative construction that uses lifted maximum rank-distance (MRD) codes.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Toda lattice and equivariant $K$-homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon known as ``quantum equals affine'' in the setting of $T$-equivariant quantum $K$-theory of the flag variety $G/B$, as established by Kato for any semisimple algebraic group $G$. In particular, we focus on the $K$-Peterson isomorphism between the $T$-equivariant quantum $K$-ring $QK_T(SL_n(\mathbb{C})/B)$ and the $T$-equivariant $K$-homology ring $K_*^T(\mathrm{Gr}_{SL_n})$ of the affine Grassmannian, after suitable localizations on both sides. Building on an earlier work by Ikeda, Iwao, and Maeno, we present an explicit algebraic realization of the $K$-Peterson map via a rational substitution that sends the generators of the quantum $K$-theory ring to explicit rational expressions in the fundamental generators of $K_*^T(\mathrm{Gr}_{SL_n})$, thereby matching the Schubert bases on both sides. Our approach builds on recent developments in the theory of $QK_T(SL_n(\mathbb{C})/B)$ by Maeno, Naito, and Sagaki, as well as the theory of $K$-theoretic double $k$-Schur functions introduced by Ikeda, Shimozono, and Yamaguchi. This concrete formulation provides new insight into the combinatorial structure of the $K$-Peterson isomorphism in the equivariant setting. As an application, we establish a factorization formula for the $K$-theoretic double $k$-Schur function associated with the maximal $k$-irreducible $k$-bounded partition.</description>

      <title>Lower Bounds for Greedy Teaching Set Constructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental open problem in learning theory is to characterize the best-case teaching dimension $\operatorname{TS}_{\min}$ of a concept class $\mathcal{C}$ with finite VC dimension $d$. Resolving this problem will, in particular, settle the conjectured upper bound on Recursive Teaching Dimension posed by [Simon and Zilles; COLT 2015]. Prior work used a natural greedy algorithm to construct teaching sets recursively, thereby proving upper bounds on $\operatorname{TS}_{\min}$, with the best known bound being $O(d^2)$ [Hu, Wu, Li, and Wang; COLT 2017]. In each iteration, this greedy algorithm chooses to add to the teaching set the $k$ labeled points that restrict the concept class the most. In this work, we prove lower bounds on the performance of this greedy approach for small $k$. Specifically, we show that for $k = 1$, the algorithm does not improve upon the halving-based bound of $O(\log(|\mathcal{C}|))$. Furthermore, for $k = 2$, we complement the upper bound of $O\left(\log(\log(|\mathcal{C}|))\right)$ from [Moran, Shpilka, Wigderson, and Yuhudayoff; FOCS 2015] with a matching lower bound. Most consequentially, our lower bound extends up to $k \le \lceil c d \rceil$ for small constant $c&gt;0$: suggesting that studying higher-order interactions may be necessary to resolve the conjecture that $\operatorname{TS}_{\min} = O(d)$.</description>

      <title>A practical algorithm for 2-admissibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03419v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $2$-admissibility of a graph is a promising measure to identify real-world networks which have an algorithmically favourable structure. In contrast to other related measures, like the weak/strong $2$-colouring numbers or the maximum density of graphs that appear as $1$-subdivisions, the $2$-admissibility can be computed in polynomial time. However, so far these results are theoretical only and no practical implementation to compute the $2$-admissibility exists.
  Here we present an algorithm which decides whether the $2$-admissibility of an input graph $G$ is at most $p$ in time $O(p^4 |V(G)|)$ and space $O(|E(G)| + p^2)$. The simple structure of the algorithm makes it easy to implement. We evaluate our implementation on a corpus of 214 real-world networks and find that the algorithm runs efficiently even on networks with millions of edges, that it has a low memory footprint, and that indeed many networks have a small $2$-admissibility.</description>

      <title>Weighted Random Dot Product Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03649v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling of intricate relational patterns has become a cornerstone of contemporary statistical research and related data science fields. Networks, represented as graphs, offer a natural framework for this analysis. This paper extends the Random Dot Product Graph (RDPG) model to accommodate weighted graphs, markedly broadening the model's scope to scenarios where edges exhibit heterogeneous weight distributions. We propose a nonparametric weighted (W)RDPG model that assigns a sequence of latent positions to each node. Inner products of these nodal vectors specify the moments of their incident edge weights' distribution via moment-generating functions. In this way, and unlike prior art, the WRDPG can discriminate between weight distributions that share the same mean but differ in other higher-order moments. We derive statistical guarantees for an estimator of the nodal's latent positions adapted from the workhorse adjacency spectral embedding, establishing its consistency and asymptotic normality. We also contribute a generative framework that enables sampling of graphs that adhere to a (prescribed or data-fitted) WRDPG, facilitating, e.g., the analysis and testing of observed graph metrics using judicious reference distributions. The paper is organized to formalize the model's definition, the estimation (or nodal embedding) process and its guarantees, as well as the methodologies for generating weighted graphs, all complemented by illustrative and reproducible examples showcasing the WRDPG's effectiveness in various network analytic applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05874v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cop-width and flip-width are new families of graph parameters introduced by Toru\'nczyk (2023) that generalise treewidth, degeneracy, generalised colouring numbers, clique-width and twin-width. In this paper, we bound the cop-width and flip-width of a graph by its strong colouring numbers. In particular, we show that for every $r\in \mathbb{N}$, every graph $G$ has $\text{copwidth}_r(G)\leq \text{scol}_{4r}(G)$. This implies that every class of graphs with linear strong colouring numbers has linear cop-width and linear flip-width. We use this result to deduce improved bounds for cop-width and flip-width for various sparse graph classes.</description>

      <title>Extending edge colorings of distance-3 matchings in the Cartesian product of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09973v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of extending partial edge colorings in Cartesian products of graphs, with a particular focus on cases where the precolored edges form a matching. Casselgren, Granholm, and Petros conjectured that any precolored distance-3 matching in $G = C^d_{2k}$ can be extended to a $2d$-edge coloring. In this paper, we prove a theorem that implies this conjecture. Especially, our main result establishes that a precolored distance-3 matching in the Cartesian product of certain class 1 graphs can be extended to an edge coloring that uses at most as many colors as the chromatic index, provided that certain degree conditions are satisfied. In the second part of the paper, we extend these results to Cartesian products of other types of graphs as well.</description>

      <title>Star colouring and locally constrained graph homomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00086v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We relate star colouring of even-degree regular graphs to the notions of locally constrained graph homomorphisms to the oriented line graph $ \vec{L}(K_q) $ of the complete graph $ K_q $ and to its underlying undirected graph $ L^*(K_q) $. Our results have consequences for locally constrained graph homomorphisms and oriented line graphs in addition to star colouring. We show that $ L^*(H) $ is a 2-lift of the line graph $ L(H) $ for every graph $ H $. Dvo\v{r}\'ak, Mohar and \v{S}\'amal (J. Graph Theory, 2013) proved that for every 3-regular graph $ G $, the line graph of $ G $ is 4-star colourable if and only if $ G $ admits a locally bijective homomorphism to the cube $ Q_3 $. We generalise this result as follows: for $ p\geq 2 $, a $ K_{1,p+1} $-free $ 2p $-regular graph $ G $ admits a $ (p+2) $-star colouring if and only if $ G $ admits a locally bijective homomorphism to $ L^*(K_{p+2}) $. As a result, if a $ K_{p+1} $-free $ 2p $-regular graph $ G $ with $ p\geq 2 $ is $ (p+2) $-star colourable, then $ -2 $ and $ p-2 $ are eigenvalues of $ G $. We also prove the following: (i) for $ p\geq 2 $, a $ 2p $-regular graph $ G $ admits a $ (p+2) $-star colouring if and only if $ G $ has an orientation that admits an out-neighbourhood bijective homomorphism to $ \vec{L}(K_{p+2}) $; (ii) the line graph of a 3-regular graph $ G $ is 4-star colourable if and only if $ G $ is bipartite and distance-two 4-colourable; and (iii) it is NP-complete to check whether a planar 4-regular 3-connected graph is 4-star colourable.</description>

      <title>Seat number configuration of the box-ball system, and its relation to the 10-elimination and invariant measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15358v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The box-ball system (BBS) is a soliton cellular automaton introduced in [TS], and it is known that the dynamics of the BBS can be linearized by several methods. Recently, a new linearization method, called the seat number configuration, is introduced in [MSSS]. The aim of this paper is fourfold. First, we introduce the $k$-skip map $\Psi_{k} : \Omega \to \Omega$, where $\Omega$ is the state space of the BBS, and show that the $k$-skip map induces a shift operator of the seat number configuration. Second, we show that the $k$-skip map is a natural generalization of the $10$-elimination, which was originally introduced in [MIT] to solve the initial value problem of the periodic BBS. Third, we generalize the notions and results of the seat number configuration and the $k$-skip map for the BBS on the whole-line. Finally, we investigate the distribution of $\Psi_{k}(\eta), \eta \in \Omega$ when the distribution of $\eta$ belongs to a certain class of invariant measures of the BBS introduced in [FG]. As an application of the above results, we compute the expectation of the carrier with seat numbers.</description>

      <title>Daisy cubes as resonance graphs and maximal independent sets of trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assume that $G$ is a peripherally 2-colorable graph with inner dual $G^*$ and resonance graph $R(G)$. We first establish a bijection between the set of maximal hypercubes of the resonance graph $R(G)$ and the set of maximal independent sets of the inner dual $G^*$, where $G^*$ is a tree and isomorphic to the $\tau$-graph of $R(G)$. A novel characterization on when resonance graphs are daisy cubes follows naturally. Furthermore, the proof of the characterization provides a binary code labelling for the vertex set of a resonance graph $R(G)$ as a daisy cube with respect to the set of maximal independent sets of the inner dual $G^*$ of $G$. We then show that a daisy cube with at least one edge is a resonance graph of a plane bipartite graph if and only if its $\tau$-graph is a forest. As applications of our main theorems, interesting results are obtained for Fibonacci cubes and Lucas cubes which are special types of daisy cubes. Structure properties are also provided for daisy cubes whose $\tau$-graphs are trees and have at most five maximal hypercubes. We conclude the paper with two algorithms which provide a binary code labelling for the vertex set of a resonance graph as a daisy cube.</description>

      <title>The reflection complexity of sequences over finite alphabets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09302v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In combinatorics on words, the well-studied factor complexity function $\rho_{\infw{x}}$ of a sequence $\infw{x}$ over a finite
  alphabet counts, for every nonnegative integer $n$, the number of distinct length-$n$ factors of $\infw{x}$. In this paper, we
  introduce the \emph{reflection complexity} function $r_{\infw{x}}$ to enumerate the factors occurring in a sequence $\infw{x}$, up
  to reversing the order of symbols in a word. We prove a number of results about the growth properties of $r_{\infw{x}}$
  and its relationship with other complexity functions. We also prove a Morse--Hedlund-type result characterizing eventually periodic
  sequences in terms of their reflection complexity, and we deduce a characterization of Sturmian sequences. We investigate
  the reflection complexity of quasi-Sturmian, episturmian, $(s+1)$-dimensional billiard, complementation-symmetric Rote, and rich
  sequences. Furthermore, we prove that if $\infw{x}$ is $k$-automatic, then $r_{\infw{x}}$ is computably $k$-regular, and we use the
  software \texttt{Walnut} to evaluate the reflection complexity of some automatic sequences, such as the Thue--Morse sequence. We
  note that there are still many unanswered questions about this reflection measure.</description>

      <title>Alon's transmitting problem and multicolor Beck--Spencer Lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19945v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hamming graph $H(n,q)$ is defined on the vertex set $\{1,2,\ldots,q\}^n$ and two vertices are adjacent if and only if they differ in precisely one coordinate. Alon (1992) proved that for any sequence $v_1,\ldots,v_b$ of $b=\lceil\frac n2\rceil$ vertices of $H(n,2)$, there is a vertex whose distance from $v_i$ is at least $b-i+1$ for all $1\leq i\leq b$. In this note, we prove that for any $q\geq 3$ and any sequence $v_1,\ldots,v_b$ of $b=\lfloor(1-\frac1q)n\rfloor$ vertices of $H(n,q)$, there is a vertex whose distance from $v_i$ is at least $b-i+1$ for all $1\leq i\leq b$.
  Alon used a lemma due to Beck and Spencer (1983) which, in turn, was based on the floating variable method introduced by Beck and Fiala (1981) who studied combinatorial discrepancies. For our proof, we extend the Beck--Spencer Lemma by using a multicolor version of the floating variable method due to Doerr and Srivastav (2003).</description>

Abstract: We construct an infinite family of triples (G,S1, S2) each consisting of a group G and a pair (S1, S2) of distinct subsets of G with the following properties. i The two Cayley graphs Cay(G, S1) and Cay(G,S2) are non-isomorphic. ii The distributions of the simple random walks on Cay(G,S1) and Cay(G,S2) are the same if one takes an appropriate correspondence between the two vertex sets at each step. iii The spectral set of Cay(G, Si) is decomposed into a disjoint union of two subsets A and B_i of the equal size which satisfies B1 = -B2.</description>

      <title>CLM's dependence relation, solitary patterns and $r$-graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A connected r-regular graph, where $r \geq 3$, is an r-graph if each odd cut has at least r edges. Every r-graph is matching covered - a connected graph whose each edge participates in some perfect matching. We set out to: (i) characterize solitary edges - those edges that participate in only one perfect matching, and (ii) upper bound the number of such edges.
  Two edges are mutually dependent if every perfect matching containing either of them also contains the other. Clearly, this is an equivalence relation and induces a partition of E(G). It is worth noting that if any member of an equivalence class is solitary then so is every member; we refer to such an equivalence class as a solitary class. This immediately brings us to the notion of solitary pattern of a matching covered graph - the sequence of cardinalities of its solitary classes in nonincreasing order.
  Clearly, n/2 is an upper bound on the cardinality of any equivalence class, and if equality holds then each largest equivalence class is a solitary class. We provide a characterization of all matching covered graphs that attain this upper bound. However, all such graphs, of order six or more, contain 2-cuts.
  On the other hand, using a result of Lucchesi and Murty, we deduce that in a 3-edge-connected r-graph, every solitary class has cardinality one or two. We prove that the distance between any two solitary classes in any 3-edge-connected r-graph is at most three; furthermore, if the order is four or more, we establish that the number of solitary classes is at most three and equality holds if and only if r = 3. Ergo, every 3-edge-connected r-graph, of order four or more, has one of the following ten solitary patterns: (2, 2, 2), (2, 2, 1), (2, 1, 1), (1, 1, 1), (2, 2), (2, 1), (2), (1, 1), (1) or (). We provide complete characterizations of 3-edge-connected r-graphs that have one of the first six solitary patterns.</description>

      <title>A Spectral Lower Bound on the Chromatic Number using $p$-Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01295v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $A_G $ be the adjacency matrix of a simple graph $ G $, and let $ \chi(G) $, $ \chi_f(G) $, $ \chi_q(G) $, $ \xi(G) $ and $ \xi_f(G) $ denote its chromatic number, fractional chromatic number, quantum chromatic number, orthogonal rank and projective rank, respectively. For $ p \geq 0 $, we define the positive and negative $ p $-energies of $ G $ by $$ \mathcal{E}_p^+(G) = \sum_{\lambda_i &gt; 0} \lambda_i^p, \quad \mathcal{E}_p^-(G) = \sum_{\lambda_i &lt; 0} |\lambda_i|^p, $$ where $ \lambda_1 \geq \cdots \geq \lambda_n $ are the eigenvalues of $A_G $. We prove that for all $ p \geq 0 $, $$ \chi(G) \geq \left\{\chi_f(G), \chi_q(G), \xi(G) \right\} \geq \xi_f(G) \geq 1 + \max\left\{ \frac{\mathcal{E}_p^+(G)}{\mathcal{E}_p^-(G)}, \frac{\mathcal{E}_p^-(G)}{\mathcal{E}_p^+(G)} \right\}^{\frac{1}{|p - 1|}}. $$ This result unifies and strengthens a series of existing bounds corresponding to the cases $ p \in \{0, 2, \infty\} $. In particular, the case $ p = 0 $ yields the inertia bound $$ \chi_f(G) \geq \xi_f(G) \geq1 + \max\left\{\frac{n^+}{n^-}, \frac{n^-}{n^+}\right\}, $$ where $ (n^+, n^0, n^-) $ is the inertia of $A_G $, thus resolving two conjectures of Elphick and Wocjan.
  We also demonstrate that for certain graphs, non-integer values of $ p $ provide sharper lower bounds than existing spectral bounds. As an example, we determine $ \chi_q(G) $ for the Tilley graph, which cannot be achieved using existing (unweighted) $p$-energy bounds.</description>

      <title>Lattice points in polytope boundaries and formal geometric quantization of singular Calabi Yau hypersurfaces in toric varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the number of lattice points in the boundary of a positive integer dilate of a Delzant integral polytope is a polynomial in the dilation parameter, analogous to the Ehrhart polynomial giving the number of lattice points in a lattice polytope. We give an explicit formula for this polynomial, analogous to the formula of Khovanskii-Pukhlikov for the Ehrhart polynomial. These counting polynomials satisfy a lacunarity principle, the vanishing of alternate coefficients, quite unlike the Ehrhart polynomial. We show that formal geometric quantization of singular Calabi Yau hypersurfaces in smooth toric varieties gives this polynomial, in analogy with the relation of the Khovanskii-Pukhlikov formula to the geometric quantization of toric varieties. The Atiyah-Singer theorem for the index of the Dirac operator gives a moral argument for the lacunarity of the counting polynomial. We conjecture that similar formulas should hold for arbitrary simple integral polytope boundaries.</description>

      <title>On an alternating sum of factorials and Stirling numbers of the first kind: trees, lattices, and games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an alternating sum involving factorials and Stirling numbers of the first kind. We give an exponential generating function for these numbers and show they are nonnegative and enumerate the number of increasing trees on $n$ vertices that are won by the second of two players when interpreted as a game tree. We also give a simple description of the quotient from the weak order to the Tamari lattice in terms of plane trees, and give bijections between plane trees, 213-avoiding permutations, and 312-avoiding permutations. Finally, for a rooted tree, we give equivalent characterizations of when it describes a game won by the first or second player in terms of the rank-generating function of the lattice of prunings and the Euler characteristic of an associated real variety.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12091v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We verify a construction which, for $\Bbb K$ the reals, complex numbers, quaternions, or octonions, builds a spherical $t$-design by placing a spherical $t$-design on each $\Bbb K$-projective or $\Bbb K$-Hopf fiber associated to the points of a $\lfloor t/2\rfloor$-design on a quotient projective space $\Bbb{KP}^n\neq\Bbb{OP}^2$ or sphere. This generalizes work of K\"{o}nig and Kuperberg, who verified the $\Bbb K=\Bbb C$ case of the projective settings, and of Okuda, who (inspired by independent observation of this construction by Cohn, Conway, Elkies, and Kumar) verified the $\Bbb K=\Bbb C$ case of the generalized Hopf settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $K_4$ be the complete graph on four vertices. Let $f$ be a continuous map of $K_4$ to the plane such that $f$-images of non-adjacent edges are disjoint. For any vertex $v \in K_4$ take the winding number of the $f$-image of the cycle $K_4 - v$ around $f(v)$. It is known that the sum of these four integers is odd. We construct examples showing that this is the only relation between these four numbers.</description>
