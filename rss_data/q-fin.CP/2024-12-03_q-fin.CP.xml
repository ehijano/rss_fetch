      <title>Beyond Monte Carlo: Harnessing Diffusion Models to Simulate Financial Market Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a highly efficient and accurate methodology for generating synthetic financial market data using a diffusion model approach. The synthetic data produced by our methodology align closely with observed market data in several key aspects: (i) they pass the two-sample Cramer - von Mises test for portfolios of assets, and (ii) Q - Q plots demonstrate consistency across quantiles, including in the tails, between observed and generated market data. Moreover, the covariance matrices derived from a large set of synthetic market data exhibit significantly lower condition numbers compared to the estimated covariance matrices of the observed data. This property makes them suitable for use as regularized versions of the latter. For model training, we develop an efficient and fast algorithm based on numerical integration rather than Monte Carlo simulations. The methodology is tested on a large set of equity data.</description>

      <title>On the relative performance of some parametric and nonparametric estimators of option prices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the empirical performance of some parametric and nonparametric estimators of prices of options with a fixed time to maturity, focusing on variance-gamma and Heston models on one side, and on expansions in Hermite functions on the other side. The latter class of estimators can be seen as perturbations of the classical Black-Scholes model. The comparison between parametric and Hermite-based models having the same "degrees of freedom" is emphasized. The main criterion is the out-of-sample relative pricing error on a dataset of historical option prices on the S&amp;P500 index. Prior to the main empirical study, the approximation of variance-gamma and Heston densities by series of Hermite functions is studied, providing explicit expressions for the coefficients of the expansion in the former case, and integral expressions involving the explicit characteristic function in the latter case. Moreover, these approximations are investigated numerically on a few test cases, indicating that expansions in Hermite functions with few terms achieve competitive accuracy in the estimation of Heston densities and the pricing of (European) options, but they perform less effectively with variance-gamma densities. On the other hand, the main large-scale empirical study show that parsimonious Hermite estimators can even outperform the Heston model in terms of pricing errors. These results underscore the trade-offs inherent in model selection and calibration, and their empirical fit in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Based Electricity Price Forecast for Virtual Bidding in Wholesale Electricity Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Virtual bidding plays an important role in two-settlement electric power markets, as it can reduce discrepancies between day-ahead and real-time markets. Renewable energy penetration increases volatility in electricity prices, making accurate forecasting critical for virtual bidders, reducing uncertainty and maximizing profits. This study presents a Transformer-based deep learning model to forecast the price spread between real-time and day-ahead electricity prices in the ERCOT (Electric Reliability Council of Texas) market. The proposed model leverages various time-series features, including load forecasts, solar and wind generation forecasts, and temporal attributes. The model is trained under realistic constraints and validated using a walk-forward approach by updating the model every week. Based on the price spread prediction results, several trading strategies are proposed and the most effective strategy for maximizing cumulative profit under realistic market conditions is identified through backtesting. The results show that the strategy of trading only at the peak hour with a precision score of over 50% produces nearly consistent profit over the test period. The proposed method underscores the importance of an accurate electricity price forecasting model and introduces a new method of evaluating the price forecast model from a virtual bidder's perspective, providing valuable insights for future research.</description>

      <title>SeQwen at the Financial Misinformation Detection Challenge Task: Sequential Learning for Claim Verification and Explanation Generation in Financial Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the system description of our entry for the COLING 2025 FMD challenge, focusing on misinformation detection in financial domains. We experimented with a combination of large language models, including Qwen, Mistral, and Gemma-2, and leveraged pre-processing and sequential learning for not only identifying fraudulent financial content but also generating coherent, and concise explanations that clarify the rationale behind the classifications. Our approach achieved competitive results with an F1-score of 0.8283 for classification, and ROUGE-1 of 0.7253 for explanations. This work highlights the transformative potential of LLMs in financial applications, offering insights into their capabilities for combating misinformation and enhancing transparency while identifying areas for future improvement in robustness and domain adaptation.</description>

      <title>Alpha Mining and Enhancing via Warm Start Genetic Programming for Quantitative Investment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional genetic programming (GP) often struggles in stock alpha factor discovery due to its vast search space, overwhelming computational burden, and sporadic effective alphas. We find that GP performs better when focusing on promising regions rather than random searching. This paper proposes a new GP framework with carefully chosen initialization and structural constraints to enhance search performance and improve the interpretability of the alpha factors. This approach is motivated by and mimics the alpha searching practice and aims to boost the efficiency of such a process. Analysis of 2020-2024 Chinese stock market data shows that our method yields superior out-of-sample prediction results and higher portfolio returns than the benchmark.</description>

      <title>Research on Optimizing Real-Time Data Processing in High-Frequency Trading Algorithms using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-frequency trading (HFT) represents a pivotal and intensely competitive domain within the financial markets. The velocity and accuracy of data processing exert a direct influence on profitability, underscoring the significance of this field. The objective of this work is to optimise the real-time processing of data in high-frequency trading algorithms. The dynamic feature selection mechanism is responsible for monitoring and analysing market data in real time through clustering and feature weight analysis, with the objective of automatically selecting the most relevant features. This process employs an adaptive feature extraction method, which enables the system to respond and adjust its feature set in a timely manner when the data input changes, thus ensuring the efficient utilisation of data. The lightweight neural networks are designed in a modular fashion, comprising fast convolutional layers and pruning techniques that facilitate the expeditious completion of data processing and output prediction. In contrast to conventional deep learning models, the neural network architecture has been specifically designed to minimise the number of parameters and computational complexity, thereby markedly reducing the inference time. The experimental results demonstrate that the model is capable of maintaining consistent performance in the context of varying market conditions, thereby illustrating its advantages in terms of processing speed and revenue enhancement.</description>

      <title>Stock Movement Prediction with Multimodal Stable Fusion via Gated Cross-Attention Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accurate prediction of stock movements is crucial for investment strategies. Stock prices are subject to the influence of various forms of information, including financial indicators, sentiment analysis, news documents, and relational structures. Predominant analytical approaches, however, tend to address only unimodal or bimodal sources, neglecting the complexity of multimodal data. Further complicating the landscape are the issues of data sparsity and semantic conflicts between these modalities, which are frequently overlooked by current models, leading to unstable performance and limiting practical applicability. To address these shortcomings, this study introduces a novel architecture, named Multimodal Stable Fusion with Gated Cross-Attention (MSGCA), designed to robustly integrate multimodal input for stock movement prediction. The MSGCA framework consists of three integral components: (1) a trimodal encoding module, responsible for processing indicator sequences, dynamic documents, and a relational graph, and standardizing their feature representations; (2) a cross-feature fusion module, where primary and consistent features guide the multimodal fusion of the three modalities via a pair of gated cross-attention networks; and (3) a prediction module, which refines the fused features through temporal and dimensional reduction to execute precise movement forecasting. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the MSGCA framework exceeds current leading methods, achieving performance gains of 8.1%, 6.1%, 21.7% and 31.6% on four multimodal datasets, respectively, attributed to its enhanced multimodal fusion stability.</description>
