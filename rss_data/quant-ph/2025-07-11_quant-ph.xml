      <title>Introduction to Quantum Error Correction with Stabilizer Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an introduction to the theory of quantum error correction using stabilizer codes that is geared towards the working computer scientists and mathematicians with an interest in exploring this area. To this end, we begin with an introduction to basic quantum computation for the uninitiated. We then construct several examples of simple error correcting codes without reference to the underlying mathematical formalism in order to develop the readers intuition for the structure of a generic code. With this in hand, we then discuss the more general theory of stabilizer codes and provide the necessary level of mathematical detail for the non-mathematician. Finally, we give a brief look at the elegant homological algebra formulation for topological codes. As a bonus, we give implementations of the codes we mention using OpenQASM, and we address the more recent approaches to decoding using neural networks. We do not attempt to give a complete overview of the entire field, but provide the reader with the level of detail needed to continue in this direction.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Entanglement Witness of Dicke State under Noise and Error Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The experimental verification of multipartite entangled states is essential for advancing quantum information processing. Entanglement witnesses (EWs) provide a widely used and experimentally accessible approach for detecting genuinely multipartite entangled states. In this work, we theoretically derive the entanglement witness for the four-qubit Dicke state and experimentally evaluate it on two distinct IBM 127-qubit Quantum Processing Units (QPUs), namely ibm\_sherbrook and ibm\_brisbane. A negative expectation value of the witness operator serves as a sufficient condition for confirming genuine multipartite entanglement. We report the maximum (negative) values of the witness achieved on these QPUs as $-0.178 \pm 0.009$ and $-0.169 \pm 0.002$, corresponding to two different state preparation protocols. Additionally, we theoretically investigate the effect of various noise channels on the genuine entanglement of a four-qubit Dicke state using the Qiskit Aer simulator. We show the behavior of the EW constructed under the assumption of Markovian and non-Markovian amplitude damping and depolarizing noises, bit-phase flip noise, and readout errors. We also investigate the effect of varying thermal relaxation time on the EW, depicting a bound on the $T_1$ time required for successful generation of a Dicke State on a superconducting QPU.</description>

      <title>Magic phase transitions in monitored gaussian fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monitored quantum systems, where unitary dynamics compete with continuous measurements, exhibit dynamical transitions as the measurement rate is varied. These reflect abrupt changes in the structure of the evolving wavefunction, captured by complementary complexity diagnostics that include and go beyond entanglement aspects. Here, we investigate how monitoring affects magic state resources, the nonstabilizerness, of Gaussian fermionic systems. Using scalable Majorana sampling techniques, we track the evolution of stabilizer R\'enyi entropies in large systems under projective measurements. While the leading extensive (volume-law) scaling of magic remains robust across all measurement rates, we uncover a sharp transition in the subleading logarithmic corrections. This measurement-induced complexity transition, invisible to standard entanglement probes, highlights the power of magic-based diagnostics in revealing hidden features of monitored many-body dynamics.</description>

      <title>Lindbladian versus Postselected Non-Hermitian Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent topological classification of non-Hermitian `Hamiltonians' is usually interpreted in terms of pure quantum states that decay or grow with time. However, many-body systems with loss and gain are typically better described by mixed-state open quantum dynamics, which only correspond to pure-state non-Hermitian dynamics upon a postselection of measurement outcomes. Since postselection becomes exponentially costly with particle number, we here investigate to what extent the most important example of non-Hermitian topology can survive without it: the non-Hermitian skin effect and its relationship to a bulk winding number in one spatial dimension. After defining the winding number of the Lindbladian superoperator for a quadratic fermion system, we systematically relate it to the winding number of the associated postselected non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. We prove that the two winding numbers are equal (opposite) in the absence of gain (loss), and provide a physical explanation for this relationship. When both loss and gain are present, the Lindbladian winding number typically remains quantized and non-zero, though it can change sign at a phase transition separating the loss and gain-dominated regimes. This transition, which leads to a reversal of the Lindbladian skin effect localization, is rendered invisible by postselection. We also identify a case where removing postselection induces a skin effect from otherwise topologically trivial non-Hermitian dynamics.</description>

      <title>Energy Spectra of Compressed Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms for estimating the ground state energy of a quantum system often operate by preparing a classically accessible quantum state and then applying quantum phase estimation. Whether this approach yields quantum advantage hinges on the state's energy spectrum, that is, the sequence of the state's overlaps with the energy eigenstates of the system Hamiltonian. For any entanglement-compressed quantum state with minimal expected energy, it is shown that its energy spectrum decays at most with the inverse-squared energy eigenvalues. This explains the main empirical finding of Silvester, Carleo, and White (Physical Review Letters, 2025) that the energy spectra of matrix product states do not decay exponentially. It also reduces the question of quantum advantage to the energy and entanglement profile of the Hamiltonian's eigenstates.</description>

      <title>Extending Forrelation: Quantum Algorithms Related to Generalized Fourier-Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study different cryptographically significant spectra of Boolean functions, including the Walsh-Hadamard, cross-correlation, and autocorrelation. The $2^k$-variation by Stanica [IEEE-IT 2016] is considered here with the formulation for any $m \in \mathbb{N}$. Given this, we present the most generalized version of the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, which extends the standard and previously extended versions, thereby encompassing them as special cases. Additionally, we generalize the Forrelation formulation by introducing the $m$-Forrelation and propose various quantum algorithms towards its estimation. In this regard, we explore different strategies in sampling these newly defined spectra using the proposed $m$-Forrelation algorithms and present a comparison of their corresponding success probabilities. Finally, we address the problem related to affine transformations of generalized bent functions and discuss quantum algorithms in identifying the shifts between two bent (or negabent) functions with certain modifications, and compare these with existing results.</description>

      <title>Kubo-Martin-Schwinger relation for energy eigenstates of SU(2)-symmetric quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT) is a fundamental result in statistical mechanics. It stipulates that, if perturbed out of equilibrium, a system responds at a rate proportional to a thermal-equilibrium property. Applications range from particle diffusion to electrical-circuit noise. To prove the FDT, one must prove that common thermal states obey a symmetry property, the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) relation. Energy eigenstates of certain quantum many-body systems were recently proved to obey the KMS relation. The proof relies on the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), which explains how such systems thermalize internally. This KMS relation contains a finite-size correction that scales as the inverse system size. Non-Abelian symmetries conflict with the ETH, so a non-Abelian ETH was proposed recently. Using it, we derive a KMS relation for SU(2)-symmetric quantum many-body systems' energy eigenstates. The finite-size correction scales as usual under certain circumstances but can be polynomially larger in others, we argue. We support the ordinary-scaling result numerically, simulating a Heisenberg chain of 16-24 qubits. The numerics, limited by computational capacity, indirectly support the larger correction. This work helps extend into nonequilibrium physics the effort, recently of interest across quantum physics, to identify how non-Abelian symmetries may alter conventional thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Analytic R\'enyi Entropy Bounds for Device-Independent Cryptography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Device-independent (DI) cryptography represents the highest level of security, enabling cryptographic primitives to be executed safely on uncharacterized devices. Moreover, with successful proof-of-concept demonstrations in randomness expansion, randomness amplification, and quantum key distribution, the field is steadily advancing toward commercial viability. Critical to this continued progression is the development of tighter finite-size security proofs. In this work, we provide a simple method to obtain tighter finite-size security proofs for protocols based on the CHSH game, which is the nonlocality test used in all of the proof-of-concept experiments. We achieve this by analytically solving key-rate optimization problems based on R\'enyi entropies, providing a simple method to obtain tighter finite-size key rates.</description>

      <title>On the classical geometry of chaotic Green functions and Wigner functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiclassical approximations for various representations of a quantum state are constructed on a single (Lagrangian) surface in phase space, but it is not available for chaotic systems. An analogous evolution surface underlies semiclassical representations of the evolution operator, albeit in a doubled phase space. It is here shown that, corresponding to the Fourier transform on a unitary operator, represented as a Green function or spectral Wigner function, a Legendre transform generates a resolvent surface as the classical basis for semiclassical representations of the resolvent operator in double phase space, independently of the integrable or chaotic nature of the system. This surface coincides with derivatives of action functions (or generating functions) depending on the choice of appropriate coordinates and its growth departs from the energy shell following trajectories in double phase space. In an initial study of the resolvent surface based on its caustics, its complex nature is revealed to be analogous to a multidimensional sponge.
  Resummation of the trace of the resolvent in terms of linear combinations of periodic orbits, known as pseudo orbits or composite orbits, provides a cutoff to the semiclassical sum at the Heisenberg time. It is here shown that the corresponding actions for higher times can be approximately included within true secondary periodic orbits, in which multiple windings of short periodic orbits are joined by heteroclinic orbits into larger circuits.</description>

      <title>Toolchain for Faster Iterations in Quantum Software Development</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing proposes a revolutionary paradigm that can radically transform numerous scientific and industrial application domains. To realize this promise, these new capabilities need software solutions that are able to effectively harness its power. However, developers may face significant challenges when developing and executing quantum software due to the limited availability of quantum computer hardware, high computational demands of simulating quantum computers on classical systems, and complicated technology stack to enable currently available accelerators into development environments. These limitations make it difficult for the developer to create an efficient workflow for quantum software development. In this paper, we investigate the potential of using remote computational capabilities in an efficient manner to improve the workflow of quantum software developers, by lowering the barrier of moving between local execution and computationally more efficient remote hardware and offering speedup in execution with simulator surroundings. The goal is to allow the development of more complex circuits and to support an iterative software development approach. In our experiment, with the solution presented in this paper, we have obtained up to 5 times faster circuit execution runtime, and enabled qubit ranges from 21 to 29 qubits with a simple plug-and-play kernel for the Jupyter notebook.</description>

      <title>A continuous variable quantum battery with wireless and remote charging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum battery has become one of the hot issues at the research frontiers of quantum physics recently. Charging power, extractable work and wireless charging over long-distance are three important aspects of interest. Non-contact electromagnetic interaction provides an important avenue for wireless charging. In this paper, we design a wireless and remote charging scheme based on the quantized Hamiltonian of two coupled LC circuits, and focus on the charging dynamics of a continuous variable quantum battery. It is found that the quantum entanglement, which is regarded as a significant quantum resource, is not a prerequisite for charging the battery and extracting useful work. On the contrary, all of the energy in the battery could be converted into useful work in the absence of the entanglement for our model. The often overlooked counter-rotating wave coupling in the interacting Hamiltonian is helpful for extracting more useful work from the charger. If the coupling between the battery and the charger is designed to contain both the rotating and counter-rotating wave couplings, the extractable work can be obtained even if the charger is prepared in thermal states, while such effect cannot be achieved in the presence of a rotating or counter-rotating wave coupling alone. Finally, the effect of the system's parameters on the extractable work is discussed, which will provide a reference for full use of the thermal state energy.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithm for Apprenticeship Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Apprenticeship learning is a method commonly used to train artificial intelligence systems to perform tasks that are challenging to specify directly using traditional methods. Based on the work of Abbeel and Ng (ICML'04), we present a quantum algorithm for apprenticeship learning via inverse reinforcement learning. As an intermediate step, we give a classical approximate apprenticeship learning algorithm to demonstrate the speedup obtained by our quantum algorithm. We prove convergence guarantees on our classical approximate apprenticeship learning algorithm, which also extends to our quantum apprenticeship learning algorithm. We also show that, as compared to its classical counterpart, our quantum algorithm achieves an improvement in the per-iteration time complexity by a quadratic factor in the dimension of the feature vectors $k$ and the size of the action space $A$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we offer the first operational interpretation of the $\alpha$-$z$ relative entropies, which were introduced by Jak\v{s}i\'{c} {\it et al.} \cite{Jaksic2012} and Audenaert and Datta \cite{Audenaert_Datta_2015}, where the $\alpha$ and $z$ parameters are truly independent from each other. Namely, we show that these relative entropies appear in the conditions for large-sample or catalytic relative majorization of pairs of flat states and certain generalizations of them. Additionally, the optimal rate of converting one such pair into another may be formulated in terms of the $\alpha$-$z$ relative entropies.</description>

      <title>Simulating sparse SYK model with a randomized algorithm on a trapped-ion quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model describes a strongly correlated quantum system that shows a strong signature of quantum chaos. Due to its chaotic nature, the simulation of real-time dynamics becomes quickly intractable by means of classical numerics, and thus, quantum simulation is deemed to be an attractive alternative. Nevertheless, quantum simulations of the SYK model on noisy quantum processors are severely limited by the complexity of its Hamiltonian. In this work, we simulate the real-time dynamics of a sparsified version of the SYK model with 24 Majorana fermions on a trapped-ion quantum processor. We adopt a randomized quantum algorithm, TETRIS, and develop an error mitigation technique tailored to the algorithm. Leveraging the hardware's high-fidelity quantum operations and all-to-all connectivity of the qubits, we successfully calculate the Loschmidt amplitude for sufficiently long times so that its decay is observed. Based on the experimental and further numerical results, we assess the future possibility of larger-scale simulations of the SYK model by estimating the required quantum resources. Moreover, we present a scalable mirror-circuit benchmark based on the randomized SYK Hamiltonian and the TETRIS algorithm, which we argue provides a better estimate of the decay of fidelity for local observables than standard mirror-circuits.</description>

      <title>Towards Nonlinear Quantum Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have recently put forth several schemes of unconventional, nonlinearly-enabled thermodynamic (TD) devices that can operate in either the classical or the quantum domain by transforming thermal-state input in multiple uncorrelated modes into non-gaussian state output in selected modes: a four-mode Kerr-nonlinear interferometer that acts as a heat engine; two coupled Kerr-nonlinear Mach-Zehnder interferometers that act as a phase microscope with unprecedented phase resolution; and a noise sensor that can distinguish between unknown nonlinear quantum processes. These schemes reveal the unique merits of nonlinear TD devices: their ability to act in an autonomous, fully coherent, dissipationless fashion, unlike their conventional counterparts. Here we present the opportunities and challenges facing this new paradigm of nonlinear (NL) quantum and classical TD devices along the following lines: A) Linear versus nonlinear multimode transformations in TD devices: what are the principal distinctions between the two types of transformations? B) Classical versus quantum effects in NL TD devices: what are their main differences? Is quantumness an advantage or a disadvantage? C) Deterministic methods of achieving giant nonlinearity at the few-photon level via coherent processes, including multiatom-bath interactions which can paradoxically yield NL Hamiltonian effects: their comparison with probabilistic, measurement-based methods that can achieve similar NL effects in the quantum domain.</description>

      <title>A Neural-Guided Variational Quantum Algorithm for Efficient Sign Structure Learning in Hybrid Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms hold great promise for unlocking the power of near-term quantum processors, yet high measurement costs, barren plateaus, and challenging optimization landscapes frequently hinder them. Here, we introduce sVQNHE, a neural-guided variational quantum algorithm that decouples amplitude and sign learning across classical and quantum modules, respectively. Our approach employs shallow quantum circuits composed of commuting diagonal gates to efficiently model quantum phase information, while a classical neural network learns the amplitude distribution and guides circuit optimization in a bidirectional feedback loop. This hybrid quantum-classical synergy not only reduces measurement costs but also achieves high expressivity with limited quantum resources and improves the convergence rate of the variational optimization. We demonstrate the advancements brought by sVQNHE through extensive numerical experiments. For the 6-qubit J1-J2 model, a prototypical system with a severe sign problem for Monte Carlo-based methods, it reduces the mean absolute error by 98.9% and suppresses variance by 99.6% relative to a baseline neural network, while requiring nearly 19x fewer optimization steps than a standard hardware-efficient VQE. Furthermore, for MaxCut problems on 45-vertex Erdos-Renyi graphs, sVQNHE improves solution quality by 19% and quantum resource efficiency by 85%. Importantly, this framework is designed to be scalable and robust against hardware noise and finite-sampling uncertainty, making it well-suited for both current NISQ processors and future high-quality quantum computers. Our results highlight a promising path forward for efficiently tackling complex many-body and combinatorial optimization problems by fully exploiting the synergy between classical and quantum resources in the NISQ era and beyond.</description>

      <title>CleanQRL: Lightweight Single-file Implementations of Quantum Reinforcement Learning Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At the interception between quantum computing and machine learning, Quantum Reinforcement Learning (QRL) has emerged as a promising research field. Due to its novelty, a standardized and comprehensive collection for QRL algorithms has not yet been established. Researchers rely on numerous software stacks for classical Reinforcement Learning (RL) as well as on various quantum computing frameworks for the implementation of the quantum subroutines of their QRL algorithms. Inspired by the CleanRL library for classical RL algorithms, we present CleanQRL, a library that offers single-script implementations of many QRL algorithms. Our library provides clear and easy to understand scripts that researchers can quickly adapt to their own needs. Alongside ray tune for distributed computing and streamlined hyperparameter tuning, CleanQRL uses weights&amp;biases to log important metrics, which facilitates benchmarking against other classical and quantum implementations. The CleanQRL library enables researchers to easily transition from theoretical considerations to practical applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As quantum computing evolves from theoretical promise to practical deployment, the demand for robust, portable, and scalable tools for quantum software experimentation is growing. This paper introduces Quantum Executor, a backend-agnostic execution engine designed to orchestrate quantum experiments across heterogeneous platforms. Quantum Executor provides a declarative and modular interface that decouples experiment design from backend execution, enabling seamless interoperability and code reuse across diverse quantum and classical resources. Key features include support for asynchronous and distributed execution, customizable execution strategies and a unified API for managing quantum experiments. We illustrate its applicability through two life-like usage scenarios such as automated benchmarking and hybrid validation, discussing its capacity to streamline quantum development. We conclude by discussing current limitations and outlining a roadmap for future enhancements.</description>

      <title>Online Quantum State Tomography via Stochastic Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate the study of online quantum state tomography (QST), where the matrix representation of an unknown quantum state is reconstructed by sequentially performing a batch of measurements and updating the state estimate using only the measurement statistics from the current round. Motivated by recent advances in non-convex optimization algorithms for solving low-rank QST, we propose non-convex mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithms to tackle online QST, which leverage the low-rank structure of the unknown quantum state and are well-suited for practical applications. Our main technical contribution is a rigorous convergence analysis of these algorithms. With proper initialization, we demonstrate that the SGD algorithms for online low-rank QST achieve linear convergence both in expectation and with high probability. Our algorithms achieve nearly optimal sample complexity while remaining highly memory-efficient. In particular, their time complexities are better than the state-of-the-art non-convex QST algorithms, in terms of the rank and the logarithm of the dimension of the unknown quantum state.</description>

      <title>Tangent Space Excitation Ansatz for Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing the excitation spectra of quantum many-body systems on noisy quantum devices is a promising avenue to demonstrate the practical utility of current quantum processors, especially as we move toward the ``megaquop'' regime. For this task, here we introduce a \textit{tangent-space excitation ansatz} for quantum circuits, motivated by the quasi-particle picture of many-body systems and the structural similarity between quantum circuits and classical tensor networks. Increasing the circuit depth by one layer to construct the tangent space around the variational optimum of a parametrized quantum circuit, we show that a large number of low-energy states can be accurately captured. We demonstrate this ansatz using various models in both one and two spatial dimensions, including the challenging kagome Heisenberg antiferromagnet. We further provide evidence that this approach, implementable using Hadamard test, is stable in the presence of measurement noise and scalable to large system size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid solvers for combinatorial optimization problems combine the advantages of classical and quantum computing to overcome difficult computational challenges. Although their theoretical performance seems promising, their practical applicability is challenging due to the lack of a technological stack that can seamlessly integrate quantum solutions with existing classical optimization frameworks. We tackle this challenge by introducing the ProvideQ toolbox, a software tool that enables users to easily adapt and configure hybrid solvers via Meta-Solver strategies. A Meta-Solver strategy implements decomposition techniques, which splits problems into classical and quantum subroutines. The ProvideQ toolbox enables the interactive creation of such decompositions via a Meta-Solver configuration tool. It combines well-established classical optimization techniques with quantum circuits that are seamlessly executable on multiple backends. This paper introduces the technical details of the ProvideQ toolbox, explains its architecture, and demonstrates possible applications for several real-world use cases. Our proof of concept shows that Meta-Solver strategies already enable the application of quantum subroutines today, however, more sophisticated hardware is required to make their performance competitive.</description>

      <title>Effects of One-particle Reduced Density Matrix Optimization in Variational Quantum Eigensolvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is a promising method for simulating molecular systems on near-term quantum computers. This approach employs energy estimation; however, other relevant molecular properties can be extracted from the one-particle reduced density matrix (1-RDM) generated by VQE. The accuracy of these properties strongly depends on the reliability and convergence of the 1-RDM, which is not guaranteed by energy-only optimization. Thus, we investigate the effect of optimizing the 1-RDM within VQE to improve the accuracy of both the energy and molecular properties. A two-step algorithm was implemented that optimizes the energy and 1-RDM by incorporating a penalty term in the cost function to enforce the convergence of the 1-RDM. The first step focuses on energy minimization, while in the second step, a weighted penalty is added to the cost function to promote simultaneous improvement of the energy and 1-RDM. This approach was tested and validated for the k-UpCCGSD and GateFabric ans\"atzes with active spaces (4,4) and (2,2), respectively. k-UpCCGSD produces energies close to CISD, so optimizing 1-RDM has little effect on the energy but significantly improves electronic properties such as electron density, dipole moments, and atomic charges. GateFabric initially shows higher energy deviations from CISD, but optimizing 1-RDM substantially improves both the energy accuracy and the quality of 1-RDM. These results demonstrate that simultaneous optimization of energy and 1-RDM is an effective strategy to improve the accuracy of energies and molecular properties in variational quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Phase-Space Framework for Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum Optical Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum optical neural networks (QONNs) enable information processing beyond classical limits by exploiting the advantages of classical and quantum optics. However, simulation of large-scale bosonic lattices remains a significant challenge due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space required to describe a quantum network accurately. Consequently, previous theoretical studies have been limited to small-scale systems, leaving the behaviour of multimode QONNs largely unexplored. This work presents an efficient computational framework based on the phase-space positive-P method for simulating bosonic neuromorphic systems. This approach provides a view to previously inaccessible regimes, allowing the validation of large-scale bosonic networks in various quantum machine learning tasks such as quantum state classification and quantum state feature prediction. Our results show that the performance of a large quantum reservoir does not improve monotonously with the number of bosonic modes, instead following a complex dependence driven by the interplay of nonlinearity, reservoir size, and the average occupation of the input mode. These findings are essential for designing and optimising optical bosonic reservoirs for future quantum neuromorphic computing devices.</description>

      <title>Strong squeezing and perfect one-way EPR steering in electro-optomechanical system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a three-mode electro-optomechanical system in which a mechanical oscillator is coupled to an optical cavity and a LC circuit through radiation pressure and capacitive coupling, respectively. By controlling the two-tone driving of the optical cavity and the microwave driving of the LC circuit, the strong squeezing of both the microwave field of the LC circuit and the mechanical mode will be obtained. Moreover, by further altering the driving power of the system, the perfect one-way Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering between the optical cavity and the mechanical oscillator will be generated. The degree of the one-way EPR steering can be controlled by the driving light of the system. We also show the robustness of the squeezing and EPR steering against environmental temperature. This scheme may provide a promising platform for quantum information processing and microwave quantum communication.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Inductance Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifiers Near the Quantum Limit: Methodology and Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed simulation and design framework for realizing traveling wave parametric amplifiers (TWPAs) using the nonlinear kinetic inductance of disordered superconductors -- in our case niobium-titanium-nitride (NbTiN). These kinetic inductance TWPAs (KITs) operate via three-wave mixing (3WM) to achieve high broadband gain and near-quantum-limited (nQL) noise. Representative fabricated devices -- realized using an inverted microstrip (IMS), dispersion-engineered, artificial transmission line -- demonstrate power gains above 25 dB, bandwidths beyond 3 GHz, and achieve ultimate system noise levels of 1.1 quanta even when operated with no magnetic shielding. These performance metrics are competitive with state-of-the-art Josephson-junction-based TWPAs but involve simpler fabrication and able to providing three orders of magnitude higher dynamic range ($IIP_1 = -68$ dBm, $IIP_3 = -55$ dBm), and high magnetic field resilience -- making KITs an attractive technology for highly multiplexed readout of quantum information and superconducting detector systems.</description>

      <title>Gate Freezing Method for Gradient-Free Variational Quantum Algorithms in Circuit Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) are pivotal components of variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), which represent a promising pathway to quantum advantage in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. PQCs enable flexible encoding of quantum information through tunable quantum gates and have been successfully applied across domains such as quantum chemistry, combinatorial optimization, and quantum machine learning. Despite their potential, PQC performance on NISQ hardware is hindered by noise, decoherence, and the presence of barren plateaus, which can impede gradient-based optimization. To address these limitations, we propose novel methods for improving gradient-free optimizers Rotosolve, Fraxis, and FQS, incorporating information from previous parameter iterations. Our approach conserves computational resources by reallocating optimization efforts toward poorly optimized gates, leading to improved convergence. The experimental results demonstrate that our techniques consistently improve the performance of various optimizers, contributing to more robust and efficient PQC optimization.</description>

      <title>Violation of Bell Inequality with Unentangled Photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Violation of local realism via Bell inequality - a profound and counterintuitive manifestation of quantum theory that conflicts with the prediction of local realism - is viewed to be intimately linked with quantum entanglement. Experimental demonstrations of such a phenomenon using quantum entangled states are among the landmark experiments of modern physics and paved the way for quantum technology. Here we report the violation of the Bell inequality that cannot be described by quantum entanglement in the system but arises from quantum indistinguishability by path identity, shown by the multi-photon frustrated interference. By analyzing the measurement of four-photon frustrated interference within the standard Bell-test formalism, we find a violation of Bell inequality by more than four standard deviations. Our work establishes a connection between quantum correlation and quantum indistinguishability, providing insights into the fundamental origin of the counterintuitive characteristics observed in quantum physics.</description>

      <title>Preparing spin-squeezed states in Rydberg atom arrays via quantum optimal control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantum optimal control protocol to generate highly spin-squeezed states in Rydberg atom arrays coupled via Ising-type Van der Waals interactions. Using gradient-based optimization techniques we construct time-dependent pulse sequences that steer an initial product state toward highly entangled, spin-squeezed states with predefined magnetization and squeezing axes. We focus on the Wineland parameter $\xi_W^2$ to measure spin squeezing and our approach achieves near-optimal spin squeezing in one-dimensional ring arrays of up to $N=8$ spins, generating states with entanglement depths exceeding 6, and significantly outperforming conventional quench dynamics for all system sizes studied. Remarkably, optimized pulse sequences can be directly scaled to larger arrays without additional optimization, achieving a squeezing parameter as low as $\xi_W^2 = 0.227$ in systems containing $N=50$ spins. This work demonstrates the potential of quantum optimal control methods for preparing highly spin-squeezed states, opening pathways to enhanced quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Methods for Reducing Ancilla-Overhead in Block Encodings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Block encodings are a fundamental primitive in quantum algorithms, but can often have large ancilla overhead. In this work, we introduce novel techniques for reducing this overhead in two distinct ways. In Part I, we prove the existence of a "space-time tradeoff" by deriving an algorithm that, for any block encoding, approximately uncomputes all but one of its ancilla (freeing up those ancillae for reuse in later parts of a quantum algorithm). In Part II, we evaluate the minimum number of ancillae required to perform coherent multiplication of block encodings. We prove that logarithmic ancillae is optimal for exact multiplication of block encodings. However, in certain block encoding regimes, we show that approximate multiplication of block encodings can be achieved to high-precision with just one ancilla.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two protocols, with one and two two-qubit gates, to noninvasively measure two incompatible observables on a qubit. Both protocols are completed with a projective measurement. By gathering sufficiently large statistics, we have been able to violate Leggett-Garg inequality and time-order invariance. The detailed analysis of the data on 10 qubit sets from 5 devices available on IBM Quantum and one on IonQ reveals violations beyond 5 standard deviations in almost all cases. The noninvasiveness is supported by a qualitative and quantitative agreement with the model of weak disturbance. These results show another characteristic feature of quantum measurements.</description>

      <title>Robust Lindbladian Estimation for Quantum Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of fitting Lindbladian models to the outputs of quantum process tomography. A sequence of prior theoretical works approached the problem by considering whether there exists a Lindbladian generator close to a matrix logarithm of the tomographically estimated transfer matrix. This technique must take into account the non-uniqueness of the matrix logarithm, so that in general multiple branches of the logarithm must be checked. In contrast, all practical demonstrations of Lindbladian fitting on real experimental data have to our knowledge eschewed logarithm search, instead adopting direct numerical optimisation or ad-hoc approaches tailored to a particular experimental realisation. In our work, we introduce algorithmic improvements to logarithm search, demonstrating that it can be applied in practice to settings relevant for current quantum computing hardware. We additionally augment the task of Lindbladian fitting with techniques from gate set tomography to improve robustness against state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors, which can otherwise obfuscate estimates of the model underlying the process of interest. We benchmark our techniques extensively using simulated tomographic data employing a range of realistic error models, before demonstrating their application to tomographic data collected from real superconducting-qubit hardware.</description>

      <title>Quantum Wall States for Noise Mitigation and Eternal Purity Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work analyzes state-stabilization techniques for decoupling a subsystem from environmental interactions. The proposed framework uses analytical and numerical tools to find an approximate decoherence-free subspace (DFS) with enhanced passive noise isolation. Active state-stabilizing control on a subsystem mediating dominant environmental interactions, which we call wall subsystem, creates an effective quantum wall state. The proposed method controls only the wall subsystem, leaving the logical subsystem untouched. This simplifies logic operations in the protected subsystem, and makes it suitable for integration with other quantum information protection techniques, such as dynamical decoupling (DD). We demonstrated its effectiveness in enhancing the performance of selective or complete DD. Under suitable conditions, our method maintains system purity above a threshold for all times, achieving eternal purity preservation. Theoretical analysis links this behavior to the asymptotic spectrum of the Hamiltonian when the control gain grows unbounded.</description>

      <title>Sharp estimates of quantum covering problems via a novel trace inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a novel trace inequality involving two operators. As applications, we sharpen the one-shot achievability bound on the relative entropy error in a wealth of quantum covering-type problems, such as soft covering, privacy amplification, convex splitting, quantum information decoupling, and quantum channel simulation by removing some dimension-dependent factors. Moreover, the established one-shot bounds extend to infinite-dimensional separable Hilbert spaces as well. The proof techniques are based on the recently developed operator layer cake theorem and an operator change-of-variable argument, which are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Strong converse rate for asymptotic hypothesis testing in type III</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend from the hyperfinite setting to general von Neumann algebras Mosonyi and Ogawa's (2015) and Mosonyi and Hiai's (2023) results showing the operational interpretation of sandwiched relative R\'enyi entropy in the strong converse of hypothesis testing. The specific task is to distinguish between two quantum states given many copies. We use a reduction method of Haagerup, Junge, and Xu (2010) to approximate relative entropy inequalities in an arbitrary von Neumann algebra by those in finite von Neumann algebras. Within these finite von Neumann algebras, it is possible to approximate densities via finite spectrum operators, after which the quantum method of types reduces them to effectively commuting subalgebras. Generalizing beyond the hyperfinite setting shows that the operational meaning of sandwiched R\'enyi entropy is not restricted to the matrices but is a more fundamental property of quantum information. Furthermore, applicability in general von Neumann algebras opens potential new connections to random matrix theory and the quantum information theory of fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Correlations and quantum circuits with dynamical causal order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Requiring that the causal structure between different parties is well-defined imposes constraints on the correlations they can establish, which define so-called causal correlations. Some of these are known to have a "dynamical" causal order in the sense that their causal structure is not fixed a priori but is instead established on the fly, with for instance the causal order between future parties depending on some choice of action of parties in the past. Here we identify a new way that the causal order between the parties can be dynamical: with at least four parties, there can be some dynamical order which can nevertheless not be influenced by the actions of past parties. This leads us to introduce an intermediate class of correlations with what we call non-influenceable causal order, in between the set of correlations with static (non-dynamical) causal order and the set of general causal correlations. We then define analogous classes of quantum processes, considering recently introduced classes of quantum circuits with classical or quantum control of causal order - the latter being the largest class within the process matrix formalism known to have a clear interpretation in terms of coherent superpositions of causal orders. This allows us to formalise precisely in which sense certain quantum processes can have both indefinite and dynamical causal order.</description>

      <title>Analytic toolkit for the Anderson model with arbitrary disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Anderson model in one dimension is a quantum particle on a discrete chain of sites with nearest-neighbor hopping and random on-site potentials. It is a progenitor of many further models of disordered systems, and it has spurred numerous developments in diverse branches of physics. The literature is silent, however, on practical analytic tools for computing the density-of-states of this model when the distribution of the on-site potentials is arbitrary. Here, supersymmetry-based techniques are employed to give an explicit linear integral equation whose solutions control the density-of-states. The output of this analytic procedure is in perfect agreement with numerical sampling. By Thouless formula, these results immediately provide analytic control over the localization length.</description>

      <title>Finite-temperature criticality through quantum annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Critical phenomena at finite temperature underpin a broad range of physical systems, yet their study remains challenging due to computational bottlenecks near phase transitions. Quantum annealers have attracted significant interest as a potential tool for accessing finite temperature criticality beyond classical reach, but their utility in precisely resolving criticality has remained limited by noise, hardware constraints, and thermal fluctuations. Here we overcome these challenges, showing that careful calibration and embedding allow quantum annealers to capture the full finite-temperature critical behavior of the paradigmatic two-dimensional Ising ferromagnet. By tuning the energy scale of the system and mitigating device asymmetries, we sample effective Boltzmann distributions and extract both the critical temperature and the associated critical exponents. Our approach opens the study of equilibrium and non-equilibrium critical phenomena in a broad class of systems at finite temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A flagship application of quantum computers is the simulation of other quantum systems, including quantum field theories. In this article, we show how quantum computers can be employed to naturally calculate Feynman diagrams and their interferences in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). We simulate the colour parts of the interactions directly on the quantum computer, while the kinematic parts are for now pre-computed classically. For processes where some of the external particles are identical, we find the first hints of a potential quantum advantage. We validate our techniques using simulated quantum computers. Furthermore, for toy examples we also demonstrate our algorithms on a 56-qubit trapped-ion quantum computer. The work constitutes a further key step towards a full quantum simulation of generic perturbative QCD processes.</description>

      <title>Introduction to Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Model: A Strongly Correlated System Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model delivers an analytically tractable framework for exotic strongly correlated phases where conventional paradigms like Landau's Fermi liquid theory collapse. This review offers a pedagogical introduction to the SYK physics, highlighting its unique capacity to model \textit{strange metals} -- systems exhibiting linear-in-temperature resistivity, Planckian dissipation, and quasiparticle breakdown. We systematically construct both Majorana and complex fermion variants, transforming them into training grounds for modern many-body physics techniques, for instance, (1) large-$N$ formulations via disorder averaging and replica symmetry, (2) Schwinger-Dyson and Kadanoff-Baym equations, (3) imaginary time Matsubara formulation, (4) real-time dynamics via Keldysh formalism, and the associated (5) non-perturbative Keldysh contour deformations. These tools lay the foundation for equilibrium thermodynamics, quantum chaos, quench dynamics, and transport in the thermodynamic limit -- all within a solvable, chaotic quantum system. Designed as a self-contained resource, the review bridges advanced technical machinery to physical insights, with computational implementations provided. Though principally treating the SYK model as a condensed matter laboratory, we also highlight its profound connection to quantum gravity -- woven throughout this work -- underscoring how this solvable chaotic fermionic model serves as a lens onto black hole thermodynamics and holographic duality.</description>

      <title>Two-point functions and the vacuum densities in the Casimir effect for the Proca field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of the vacuum state for the Proca field in the geometry of two parallel plates on background of (D+1)-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. The two-point functions for the vector potential and the field tensor are evaluated for higher-dimensional generalizations of the perfect magnetic conductor (PMC) and perfect electric conductor (PEC) boundary conditions. Explicit expressions are provided for the vacuum expectation values (VEVs) of the electric and magnetic field squares, field condensate, and for the VEV of the energy-momentum tensor. In the zero-mass limit the VEVs of the electric and magnetic field squares and the condensate reduce to the corresponding expressions for a massless vector field. The same is the case for the VEV of the energy-momentum tensor in the problem with PEC conditions. However, for PMC conditions the zero-mass limit for the vacuum energy-momentum tensor differs from the corresponding VEV for a massless field. This difference in the zero-mass limits is related to the different influences of the boundary conditions on the longitudinal polarization mode of a massive vector field. The PMC conditions constrain all the polarization modes including the longitudinal mode, whereas PEC conditions do not influence the longitudinal mode. The vacuum energy-momentum tensor is diagonal. The normal stress is uniformly distributed in the region between the plates and vanishes in the remaining regions. The corresponding Casimir forces are attractive for both boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Approximate Optimization: A New Variational Monte Carlo Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a generalized \textit{Probabilistic Approximate Optimization Algorithm (PAOA)}, a classical variational Monte Carlo framework that extends and formalizes prior work by Weitz \textit{et al.}~\cite{Combes_2023}, enabling parameterized and fast sampling on present-day Ising machines and probabilistic computers. PAOA operates by iteratively modifying the couplings of a network of binary stochastic units, guided by cost evaluations from independent samples. We establish a direct correspondence between derivative-free updates and the gradient of the full $2^N \times 2^N$ Markov flow, showing that PAOA admits a principled variational formulation. Simulated annealing emerges as a limiting case under constrained parameterizations, and we implement this regime on an FPGA-based probabilistic computer with on-chip annealing to solve large 3D spin-glass problems. Benchmarking PAOA against QAOA on the canonical 26-spin Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model with matched parameters reveals superior performance for PAOA. We show that PAOA naturally extends simulated annealing by optimizing multiple temperature profiles, leading to improved performance over SA on heavy-tailed problems such as SK-L\'evy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that deep neural networks, including transformers and RNNs, pretrained as usual on next-token prediction, intrinsically discover and represent beliefs over 'quantum' and 'post-quantum' low-dimensional generative models of their training data -- as if performing iterative Bayesian updates over the latent state of this world model during inference as they observe more context. Notably, neural nets easily find these representation whereas there is no finite classical circuit that would do the job. The corresponding geometric relationships among neural activations induced by different input sequences are found to be largely independent of neural-network architecture. Each point in this geometry corresponds to a history-induced probability density over all possible futures, and the relative displacement of these points reflects the difference in mechanism and magnitude for how these distinct pasts affect the future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated the quantum effects of a frustrated Ising model on a two-dimensional square lattice using the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). While strong spin frustration is known to induce quantum fluctuations at low temperatures, previous classical approaches restricted to binary (up or down) spin configurations have been insufficient to fully capture the quantum contributions of frustration. In this study, we introduced a quantitative metric to evaluate the quantum effects arising from frustration and employed QAOA to differentiate between classical and quantum regimes. Notably, we found that in the weakly frustrated region, QAOA measurements rarely capture first excited states, as they are energetically well separated from the ground state. In contrast, near the quantum phase transition point, excited states appear more frequently in QAOA measurements, highlighting the increased role of quantum fluctuations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on an optical magnetometer enhanced by vacuum-squeezed light, employing an Mx magnetometer based on $^{87}$Rb vapor in a micrometer-scale cell (~100 $\mu$m). Using the well-established polarization self-rotation effect in a room-temperature $^{87}$Rb vapor cell, we achieve -3 dB of vacuum squeezing within the noise spectral window of 100 Hz to several MHz, corresponding to 3.5 dB squeezing when accounting for optical losses. Leveraging this level of squeezing, we demonstrate a magnetic field sensitivity of approx. 1 pT$/$$\sqrt{Hz}$. The combination of vacuum-squeezed light and micrometer-scale vapor cells paves the way for compact, low-power-consumption atomic sensors with enhanced performance.</description>

Abstract: We develop a general framework based on the functional derivative to extract nonlinear dynamical response functions from the temporal evolution of physical quantities, without explicitly computing multipoint correlation functions. We validate our approach by calculating the second- and third-order optical responses in the Rice-Mele model and further apply it to a many-body interacting system using a tensor network method. This framework is broadly applicable to any method that can compute real-time dynamics, offering a powerful and versatile tool for investigating nonlinear responses in dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Extending unified gravity to account for graviton-graviton interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a gauge theory of unified gravity [Rep. Prog. Phys. 88, 057802 (2025)] has been developed to extend the Standard Model to include gravity. Here we present unified gravity using the ordinary four-vector and tensor field notation of the Standard Model. The main goal of the present work is to extend the original Minkowski spacetime formulation of the theory to account for graviton-graviton interaction. This is a necessary extension for problems involving interactions between gravitational fields, for example, in the propagation of gravitational waves in external gravitational potentials. The 4xU(1) gauge invariance of unified gravity is preserved in this extension.</description>

      <title>Mid-IR hyperspectral imaging with undetected photons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sensing with undetected photons has become a vibrant, application-driven research domain with a special focus on the mid-infrared (mid-IR) wavelength region. Since the mid-IR contains spectral bands with highly specific and strong molecular absorbance signatures, often referred to as fingerprints, a multitude of different samples and their compositions can be detected and quantified spectroscopically. Enhancing this inherently sample alteration-free spectroscopic method with imaging capabilities leads to a powerful technique for environmental monitoring and biomedical applications that enables automated diagnostics while omitting time-consuming and non-reversible labeling steps. To evade the shortcomings of state-of-the-art instruments for mid-IR hyperspectral microscopy related to cost, complexity, power-consumption, and performance, which are associated with technological challenges for mid-IR cameras and low-noise and broadband mid-IR sources, here, we construct a proof-of-concept nonlinear interferometer in a wide-field imaging arrangement combined with high-resolution spectral acquisition by pixelwise quantum Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. For the broadband range of 2300-3100 cm$^{-1}$, covering the important CH-stretch band, we perform hyperspectral imaging that simultaneously resolves 3500 spatial modes, each with a spectral resolution of 10 cm$^{-1}$ leveraging in total around $10^5$ spatio-spectrally entangled photon modes. Our image acquisition uses a commercial, megapixel sCMOS camera, while a medium-power and compact c.w. pump laser is the only necessary light source.</description>

      <title>Single-Beam Magneto-Optical Trap in Back-to-Back Pyramidal and Conical Mirrors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A three-dimensional magneto-optical trap (MOT), as an efficient method of producing cold atoms from room-temperature atomic vapor, has been widely used to develop atomic sensors. Various compact MOTs using a single laser beam have been reported, simplifying apparatuses and leading to miniaturized devices. Here, we propose single-beam MOTs based on back-to-back pyramidal and conical mirrors. In such back-to-back mirrors, a MOT trapping volume is formed by an incident laser beam, a retroreflected beam, and multiple reflections from the mirror surfaces. We present the design of back-to-back mirrors and a series of compact MOT configurations, with the potential of increasing access to the MOT and simultaneously creating multiple MOTs. We demonstrate a MOT in a back-to-back conical mirror, loading 10 million rubidium-87 atoms from background vapor and cooling the atoms to 7 {\mu}K using polarization gradients. Single-beam MOTs based on back-to-back mirrors will contribute to building compact and scalable cold-atom-based sensors.</description>

      <title>A c-theorem for the effective central charge in the R=1 replica limit, and applications to systems with measurement-induced randomness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general theorem demonstrating non-perturbatively the decrease of the "effective central charge" $c_{\text{eff}}=(d c/dR)|_{R=1}$ under renormalization group (RG) flow in the $R\rightarrow1$ replica limit of a $R$-copy $2D$ conformal field theory (CFT) action $S_{*}$ perturbed by a replica interaction of the form $$-\mathbb{S}=-\sum_{a=1}^{R}S_{*}^{(a)}+\Delta\int d^2 x \sum_{\substack{a,b=1\\ a\neq b}}^{R}\varphi^{(a)}(x)\varphi^{(b)}(x).$$ Here $\varphi$ is a scaling field belonging to the CFT with action $S_*$ and the coupling $\Delta$ is relevant in the RG sense. We show that the infrared value of $c_{\text{eff}}$ is always $\textit{less}$ than the central charge $c$ of the unperturbed CFT $S_{*}$. We refer to this result as the "$c$-effective theorem". As an application of this theorem, we consider replica field theories in the limit of $R \to 1$ replicas of the form above, shown by Nahum and Jacobsen [arXiv:2504.01264] to describe $2D$ classical monitored systems, where measurements introduce a form of quenched randomness via Bayes' theorem. Lastly, we discuss a possible relationship of our theorem with the effective central charge $c_{\text{eff}}^{(R\rightarrow0)}=(dc/dR)|_{R=0}$ for the above replica action in the different $R\rightarrow0$ replica limit, which is of relevance to systems with generic uncorrelated impurity-type quenched disorder, as opposed to measurements.</description>

      <title>Spin-only dynamics of the multi-species nonreciprocal Dicke model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hepp-Lieb-Dicke model is ubiquitous in cavity quantum electrodynamics, describing spin-cavity coupling which does not conserve excitation number. Coupling the closed spin-cavity system to an environment realizes the open Dicke model, and by tuning the structure of the environment or the system-environment coupling, interesting spin-only models can be engineered. In this work, we focus on a variation of the multi-species open Dicke model which realizes mediated nonreciprocal interactions between the spin species and, consequently, an interesting dynamical limit-cycle phase. In particular, we improve upon adiabatic elimination and, instead, employ a Redfield master equation in order to describe the effective dynamics of the spin-only system. We assess this approach at the mean-field level, comparing it both to adiabatic elimination and the full spin-cavity model, and find that the predictions are sensitive to the presence of single-particle incoherent decay. Additionally, we clarify the symmetries of the model and explore the dynamical limit-cycle phase in the case of explicit parity-time-symmetry breaking, finding a region of phase coexistence terminating at an codimension-two exceptional point. Lastly, we go beyond mean-field theory by exact numerical diagonalization of the master equation, appealing to permutation symmetry in order to increase the size of accessible systems. We find signatures of phase transitions even for small system sizes.</description>

Abstract: Entangled biphoton sources exhibit nonclassical characteristics and have been applied to imaging techniques such as ghost imaging, quantum holography, and quantum optical coherence tomography. The development of wide-field quantum imaging to date has been hindered by low spatial resolutions, speeds, and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs). Here, we present quantum microscopy by coincidence (QMC) with balanced pathlengths, which enables super-resolution imaging at the Heisenberg limit with substantially higher speeds and CNRs than existing wide-field quantum imaging methods. QMC benefits from a configuration with balanced pathlengths, where a pair of entangled photons traversing symmetric paths with balanced optical pathlengths in two arms behave like a single photon with half the wavelength, leading to 2-fold resolution improvement. Concurrently, QMC resists stray light up to 155 times stronger than classical signals. The low intensity and entanglement features of biphotons in QMC promise nondestructive bioimaging. QMC advances quantum imaging to the microscopic level with significant improvements in speed and CNR toward bioimaging of cancer cells. We experimentally and theoretically prove that the configuration with balanced pathlengths illuminates an avenue for quantum-enhanced coincidence imaging at the Heisenberg limit.</description>

Abstract: In the current era of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) technology, quantum devices present new avenues for addressing complex, real-world challenges including potentially NP-hard optimization problems. Acknowledging the fact that quantum methods underperform classical solvers, the primary goal of our research is to demonstrate how to leverage quantum noise as a computational resource for optimization. This work aims to showcase how the inherent noise in NISQ devices can be leveraged to solve such real-world problems effectively. Utilizing a D-Wave quantum annealer and IonQ's gate-based NISQ computers, we generate and analyze solutions for managing train traffic under stochastic disturbances. Our case study focuses on the Baltimore Light RailLink, which embodies the characteristics of both tramway and railway networks. We explore the feasibility of using NISQ technology to model the stochastic nature of disruptions in these transportation systems. Our research marks the inaugural application of both quantum computing paradigms to tramway and railway rescheduling, highlighting the potential of quantum noise as a beneficial resource in complex optimization scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10093v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the computational model of IQP circuits (in which all computational steps are $X$ basis diagonal gates), supplemented by intermediate $X$ or $Z$ basis measurements. We show that if we allow non-adaptive or adaptive $X$ basis measurements, or allow non-adaptive $Z$ basis measurements, then the computational power remains the same as that of the original IQP model; and with adaptive $Z$ basis measurements the model becomes quantum universal. Furthermore we show that the computational model having circuits of only $CZ$ gates and adaptive $X$ basis measurements, with input states that are tensor products of 1-qubit states from the set $\{ |+\rangle, |1\rangle,\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle+i|1\rangle), \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle+e^{i\pi/4}|1\rangle) \} $, is quantum universal. In contrast to the relation of IQP to PH collapse, all our results here are manifestly stable under small additive implementational errors.</description>

Abstract: Our work integrates an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) with the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) to optimize ansatz parameters in place of traditional gradient-based methods. We benchmark this Evolutionary-QAOA (E-QAOA) approach on the Max-Cut problem for $d$-3 regular graphs of 4 to 26 nodes, demonstrating equal or higher accuracy and reduced variance compared to COBYLA-based QAOA, especially when using Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) for fitness evaluations. Additionally, we propose a novel distributed multi-population EA strategy, executing parallel, independent populations on two quantum processing units (QPUs) with classical communication of 'elite' solutions. Experiments on quantum simulators and IBM hardware validate the approach. We also discuss potential extensions of our method and outline promising future directions in scalable, distributed quantum optimization on hybrid quantum-classical infrastructures.</description>

      <title>Pseudoentanglement from tensor networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02758v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pseudoentangled states are defined by their ability to hide their entanglement structure: they are indistinguishable from random states to any observer with polynomial resources, yet can have much less entanglement than random states. Existing constructions of pseudoentanglement based on phase- and/or subset-states are limited in the entanglement structures they can hide: e.g., the states may have low entanglement on a single cut, on all cuts at once, or on local cuts in one dimension. Here we introduce new constructions of pseudoentangled states based on (pseudo)random tensor networks that affords much more flexibility in the achievable entanglement structures. We illustrate our construction with the simplest example of a matrix product state, realizable as a staircase circuit of pseudorandom unitary gates, which exhibits pseudo-area-law scaling of entanglement in one dimension. We then generalize our construction to arbitrary tensor network structures that admit an isometric realization. A notable application of this result is the construction of pseudoentangled `holographic' states whose entanglement entropy obeys a Ryu-Takayanagi `minimum-cut' formula, answering a question posed in [Aaronson et al., arXiv:2211.00747].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16182v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We systematically investigate whether classical hydrodynamic field theories can predict the long-time dynamics of many-particle quantum systems. We study both numerically and analytically the time evolution of a chain of spins (or qubits) subjected to stroboscopic dynamics. The time evolution is implemented by a sequence of local and nearest-neighbor gates that conserve the total magnetization. The long-time dynamics of such a system is believed to be describable by a hydrodynamic field theory, which, importantly, includes the effect of noise. Based on a field theoretical analysis and symmetry arguments, we map each operator in the spin model to the corresponding fields in hydrodynamics. This allows us to predict which expectation values decay exponentially and which decay with a hydrodynamic long-time tail. We illustrate these findings by studying the time evolution of all 255 Hermitian operators that can be defined on four neighboring sites. All operators not protected by hydrodynamics decay exponentially, while the others show a slow hydrodynamic decay. While most hydrodynamic power laws seem to follow the analytical predictions, we also discuss cases where there is an apparent discrepancy between analytics and the finite-size numerical data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23779v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The realization of fault-tolerant quantum computers hinges on effective quantum error correction protocols, whose performance significantly relies on the nature of the underlying noise. In this work, we directly study the structure of non-Markovian correlated errors and their impact on surface code memory performance. Specifically, we compare surface code performance under non-Markovian noise and independent circuit-level noise, while keeping marginal error rates constant. Our analysis shows that while not all temporally correlated structures are detrimental, certain structures, particularly multi-time "streaky" correlations affecting syndrome qubits and two-qubit gates, can severely degrade logical error rate scaling. Furthermore, we discuss our results in the context of recent quantum error correction experiments on physical devices. These findings underscore the importance of understanding and mitigating non-Markovian noise toward achieving practical, fault-tolerant quantum computing.</description>

Abstract: It is demonstrated that the Aharonov-Casher (AC) phase is a geometric phase that, in general, depends on the details of the closed path taken by a particle with a magnetic moment that is subject to an electric field. Consequently, it is not a topological phase. The proof of this statement is obtained by developing a counterexample that elucidates the dependence of the AC phase on the details of the path. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, in the particular example considered here, paths having an Abelian AC phase factor, also have an AC phase that is path-independent, whereas paths having a non-Abelian AC phase factor may have an AC phase that is path-dependent (i.e., not topological).</description>

      <title>Validation tests of Gaussian boson samplers with photon-number resolving detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An important challenge with the current generation of noisy, large-scale quantum computers is the question of validation. Does the hardware generate correct answers? If not, what are the errors? This issue is often combined with questions of computational advantage, but it is a fundamentally distinct issue. In current experiments, complete validation of the output statistics is generally not possible because it is exponentially hard to do so. Here, we apply phase-space simulation methods to partially verify recent experiments on Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) implementing photon-number resolving (PNR) detectors. The positive-P phase-space distribution is employed, as it uses probabilistic sampling to reduce complexity. It is \sim10^{18} times faster than direct classical simulation for experiments on 288 modes where quantum computational advantage is claimed. When combined with binning and marginalization to improve statistics, multiple validation tests are efficiently computable, of which some tests can be carried out on experimental data. We show that the data as a whole shows discrepancies with theoretical predictions for perfect squeezing. However, a small modification of the GBS parameters greatly improves agreement for some tests. We suggest that such validation tests could form the basis of feedback methods to improve GBS experiments.</description>

      <title>Direct phase encoding in QAOA: Describing combinatorial optimization problems through binary decision variables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and its derived variants are widely in use for approximating combinatorial optimization problem instances on gate-based Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers. Commonly, circuits required for QAOA are constructed by first reformulating a given problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem. It is then straightforward to synthesize a QAOA circuit from QUBO equations.
  In this work, we illustrate a more qubit-efficient circuit construction for combinatorial optimization problems by the example of the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP). Conventionally, the qubit encoding in QAOA for the TSP describes a tour using a sequence of nodes, where each node is written as a 1-hot binary vector. We propose to encode TSP tours by selecting edges included in the tour. Removing certain redundancies, the number of required qubits can be reduced by a linear factor compared to the aforementioned conventional encoding.
  We examined implementations of both QAOA encoding variants in terms of their approximation quality and runtime. Our experiments show that for small instances results are just as accurate using our proposed encoding, whereas the number of required classical optimizer iterations increases only slightly.</description>

      <title>Verification of single-photon path entanglement using a nitrogen vacancy center</title>

Abstract: Path entanglement is an essential resource for photonic quantum information processing, including in quantum computing, quantum communication and quantum sensing. In this work, we experimentally study the generation and verification of bipartite path-entangled states using single photons produced by a nitrogen-vacancy center within a nanodiamond. We perform a range of measurements to characterize the photons being generated and verify the presence of path entanglement. The experiment is performed using continuous-wave laser excitation and a novel state generation 'time-window' method. This approach to path entanglement verification is different to previous work as it does not make use of a pulsed laser excitation source.</description>

      <title>End-to-end switchless architecture for fault-tolerant photonic quantum computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12680v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photonics represents one of the most promising approaches to large-scale quantum computation with millions of qubits and billions of gates, owing to the potential for room-temperature operation, high clock speeds, miniaturization of photonic circuits, and repeatable fabrication processes in commercial photonic foundries. We present an end-to-end architecture for fault-tolerant continuous variable (CV) quantum computation using only passive on-chip components that can produce photonic qubits above the fault tolerance threshold with probabilities above 90%, and encodes logical qubits using physical qubits sampled from a distribution around the fault tolerance threshold. By requiring only low photon number resolution, the architecture enables the use of high-bandwidth photodetectors in CV quantum computing. Simulations of our qubit generation and logical encoding processes show a Gaussian cluster squeezing threshold of 12 dB to 13 dB. Additionally, we present a novel magic state generation protocol which requires only 13 dB of cluster squeezing to produce magic states with an order of magnitude higher probability than existing approaches, opening up the path to universal fault-tolerant quantum computation at less than 13 dB of cluster squeezing.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and Stabilizer entropies of random bipartite pure quantum states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19261v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplay between non-stabilizerness and entanglement in random states is a very rich arena of study for the understanding of quantum advantage and complexity. In this work, we tackle the problem of such interplay in random pure quantum states. We show that while there is a strong dependence between entanglement and magic, they are, surprisingly, perfectly uncorrelated. We compute the expectation value of non-stabilizerness given the Schmidt spectrum (and thus entanglement). At a first approximation, entanglement determines the average magic on the Schmidt orbit. However, there is a finer structure in the average magic distinguishing different orbits where the flatness of entanglement spectrum is involved.</description>

      <title>Implementation and Analysis of Regev's Quantum Factorization Algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing represents a significant advancement in computational capabilities. Of particular concern is its impact on asymmetric cryptography through, notably, Shor's algorithm and the more recently developed Regev's algorithm for factoring composite numbers. We present our implementation of the latter. Our analysis encompasses both quantum simulation results and classical component examples, with particular emphasis on comparative cases between Regev's and Shor's algorithms. Our experimental results reveal that Regev's algorithm indeed outperforms Shor's algorithm for certain composite numbers in practice. However, we observed significant performance variations across different input values. Despite Regev's algorithm's theoretical asymptotic efficiency advantage, our implementation exhibited execution times longer than Shor's algorithm for small integer factorization in both quantum and classical components. These findings offer insights into the practical challenges and performance characteristics of implementing Regev's algorithm in realistic quantum computing scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We determine the Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability (KDQ) distribution associated to the stochastic instances of internal energy variations for the quantum system and environment particles in coherent Markovian collision models. In the case the interactions between the quantum system and the particles do not conserve energy, the KDQ of the non-energy-preserving stochastic work is also derived. These KDQ distributions can account for non-commutativity, and return the unperturbed average values and variances for a generic interaction-time, and generic local initial states of the quantum system and environment particles. Using this nonequilibrium-physics approach, we certify the conditions under which the collision process of the model exhibits quantum traits, and we quantify the rate of energy exchanged by the quantum system by looking at the variance of the KDQ energy distributions. Finally, we propose an experimental test of our results on a superconducting quantum circuit implementing a qubit system, with microwave photons representing the environment particles.</description>

      <title>Cross-Problem Parameter Transfer in Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm: A Machine Learning Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is one of the most promising candidates to achieve the quantum advantage in solving combinatorial optimization problems. The process of finding a good set of variational parameters in the QAOA circuit has proven to be challenging due to multiple factors, such as barren plateaus. As a result, there is growing interest in exploiting parameter transferability, where parameter sets optimized for one problem instance are transferred to another that could be more complex either to estimate the solution or to serve as a warm start for further optimization. But can we transfer parameters from one class of problems to another? Leveraging parameter sets learned from a well-studied class of problems could help navigate the less studied one, reducing optimization overhead and mitigating performance pitfalls. In this paper, we study whether pretrained QAOA parameters of MaxCut can be used as is or to warm start the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) circuits. Specifically, we design machine learning models to find good donor candidates optimized on MaxCut and apply their parameters to MIS acceptors. Our experimental results show that such parameter transfer can significantly reduce the number of optimization iterations required while achieving comparable approximation ratios.</description>

      <title>Open quantum systems with particle and bath driven by time-dependent fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a generalized quantum Langevin equation and its fluctuation-dissipation relation describing the quantum dynamics of a tagged particle interacting with a medium (environment), where both the particle and the environment are driven by an external time-dependent (e.g. oscillating) field. We specialize on the case of a charged tagged particle interacting with a bath of charged oscillators, under an external AC electric field, although the results are much more general and can be applied to any type of external time-dependent fields. We derive the corresponding quantum Langevin equation, which obeys a modified fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR) where the AC field plays an explicit role. The modified FDR is non-Markovian even if the undriven particle-bath system is Markovian without the external field. We provide an illustration of the usefulness of these results and derive a new form of the quantum Nyquist noise for the voltage fluctuations in electrical circuits under AC conditions (finite frequency), which is the most general since it also accounts for the response of the heat bath (e.g. lattice ions) to the applied AC electric field in the GHz-THz region, of relevance for 5G/6G wireless technologies. This generalized quantum fluctuation-dissipation relation for driven systems can also find other applications ranging from quantum noise in quantum optics to quantum computing with trapped ions.</description>

      <title>Unraveling superradiance: Entanglement and mutual information in collective decay</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13401v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the collective decay of an initially inverted ensemble of two-level emitters in two distinct scenarios: when coupled to a squeezed photonic reservoir and when interacting with a one-dimensional waveguide. Using a quantum-state diffusion approach to unravel the emission process, we investigate entanglement and classical correlations along individual quantum trajectories over time. This numerical analysis shows that despite an initial build-up of entanglement and a significant amount of entanglement due to either spin squeezing or dark states at late times, the essential features of the superradiant burst are well described by averages over fully factorizable states. We explain this observation in terms of an almost complete factorization of all 2-local observables, which we identify as a generic property of superradiant decay. Based on this insight, we provide a purely classical theory for the burst in squeezed superradiance, which is both intuitive and exact for a large number of emitters. Moreover, we find that our numerical approach also performs well in the presence of subradiant states, which dominate the slow residual decay of non-uniform ensembles at late times.</description>

      <title>Variational Quantum Simulations of a Two-Dimensional Frustrated Transverse-Field Ising Model on a Trapped-Ion Quantum Computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computers are an ideal platform to study the ground state properties of strongly correlated systems due to the limitation of classical computing techniques particularly for systems exhibiting quantum phase transitions. While the error rates of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers are still high, simulating strongly correlated systems on such devices and extracting information of possible phases may be within reach. The frustrated transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) is such a system with multiple ordered magnetic phases. In this study, we simulate a two-dimensional frustrated TFIM with next-nearest-neighbor spin-exchange interactions at zero temperature. The competition between the nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic and next-nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic coupling gives rise to frustration in the system. Moreover, the presence of quantum fluctuations makes the ground-state phase profile even richer. We use the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) to compute the phases on a square lattice with periodic boundary conditions for a system of 16 sites (qubits). The trained VQE circuits are compared to exact diagonalization, allowing us to extract error measures of VQE. We focus on the ground-state phase transitions of this model, where VQE succeeds in finding the dominant magnetic phases. The optimized VQE circuits are then executed on the Quantinuum H1-1 trapped-ion quantum computer without using any error mitigation techniques. Our experiments show near perfect recovery of the magnetic phases of the frustrated model through ground-state energy, the energy derivative, and the spin correlation functions. Thus, we show that the trapped-ion quantum processor is able to achieve reliable simulations of a strongly correlated system within the limitations of the VQE approach.</description>

      <title>Fast and High Excitation Transport in Waveguide Quantum Electrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Waveguide quantum electrodynamics (wQED) with underlying collective and long-range atom-atom interactions has led to many distinct dynamical phenomena, including modified collective radiations and intriguing quantum correlations. It stands out as a unique platform to illustrate correlated photon transport, as well as to promise applications in quantum information processing. Here we manifest a fast and high atomic excitation transport by employing two well-separated chirally-coupled atomic arrays. This enhanced waveguide-mediated transport of excitations emerges due to the dominance of spectrally isolated and right-localized right eigenstates in the system's dynamics. Contrary to the instinct of applying the cascaded systems with unidirectional couplings to expedite direct and high excitation transport, the optimal system configurations in open wQED systems demand slight or finite nonreciprocal decay channels to facilitate energy transport by exploiting waveguide-mediated couplings. We also investigate the effect of the couplings' directionality and the scaling of atom number on the transport properties. Our results showcase the wide applicability in wQED platforms and provide insights to quantum engineering and quantum information applications.</description>

      <title>The effect of partial post-selection on quantum discrimination</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discrimination of quantum states is a central problem in quantum information science and technology. Meanwhile, partial post-selection has emerged as a valuable tool for quantum state engineering. In this work, we bring these two areas together and ask whether partial measurements can enhance the discrimination performance between two unknown and non-orthogonal pure states. Our framework is general: the two unknown states interact with the same environment-set in a pure state-via an arbitrary unitary transformation. A partial measurement is then performed on one of the output modes, modeled by an arbitrary positive operator-valued measure (POVM). We then allow classical communication to inform the unmeasured mode of the outcome of the partial measurement on the other mode, which is subsequently measured by a POVM that is optimal in the sense that the probability of error is minimized. The two POVMs act locally, but since we allow for classical communication between the two modes, we consider a scheme involving local operations and classical communication (LOCC). Under these considerations, we show that the minimum error probability, averaged over all possible post-selected branches, cannot be reduced below the minimum error probability of discriminating the original input states. In other words, prior state engineering via partial measurement does not improve the average discrimination performance. However, we also identify specific post-selection outcomes under which the conditional discrimination can achieve strictly lower error probabilities than the original optimal measurement, illustrating that while post-selection does not improve average performance, it can enable better discrimination in certain branches of the post-selected ensemble.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14354v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In particle physics, axions and axion-like particles are ubiquitous. Remarkably, ultra-light axions could constitute dark matter or dark energy. Therefore, it is important to detect axions experimentally. In the presence of a magnetic field, a photon can be converted into an axion, and vice versa. Utilizing the conversion phenomenon, several methods for detecting axions have been proposed. To improve detectability, it is desirable to use quantum sensing. However, since the conversion process is usually treated as classical wave dynamics, it is unclear how to incorporate quantum effects such as entanglement. In this work, we formulate the photon-axion conversion in a quantum field theoretical manner. As a result, we succeed in evaluating the conversion probability from a photon quantum state to an axion quantum state. In particular, it turns out that squeezed coherent states can enhance the conversion probability.</description>

      <title>Robust Control of High-dimensional Quantum Systems against Coherent and Incoherent Errors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Toward scalable quantum computing, the control of quantum systems needs to be robust against both coherent errors induced by parametric uncertainties and incoherent errors induced by environmental decoherence. This poses significant challenges for high-dimensional systems due to the computational intensity involved in the control design process. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework to improve the design efficiency. By employing the Taylor series expansion of uncertain parameters, the problem of robust control for an uncertain quantum system is reformulated as the optimal control problem of an augmented deterministic system. The Suzuki-Trotter expansion is then applied to accelerate the calculation of the system dynamics. Numerical simulations of quantum state preparation and quantum gate synthesis demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can successfully identify robust solutions in multi-qubit systems. The enhanced efficiency effectively extends the feasibility of high-order robust control for realistic high-dimensional quantum systems with multiple error sources.</description>

      <title>Observing High-dimensional Bell Inequality Violations using Multi-Outcome Spectral Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Violation of Bell inequalities is an essential requirement for many quantum information and communication protocols. In high-dimensional systems, Bell inequality tests face the challenge of implementing genuinely multi-outcome measurements, since the emulation of these with separate dichotomic projections opens a binarisation loophole that local hidden variable theories can exploit. Here we show that the joint spectral intensity of a two-photon entangled state contains access to the necessary multi-outcome measurements to overcome this obstacle and certify and violate a Bell inequality for high-dimensional states. This result is contrary to the belief that the joint spectral intensity is a phase-insensitive quantity and does not have sufficient information to certify entanglement or Bell-nonlocality. Using this approach, we violate the CGLMP Bell inequality up to dimension d = 8, all with negligible p-values, and for the first time close the binarisation loophole in high-dimensional Bell experiments. Guaranteeing Bell-nonlocal correlations using frequency-only measurements removes the technological hurdle of measurements in the temporal domain, thus greatly simplifying any practical implementation of future high-dimensional quantum information protocols.</description>

      <title>Generalized tensor transforms and their applications in classical and quantum computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for Generalized Tensor Transforms (GTTs), constructed through an $n$-fold tensor product of an arbitrary $b \times b$ unitary matrix $W$. This construction generalizes many established transforms, by providing a adaptable set of orthonormal basis functions. Our proposed fast classical algorithm for GTT achieves an exponentially lower complexity of $O(N \log_b N)$ in comparison to a naive classical implementation that has an associated computational cost of $O(N^2)$. For quantum applications, our GTT-based algorithm, implemented in the natural spectral ordering, achieves both gate complexity and circuit depth of $O(\log_b N)$, where $N = b^n$ denotes the length of the input vector. This represents a quadratic improvement over Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), which requires $O((\log_b N)^2)$ gates and depth for $n$ qudits, and an exponential advantage over classical Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) based and Fast Walsh-Hadamard Transform (FWHT) based methods, which incur a computational cost of $O(N \log_b N)$.
  We explore diverse applications of GTTs in quantum computing, including quantum state compression and transmission, function encoding and quantum digital signal processing. The proposed framework provides fine-grained control of the transformation through the adjustable parameters of the base matrix $W$. This versatility allows precise shaping of each basis function while preserving their effective Walsh-type structure, thus tailoring basis representations to specific quantum data and computational tasks. Our numerical results demonstrate that GTTs enable improved performance in quantum state compression and function encoding compared to fixed transforms (such as FWHT or FFT), achieving higher fidelities with fewer retained components. We also provided novel classical and quantum digital signal filtering algorithms based on our GTT framework.</description>

      <title>High-rate qutrit entanglement swapping with photon-number-basis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04322v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement generation between distant nodes is a fundamental process in distributed quantum information processing. Qudits, high-dimensional quantum states, are promising candidates for enhancing entanglement distribution capabilities. However, the success probability of qudit entanglement distribution using Bell measurements is typically lower than that of conventional qubit-based protocols. In this paper, we propose a novel entanglement swapping protocol specifically designed for qutrits (three-dimensional quantum states). Our protocol employs photon-number encoding combined with an additional mode basis, such as polarization, effectively increasing the success probability. We show that the proposed qutrit protocol can achieve higher entanglement generation rates compared to conventional two-photon detection-based qubit protocols, especially under conditions of limited photon generation probability. Furthermore, we evaluate our protocol under realistic experimental imperfections, including photon loss and threshold detection, and show that it achieves high fidelity with probabilistic photon sources.</description>

      <title>Layer Cake Representations for Quantum Divergences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Defining suitable quantum extensions of classical divergences often poses a challenge due to the non-commutative nature of quantum information. In this work, we propose a new approach via what we call the layer cake representation. The resulting quantum R\'enyi and $f$-divergences are then proven to be equivalent to those recently defined via integral representations. Nevertheless, the approach can provide several insights. We give an alternative proof of the integral representation of the relative entropy by Frenkel and prove a conjecture regarding a trace expression for the R\'enyi divergence. Additionally, we give applications to error exponents in hypothesis testing, a new Riemann-Stieltjes type integral representation and a variational representation.</description>

      <title>Non-Linearities In Atomic Quantum Receivers: Harmonic And Intermodulation Distortion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rydberg sensors offer a unique approach to radio frequency (RF) detection, leveraging the high sensitivity and quantum properties of highly-excited atomic states to achieve performance levels beyond classical technologies. Non-linear responses and distortion behavior in Rydberg atom receivers are critical to evaluating and establishing performance metrics and capabilities such as spur-free dynamic range and tolerance to unwanted interfering signals. We report here on the measurement and characterization of non-linear behavior and spurious response of a Rydberg atomic heterodyne receiver. Single-tone and two-tone testing procedures are developed and implemented for measurement of harmonic and inter-modulation distortion in Rydberg atomic receivers based on multi-photon Rydberg spectroscopy and radio-frequency heterodyne signal detection and demodulation in an atomic vapor. For a predetermined set of atomic receiver parameters and RF carrier wave in the SHF band near-resonant to a cesium Rydberg transition, we measure and characterize atomic receiver selectivity, bandwidth, roll-off, compression point (P1dB), second-order (IP2) and third-order (IP3) intercepts, and spur-free dynamic range. Receiver intermodulation distortion is characterized for the case of an interfering signal wave applied at two frequency offsets relative to the near-resonant reference local oscillator, $\Delta F/F= 10^{-4}$ at 6dB and $10^{-6}$ at 22dB single-tone bandwidths, respectively. We observe that under suitable operating conditions the atomic receiver can exhibit a suppression of harmonic and inter-modulation distortion relative to that of classical receiver mixer amplifiers. Finally, we describe how the non-linear behaviors of atomic receivers can provide unique, controllable RF signatures inaccessible by classical counterparts and propose their use to realize secure communication modalities and applications.</description>

      <title>Optically Switchable Fluorescence Enhancement at Critical Interparticle Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11541v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Plasmonic nanostructures provide electric field localization to be used as a fluorescence enhancement tool for the closely located fluorophores. However, metallic structures exhibit non-radiative energy transfer at close proximity, which suppresses the boost in the photoluminescence spectrum due to inhomogeneous medium. Compensation to non-radiative losses is fundamentally restricted, therefore defining the critical interparticle distances, where the fluorescence enhancement is detectable hold utmost importance for device applications. In this work, we numerically identified the critical interparticle distances of a metal nanoparticle (MNP) and quantum emitters (QEs) with angstrom resolution by analyzing the interplay between quantum yield and non-radiative decay. By engaging a collimated light application on silver nanoparticle (AgNP) placed at a critical distance, we simulated an active fluorescence enhancement switch yielding observable 7-fold increase in fluorescence intensity. The provided free space simulation includes the complete response of AgNP with retardation and higher order multi-polar effects for which the previous analytical works fall short. While the model bridges the absorption and emission spectra via corresponding Stokes shift values and presents a general approach for the interaction of QEs and MNPs in Rayleigh regime, it can be extended to Mie regime for larger QEs and can be modified for dielectric device environment.</description>

      <title>Finding local integrals of motion in quantum lattice models in the thermodynamic limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Local integrals of motion (LIOMs) play a key role in understanding the long-time properties of closed macroscopic systems. They were found for selected integrable systems via complex analytical calculations. The existence of LIOMs and their structure can also be studied via numerical methods, which, however, involve exact diagonalization of Hamiltonians, posing a bottleneck for such studies. We show that finding LIOMs in translationally invariant lattice models or unitary quantum circuits can be reduced to a problem for which one may numerically find an exact solution in the thermodynamic limit. We develop a simple algorithm and demonstrate its efficiency by calculating LIOMs and bounds on correlations (the Mazur bounds) for infinite integrable spin chains and unitary circuits. Finally, we demonstrate that this approach identifies slow modes in nearly integrable spin models and estimates their relaxation times.</description>

      <title>Solving the Hubbard model with Neural Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02644v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid development of neural quantum states (NQS) has established it as a promising framework for studying quantum many-body systems. In this work, by leveraging the cutting-edge transformer-based architectures and developing highly efficient optimization algorithms, we achieve the state-of-the-art results for the doped two-dimensional (2D) Hubbard model, arguably the minimum model for high-Tc superconductivity. Interestingly, we find different attention heads in the NQS ansatz can directly encode correlations at different scales, making it capable of capturing long-range correlations and entanglements in strongly correlated systems. With these advances, we establish the half-filled stripe in the ground state of 2D Hubbard model with the next nearest neighboring hoppings, consistent with experimental observations in cuprates. Our work establishes NQS as a powerful tool for solving challenging many-fermions systems.</description>
