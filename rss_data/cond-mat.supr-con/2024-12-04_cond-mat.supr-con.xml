      <title>Resistive anisotropy in the charge density wave phase of Kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5 thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the resistive anisotropy in CsV3Sb5 thin films within the charge density wave phase. Using a device structure with twelve electrodes symmetrically distributed in a circular shape, we measure the resistivity anisotropy by varying the current direction. A twofold resistivity anisotropy modulated by temperature is found, which is fully consistent with the electronic nematicity in CsV3Sb5, that is, the spontaneous rotational symmetry breaking by electronic degree of freedom. Additionally, the resistivity anisotropy also shows modest changes by applying magnetic fields, implying the possible chiral charge orders with time-reversal symmetry breaking. These findings provide deep insights into the correlated electronic states in Kagome materials and highlight the unique properties of CsV3Sb5 in the two-dimensional regime.</description>

      <title>Negative $c$-axis longitudinal magnetoresistance in FeSe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Below the structural transition occurring at $T_s=90$\,K, FeSe exhibits positive transverse magnetoresistance when the current is applied parallel to the $ab$-plane. In this study, we show that, in contrast, when both the magnetic field and the current are aligned along the $c$-axis, the magnetotransport changes significantly. In this configuration, FeSe develops a sizable negative longitudinal magnetoresistance ($\sim$15\% at $T$=10\,K and $\mu_0H$=16\,T) in the nematic phase. We attribute this finding to the effect of the applied magnetic field on the scattering from spin fluctuations. Our observations reflect the intricate interplay between spin and orbital degrees of freedom in the nematic phase of FeSe.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets, a distinct class of antiferromagnets with electronic structures resembling those of d-wave superconductors, exhibit intriguing properties that have gained significant attention in recent research. In this article, we propose synthetic altermagnets, composed of two anisotropic ferromagnetic layers arranged such that the total net magnetization is zero. We investigate the properties of these synthetic altermagnets, focusing on their electronic band structures, spin current, Berry curvature, and anomalous Hall conductivity. By developing a minimal model for our synthetic altermagnets, we examine the influence of factors such as anisotropic coupling strengths and spin-orbit coupling on the physical phenomena altermagnets manifest. Our findings open a new path for the realization of altermagnetic materials experimentally and highlight their potential applications in magneto-electronics, magneto-optics, and spintronics devices.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in metallic hydrogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05554v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconductivity, the lossless flow of electric current, occurs typically at very low temperatures. A possible exception is highly pressurized hydrogen, for which room temperature superconductivity has been predicted. However, as a result of various approximations used, conflicting theoretical predictions exist for the temperatures where superconductivity is expected to occur in highly pressurized hydrogen. Here we avoid those approximations and exploit the ``jellium'' model proposed in 1966 by De Gennes, where superconductivity involves the combination of Coulomb repulsion between the electrons and Coulomb attraction between the protons and the electrons. We confirm that metallic hydrogen should indeed exhibit superconductivity, but this is limited to temperatures far below previous estimates. We also find that the superconducting order develops over an energy range significantly exceeding the characteristic phonon energy, and that the phase of the order parameter flips 180 degrees at the characteristic phonon energy above and below the Fermi energy.</description>

      <title>Unconventional p-wave and finite-momentum superconductivity induced by altermagnetism through the formation of Bogoliubov Fermi surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnet is an exotic class of magnetic materials wherein the Fermi surface exhibits a momentum-dependent spin-splitting while maintaining a net zero magnetization. Previous studies have shown that this distinctive spin-splitting can induce chiral p-wave superconductors or Fulde-Ferrell (FF) superconducting states carrying finite momentum. However, the underlying mechanisms of such unconventional superconductivities remain elusive. Here, we propose that the formation of the Bogoliubov Fermi surface (BFS) through the exchange field can play a significant role in such phenomena. Through a systematic self-consistent mean-field analysis on the extended attractive Hubbard model combined with the d-wave spin-splitting induced by the exchange field, as observed in RuO2, we demonstrate that the formation of the BFS suppresses conventional spin-singlet superconducting states with s-wave characteristics. In contrast, the chiral p-wave state maintains a fully gapped spectrum without the Fermi surface, thereby becoming the ground state in the strong field regime. In the intermediate regime, we find that the FF state becomes the predominant state through the optimization of available channels for Cooper pairing. Moreover, we illustrate how the prevalence of the chiral p-wave and FF states over the s-wave state changes under the variation of the field strength or chemical potential. Our findings provide valuable insights into potential pathways for realizing sought-after topological p-wave superconductivity and finite momentum pairing facilitated by altermagnetism.</description>

      <title>Few-to-many-particle crossover of pair excitations in a superfluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.03762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent advances in the creation of few-body atomic Fermi gases with attractive interactions, we study theoretically the few-to-many-particle crossover of pair excitations, which for large particle numbers evolve into a mode that describes amplitude fluctuations of the superfluid order parameter (the "Higgs" mode). Our analysis is based on the hypothesis that salient aspects of the excitation spectrum are captured by interactions between time-reversed pair states in a harmonic oscillator potential. Microscopically, this assumption leads to a Richardson-type pairing model, which is integrable and thus allows a systematic quantitative study of the few-to-many-particle crossover with only minor numerical effort. We first establish a parity effect in the ground-state energy, i.e., a spectral convexity in the energy of open-shell configurations compared to their closed-shell neighbors, which is quantified by a so-called Matveev-Larkin parameter discussed for mesoscopic superconductors, which generalizes the pairing gap to mesoscopic ensembles and which behaves quantitatively differently in a few-body and a many-body regime. The crossover point for this quantity is widely tunable as a function of interaction strength. We then compute the excitation spectrum and demonstrate that the pair excitation energy shows a minimum that deepens with increasing particle number and shifts to smaller interaction strengths, consistent with the finite-size precursor of a quantum phase transition to a superfluid state. We extract a critical finite-size scaling exponent that characterizes the decrease of the gap with increasing particle number.</description>

      <title>Photon Frequency Conversion in High-$Q$ Superconducting Resonators: Axion Electrodynamics, QED &amp; Nonlinear Meissner Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08275v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-Q superconducting resonators have been proposed and developed as detectors of light-by-light scattering mediated by the hypothesized axion or virtual electron-positron pairs in quantum electrodynamics - the Euler-Heisenberg (EH) interaction. Photon frequency and mode conversion is central to the scheme for detecting such rare events. Superconducting resonators are nonlinear devices. The Meissner screening currents that confine the electromagnetic fields to the vacuum region of a superconducting RF cavity are nonlinear functions of the EM field at the vacuum-superconducting interface, and as a result can generate source currents and frequency conversion of microwave photons in the cavity. In this report we consider photon frequency and mode conversion in superconducting resonators with high quality factors from Meissner currents in single and dual cavity setups proposed for axion and QED searches based on light-by-light scattering. In a single cavity with two pump modes photon frequency conversion by the Meissner screening current dominates photon generation by the EH interaction for cavities with $Q \lesssim 10^{12}$. The Meissner currents also generate background photons that limits the operation of the resonator for axion detection in three-mode, single cavity setups. We also consider the leakage of photons from pump modes into the signal mode for both axion and EH mediated light-by-light scattering. Photon frequency conversion by the EH interaction can compete with Meissner and leakage radiation in \emph{ultra-high-Q} cavities that are beyond current state of the art. Meissner radiation and leakage backgrounds can be suppressed in dual cavity setups with appropriate choices for pump and spectator modes, as well as the single-cavity setup proposed for heterodyne detection of galactic axion dark matter.</description>

      <title>Rare-Earth Chalcogenides: An Inspiring Playground For Exploring Frustrated Magnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rare-earth chalcogenide $ARECh_{2}$ family ($A =$ alkali metal or monovalent ions, $RE =$ rare earth, $Ch =$ chalcogen) has emerged as a paradigmatic platform for studying frustrated magnetism on a triangular lattice. The family members exhibit a variety of ground states, from quantum spin liquid to exotic ordered phases, providing fascinating insight into quantum magnetism. Their simple crystal structure and chemical tunability enable systematic exploration of competing interactions in quantum magnets. Recent neutron scattering and thermodynamic studies have revealed rich phase diagrams and unusual excitations, refining theoretical models of frustrated systems. This review provides a succinct introduction to $ARECh_{2}$ research. It summarizes key findings on crystal structures, single-ion physics, magnetic Hamiltonians, ground states, and low-energy excitations. By highlighting current developments and open questions, we aim to catalyze further exploration and deeper physical understanding on this frontier of quantum magnetism.</description>
