      <title>Relative Hochster--Takayama formula and Cohen--Macaulay monomial ideal quotients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hochster's and Takayama's formulas describes the multigraded components of local cohomology modules of monomial ideals in terms of simplicial complexes. In this paper, we develop a relative version of these formulas for quotients $I/J$ of monomial ideals, expressing the multigraded pieces of local cohomology modules of $I/J$ as reduced relative (co)homology of pairs of degree complexes. As an application, we obtain a relative Reisner criterion characterizing Cohen-Macaulay monomial ideal quotients. We further apply this relative Hochster--Takayama framework to modules arising from symbolic power filtrations, including symbolic quotients $I^{(t)}/I^{(t+1)}$ and symbolic-ordinary discrepancy module $I^{(t)}/I^t$. In particular, for a squarefree monomial ideal $I$, we give a precise classification of when $I^{(t)}/I^{(t+1)}$ is Cohen-Macaulay for all or, equivalently, for some $t \ge 2$. When $I$ is the edge ideal of a graph, we characterize the Cohen-Macaulayness of $I^{(t)}/I^t$ for all or, equivalently, for some sufficiently large $t$, and analyze the behavior of its dimension function.</description>

      <title>Annihilator of Ext</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the higher divisorial ideal \( D(I) := \Ann\!\bigl(Ext^g_R(R/I,R)\bigr) \) associated to an ideal \(I\) of grade \(g\). Our main focus is the containment problem \( D(I) \subseteq \overline{I} \). We establish that this inclusion holds for broad classes of ideals, including unmixed ideals of finite projective dimension over 3-dimensional quasi-normal rings, parameter ideals in quasi-Gorenstein rings, and powers of perfect ideals under certain homological conditions. Conversely, we construct explicit examples showing the necessity of hypotheses. We develop structural properties of \(D(I)\), relating it to unmixed parts, reflexive closures, symbolic powers, Frobenius closure, and trace ideals. Applications include criteria for the triviality of reflexive modules and vector bundles on punctured spectra, as well as new connections between annihilators of Ext, conductor ideals, and local cohomology.</description>

      <title>On the initial Betti numbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:1912.10864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a Cohen-Macaulay local ring possessing a canonical module. We compare the initial and terminal Betti numbers of modules in a series of nontrivial cases. We pay special attention to the Betti numbers of the canonical module. Also, we compute $\beta_0(\omega_{\frac{R}{I}})$ in some cases, where $I$ is a product of two ideals.</description>

      <title>Topologically integrable derivations and additive group actions on affine ind-schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.14302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.14302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a theory of additive group actions on affine ind-schemes through a purely algebraic and topological framework. Affine ind-schemes are described via complete, second-countable, linearly topologized rings, and actions of the additive group are encoded by restricted exponential homomorphisms. We introduce the notion of a topologically integrable derivation, a continuous derivation whose formal exponential converges in the sense of restricted power series, and show that this notion provides the correct extension of locally nilpotent derivations to the infinite-dimensional setting. Our first main result establishes a one-to-one correspondence between topologically integrable derivations and additive group actions on affine ind-schemes, extending the classical correspondence for affine varieties. We then investigate the structure of such actions admitting a slice. In this context, we prove an ind-scheme analog of the classical slice theorem: if an additive group action admits a slice, then the underlying affine ind-scheme is equivariantly isomorphic to a product with the affine line, and the action is given by translation on the second factor. Several examples illustrate the necessity of the topological hypotheses and highlight phenomena absent in the finite-type case.</description>

      <title>Integral closure of 1-dimensional rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study certain properties of modules over 1-dimensional local integral domains. First, we examine the order of the conductor ideal and its expected relationship with multiplicity. Next, we investigate the reflexivity of certain colength-two ideals. Finally, we consider the freeness problem of the absolute integral closure of a DVR, and connect this to the reflexivity problem of $R^{\frac{1}{p^n}}$.</description>

      <title>Torsion modules and differential operators in infinitely many variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07739v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper grew out of the author's work on arXiv:2504.18460. Differential operators in the sense of Grothendieck acting between modules over a commutative ring can be interpreted as torsion elements in the bimodule of all operators with respect to the diagonal ideal in the tensor square of the ring. Various notions of torsion modules for an infinitely generated ideal in a commutative ring lead to various notions of differential operators. We discuss differential operators of transfinite orders and differential operators having no global order at all, but only local orders with respect to specific elements of the ring. Many examples are presented. In particular, we prove that every ordinal can be realized as the order of a differential operator acting on the algebra of polynomials in infinitely many variables over a field. We also discuss extension of differential operators to localizations of rings and modules, and to colocalizations of modules.</description>

      <title>Numerical Semigroups of Sally Type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11738v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Judith Sally proved in 1980 that the associated graded ring of one-dimensional Gorenstein local rings of multiplicity $e$ and embedding dimension $e-2$ are Cohen-Macaulay. She showed that the defining ideal of the associated graded ring of such rings is generated by ${e-2 \choose 2}$ elements. Numerical semigroup rings are a big class of one-dimensional Cohen-Macaulay rings. In 2014, Herzog and Stamate proved that the numerical semigroup $&lt;e,e+1,e+4,\ldots,2e-1 &gt;$ defines a Gorenstein semigroup ring satisfying Sally's conditions above and such semigroups are called Gorenstein Sally Semigroups. We call a numerical semigroup $S$ as Sally type if $&lt;S &gt;= &lt; e,e+1,\ldots,e+m-1, e+m+1,\ldots, e+n-1,e+n+1, \ldots 2e-1&gt;$ for some $2 \leq m &lt;n \leq e-2$. In this paper, we give a formula for its Frobenius number along with a necessary and sufficient condition for it to be Gorenstein. We compute the minimal number of generators for the defining ideal of the semigroup ring $k[S]$. Additionally, we present an algorithm and a GAP code used in applying Hochster's combinatorial formula to compute the first Betti number of $k[S]$.</description>

      <title>Structure and Symmetry of Sally Type Semigroup Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a numerical semigroup minimally generated by a subset of the interval $[e,2e-1]$ with multiplicity $e$ and width $e-1$. Such numerical semigroups are called Sally type semigroups. We show that the defining ideals of these semigroup rings, when the embedding dimension is $e-2$, generically have the structure of the sum of two determinantal ideals. More generally, Sally type numerical semigroups with multiplicity $e$ and embedding dimension $d=e-k$ are obtained by introducing $k$ gaps in the interval $[e,2e-1]$. It is known that for $k =2$, there is precisely one such semigroup that is Gorenstein, and it happens when one deletes consecutive integers. Let $S^e_k(j)$ denote the Sally type numerical semigroup of multiplcity $e$, embedding dimension $e-k$ obtained by deleting the $k$ consecutive integers $j, j+1, \ldots, j+k-1$.We prove that for any $1\le k &lt; e/2$, the semigroup $S^e_k(j)$ is Gorenstein if and only if $j=k$. We construct an explicit minimal free resolution of the semigroup ring of $S^e_k(k)$ and compute the Betti numbers. In general, we characterize when $S^e_k(j)$ are symmetric and construct minimal resolutions for these Gorenstein semigroup rings.</description>

      <title>Toric varieties modulo reflections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $W$ be a finite group generated by reflections of a lattice $M$. If a lattice polytope $P \subset M \otimes_{\mathbb Z}\mathbb R$ is preserved by $W$, then we show that the quotient of the projective toric variety $X_P$ by $W$ is isomorphic to the toric variety $X_{P \cap D}$, where $D$ is a fundamental domain for the action of $W$. This answers a question of Horiguchi-Masuda-Shareshian-Song, and recovers results of Blume, of Song, of the second author, and of Gui-Hu-Liu. We also study quotients of real toric varieties, proving that $X_P^{\mathbb R} / W$ is contractible when $P$ is a permutohedron.</description>

      <title>The spectrum of the Burnside Tambara functor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the spectrum of prime ideals in the Burnside Tambara functor over an arbitrary finite group. Our proof uses recent advances in the commutative algebra of Tambara functors, as well as a Tambara functor analogue of ghost coordinates which works over arbitrary finite groups and clarifies some previous computations. As examples, we explicitly compute the spectrum of the Burnside Tambara functor over all dihederal groups, the quaternion group $Q_8$, the alternating group $A_4$, and the general linear group $GL_3(F_2)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the Thomason condition holds for any concentrated regular Noetherian algebraic stack with quasi-finite and locally separated diagonal. As a consequence, the derived category of quasi-coherent sheaves on such an algebraic stack is singly compactly generated. This extends results of Hall--Rydh from separated to locally separated diagonal, under additional regularity hypotheses.</description>
