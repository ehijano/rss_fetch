      <title>Combinatorial and Gaussian Foundations of Rational Nth Root Approximations: Theorems and Conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an approach (the biroot method) for nth root approximation that yields closed-form rational functions with coefficients derived from binomial structures, Gaussian functions, or qualifying DAG structures. The method emerges from an analysis of Newton's method applied to root extraction, revealing that successive iterations generate coefficients following rows of Pascal's triangle in an alternating numerator-denominator pattern. After further exploration of these patterns, we formulate three main conjectures: (1) the Binomial Biroot Conjecture establishing the fundamental alternating coefficient structure to approximate nth roots (for which we prove the square root case and optimal parameter conditions), (2) the Gaussian Biroot Conjecture, and (3) the General DAG Biroot Conjecture showing a structural invariance to nth root approximation using arbitrary linearly-constructed directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Computational evidence demonstrates superior convergence properties when compared to Taylor series and Pad\'e approximations, especially considering the more direct and less computationally intensive approach to the biroot function construction. A computational framework has been developed to support systematic exploration of the biroot method's parameter space and to enable extensive numerical and symbolic analysis. The method provides both theoretical insights and computational significance by connecting combinatorial structures to nth root rational approximation theory.</description>

      <title>Cactus, Pascal, and Pappus Point-Line Configurations: An Algebraic-Geometric Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study point-line configurations and their associated matroid and circuit varieties. We aim to find a finite set of defining equations for matroid varieties and an irreducible decomposition for circuit varieties.
  To solve the former problem, we use some classical techniques from algebraic geometry, including the Grassmann-Cayley algebra and the liftability technique. From this, we can respectively derive the Grassmann-Cayley ideal, introduced by Sidman, Traves and Wheeler, and the lifting ideal, introduced by Liwski, Mohammadi, Clarke and Masiero. Since the circuit ideal, the Grassmann-Cayley ideal and the lifting ideal are contained in the matroid ideal and explicit generators are known for them, it is a natural question to identify point-line configurations for which a generating set of the matroid ideal is formed by the circuit polynomials, Grassmann-Cayley polynomials and lifting polynomials. For these point-line configurations, we obtain an explicit and finite description of the matroid variety. In this thesis, we prove that the matroid ideal of cactus configurations, the Pascal configuration and the Pappus configuration can be generated by these three types of polynomials.
  To find an irreducible decomposition for the circuit varieties of point-line configurations, we use the decomposition strategy developed by Clarke, Grace, Mohammadi and Motwani. If the point-line configuration has some points lying on at most two lines, we develop a shorter alternative as well. We find such a decomposition for cactus configurations, up to irredundancy. Moreover, we find an irreducible decomposition for the Pascal configuration and the third configuration $9_3$, which is a point-line configuration with nine points and nine lines, such that every point is on three lines and every line contains three points.</description>

      <title>The tropical crossing number of a finite graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2015, Cartwright et al. showed that any $3$-regular metric graph arises as the skeleton of a tropical plane curve with nodes allowed. They introduced the tropical crossing number of a metric graph as the minimum number of nodes required for that graph with the prescribed lengths. We introduce the tropical crossing number of a finite, non-metric graph, the minimum number of nodes required to achieve that graph with any lengths on its edges. We prove that for any positive integer $d$ there exists a graph whose tropical crossing number is equal to $d$; moreover, this graph can be chosen with any prescribed graph-theoretic crossing number at most $d$. We then introduce and use computational methods to find the tropical crossing number of the smallest non-tropically planar graph, the lollipop graph of genus $3$. We also show that our tropical crossing number can grow quadratically in the number of vertices of the graph.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that every proper edge-coloring of the $n$-dimensional hypercube $Q_n$ contains a rainbow copy of every tree $T$ on at most $n$ edges. This result is best possible, as $Q_n$ can be properly edge-colored using only $n$ colors while avoiding rainbow cycles.</description>

      <title>The Exponential Hyper-Zagreb Indices and Structural Properties of Trees and Bipartite Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the structural properties of trees and bipartite graphs through the lens of topological indices and combinatorial graph theory. We focus on the First and Second Hyper-Zagreb indices, $HM_1(G)$ and $HM_2(G)$, for trees $T \in T(n, \Delta)$ with $n$ vertices and maximum degree $\Delta$. Key propositions demonstrate that the presence of end-support or support vertices of degree at least three, distinct from a vertex of maximum degree, implies the existence of another tree $T' \in T(n, \Delta)$ with strictly smaller Hyper-Zagreb indices. These results are extended to exponential forms, highlighting the influence of high-degree vertices. Additionally, we explore structural characterizations of trees via degree sequence majorization and $S$-order, establishing conditions for the first and last trees in specific classes. For bipartite graphs, we examine equitable coloring, cycle lengths, and $k$-redundant tree embeddings, supported by theorems on connectivity and minimum degree constraints. The paper also addresses the independence number of bipartite graphs, exterior covers, and competition numbers of complete $r$-partite graphs, providing bounds and structural insights. Finally, we discuss Markov-chain algorithms for generating bipartite graphs and tournaments with prescribed degree sequences, analyzing their mixing times and convergence properties. These results contribute to the understanding of extremal properties and combinatorial structures in graph theory, with applications in chemical graph theory and network analysis.</description>

      <title>Almost Maiorana-McFarland bent functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study bent functions on $\mathbb{F}_2^{2m}$ of the form $f(x,y) = x \cdot \phi(y) + h(y)$, where $x \in \mathbb{F}_2^{m-1} $ and $ y \in \mathbb{F}_2^{m+1}$, which form the generalized Maiorana-McFarland class (denoted by ${GMM}_{m+1}$) and are referred to as almost Maiorana-McFarland bent functions. We provide a complete characterization of the bent property for such functions and determine their duals. Specifically, we show that $f$ is bent if and only if the mapping $\phi $ partitions $ \mathbb{F}_2^{m+1}$ into 2-dimensional affine subspaces, on each of which the function $ h $ has odd weight. We investigate which properties of mappings $\phi \colon \mathbb{F}_2^{m+1} \to \mathbb{F}_2^{m-1}$ lead to bent functions of the form $ f(x,y) = x \cdot \phi(y) + h(y) $ both inside and outside ${M}^\# $ and provide construction methods for suitable Boolean functions $ h $ on $\mathbb{F}_2^{m+1}$. We present a simple algorithm for constructing partitions of the vector space $\mathbb{F}_2^{m+1}$ together with appropriate Boolean functions $ h $ that generate bent functions outside ${M}^\# $. When $ 2m = 8 $, we explicitly identify many such partitions that produce at least $ 2^{78} $ distinct bent functions on $\mathbb{F}_2^8$ that do not belong to ${M}^\# $, thereby generating more bent functions outside ${M}^\#$ than the total number of 8-variable bent functions in ${M}^\#$. Additionally, we demonstrate that concatenating four almost Maiorana-McFarland bent functions outside ${M}^\# $, can result in a bent function ${M}^\# $. This finding answers an open problem posed recently in Kudin et al. (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 71(5): 3999-4011, 2025). Conversely, using a similar approach to concatenate four functions each in ${M}^\#$, we generate bent functions that are provably outside ${M}^\#$.</description>

      <title>On the "second" Kahn--Kalai Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We make progress on a conjecture of Kahn and Kalai, the original (stronger but less general) version of what became known as the ``Kahn-Kalai Conjecture" (KKC; now a theorem of Park and Pham). This ``second" KKC concerns the threshold, $p_c(H)$, for $G_{n,p}$ to contain a copy of a given graph $H$, predicting $p_c(H) = O(p_{\mathbb E}(H)\log n)$, where $p_{\mathbb E}$ is an easy lower bound on $p_c$. What we actually show is $p_{\mathbb E}^*(H)=O(p_{\mathbb E}(H)\log ^2n)$, where $p_{\mathbb E}^*$, the fractional expectation threshold, is a larger lower bound suggested by Talagrand. When combined with Talagrand's fractional relaxation of the KKC (now a theorem of Frankston, Kahn, Narayanan and Park), this gives $p_c(H)=O(p_{\mathbb E}(H)\log^3 n)$. (The second KKC would follow similarly if one could remove the log factors from the above bound on $p_{\mathbb E}^*$.)</description>

      <title>Permutations satisfying $(P_1)$ and $(P_2)$ properties and $\ell$-optimal bent functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An important classification of permutations over $\mathbb{F}_2^m$, suitable for constructing Maiorana-McFarland bent functions on $\mathbb{F}_2^m \times \mathbb{F}_2^m$ with the unique $M$-subspace of maximal dimension, was recently considered in Pasalic et al. (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 70(6): 4464-4477, 2024). More precisely, two properties called $(P_1)$ and $(P_2)$ were introduced and a generic method of constructing permutations having the property $(P_1)$ was presented, whereas no such results were provided related to the $(P_2)$ property. In this article, we provide a deeper insight on these properties, their mutual relationship, and specify some explicit classes of permutations having these properties. Such permutations are then employed to generate a large variety of bent functions outside the completed Maiorana-McFarland class $M^\#$. We also introduce $\ell$-optimal bent functions as bent functions with the lowest possible linearity index; such functions can be considered as opposite to Maiorana-McFarland bent functions. We give explicit constructions of $\ell$-optimal bent functions within the $D_0$ class, which in turn can be employed in certain secondary constructions of bent functions for providing even more classes of bent functions that are provably outside $M^\#$. Moreover, we demonstrate that a certain subclass of $D_0$ has an additional property of having only 5-valued spectra decompositions. Finally, we generalize the so-called "swapping variables" method which then allows us to specify large families of bent functions outside $M^\#$. In this way, we give a better explanation of the origin of bent functions in dimension eight, since the vast majority of them is outside ${M}^\#$.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic structure. IV. A counterexample to the weak coarse Menger conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coarse graph theory concerns finding 'coarse' analogues of graph theory theorems, replacing disjointness with being far apart. One of the most interesting open questions is to find a coarse analogue of Menger's theorem, which characterizes when there are $k$ vertex-disjoint paths between two given sets $S,T$ of vertices of a graph. We showed in an earlier paper that the most natural such analogue is false, but a weaker statement remained as a popular open question. Here we show that the weaker statement is also false.
  More exactly, suppose that $S,T$ are sets of vertices of a graph $G$, and there do not exist $k$ paths between $S,T$, pairwise at distance at least $c$. To make an analogue of Menger's theorem, one would like to prove that there must be a small set $X\subseteq V(G)$ such that every $S-T$ path of $G$ passes close to a member of $X$: but how small and how close? In view of Menger's theorem, one would hope for $|X|&lt;k$ and 'close' some function of $k,c$ (and indeed, this was conjectured by Georgakopoulos and Papasoglu, and independently, by Albrechtsen, Huynh, Jacobs, Knappe and Wollan); but we showed that this is false, even if $c=3$ and $k=3$.
  Here we upgrade the counterexample: we show that, even if $c=k=3$, no pair of constants (for 'small' and 'close') work. For all $\ell, m$, there is a graph $G$ and $S,T\subseteq V(G)$, such that there do not exist three $S-T$ paths pairwise with distance at least three, and yet there is no $X$ with $|X|\le m$ such that every $S-T$ path passes within distance at most $\ell$ of $X$.</description>

      <title>Maxmum Size of a Uniform Family with Bounded VC-dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1984, Frankl and Pach proved that, for positive integers $n$ and $d$, the maximum size of a $(d+1)$-uniform set family $\mathcal{F}$ on an $n$-element set with VC-dimension at most $d$ is at most ${n\choose d}$; and they suspected that ${n\choose d}$ could be replaced by ${n-1\choose d}$, which would generalize the famous Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado theorem and was mentioned by Erd\H{o}s as Frankl--Pach conjecture. However, Ahlswede and Khachatrian in 1997 constructed $(d+1)$-uniform families on an $n$-element set with VC-dimension at most $d$ and size exactly $\binom{n-1}{d}+\binom{n-4}{d-2}$, and Mubayi and Zhao in 2007 constructed more such families. It has since been an open question to narrow the gap between the lower bound $\binom{n-1}{d}+\binom{n-4}{d-2}$ and the upper bound ${n\choose d}$. In a recent breakthrough, Chao, Xu, Yip, and Zhang reduced the upper bound $\binom{n }{d}$ to $ \binom{n-1}{d}+O( n^{d-1-\frac{1}{4d-2}})$. In this paper, we further reduce the upper bound to $\binom{n-1}{d} + O(n^{d-2})$, asymptotically matching the lower bound $\binom{n-1}{d}+\binom{n-4}{d-2}$.</description>

      <title>More on Nosal's spectral theorem: Books and $4$-cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectral graph theory studies how the eigenvalues of a graph relate to the structural properties of a graph. In this paper, we solve three open problems in spectral extremal graph theory which generalize the classical Tur\'{a}n-type supersaturation results.
  (a) We prove that every $m$-edge graph $G$ with the spectral radius $\lambda (G) &gt; \sqrt{m}$ contains at least $\frac{1}{144} \sqrt{m}$ triangles sharing a common edge. This result confirms a conjecture of Nikiforov, and Li and Peng. Moreover, the bound is optimal up to a constant factor.
  (b) Next, for $m$-edge graph $G$ with $\lambda (G) &gt; \sqrt{(1-\frac{1}{r})2m}$, we show that it must contain $\Omega_r (\sqrt{m})$ copies of $K_{r+1}$ sharing $r$ common vertices. This confirms a conjecture of Li, Liu and Feng and unifies a series of spectral extremal results on books and cliques. Moreover, we also show that such a graph $G$ contains $\Omega_r (m^{\frac{r-1}{2}})$ copies of $K_{r+1}$. This extends a result of Ning and Zhai for counting triangles.
  (c) We prove that every $m$-edge graph $G$ with $\lambda (G) &gt; \sqrt{m}$ contains at least $(\frac{1}{8}-o(1)) m^2$ copies of 4-cycles, and we provide two constructions showing that the constant $\frac{1}{8}$ is the best possible. This result settles a problem raised by Ning and Zhai, and it gives the first asymptotics for counting degenerate bipartite graphs.
  The key to our proof are two structural results we obtain for graphs with large spectral radii on their maximum degree and on existence of large structured subgraphs, which we believe to be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Dehn Sommerville Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dehn-Sommerville manifolds are a class of finite abstract simplicial complexes that generalize discrete manifolds. Despite a simpler definition in comparison to manifolds, they still share most properties of manifolds. They especially satisfy all Dehn-Sommerville symmetries telling that half of the f-vector entries are redundant. They also share other properties with q-manifolds: for every Dehn-Sommerville q-manifold G and any function g: V(G) to A={0, ..., k} with positive k, the set of x such that g(x) contains A is a Dehn-Sommerville (q-k)-manifold if not empty. We also see that for Dehn-Sommerville q-manifolds, all higher characteristics w_m(G) agree with Euler characteristic that the chromatic number is bounded above by 2q+2 and that odd-dimensional Dehn-Sommerville manifolds are flat and form a monoid under the join operation. In general, Dehn-Sommerville manifolds are invariant under edge refinement, Barycentric refinement and Cartesian products.</description>

      <title>Injective (edge) colorings of generalized Sierpi\'{n}ski graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized Sierpi\'{n}ski graphs constitute a distinctive class of fractal-like networks, whose self-similar properties have attracted growing attention. In particular, a number of graph invariants have been studied in generalized Sierpi\'{n}ski graphs. In this paper, we focus on injective colorings of this class of graphs, both the vertex and the edge version. The vertex version of injective colorings in generalized Sierpi\'{n}ski graphs was initiated in [Injective colorings of Sierpi\'nski-like graphs and Kneser graphs,Graphs.\ Combin.\ 41 (2025) 83], where the authors determined the injective chromatic numbers of the standard Sierpi\'{n}ski graphs (which are those whose base graph is a clique) and asked about the values when the base graph is a cycle. We resolve this question by proving that $\chi_i(S_{C_k}^n)=3$ for every $n\ge 2$ and every $k\ge 3$, which follows from a more general result on generalized Sierpi\' nski graphs $S_G^n$ with arbitrary base graphs $G$. Moreover, we prove (an almost conclusive result) that $\chi_i(S_G^n)\in \{\chi_i(G),\chi_i(G)+1\}$ for any graph $G$ and any $n\ge 2$. Injective edge colorings appear to be more difficult, especially in graphs with triangles. On a positive note, we prove that $\chi_i'(S_{K_3}^n)=5$ for all $n\ge 3$. Furthermore, if $G$ is a triangle-free graph, we prove that $\chi_i'(S_G^n)\in \{\chi_i'(S_G^3),\chi_i'(S_G^3)+1\}$ for all $n\ge 4$, and provide some sufficient conditions on an injective edge coloring of the 3-dimensional Sierpi\'{n}ski graph over $G$, which ensure that $\chi_i'(S_G^n)=\chi_i'(S_G^3)$. In particular, the latter result enables us to establish that $\chi_i'(S_{C_4}^n)=3$, $\chi_i'(S_{C_5}^n)=4$ and $\chi_i'(S_{C_6}^n)=3$ hold for any $n\ge 2$.</description>

      <title>An elementary construction of the ring of dual $K$-$Q$-cancellation property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an elementary introduction on $K$-theoretic $Q$-functions, which were introduced by Ikeda and Naruse in 2013. These functions, which serve as $K$-theoretic analogs of Schur $Q$-functions, are known to possess combinatorial and algebraic constructions. In a 2022 paper, the author introduced ``$\beta$-deformed power-sums" to provide a simpler, more algebraic construction of these functions. Since the original approach relies on fermionic operators and vacuum expectation values, this paper presents a more accessible, purely algebraic treatment, following the exposition of Schur $Q$-functions in Macdonald's standard textbook. We also show that the algebra of dual $Q$-cancellation property with integer coefficients is generated by dual $K$-$Q$-functions associated with an odd row partition.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Cycles in Simplicial and Supersolvable Hyperplane Arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14538v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the Gray code interpretation of Hamiltonian cycles in Cayley graphs, we investigate the existence of Hamiltonian cycles in tope graphs of hyperplane arrangements, with a focus on simplicial, reflection, and supersolvable arrangements. We confirm Hamiltonicity for all 3-dimensional simplicial arrangements listed in the Gr\"unbaum--Cuntz catalogue. Extending earlier results by Conway, Sloane, and Wilks, we prove that all restrictions of finite reflection arrangements, including all Weyl groupoids and crystallographic arrangements, admit Hamiltonian cycles. Finally, we further establish that all supersolvable hyperplane arrangements and supersolvable oriented matroids have Hamiltonian cycles, offering a constructive proof based on their inductive structure.</description>

      <title>On upper bounds on the number of parts in the problem of partitioning sets into parts of smaller diameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, we study problems related to the classical Borsuk's problem. Recall that the Borsuk's problem consists in finding the smallest number $ f(n) $ of parts of smaller diameter into which an arbitrary set of diameter 1 in Euclidean space $ {\mathbb R}^n $ can be divided. Here we will discuss the quantity $ \chi(n,b) $ which differs from the quantity $ f(n) $ in that in its definition an arbitrary set of diameter 1 in $ {\mathbb R}^n $ must be partitioned into parts whose diameters are strictly less than a given number $ b \in (0,1] $. In this paper, we collect information about the known upper bounds and, among other things, find a new upper bound for the quantity $ \chi(n,b) $.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bent functions are Boolean functions that are maximally nonlinear. They can be represented as bent squares, i.e., square matrices for which each row and each column is the Walsh spectrum of a Boolean function. Using this representation, it is shown in this note that the number of bent functions in $n$ variables is at least $2^{n \cdot 2^{\frac{n}{2}} \left(1 + O\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)\right)}$ for even integers $n$.</description>

      <title>New improved lower bounds for Zagreb indices of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents new lower bounds for the first general Zagreb index $Z_{\alpha}(G)$ involving two, three, and four arbitrary degrees of vertices of a simple graph $G$. For the special cases $\alpha = 2$ and $\alpha = -2$, the results give sharper bounds for the first Zagreb index $M_1(G)$ and the modified first Zagreb index ${}^{m}M_1(G)$, thereby improving several well-known inequalities in the literature. Furthermore, some applications of the derived bounds for $M_1(G)$ are demonstrated, establishing new bounds for the second Zagreb index, the spectral radius, Nordhaus-Gaddum type bounds, and their corresponding coindices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The connected components of $\mathcal{M}_{0,n}(\mathbb{R})$ are in bijection with the $(n-1)!/2$ dihedral orderings of $[n]$. They are all isomorphic. We construct monomial maps between them, and use these maps to prove a conjecture of Arkani-Hamed, He, and Lam in the case of $\mathcal{M}_{0,n}$. Namely, we provide a bijection between connected components and sign patterns that are consistent with the extended $u$-relations for the dihedral embedding.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we continue the study of the generator graph of a group. In 2023, Tacbobo [9] defined the generator graph of a nontrivial group to be the graph whose vertices are the elements of the group, with two vertices being adjacent if at least one of them is a generator of the group. Building on the properties established in [9], we prove that the diameter of the generator graph of a cyclic group is at most $2$. Furthermore, we present explicit formulas for some topological indices of the generator graph of a cyclic group with $n \ge 2$ elements and whose set of generators is $S$, expressed in terms of $n$ and $|S|$. Lastly, we determine the metric dimension of the generator graph of a nontrivial cyclic group as a function of its order $n$.</description>

      <title>General Kontsevich-style formula for Hirzebruch Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tyomkin's correspondence theorem states the equality of counts of rational curves of fixed homology class in a toric surface satisfying point and cross-ratio conditions with their tropical counterparts. Such correspondence theorems allow us to derive non-tropical results from tropical ones; for example, Mikhalkin's correspondence theorem is used in the tropical proof of the famous Kontsevich formula for counts of plane rational curves of degree $d$ satisfying point conditions. This formula has been generalized to counts of curves in the Hirzebruch surface $\mathbb{F}_{2}$ satisfying point conditions. Further generalizations allow curves in $\mathbb{P}^2$ to satisfy multiple cross-ratio conditions. In this paper, we present a Kontsevich-style formula for the Hirzebruch surface $\mathbb{F}_r$, $r \in \mathbb{N}$, which counts rational tropical curves of a fixed homology class satisfying point and multiple cross-ratio conditions using tropical methods. Moreover, the cross-ratio conditions we impose on the curves allow more freedom.</description>

      <title>Tropicalized quantum field theory and global tropical sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explain how to tropicalize scalar quantum field theory and show that tropicalized massive scalar quantum field theory is exactly solvable. This exact solution manifests as a non-linear recursion equation fulfilled by the expansion coefficients of the quantum effective action. Geometrically, this recursion computes specific volumes of moduli spaces of metric graphs and is thereby analogous to Mirzakhani's volume recursions on the moduli space of curves. Building on this exact solution, we construct an algorithm that samples points from the moduli space of graphs approximately proportional to their perturbative contribution. Remarkably, this algorithm requires only polynomial time and memory, suggesting that perturbative quantum field theory computations lie in the polynomial-time complexity class, while all known algorithms for evaluating individual Feynman integrals are exponential in time and memory. To demonstrate the capabilities of the algorithm, we evaluate the primitive contribution to the $\phi^4$ beta function at 50 loops with a proof-of-concept implementation.</description>

      <title>On the homology of simplicial and cubical sets with symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the homology of simplicial and cubical sets with symmetries. These are simplicial and cubical sets with additional maps expressing the symmetries of simplices and cubes. We consider the chain complex computing the homology groups in either case. We show for coefficients in fields of characteristic $0$ that the sub-complex generated by degeneracies (simplicial case) or connections (cubical case) together with all $x - sgn(t)tx$ for symmetries $t$ and chains $x$ is acyclic. In particular, it follows that quotienting by this sub-complex yields a chain complex with isomorphic homology. The latter leads to structural insight and a speedup in explicit computations. We also exhibit examples which show that acyclicity does not hold for general coefficient rings $R$.</description>

Abstract: Linked projective spaces are quiver Grassmanians of constant dimension one of certain quiver representations, called linked nets, over special class of quivers, called $\mathbb{Z}^n$-quivers. They were recently introduced as a tool for describing schematic limits of families of divisors. They are subschemes of products of projective spaces of the same dimension. It is an open question whether they are degenerations of the (small) diagonal. We show that they have the Chow class of the diagonal.</description>

Abstract: Gijswijt's sequence consists almost entirely of small positive integers. However, it is known that every positive integer eventually appears in the sequence. In this paper we determine its growth rate. Specifically, we prove that for $n=4,5,6,\dots$, the number $n$ occurs for the first time at position $2\uparrow (2\uparrow(3\uparrow(4\uparrow(5\uparrow\cdots\uparrow((n-2)\uparrow \alpha)))))$, where $\uparrow$ denotes exponentiation, and $\alpha\in(n-2,n-1)$ is a real number. Our result confirms the growth rate conjectured by van de Bult et al.</description>

This disproves a conjecture that all well-quasi-ordered permutation classes have algebraic generating functions, and in fact shows that many such classes lack D-finite or D-algebraic generating functions. Our construction is based on an uncountably large collection of factor-closed, well-quasi-ordered binary languages due to Pouzet.</description>

      <title>Isolation of regular graphs, stars and $k$-chromatic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.13709v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a set $\mathcal{F}$ of graphs, we call a copy of a graph in $\mathcal{F}$ an $\mathcal{F}$-graph. The $\mathcal{F}$-isolation number of a graph $G$, denoted by $\iota(G,\mathcal{F})$, is the size of a smallest set $D$ of vertices of $G$ such that the closed neighbourhood of $D$ intersects the vertex sets of the $\mathcal{F}$-graphs contained by $G$ (equivalently, $G - N[D]$ contains no $\mathcal{F}$-graph). Thus, $\iota(G,\{K_1\})$ is the domination number of $G$. Clearly, $\iota(G, \mathcal{F}) \leq \iota(G, \mathcal{F} \cup \mathcal{H})$. For any integer $k \geq 1$, let $\mathcal{F}_{0,k}$ be the set consisting of the $k$-star $K_{1,k}$, let $\mathcal{F}_{1,k}$ be the set of regular graphs whose degree is at least $k-1$, let $\mathcal{F}_{2,k}$ be the set of graphs whose chromatic number is at least $k$, and let $\mathcal{F}_{3,k}$ be the union $\mathcal{F}_{0,k} \cup \mathcal{F}_{1,k} \cup \mathcal{F}_{2,k}$. We prove that if $G$ is a connected $n$-vertex graph, then $\iota(G, \mathcal{F}_{3,k}) \leq \frac{n}{k+1}$ unless $G$ is a $k$-clique or $k = 2$ and $G$ is a $5$-cycle. This generalizes a classical bound of Ore on the domination number, a bound of Caro and Hansberg and of \.{Z}yli\'{n}ski on the vertex-edge domination number, a bound of Fenech, Kaemawichanurat and the author on the $k$-clique isolation number, a bound of the author on the cycle isolation number, and a bound of Caro and Hansberg on the $\mathcal{F}_{0,k}$-isolation number. The proof features a new strategy. For $i = 1, 2, 3$, the bound $\frac{n}{k+1}$ on $\iota(G, \mathcal{F}_{i,k})$ is attainable if $k+1$ divides $n$. Our second main result is that the bound $\frac{n}{k+1}$ on $\iota(G, \mathcal{F}_{0,k})$ is attainable if and only if $n$ is $0$ or $k+1$ or $2(k+1)$. We pose some problems and conjectures, and establish additional intriguing phenomena concerning $k$-star isolation and $k$-cycle isolation.</description>

Abstract: A vertex coloring of a graph $G$ is called a 2-distance coloring if any two vertices at a distance at most $2$ from each other receive different colors. Suppose that $G$ is a planar graph with girth $5$ and maximum degree $\Delta$. We prove that $G$ admits a $2$-distance $\Delta+7$ coloring, which improves the result of Dong and Lin (J. Comb. Optim. 32(2), 645-655, 2016). Moreover, we prove that $G$ admits a $2$-distance $\Delta+6$ coloring when $\Delta\geq 10$.</description>

      <title>Proof of a conjecture on isolation of graphs dominated by a vertex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18126v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A copy of a graph $F$ is called an $F$-copy. For any graph $G$, the $F$-isolation number of $G$, denoted by $\iota(G,F)$, is the size of a smallest subset $D$ of the vertex set of $G$ such that the closed neighbourhood $N[D]$ of $D$ in $G$ intersects the vertex sets of the $F$-copies contained by $G$ (equivalently, $G-N[D]$ contains no $F$-copy). Thus, $\iota(G,K_1)$ is the domination number $\gamma(G)$ of $G$, and $\iota(G,K_2)$ is the vertex-edge domination number of $G$. We prove that if $F$ is a $k$-edge graph, $\gamma(F) = 1$ (that is, $F$ has a vertex that is adjacent to all the other vertices of $F$), and $G$ is a connected $m$-edge graph, then $\iota(G,F) \leq \big\lfloor \frac{m+1}{k+2} \big\rfloor$ unless $G$ is an $F$-copy or $F$ is a $3$-path and $G$ is a $6$-cycle. This was recently posed as a conjecture by Zhang and Wu, who settled the extreme case where $F$ is a star. The result for the other extreme case where $F$ is a clique had been obtained by Fenech, Kaemawichanurat and the present author. The bound is attainable for any $m \geq 0$ unless $1 \leq m = k \leq 2$. New ideas, including deletion methods and divisibility considerations, are introduced in the proof of the conjecture.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial interpretation of the Schlesinger-Zudilin stuffle product</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive an explicit formula for the quasi--shuffle product satisfied by Schlesinger--Zudilin Multiple~$q$-Zeta Values, expressed in terms of partition data. To achieve this, we interpret Schlesinger--Zudilin Multiple~$q$-Zeta Values as generating series of distinguished marked partitions, which are partitions whose Young diagrams have certain rows and columns marked. Together with the description of duality using marked partitions in~\cite{Br2}, and Bachmanns conjecture~(\cite{BaTalk}) that all linear relations among Multiple~$q$-Zeta Values are implied by duality and the stuffle product, this paper completes the description of the conjectural structure of Multiple~$q$-Zeta Values using marked partitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we characterise graphs that are quasi-isometric to graphs with bounded treewidth. Specifically, we prove that a graph is quasi-isometric to a graph with bounded treewidth if and only if it has a tree-decomposition where each bag consists of a bounded number of balls of bounded diameter. This result extends a characterisation by Berger and Seymour (2024) of graphs that are quasi-isometric to trees. Additionally, we characterise graphs that are quasi-isometric to graphs with bounded pathwidth and graphs that are quasi-isometric to graphs with bounded linewidth. As an application of these results, we show that graphs with bounded rank-width, graphs with bounded tree independence number, and graphs with bounded sim-width are quasi-isometric to graphs with bounded treewidth.</description>

      <title>On restricted sumsets with bounded degree relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given two subsets $A, B \subseteq \mathbb{F}_p$ and a binary relation $\mathcal{R} \subseteq A \times B$, the restricted sumset of $A, B$ with respect to $\mathcal{R}$ is defined as $A +_{\mathcal{R}} B = \{ a+b \colon (a,b) \notin \mathcal{R} \}$. When $\mathcal{R}$ is taken as the equality relation, determining the minimum value of $|A +_{\mathcal{R}} B|$ is the famous Erd\H{o}s--Heilbronn problem, which was solved separately by Dias da Silva, Hamidoune and Alon, Nathanson and Ruzsa. Lev later conjectured that if $A, B \subseteq \mathbb{F}_p$ with $|A| + |B| \le p$ and $\mathcal{R}$ is a matching between subsets of $A$ and $B$, then $|A +_{\mathcal{R}} B| \ge |A| + |B| - 3$.
  We confirm this conjecture in the case where $|A| + |B| \le (1-\varepsilon)p$ for any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, provided that $p &gt; p_0$ for some sufficiently large $p_0$ depending only on $\varepsilon$. Our proof builds on a recent work by Bollob\'as, Leader, and Tiba, and a rectifiability argument developed by Green and Ruzsa. Furthermore, our method extends to cases when $\mathcal{R}$ is a degree-bounded relation, either on both sides $A$ and $B$ or solely on the smaller set.
  In addition, we construct subsets $A \subseteq \mathbb{F}_p$ with $|A| = \frac{6p}{11} - O(1)$ such that $|A +_{\mathcal{R}} A| = p-3$ for any prime number $p$, where $\mathcal{R}$ is a matching on $A$. This extends an earlier construction by Lev and highlights a distinction between the combinatorial notion of the restricted sumset and the classcial Erd\H{o}s--Heilbronn problem, where $|A +_{\mathcal{R}} A| \ge p$ holds given $\mathcal{R} = \{(a,a) \colon a \in A\}$ is the equality relation on $A$ and $|A| \ge \frac{p+3}{2}$.</description>

      <title>Path Eccentricity and Forbidden Induced Subgraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The path eccentricity of a connected graph $G$ is the minimum integer $k$ such that $G$ has a path such that every vertex is at distance at most $k$ from the path. A result of Duffus, Jacobson, and Gould from 1981 states that every connected $\{\text{claw}, \text{net}\}$-free graph $G$ has a Hamiltonian path, that is, $G$ has path eccentricity $0$. Several more recent works identified various classes of connected graphs with path eccentricity at most $1$, or, equivalently, graphs having a spanning caterpillar, including connected $P_5$-free graphs, AT-free graphs, and biconvex graphs. Generalizing all these results, we apply the work on structural distance domination of Bacs\'o and Tuza [Discrete Math., 2012] and characterize, for every positive integer $k$, graphs such that every connected induced subgraph has path eccentricity less than $k$. More specifically, we show that every connected $\{S_{k}, T_{k}\}$-free graph has a path eccentricity less than $k$, where $S_k$ and $T_k$ are two specific graphs of path eccentricity $k$ (a subdivided claw and the line graph of such a graph). As a consequence, every connected $H$-free graph has path eccentricity less than $k$ if and only if $H$ is an induced subgraph of $3P_{k}$ or $P_{2k+1} + P_{k-1}$. For such cases, we also provide a robust polynomial-time algorithm that finds a path witnessing the upper bound on the path eccentricity. Our main result also answers an open question of Bastide, Hilaire, and Robinson [Discrete Math., 2025].</description>

Abstract: A graph $G$ is called $k$-factor-critical if $G-S$ has a perfect matching for every $S\subseteq G$ with $|S|=k$. A connected graph $G$ is called $t$-connected if it has more than $t$ vertices and remains connected whenever fewer than $t$ vertices are removed. We give a condition on the number of edges and a condition on the spectral radius for $k$-factor-criticality in $t$-connected graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is $H$-induced-saturated if $G$ is $H$-free but deleting any edge or adding any edge creates an induced copy of $H$. There are non-trivial graphs $H$, such as $P_4$, for which no finite $H$-induced-saturated graph $G$ exists. We show that for every finite graph $H$ that is not a clique or an independent set, there always exists a countable $H$-induced-saturated graph. In fact, we show that a far stronger property can be achieved: there is a countably infinite $H$-free graph $G$ such that any graph $G'\ne G$ obtained by making a locally finite set of changes to $G$ contains a copy of $H$.</description>

      <title>From dual canonical bases to positroidal subdivisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Grassmannian cluster algebra $\mathbb{C}[\text{Gr}(k, n)]$ admits a distinguished basis known as the dual canonical basis, whose elements correspond to rectangular semi-standard Young tableaux with $k$ rows and with entries in $[n]$. We establish that each such tableau induces a positroidal subdivision of the hypersimplex $\Delta(k,n)$ via a map introduced by Speyer and Williams. For $\text{Gr}(2,n)$, we prove that non-frozen prime tableaux correspond precisely to the coarsest positroidal subdivisions of $\Delta(2,n)$. Furthermore, we present computational evidence extending these results to $k&gt;2$. In the process, we formulate a conjectural formula for the number of split positroidal subdivisions of $\Delta(k,n)$ for any $k \ge 2$ and explore the deep connections between the polyhedral combinatorics of $\Delta(k,n)$ and the dual canonical basis of $\mathbb{C}[\text{Gr}(k, n)]$.</description>

      <title>On 3-terminal positions in Hex</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is about 3-terminal regions in Hex. A 3-terminal region is a region of the Hex board that is completely surrounded by black and white stones, in such a way that the black boundary stones form 3 connected components. We characterize Hex as the universal planar Shannon game of degree 3. This ensures that every Hex position can be decomposed into 3-terminal regions. We then investigate the combinatorial game theory of 3-terminal regions. We show that there are infinitely many distinct Hex-realizable values for such regions. We introduce an infinite family of 3-terminal positions called superswitches and investigate their properties. We also present a database of Hex-realizable 3-terminal values, and illustrate its utility as a problem-solving tool by giving various applications. The applications include the automated verification of connects-both templates and pivoting templates, a new handicap strategy for $11\times 11$ Hex, and a method for constructing witnesses for the non-inferiority of probes in many Hex templates. These methods allow us to disprove a conjecture by Henderson and Hayward.</description>

      <title>The $d$-distance $p$-packing domination number: complexity, cycles, and trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A set of vertices $X\subseteq V(G)$ is a $d$-distance dominating set if for every $u\in V(G)\setminus X$ there exists $x\in X$ such that $d(u,x) \le d$, and $X$ is a $p$-packing if $d(u,v) \ge p+1$ for every different $u,v\in X$. The $d$-distance $p$-packing domination number $\gamma_d^p(G)$ of $G$ is the minimum size of a set of vertices of $G$ which is both a $d$-distance dominating set and a $p$-packing. It is proved that for every two fixed integers $d$ and $p$ with $2 \le d$ and $0 \le p \leq 2d-1$, the decision problem whether $\gamma_d^p(G) \leq k$ holds is NP-complete for bipartite planar graphs. A necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a $d$-distance $p$-packing dominating set in $C_n$ is obtained and $\gamma_d^p(C_n)$ determined for every $d$, $p$, and $n$. For a tree $T$ on $n$ vertices with $\ell$ leaves and $s$ support vertices it is proved that (i) $\gamma_2^0(T) \geq \frac{n-\ell-s+4}{5}$, (ii) $\left \lceil \frac{n-\ell-s+4}{5} \right \rceil \leq \gamma_2^2(T) \leq \left \lfloor \frac{n+3s-1}{5} \right \rfloor$, and if $d \geq 2$, then (iii) $\gamma_d^2(T) \leq \frac{n-2\sqrt{n}+d+1}{d}$. Inequality (i) improves an earlier bound due to Meierling and Volkmann, and independently Raczek, Lema\'nska, and Cyman, while (iii) extends an earlier result for $\gamma_2^2(T)$ due to Henning. Sharpness of the bounds are discussed and established in most cases. It is also proved that every connected graph $G$ contains a spanning tree $T$ such that $\gamma_2^2(T) \leq \gamma_2^2(G)$.</description>

      <title>The spectra of graph substitutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(X,E_X)$ and $(V,E_V)$ be finite connected graphs without loops. We assume that $V$ has two distinguished vertices $a,b$ and an automorphism $\gamma$ which exchanges $a$ and~$b$. The $V$-edge substitution of $X$ is the graph $X[V]$ where each edge $[x,y] \in E_X$ is replaced by a copy of $V$, identifying $x$ with $a$ and $y$ with $b$ or vice versa. (The latter choice does not matter; it yields isomorphic graphs.) The aim is to describe the spectrum of $X[V]$ in terms of the spectra of $X$ and $V$. Instead of the spectra of the adjacency matrices, we consider the versions which are normalised by dividing each row by the row sum (the vertex degree). These are stochastic, reversible matrices, and our approach applies more generally to reversible transition matrices corresponding to arbitrary positive edge weights invariant under $\gamma$. We write $P$ for the transition matrix over $X$ and $Q$ for the one over $V$. Together, they induce the matrix $P_*$ over $X[V]$.
  The main part of the spectrum of $P_*$ is the response of the natural frequencies of $X$ to substituting $V$, given by a functional equation coming from a rational function induced by~$Q$. A second part comes from specific eigenvalues of $Q$, if present. Finally, there is the part of $\mathsf{spec}(P_*)$ whose eigenfunctions have $X$ as a nodal set. The results depend on issues like whether $X$ has circles of even length and on the eigenvalues of the restriction of $Q$ to $V \setminus \{ a,b\}$, which are classified into 4 possible types. Quite subtle is the issue of determining the multiplicities of the latter as eigenvalues of $P_*$ in terms of the input.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that every supersymmetric Schur polynomial has a saturated Newton polytope (SNP). Our approach begins with a tableau-theoretic description of the support, which we encode as a polyhedron with a totally unimodular constraint matrix. The integrality of this polyhedron follows from the Hoffman-Kruskal criterion, thereby establishing the SNP property.</description>

      <title>Counting Graph Homomorphisms in Bipartite Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of counting homomorphisms from a bipartite source graph to a bipartite target graph. An exact formula is first derived for the number of homomorphisms from a complete bipartite graph into a general bipartite graph. While exact, this formula is typically computationally intensive to evaluate. To address this, computable combinatorial lower bounds are established. When the target graph contains no 4-cycles, the lower bound simplifies and becomes exact. Two additional lower bounds on the number of homomorphisms from a complete bipartite graph to an arbitrary bipartite graph are derived using properties of Shannon entropy. The first depends only on the sizes of the partite sets in the source and target graphs, along with the edge density of the target graph. The second further incorporates the degree profiles within the target's partite sets, yielding a strengthening of the first. Both entropy-based bounds improve upon the inequality implied by the validity of Sidorenko's conjecture for complete bipartite graphs. Lower bounds for complete bipartite sources are combined with new auxiliary results to derive general lower bounds on homomorphism counts between arbitrary bipartite graphs, while a known reverse Sidorenko inequality is employed to establish corresponding upper bounds. The upper bound is attained when the source is a disjoint union of complete bipartite graphs, and it admits a simple closed-form expression when the target contains no 4-cycles. Numerical results compare the proposed easy-to-compute bounds with exact counts in computationally tractable cases.</description>

Abstract: We prove that graphs that do not contain a totally odd immersion of $K_t$ are $\mathcal{O}(t)$-colorable. In particular, we show that any graph with no totally odd immersion of $K_t$ is the union of a bipartite graph and a graph which forbids an immersion of $K_{\mathcal{O}(t)}$. Our results are algorithmic, and we give a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm (in $t$) to find such a decomposition.</description>

      <title>Infinite matroids in tropical differential algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.04784v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a finite-dimensional vector space $W\subset K^E$ over an arbitrary field $K$ and an arbitrary set $E$. We show that the set $C(W)\subset 2^E$ consisting of the minimal supports of $W$ are the circuits of a matroid on $E$. In particular, we show that this matroid is cofinitary (hence, tame). When the cardinality of $K$ is large enough (with respect to the cardinality of $E$), then the set $trop(W)\subset 2^E$ consisting of all the supports of $W$ is a matroid itself.
  Afterwards we apply these results to tropical differential algebraic geometry and study the set of supports $trop(Sol(\Sigma))\subset (2^{\mathbb{N}^{m}})^n$ of spaces of formal power series solutions $\text{Sol}(\Sigma)$ of systems of linear differential equations $\Sigma$ in differential variables $x_1,\ldots,x_n$ having coefficients in the ring ${K}[\![t_1,\ldots,t_m]\!]$. If $\Sigma$ is of differential type zero, then the set $C(Sol(\Sigma))\subset (2^{\mathbb{N}^{m}})^n$ of minimal supports defines a matroid on $E=[n]\times\mathbb{N}^{m}$, and if the cardinality of $K$ is large enough, then the set of supports $\phi \circ trop(Sol(\Sigma))$ itself is a matroid on $E$ as well. By applying the fundamental theorem of tropical differential algebraic geometry (fttdag), we give a necessary condition under which the set of solutions $Sol(U)$ of a system $U$ of tropical linear differential equations to be a matroid.
  We also give a counterexample to the fttdag for systems $\Sigma$ of linear differential equations over countable fields. In this case, the set $\phi \circ trop(Sol(\Sigma))$ may not form a matroid.</description>

      <title>The $m$-th Element of a Sidon Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01986v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that if $A=\{a_1,\dots ,a_{|A|}\}\subset \{1,2,\dots ,n\}$ is a Sidon set so that $|A|=n^{1/2}-L^\prime$, then $$a_m = m\cdot n^{1/2} + \mathcal O\left( n^{7/8}\right) + \mathcal O\left(L^{1/2}\cdot n^{3/4}\right)$$ where $L=\max\{0,L^\prime\}$. As an application of this, we give easy proofs of some previously derived results. We proceed on to proving that for a dense Sidon set $S$ and for any $\varepsilon &gt;0$, we have $$\sum_{a\in S} a = \frac 12 n^{3/2} + \mathcal O \left (n^{11/8} \right )$$ for all $n\le N$ but at most $\mathcal O_{\varepsilon} \left (N^{\frac 45 + \varepsilon} \right )$ exceptions.</description>

      <title>Surface sums for lattice Yang-Mills in the large-$N$ limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a sum over weighted planar surfaces formula for Wilson loop expectations in the large-$N$ limit of strongly coupled lattice Yang-Mills theory, in any dimension. The weights of each surface are simple and expressed in terms of products of signed Catalan numbers.
  In establishing our results, the main novelty is to convert a recursive relation for Wilson loop expectations, known as the master loop equation, into a new peeling exploration of the planar surfaces. This exploration reveals hidden cancellations within the sums, enabling a deeper understanding of the structure of the planar surfaces.
  We view our results as a continuation of the program initiated in [CPS23] to understand Yang-Mills theories via surfaces and as a refinement of the string trajectories point-of-view developed in [Cha19a].</description>

      <title>On the Sylvester program and Cayley algorithm for vector partition reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18789v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A vector partition problem asks for a number of nonnegative integer solutions to a system of several linear Diophantine equations with integer nonnegative coefficients. J.J. Sylvester put forward an idea of reduction of vector partition to a sum of scalar partitions. In the simplest case of two equations with positive coefficients A. Cayley performed a reduction of the corresponding double partition to a sum of scalar partitions using an algorithm subject to a set of conditions on the coefficients. We suggested a modification of the original Cayley algorithm for the cases when these conditions are not satisfied. This result is extended to arbitrary number of the Diophantine equations to accomplish the Sylvester program of the vector partition reduction to a combination of scalar partitions.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of Markov property on planar maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit, in a self contained way, the Markov property on planar maps and decorated planar maps from three perspectives. First, we characterize the laws on these planar maps that satisfy both the Markov property and rerooting invariance, showing that they are Boltzmann-type maps. Second, we provide a comprehensive characterization of random submaps, that we call stopping maps, satisfying the Markov property, demonstrating that they are not restricted to those obtained through a peeling procedure. Third, we introduce decorated metric planar maps in which edges are replaced by copies of random length intervals $[0,w_e]$, and the decorations are given by continuous functions on the edges. We define a probability measure on them that is the analogue of the Boltzmann map and show that it satisfies the Markov property even for sets that halt exploration mid-edge.</description>

      <title>Amplitude maximization in stable systems, Schur positivity, and some conjectures on polynomial interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13554v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For $r &gt; 0$ and integers $t \ge n &gt; 0$, we consider the following problem: maximize the amplitude $|x_t|$ at time $t$, over all complex solutions $x = (x_0, x_1, \dots)$ of arbitrary homogeneous linear difference equations of order $n$ with the characteristic roots in the disc $\{z \in \mathbb{C}: |z| \le r\}$, and with initial values $x_0, \dots, x_{n-1}$ in the unit disc. We find that for any triple $t,n,r$, the maximum is attained with coinciding roots on the boundary circle; in particular, this implies that the peak amplitude $\sup_{t \ge n} |x_t|$ can be maximized explicitly, by studying a unique equation with the characteristic polynomial $(z-r)^n$. Moreover, the optimality of the cophase root configuration holds for origin-centered polydiscs. To prove this result, we first reduce the problem to a certain interpolation problem over monomials, then solve the latter by leveraging the theory of symmetric functions and identifying the associated Schur positivity structure. We also discuss the implications for more general Reinhardt domains. Finally, we study the problem of estimating the derivatives of a real entire function from its values at $n/2$ pairs of complex conjugate points in the unit disc. We propose conjectures on the extremality of the monomial $z^n$, and restate them in terms of Schur polynomials.</description>
