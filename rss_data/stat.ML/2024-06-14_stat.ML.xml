      <title>Large Stepsize Gradient Descent for Non-Homogeneous Two-Layer Networks: Margin Improvement and Fast Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The typical training of neural networks using large stepsize gradient descent (GD) under the logistic loss often involves two distinct phases, where the empirical risk oscillates in the first phase but decreases monotonically in the second phase. We investigate this phenomenon in two-layer networks that satisfy a near-homogeneity condition. We show that the second phase begins once the empirical risk falls below a certain threshold, dependent on the stepsize. Additionally, we show that the normalized margin grows nearly monotonically in the second phase, demonstrating an implicit bias of GD in training non-homogeneous predictors. If the dataset is linearly separable and the derivative of the activation function is bounded away from zero, we show that the average empirical risk decreases, implying that the first phase must stop in finite steps. Finally, we demonstrate that by choosing a suitably large stepsize, GD that undergoes this phase transition is more efficient than GD that monotonically decreases the risk. Our analysis applies to networks of any width, beyond the well-known neural tangent kernel and mean-field regimes.</description>

      <title>Pruning is Optimal for Learning Sparse Features in High-Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While it is commonly observed in practice that pruning networks to a certain level of sparsity can improve the quality of the features, a theoretical explanation of this phenomenon remains elusive. In this work, we investigate this by demonstrating that a broad class of statistical models can be optimally learned using pruned neural networks trained with gradient descent, in high-dimensions.
  We consider learning both single-index and multi-index models of the form $y = \sigma^*(\boldsymbol{V}^{\top} \boldsymbol{x}) + \epsilon$, where $\sigma^*$ is a degree-$p$ polynomial, and $\boldsymbol{V} \in \mathbbm{R}^{d \times r}$ with $r \ll d$, is the matrix containing relevant model directions. We assume that $\boldsymbol{V}$ satisfies a certain $\ell_q$-sparsity condition for matrices and show that pruning neural networks proportional to the sparsity level of $\boldsymbol{V}$ improves their sample complexity compared to unpruned networks. Furthermore, we establish Correlational Statistical Query (CSQ) lower bounds in this setting, which take the sparsity level of $\boldsymbol{V}$ into account. We show that if the sparsity level of $\boldsymbol{V}$ exceeds a certain threshold, training pruned networks with a gradient descent algorithm achieves the sample complexity suggested by the CSQ lower bound. In the same scenario, however, our results imply that basis-independent methods such as models trained via standard gradient descent initialized with rotationally invariant random weights can provably achieve only suboptimal sample complexity.</description>

      <title>Orthogonalized Estimation of Difference of $Q$-functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning is important in many settings with available observational data but the inability to deploy new policies online due to safety, cost, and other concerns. Many recent advances in causal inference and machine learning target estimation of causal contrast functions such as CATE, which is sufficient for optimizing decisions and can adapt to potentially smoother structure. We develop a dynamic generalization of the R-learner (Nie and Wager 2021, Lewis and Syrgkanis 2021) for estimating and optimizing the difference of $Q^\pi$-functions, $Q^\pi(s,1)-Q^\pi(s,0)$ (which can be used to optimize multiple-valued actions). We leverage orthogonal estimation to improve convergence rates in the presence of slower nuisance estimation rates and prove consistency of policy optimization under a margin condition. The method can leverage black-box nuisance estimators of the $Q$-function and behavior policy to target estimation of a more structured $Q$-function contrast.</description>

      <title>Assessment of Uncertainty Quantification in Universal Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific Machine Learning is a new class of approaches that integrate physical knowledge and mechanistic models with data-driven techniques for uncovering governing equations of complex processes. Among the available approaches, Universal Differential Equations (UDEs) are used to combine prior knowledge in the form of mechanistic formulations with universal function approximators, like neural networks. Integral to the efficacy of UDEs is the joint estimation of parameters within mechanistic formulations and the universal function approximators using empirical data. The robustness and applicability of resultant models, however, hinge upon the rigorous quantification of uncertainties associated with these parameters, as well as the predictive capabilities of the overall model or its constituent components. With this work, we provide a formalisation of uncertainty quantification (UQ) for UDEs and investigate important frequentist and Bayesian methods. By analysing three synthetic examples of varying complexity, we evaluate the validity and efficiency of ensembles, variational inference and Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling as epistemic UQ methods for UDEs.</description>

      <title>Central Limit Theorem for Bayesian Neural Network trained with Variational Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we rigorously derive Central Limit Theorems (CLT) for Bayesian two-layerneural networks in the infinite-width limit and trained by variational inference on a regression task. The different networks are trained via different maximization schemes of the regularized evidence lower bound: (i) the idealized case with exact estimation of a multiple Gaussian integral from the reparametrization trick, (ii) a minibatch scheme using Monte Carlo sampling, commonly known as Bayes-by-Backprop, and (iii) a computationally cheaper algorithm named Minimal VI. The latter was recently introduced by leveraging the information obtained at the level of the mean-field limit. Laws of large numbers are already rigorously proven for the three schemes that admits the same asymptotic limit. By deriving CLT, this work shows that the idealized and Bayes-by-Backprop schemes have similar fluctuation behavior, that is different from the Minimal VI one. Numerical experiments then illustrate that the Minimal VI scheme is still more efficient, in spite of bigger variances, thanks to its important gain in computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Structural Model Updating with Multimodal Variational Autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for Bayesian structural model updating and proposes a method that utilizes the surrogate unimodal encoders of a multimodal variational autoencoder. This method facilitates an efficient nonparametric estimation of the likelihood describing the observed data. It is particularly suitable for high-dimensional correlated simultaneous observations applicable to various dynamic analysis models. The proposed approach is benchmarked using a numerical model of a single-story frame building with acceleration and dynamic strain measurements.</description>

      <title>Operator-informed score matching for Markov diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models are typically trained using score matching, yet score matching is agnostic to the particular forward process that defines the model. This paper argues that Markov diffusion models enjoy an advantage over other types of diffusion model, as their associated operators can be exploited to improve the training process. In particular, (i) there exists an explicit formal solution to the forward process as a sequence of time-dependent kernel mean embeddings; and (ii) the derivation of score-matching and related estimators can be streamlined. Building upon (i), we propose Riemannian diffusion kernel smoothing, which ameliorates the need for neural score approximation, at least in the low-dimensional context; Building upon (ii), we propose operator-informed score matching, a variance reduction technique that is straightforward to implement in both low- and high-dimensional diffusion modeling and is demonstrated to improve score matching in an empirical proof-of-concept.</description>

      <title>Generative vs. Discriminative modeling under the lens of uncertainty quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning a parametric model from a given dataset indeed enables to capture intrinsic dependencies between random variables via a parametric conditional probability distribution and in turn predict the value of a label variable given observed variables. In this paper, we undertake a comparative analysis of generative and discriminative approaches which differ in their construction and the structure of the underlying inference problem. Our objective is to compare the ability of both approaches to leverage information from various sources in an epistemic uncertainty aware inference via the posterior predictive distribution. We assess the role of a prior distribution, explicit in the generative case and implicit in the discriminative case, leading to a discussion about discriminative models suffering from imbalanced dataset. We next examine the double role played by the observed variables in the generative case, and discuss the compatibility of both approaches with semi-supervised learning. We also provide with practical insights and we examine how the modeling choice impacts the sampling from the posterior predictive distribution. With regard to this, we propose a general sampling scheme enabling supervised learning for both approaches, as well as semi-supervised learning when compatible with the considered modeling approach. Throughout this paper, we illustrate our arguments and conclusions using the example of affine regression, and validate our comparative analysis through classification simulations using neural network based models.</description>

      <title>Scalable and Flexible Causal Discovery with an Efficient Test for Adjacency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To make accurate predictions, understand mechanisms, and design interventions in systems of many variables, we wish to learn causal graphs from large scale data. Unfortunately the space of all possible causal graphs is enormous so scalably and accurately searching for the best fit to the data is a challenge. In principle we could substantially decrease the search space, or learn the graph entirely, by testing the conditional independence of variables. However, deciding if two variables are adjacent in a causal graph may require an exponential number of tests. Here we build a scalable and flexible method to evaluate if two variables are adjacent in a causal graph, the Differentiable Adjacency Test (DAT). DAT replaces an exponential number of tests with a provably equivalent relaxed problem. It then solves this problem by training two neural networks. We build a graph learning method based on DAT, DAT-Graph, that can also learn from data with interventions. DAT-Graph can learn graphs of 1000 variables with state of the art accuracy. Using the graph learned by DAT-Graph, we also build models that make much more accurate predictions of the effects of interventions on large scale RNA sequencing data.</description>

      <title>Ridge interpolators in correlated factor regression models -- exact risk analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider correlated \emph{factor} regression models (FRM) and analyze the performance of classical ridge interpolators. Utilizing powerful \emph{Random Duality Theory} (RDT) mathematical engine, we obtain \emph{precise} closed form characterizations of the underlying optimization problems and all associated optimizing quantities. In particular, we provide \emph{excess prediction risk} characterizations that clearly show the dependence on all key model parameters, covariance matrices, loadings, and dimensions. As a function of the over-parametrization ratio, the generalized least squares (GLS) risk also exhibits the well known \emph{double-descent} (non-monotonic) behavior. Similarly to the classical linear regression models (LRM), we demonstrate that such FRM phenomenon can be smoothened out by the optimally tuned ridge regularization. The theoretical results are supplemented by numerical simulations and an excellent agrement between the two is observed. Moreover, we note that ``ridge smootenhing'' is often of limited effect already for over-parametrization ratios above $5$ and of virtually no effect for those above $10$. This solidifies the notion that one of the recently most popular neural networks paradigms -- \emph{zero-training (interpolating) generalizes well} -- enjoys wider applicability, including the one within the FRM estimation/prediction context.</description>

      <title>Bengining overfitting in Fixed Dimension via Physics-Informed Learning with Smooth Iductive Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning theory showed that interpolation to noisy samples using over-parameterized machine learning algorithms always leads to inconsistency. However, this work surprisingly discovers that interpolated machine learning can exhibit benign overfitting and consistency when using physics-informed learning for supervised tasks governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) describing laws of physics. An analysis provides an asymptotic Sobolev norm learning curve for kernel ridge(less) regression addressing linear inverse problems involving elliptic PDEs. The results reveal that the PDE operators can stabilize variance and lead to benign overfitting for fixed-dimensional problems, contrasting standard regression settings. The impact of various inductive biases introduced by minimizing different Sobolev norms as implicit regularization is also examined. Notably, the convergence rate is independent of the specific (smooth) inductive bias for both ridge and ridgeless regression. For regularized least squares estimators, all (smooth enough) inductive biases can achieve optimal convergence rates when the regularization parameter is properly chosen. The smoothness requirement recovers a condition previously found in the Bayesian setting and extends conclusions to minimum norm interpolation estimators.</description>

      <title>Precise analysis of ridge interpolators under heavy correlations -- a Random Duality Theory view</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider fully row/column-correlated linear regression models and study several classical estimators (including minimum norm interpolators (GLS), ordinary least squares (LS), and ridge regressors). We show that \emph{Random Duality Theory} (RDT) can be utilized to obtain precise closed form characterizations of all estimators related optimizing quantities of interest, including the \emph{prediction risk} (testing or generalization error). On a qualitative level out results recover the risk's well known non-monotonic (so-called double-descent) behavior as the number of features/sample size ratio increases. On a quantitative level, our closed form results show how the risk explicitly depends on all key model parameters, including the problem dimensions and covariance matrices. Moreover, a special case of our results, obtained when intra-sample (or time-series) correlations are not present, precisely match the corresponding ones obtained via spectral methods in [6,16,17,24].</description>

      <title>Deep Sketched Output Kernel Regression for Structured Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By leveraging the kernel trick in the output space, kernel-induced losses provide a principled way to define structured output prediction tasks for a wide variety of output modalities. In particular, they have been successfully used in the context of surrogate non-parametric regression, where the kernel trick is typically exploited in the input space as well. However, when inputs are images or texts, more expressive models such as deep neural networks seem more suited than non-parametric methods. In this work, we tackle the question of how to train neural networks to solve structured output prediction tasks, while still benefiting from the versatility and relevance of kernel-induced losses. We design a novel family of deep neural architectures, whose last layer predicts in a data-dependent finite-dimensional subspace of the infinite-dimensional output feature space deriving from the kernel-induced loss. This subspace is chosen as the span of the eigenfunctions of a randomly-approximated version of the empirical kernel covariance operator. Interestingly, this approach unlocks the use of gradient descent algorithms (and consequently of any neural architecture) for structured prediction. Experiments on synthetic tasks as well as real-world supervised graph prediction problems show the relevance of our method.</description>

      <title>Learning conditional distributions on continuous spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate sample-based learning of conditional distributions on multi-dimensional unit boxes, allowing for different dimensions of the feature and target spaces. Our approach involves clustering data near varying query points in the feature space to create empirical measures in the target space. We employ two distinct clustering schemes: one based on a fixed-radius ball and the other on nearest neighbors. We establish upper bounds for the convergence rates of both methods and, from these bounds, deduce optimal configurations for the radius and the number of neighbors. We propose to incorporate the nearest neighbors method into neural network training, as our empirical analysis indicates it has better performance in practice. For efficiency, our training process utilizes approximate nearest neighbors search with random binary space partitioning. Additionally, we employ the Sinkhorn algorithm and a sparsity-enforced transport plan. Our empirical findings demonstrate that, with a suitably designed structure, the neural network has the ability to adapt to a suitable level of Lipschitz continuity locally. For reproducibility, our code is available at \url{https://github.com/zcheng-a/LCD_kNN}.</description>

      <title>Oblivious subspace embeddings for compressed Tucker decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emphasis in the tensor literature on random embeddings (tools for low-distortion dimension reduction) for the canonical polyadic (CP) tensor decomposition has left analogous results for the more expressive Tucker decomposition comparatively lacking. This work establishes general Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) type guarantees for the estimation of Tucker decompositions when an oblivious random embedding is applied along each mode. When these embeddings are drawn from a JL-optimal family, the decomposition can be estimated within $\varepsilon$ relative error under restrictions on the embedding dimension that are in line with recent CP results. We implement a higher-order orthogonal iteration (HOOI) decomposition algorithm with random embeddings to demonstrate the practical benefits of this approach and its potential to improve the accessibility of otherwise prohibitive tensor analyses. On moderately large face image and fMRI neuroimaging datasets, empirical results show that substantial dimension reduction is possible with minimal increase in reconstruction error relative to traditional HOOI ($\leq$5% larger error, 50%-60% lower computation time for large models with 50% dimension reduction along each mode). Especially for large tensors, our method outperforms traditional higher-order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) and recently proposed TensorSketch methods.</description>

Abstract: Differential privacy is a framework for protecting the identity of individual data points in the decision-making process. In this note, we propose a new form of differential privacy called tangent differential privacy. Compared with the usual differential privacy that is defined uniformly across data distributions, tangent differential privacy is tailored towards a specific data distribution of interest. It also allows for general distribution distances such as total variation distance and Wasserstein distance. In the case of risk minimization, we show that entropic regularization guarantees tangent differential privacy under rather general conditions on the risk function.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Anomaly Detection in Automotive Systems Using SAAD: Statistical Aggregated Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel anomaly detection methodology termed Statistical Aggregated Anomaly Detection (SAAD). The SAAD approach integrates advanced statistical techniques with machine learning, and its efficacy is demonstrated through validation on real sensor data from a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) environment within the automotive domain. The key innovation of SAAD lies in its ability to significantly enhance the accuracy and robustness of anomaly detection when combined with Fully Connected Networks (FCNs) augmented by dropout layers. Comprehensive experimental evaluations indicate that the standalone statistical method achieves an accuracy of 72.1%, whereas the deep learning model alone attains an accuracy of 71.5%. In contrast, the aggregated method achieves a superior accuracy of 88.3% and an F1 score of 0.921, thereby outperforming the individual models. These results underscore the effectiveness of SAAD, demonstrating its potential for broad application in various domains, including automotive systems.</description>

      <title>Noise-Aware Differentially Private Regression via Meta-Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many high-stakes applications require machine learning models that protect user privacy and provide well-calibrated, accurate predictions. While Differential Privacy (DP) is the gold standard for protecting user privacy, standard DP mechanisms typically significantly impair performance. One approach to mitigating this issue is pre-training models on simulated data before DP learning on the private data. In this work we go a step further, using simulated data to train a meta-learning model that combines the Convolutional Conditional Neural Process (ConvCNP) with an improved functional DP mechanism of Hall et al. [2013] yielding the DPConvCNP. DPConvCNP learns from simulated data how to map private data to a DP predictive model in one forward pass, and then provides accurate, well-calibrated predictions. We compare DPConvCNP with a DP Gaussian Process (GP) baseline with carefully tuned hyperparameters. The DPConvCNP outperforms the GP baseline, especially on non-Gaussian data, yet is much faster at test time and requires less tuning.</description>

      <title>Interventional Causal Discovery in a Mixture of DAGs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causal interactions among a group of variables are often modeled by a single causal graph. In some domains, however, these interactions are best described by multiple co-existing causal graphs, e.g., in dynamical systems or genomics. This paper addresses the hitherto unknown role of interventions in learning causal interactions among variables governed by a mixture of causal systems, each modeled by one directed acyclic graph (DAG). Causal discovery from mixtures is fundamentally more challenging than single-DAG causal discovery. Two major difficulties stem from (i) inherent uncertainty about the skeletons of the component DAGs that constitute the mixture and (ii) possibly cyclic relationships across these component DAGs. This paper addresses these challenges and aims to identify edges that exist in at least one component DAG of the mixture, referred to as true edges. First, it establishes matching necessary and sufficient conditions on the size of interventions required to identify the true edges. Next, guided by the necessity results, an adaptive algorithm is designed that learns all true edges using ${\cal O}(n^2)$ interventions, where $n$ is the number of nodes. Remarkably, the size of the interventions is optimal if the underlying mixture model does not contain cycles across its components. More generally, the gap between the intervention size used by the algorithm and the optimal size is quantified. It is shown to be bounded by the cyclic complexity number of the mixture model, defined as the size of the minimal intervention that can break the cycles in the mixture, which is upper bounded by the number of cycles among the ancestors of a node.</description>

      <title>Learning in Feature Spaces via Coupled Covariances: Asymmetric Kernel SVD and Nystr\"om method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In contrast with Mercer kernel-based approaches as used e.g., in Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA), it was previously shown that Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) inherently relates to asymmetric kernels and Asymmetric Kernel Singular Value Decomposition (KSVD) has been proposed. However, the existing formulation to KSVD cannot work with infinite-dimensional feature mappings, the variational objective can be unbounded, and needs further numerical evaluation and exploration towards machine learning. In this work, i) we introduce a new asymmetric learning paradigm based on coupled covariance eigenproblem (CCE) through covariance operators, allowing infinite-dimensional feature maps. The solution to CCE is ultimately obtained from the SVD of the induced asymmetric kernel matrix, providing links to KSVD. ii) Starting from the integral equations corresponding to a pair of coupled adjoint eigenfunctions, we formalize the asymmetric Nystr\"om method through a finite sample approximation to speed up training. iii) We provide the first empirical evaluations verifying the practical utility and benefits of KSVD and compare with methods resorting to symmetrization or linear SVD across multiple tasks.</description>

      <title>Learning Joint and Individual Structure in Network Data with Covariates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Datasets consisting of a network and covariates associated with its vertices have become ubiquitous. One problem pertaining to this type of data is to identify information unique to the network, information unique to the vertex covariates and information that is shared between the network and the vertex covariates. Existing techniques for network data and vertex covariates focus on capturing structure that is shared but are usually not able to differentiate structure that is unique to each dataset. This work formulates a low-rank model that simultaneously captures joint and individual information in network data with vertex covariates. A two-step estimation procedure is proposed, composed of an efficient spectral method followed by a refinement optimization step. Theoretically, we show that the spectral method is able to consistently recover the joint and individual components under a general signal-plus-noise model.
  Simulations and real data examples demonstrate the ability of the methods to recover accurate and interpretable components. In particular, the application of the methodology to a food trade network between countries with economic, developmental and geographical country-level indicators as covariates yields joint and individual factors that explain the trading patterns.</description>

      <title>AIM: Attributing, Interpreting, Mitigating Data Unfairness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data collected in the real world often encapsulates historical discrimination against disadvantaged groups and individuals. Existing fair machine learning (FairML) research has predominantly focused on mitigating discriminative bias in the model prediction, with far less effort dedicated towards exploring how to trace biases present in the data, despite its importance for the transparency and interpretability of FairML. To fill this gap, we investigate a novel research problem: discovering samples that reflect biases/prejudices from the training data. Grounding on the existing fairness notions, we lay out a sample bias criterion and propose practical algorithms for measuring and countering sample bias. The derived bias score provides intuitive sample-level attribution and explanation of historical bias in data. On this basis, we further design two FairML strategies via sample-bias-informed minimal data editing. They can mitigate both group and individual unfairness at the cost of minimal or zero predictive utility loss. Extensive experiments and analyses on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods in explaining and mitigating unfairness.

      <title>The Penalized Inverse Probability Measure for Conformal Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The deployment of safe and trustworthy machine learning systems, and particularly complex black box neural networks, in real-world applications requires reliable and certified guarantees on their performance. The conformal prediction framework offers such formal guarantees by transforming any point into a set predictor with valid, finite-set, guarantees on the coverage of the true at a chosen level of confidence. Central to this methodology is the notion of the nonconformity score function that assigns to each example a measure of ''strangeness'' in comparison with the previously seen observations. While the coverage guarantees are maintained regardless of the nonconformity measure, the point predictor and the dataset, previous research has shown that the performance of a conformal model, as measured by its efficiency (the average size of the predicted sets) and its informativeness (the proportion of prediction sets that are singletons), is influenced by the choice of the nonconformity score function. The current work introduces the Penalized Inverse Probability (PIP) nonconformity score, and its regularized version RePIP, that allow the joint optimization of both efficiency and informativeness. Through toy examples and empirical results on the task of crop and weed image classification in agricultural robotics, the current work shows how PIP-based conformal classifiers exhibit precisely the desired behavior in comparison with other nonconformity measures and strike a good balance between informativeness and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Calibration Point: Mechanism Comparison in Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In differentially private (DP) machine learning, the privacy guarantees of DP mechanisms are often reported and compared on the basis of a single $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-pair. This practice overlooks that DP guarantees can vary substantially \emph{even between mechanisms sharing a given $(\varepsilon, \delta)$}, and potentially introduces privacy vulnerabilities which can remain undetected. This motivates the need for robust, rigorous methods for comparing DP guarantees in such cases. Here, we introduce the $\Delta$-divergence between mechanisms which quantifies the worst-case excess privacy vulnerability of choosing one mechanism over another in terms of $(\varepsilon, \delta)$, $f$-DP and in terms of a newly presented Bayesian interpretation. Moreover, as a generalisation of the Blackwell theorem, it is endowed with strong decision-theoretic foundations. Through application examples, we show that our techniques can facilitate informed decision-making and reveal gaps in the current understanding of privacy risks, as current practices in DP-SGD often result in choosing mechanisms with high excess privacy vulnerabilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating matrices in the symmetric positive-definite (SPD) cone is of interest for many applications ranging from computer vision to graph learning. While there exist various convex optimization-based estimators, they remain limited in expressivity due to their model-based approach. The success of deep learning has thus led many to use neural networks to learn to estimate SPD matrices in a data-driven fashion. For learning structured outputs, one promising strategy involves architectures designed by unrolling iterative algorithms, which potentially benefit from inductive bias properties. However, designing correct unrolled architectures for SPD learning is difficult: they either do not guarantee that their output has all the desired properties, rely on heavy computations, or are overly restrained to specific matrices which hinders their expressivity. In this paper, we propose a novel and generic learning module with guaranteed SPD outputs called SpodNet, that also enables learning a larger class of functions than existing approaches. Notably, it solves the challenging task of learning jointly SPD and sparse matrices. Our experiments demonstrate the versatility of SpodNet layers.</description>

Abstract: For causal discovery in the presence of latent confounders, constraints beyond conditional independences exist that can enable causal discovery algorithms to distinguish more pairs of graphs. Such constraints are not well-understood yet. In the setting of linear structural equation models without bows, we study algebraic constraints and argue that these provide the most fine-grained resolution achievable. We propose efficient algorithms that decide whether two graphs impose the same algebraic constraints, or whether the constraints imposed by one graph are a subset of those imposed by another graph.</description>

Abstract: We study the robustness of global post-hoc explanations for predictive models trained on tabular data. Effects of predictor features in black-box supervised learning are an essential diagnostic tool for model debugging and scientific discovery in applied sciences. However, how vulnerable they are to data and model perturbations remains an open research question. We introduce several theoretical bounds for evaluating the robustness of partial dependence plots and accumulated local effects. Our experimental results with synthetic and real-world datasets quantify the gap between the best and worst-case scenarios of (mis)interpreting machine learning predictions globally.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Normalizing Flows (NFs) are powerful and efficient models for density estimation. When modeling densities on manifolds, NFs can be generalized to injective flows but the Jacobian determinant becomes computationally prohibitive. Current approaches either consider bounds on the log-likelihood or rely on some approximations of the Jacobian determinant. In contrast, we propose injective flows for parametric hypersurfaces and show that for such manifolds we can compute the Jacobian determinant exactly and efficiently, with the same cost as NFs. Furthermore, we show that for the subclass of star-like manifolds we can extend the proposed framework to always allow for a Cartesian representation of the density. We showcase the relevance of modeling densities on hypersurfaces in two settings. Firstly, we introduce a novel Objective Bayesian approach to penalized likelihood models by interpreting level-sets of the penalty as star-like manifolds. Secondly, we consider Bayesian mixture models and introduce a general method for variational inference by defining the posterior of mixture weights on the probability simplex.</description>

      <title>What is the long-run distribution of stochastic gradient descent? A large deviations analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the long-run distribution of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in general, non-convex problems. Specifically, we seek to understand which regions of the problem's state space are more likely to be visited by SGD, and by how much. Using an approach based on the theory of large deviations and randomly perturbed dynamical systems, we show that the long-run distribution of SGD resembles the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution of equilibrium thermodynamics with temperature equal to the method's step-size and energy levels determined by the problem's objective and the statistics of the noise. In particular, we show that, in the long run, (a) the problem's critical region is visited exponentially more often than any non-critical region; (b) the iterates of SGD are exponentially concentrated around the problem's minimum energy state (which does not always coincide with the global minimum of the objective); (c) all other connected components of critical points are visited with frequency that is exponentially proportional to their energy level; and, finally (d) any component of local maximizers or saddle points is "dominated" by a component of local minimizers which is visited exponentially more often.</description>

      <title>A tutorial on fairness in machine learning in healthcare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Ensuring that machine learning (ML) algorithms are safe and effective within all patient groups, and do not disadvantage particular patients, is essential to clinical decision making and preventing the reinforcement of existing healthcare inequities. The objective of this tutorial is to introduce the medical informatics community to the common notions of fairness within ML, focusing on clinical applications and implementation in practice.
  TARGET AUDIENCE: As gaps in fairness arise in a variety of healthcare applications, this tutorial is designed to provide an understanding of fairness, without assuming prior knowledge, to researchers and clinicians who make use of modern clinical data.
  SCOPE: We describe the fundamental concepts and methods used to define fairness in ML, including an overview of why models in healthcare may be unfair, a summary and comparison of the metrics used to quantify fairness, and a discussion of some ongoing research. We illustrate some of the fairness methods introduced through a case study of mortality prediction in a publicly available electronic health record dataset. Finally, we provide a user-friendly R package for comprehensive group fairness evaluation, enabling researchers and clinicians to assess fairness in their own ML work.</description>

Due to their high inference costs, there is renewed interest in exploring the potential of efficient recurrent architectures (RNNs). In this paper, we analyze the differences in the representational capabilities of Transformers and RNNs across several tasks of practical relevance, including index lookup, nearest neighbor, recognizing bounded Dyck languages, and string equality. For the tasks considered, our results show separations based on the size of the model required for different architectures. For example, we show that a one-layer Transformer of logarithmic width can perform index lookup, whereas an RNN requires a hidden state of linear size. Conversely, while constant-size RNNs can recognize bounded Dyck languages, we show that one-layer Transformers require a linear size for this task. Furthermore, we show that two-layer Transformers of logarithmic size can perform decision tasks such as string equality or disjointness, whereas both one-layer Transformers and recurrent models require linear size for these tasks. We also show that a log-size two-layer Transformer can implement the nearest neighbor algorithm in its forward pass; on the other hand recurrent models require linear size. Our constructions are based on the existence of $N$ nearly orthogonal vectors in $O(\log N)$ dimensional space and our lower bounds are based on reductions from communication complexity problems. We supplement our theoretical results with experiments that highlight the differences in the performance of these architectures on practical-size sequences.</description>

      <title>Advancing Graph Generation through Beta Diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated effectiveness in generating natural images and have been extended to generate diverse data types, including graphs. This new generation of diffusion-based graph generative models has demonstrated significant performance improvements over methods that rely on variational autoencoders or generative adversarial networks. It's important to recognize, however, that most of these models employ Gaussian or categorical diffusion processes, which can struggle with sparse and long-tailed data distributions. In our work, we introduce Graph Beta Diffusion (GBD), a diffusion-based generative model particularly adept at capturing diverse graph structures. GBD utilizes a beta diffusion process, tailored for the sparse and range-bounded characteristics of graph adjacency matrices. Furthermore, we have developed a modulation technique that enhances the realism of the generated graphs by stabilizing the generation of critical graph structures, while preserving flexibility elsewhere. The outstanding performance of GBD across three general graph benchmarks and two biochemical graph benchmarks highlights its capability to effectively capture the complexities of real-world graph data. The code will be made available at https://github.com/YH-UtMSB/Graph_Beta_Diffusion</description>

      <title>Why Warmup the Learning Rate? Underlying Mechanisms and Improvements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is common in deep learning to warm up the learning rate $\eta$, often by a linear schedule between $\eta_{\text{init}} = 0$ and a predetermined target $\eta_{\text{trgt}}$. In this paper, we show through systematic experiments using SGD and Adam that the overwhelming benefit of warmup arises from allowing the network to tolerate larger $\eta_{\text{trgt}}$ by forcing the network to more well-conditioned areas of the loss landscape. The ability to handle larger $\eta_{\text{trgt}}$ makes hyperparameter tuning more robust while improving the final performance. We uncover different regimes of operation during the warmup period, depending on whether training starts off in a progressive sharpening or sharpness reduction phase, which in turn depends on the initialization and parameterization. Using these insights, we show how $\eta_{\text{init}}$ can be properly chosen by utilizing the loss catapult mechanism, which saves on the number of warmup steps, in some cases completely eliminating the need for warmup. We also suggest an initialization for the variance in Adam which provides benefits similar to warmup.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of sketching for compressive mixture modeling, we revisit existing proofs of the Restricted Isometry Property of sketching operators with respect to certain mixtures models. After examining the shortcomings of existing guarantees, we propose an alternative analysis that circumvents the need to assume importance sampling when drawing random Fourier features to build random sketching operators. Our analysis is based on new deterministic bounds on the restricted isometry constant that depend solely on the set of frequencies used to define the sketching operator; then we leverage these bounds to establish concentration inequalities for random sketching operators that lead to the desired RIP guarantees. Our analysis also opens the door to theoretical guarantees for structured sketching with frequencies associated to fast random linear operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an ordinary differential equation (ODE) based deep generative method for learning conditional distributions, named Conditional F\"ollmer Flow. Starting from a standard Gaussian distribution, the proposed flow could approximate the target conditional distribution very well when the time is close to 1. For effective implementation, we discretize the flow with Euler's method where we estimate the velocity field nonparametrically using a deep neural network. Furthermore, we also establish the convergence result for the Wasserstein-2 distance between the distribution of the learned samples and the target conditional distribution, providing the first comprehensive end-to-end error analysis for conditional distribution learning via ODE flow. Our numerical experiments showcase its effectiveness across a range of scenarios, from standard nonparametric conditional density estimation problems to more intricate challenges involving image data, illustrating its superiority over various existing conditional density estimation methods.</description>

      <title>On a Neural Implementation of Brenier's Polar Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1991, Brenier proved a theorem that generalizes the polar decomposition for square matrices -- factored as PSD $\times$ unitary -- to any vector field $F:\mathbb{R}^d\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^d$. The theorem, known as the polar factorization theorem, states that any field $F$ can be recovered as the composition of the gradient of a convex function $u$ with a measure-preserving map $M$, namely $F=\nabla u \circ M$. We propose a practical implementation of this far-reaching theoretical result, and explore possible uses within machine learning. The theorem is closely related to optimal transport (OT) theory, and we borrow from recent advances in the field of neural optimal transport to parameterize the potential $u$ as an input convex neural network. The map $M$ can be either evaluated pointwise using $u^*$, the convex conjugate of $u$, through the identity $M=\nabla u^* \circ F$, or learned as an auxiliary network. Because $M$ is, in general, not injective, we consider the additional task of estimating the ill-posed inverse map that can approximate the pre-image measure $M^{-1}$ using a stochastic generator. We illustrate possible applications of Brenier's polar factorization to non-convex optimization problems, as well as sampling of densities that are not log-concave.</description>

      <title>Towards Model-Agnostic Posterior Approximation for Fast and Accurate Variational Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inference for Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) consists of learning two models: (1) a generative model, which transforms a simple distribution over a latent space into the distribution over observed data, and (2) an inference model, which approximates the posterior of the latent codes given data. The two components are learned jointly via a lower bound to the generative model's log marginal likelihood. In early phases of joint training, the inference model poorly approximates the latent code posteriors. Recent work showed that this leads optimization to get stuck in local optima, negatively impacting the learned generative model. As such, recent work suggests ensuring a high-quality inference model via iterative training: maximizing the objective function relative to the inference model before every update to the generative model. Unfortunately, iterative training is inefficient, requiring heuristic criteria for reverting from iterative to joint training for speed. Here, we suggest an inference method that trains the generative and inference models independently. It approximates the posterior of the true model a priori; fixing this posterior approximation, we then maximize the lower bound relative to only the generative model. By conventional wisdom, this approach should rely on the true prior and likelihood of the true model to approximate its posterior (which are unknown). However, we show that we can compute a deterministic, model-agnostic posterior approximation (MAPA) of the true model's posterior. We then use MAPA to develop a proof-of-concept inference method. We present preliminary results on low-dimensional synthetic data that (1) MAPA captures the trend of the true posterior, and (2) our MAPA-based inference performs better density estimation with less computation than baselines. Lastly, we present a roadmap for scaling the MAPA-based inference method to high-dimensional data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20233v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new functional point of view on bilevel optimization problems for machine learning, where the inner objective is minimized over a function space. These types of problems are most often solved by using methods developed in the parametric setting, where the inner objective is strongly convex with respect to the parameters of the prediction function. The functional point of view does not rely on this assumption and notably allows using over-parameterized neural networks as the inner prediction function. We propose scalable and efficient algorithms for the functional bilevel optimization problem and illustrate the benefits of our approach on instrumental regression and reinforcement learning tasks.</description>

      <title>Learning with little mixing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.08269v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study square loss in a realizable time-series framework with martingale difference noise. Our main result is a fast rate excess risk bound which shows that whenever a trajectory hypercontractivity condition holds, the risk of the least-squares estimator on dependent data matches the iid rate order-wise after a burn-in time. In comparison, many existing results in learning from dependent data have rates where the effective sample size is deflated by a factor of the mixing-time of the underlying process, even after the burn-in time. Furthermore, our results allow the covariate process to exhibit long range correlations which are substantially weaker than geometric ergodicity. We call this phenomenon learning with little mixing, and present several examples for when it occurs: bounded function classes for which the $L^2$ and $L^{2+\epsilon}$ norms are equivalent, ergodic finite state Markov chains, various parametric models, and a broad family of infinite dimensional $\ell^2(\mathbb{N})$ ellipsoids. By instantiating our main result to system identification of nonlinear dynamics with generalized linear model transitions, we obtain a nearly minimax optimal excess risk bound after only a polynomial burn-in time.</description>

      <title>Robust Knowledge Transfer in Tiered Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.05534v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Tiered Reinforcement Learning setting, a parallel transfer learning framework, where the goal is to transfer knowledge from the low-tier (source) task to the high-tier (target) task to reduce the exploration risk of the latter while solving the two tasks in parallel. Unlike previous work, we do not assume the low-tier and high-tier tasks share the same dynamics or reward functions, and focus on robust knowledge transfer without prior knowledge on the task similarity. We identify a natural and necessary condition called the ``Optimal Value Dominance'' for our objective. Under this condition, we propose novel online learning algorithms such that, for the high-tier task, it can achieve constant regret on partial states depending on the task similarity and retain near-optimal regret when the two tasks are dissimilar, while for the low-tier task, it can keep near-optimal without making sacrifice. Moreover, we further study the setting with multiple low-tier tasks, and propose a novel transfer source selection mechanism, which can ensemble the information from all low-tier tasks and allow provable benefits on a much larger state-action space.</description>

      <title>Provably Efficient Exploration in Quantum Reinforcement Learning with Logarithmic Worst-Case Regret</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.10796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While quantum reinforcement learning (RL) has attracted a surge of attention recently, its theoretical understanding is limited. In particular, it remains elusive how to design provably efficient quantum RL algorithms that can address the exploration-exploitation trade-off. To this end, we propose a novel UCRL-style algorithm that takes advantage of quantum computing for tabular Markov decision processes (MDPs) with $S$ states, $A$ actions, and horizon $H$, and establish an $\mathcal{O}(\mathrm{poly}(S, A, H, \log T))$ worst-case regret for it, where $T$ is the number of episodes. Furthermore, we extend our results to quantum RL with linear function approximation, which is capable of handling problems with large state spaces. Specifically, we develop a quantum algorithm based on value target regression (VTR) for linear mixture MDPs with $d$-dimensional linear representation and prove that it enjoys $\mathcal{O}(\mathrm{poly}(d, H, \log T))$ regret. Our algorithms are variants of UCRL/UCRL-VTR algorithms in classical RL, which also leverage a novel combination of lazy updating mechanisms and quantum estimation subroutines. This is the key to breaking the $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$-regret barrier in classical RL. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work studying the online exploration in quantum RL with provable logarithmic worst-case regret.</description>

      <title>Prediction Risk and Estimation Risk of the Ridgeless Least Squares Estimator under General Assumptions on Regression Errors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.12883v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a significant growth in research focusing on minimum $\ell_2$ norm (ridgeless) interpolation least squares estimators. However, the majority of these analyses have been limited to an unrealistic regression error structure, assuming independent and identically distributed errors with zero mean and common variance. In this paper, we explore prediction risk as well as estimation risk under more general regression error assumptions, highlighting the benefits of overparameterization in a more realistic setting that allows for clustered or serial dependence. Notably, we establish that the estimation difficulties associated with the variance components of both risks can be summarized through the trace of the variance-covariance matrix of the regression errors. Our findings suggest that the benefits of overparameterization can extend to time series, panel and grouped data.</description>

      <title>Improved Stability and Generalization Guarantees of the Decentralized SGD Algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.02939v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new generalization error analysis for Decentralized Stochastic Gradient Descent (D-SGD) based on algorithmic stability. The obtained results overhaul a series of recent works that suggested an increased instability due to decentralization and a detrimental impact of poorly-connected communication graphs on generalization. On the contrary, we show, for convex, strongly convex and non-convex functions, that D-SGD can always recover generalization bounds analogous to those of classical SGD, suggesting that the choice of graph does not matter. We then argue that this result is coming from a worst-case analysis, and we provide a refined optimization-dependent generalization bound for general convex functions. This new bound reveals that the choice of graph can in fact improve the worst-case bound in certain regimes, and that surprisingly, a poorly-connected graph can even be beneficial for generalization.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Learning Without Labeled Multimodal Data: Guarantees and Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.04539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many machine learning systems that jointly learn from multiple modalities, a core research question is to understand the nature of multimodal interactions: how modalities combine to provide new task-relevant information that was not present in either alone. We study this challenge of interaction quantification in a semi-supervised setting with only labeled unimodal data and naturally co-occurring multimodal data (e.g., unlabeled images and captions, video and corresponding audio) but when labeling them is time-consuming. Using a precise information-theoretic definition of interactions, our key contribution is the derivation of lower and upper bounds to quantify the amount of multimodal interactions in this semi-supervised setting. We propose two lower bounds: one based on the shared information between modalities and the other based on disagreement between separately trained unimodal classifiers, and derive an upper bound through connections to approximate algorithms for min-entropy couplings. We validate these estimated bounds and show how they accurately track true interactions. Finally, we show how these theoretical results can be used to estimate multimodal model performance, guide data collection, and select appropriate multimodal models for various tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09924v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce DYMAG: a message passing paradigm for GNNs built on the expressive power of continuous, multiscale graph-dynamics. Standard discrete-time message passing algorithms implicitly make use of simplistic graph dynamics and aggregation schemes which limit their ability to capture fundamental graph topological properties. By contrast, DYMAG makes use of complex graph dynamics based on the heat and wave equation as well as a more complex equation which admits chaotic solutions. The continuous nature of the dynamics are leveraged to generate multiscale (dynamic-time snapshot) representations which we prove are linked to various graph topological and spectral properties. We demonstrate experimentally that DYMAG achieves superior performance in recovering the generating parameters of Erd\"os-Renyi and stochastic block model random graphs and the persistent homology of synthetic graphs and citation network. Since the behavior of proteins and biomolecules is sensitive to graph topology and exhibits important structure at multiple scales, we find that DYMAG outperforms other methods at predicting salient features of various biomolecules.</description>

      <title>Flora: Low-Rank Adapters Are Secretly Gradient Compressors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite large neural networks demonstrating remarkable abilities to complete different tasks, they require excessive memory usage to store the optimization states for training. To alleviate this, the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is proposed to reduce the optimization states by training fewer parameters. However, LoRA restricts overall weight update matrices to be low-rank, limiting the model performance. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of LoRA and identify that it can be approximated by a random projection. Based on this observation, we propose Flora, which is able to achieve high-rank updates by resampling the projection matrices while enjoying the sublinear space complexity of optimization states. We conduct experiments across different tasks and model architectures to verify the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Learning Metrics that Maximise Power for Accelerated A/B-Tests</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Online controlled experiments are a crucial tool to allow for confident decision-making in technology companies. A North Star metric is defined (such as long-term revenue or user retention), and system variants that statistically significantly improve on this metric in an A/B-test can be considered superior. North Star metrics are typically delayed and insensitive. As a result, the cost of experimentation is high: experiments need to run for a long time, and even then, type-II errors (i.e. false negatives) are prevalent.
  We propose to tackle this by learning metrics from short-term signals that directly maximise the statistical power they harness with respect to the North Star. We show that existing approaches are prone to overfitting, in that higher average metric sensitivity does not imply improved type-II errors, and propose to instead minimise the $p$-values a metric would have produced on a log of past experiments. We collect such datasets from two social media applications with over 160 million Monthly Active Users each, totalling over 153 A/B-pairs. Empirical results show that we are able to increase statistical power by up to 78% when using our learnt metrics stand-alone, and by up to 210% when used in tandem with the North Star. Alternatively, we can obtain constant statistical power at a sample size that is down to 12% of what the North Star requires, significantly reducing the cost of experimentation.</description>

      <title>Sharp Rates in Dependent Learning Theory: Avoiding Sample Size Deflation for the Square Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05928v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study statistical learning with dependent ($\beta$-mixing) data and square loss in a hypothesis class $\mathscr{F}\subset L_{\Psi_p}$ where $\Psi_p$ is the norm $\|f\|_{\Psi_p} \triangleq \sup_{m\geq 1} m^{-1/p} \|f\|_{L^m} $ for some $p\in [2,\infty]$. Our inquiry is motivated by the search for a sharp noise interaction term, or variance proxy, in learning with dependent data. Absent any realizability assumption, typical non-asymptotic results exhibit variance proxies that are deflated multiplicatively by the mixing time of the underlying covariates process. We show that whenever the topologies of $L^2$ and $\Psi_p$ are comparable on our hypothesis class $\mathscr{F}$ -- that is, $\mathscr{F}$ is a weakly sub-Gaussian class: $\|f\|_{\Psi_p} \lesssim \|f\|_{L^2}^\eta$ for some $\eta\in (0,1]$ -- the empirical risk minimizer achieves a rate that only depends on the complexity of the class and second order statistics in its leading term. Our result holds whether the problem is realizable or not and we refer to this as a \emph{near mixing-free rate}, since direct dependence on mixing is relegated to an additive higher order term. We arrive at our result by combining the above notion of a weakly sub-Gaussian class with mixed tail generic chaining. This combination allows us to compute sharp, instance-optimal rates for a wide range of problems. Examples that satisfy our framework include sub-Gaussian linear regression, more general smoothly parameterized function classes, finite hypothesis classes, and bounded smoothness classes.</description>

      <title>Are Uncertainty Quantification Capabilities of Evidential Deep Learning a Mirage?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper questions the effectiveness of a modern predictive uncertainty quantification approach, called \emph{evidential deep learning} (EDL), in which a single neural network model is trained to learn a meta distribution over the predictive distribution by minimizing a specific objective function. Despite their perceived strong empirical performance on downstream tasks, a line of recent studies by Bengs et al. identify limitations of the existing methods to conclude their learned epistemic uncertainties are unreliable, e.g., in that they are non-vanishing even with infinite data. Building on and sharpening such analysis, we 1) provide a sharper understanding of the asymptotic behavior of a wide class of EDL methods by unifying various objective functions; 2) reveal that the EDL methods can be better interpreted as an out-of-distribution detection algorithm based on energy-based-models; and 3) conduct extensive ablation studies to better assess their empirical effectiveness with real-world datasets. Through all these analyses, we conclude that even when EDL methods are empirically effective on downstream tasks, this occurs despite their poor uncertainty quantification capabilities. Our investigation suggests that incorporating model uncertainty can help EDL methods faithfully quantify uncertainties and further improve performance on representative downstream tasks, albeit at the cost of additional computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Data-Efficient Operator Learning via Unsupervised Pretraining and In-Context Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the promise of coupling machine learning methods and physical domainspecific insights for solving scientific problems based on partial differential equations (PDEs). However, being data-intensive, these methods still require a large amount of PDE data. This reintroduces the need for expensive numerical PDE solutions, partially undermining the original goal of avoiding these expensive simulations. In this work, seeking data efficiency, we design unsupervised pretraining for PDE operator learning. To reduce the need for training data with heavy simulation costs, we mine unlabeled PDE data without simulated solutions, and pretrain neural operators with physics-inspired reconstruction-based proxy tasks. To improve out-of-distribution performance, we further assist neural operators in flexibly leveraging in-context learning methods, without incurring extra training costs or designs. Extensive empirical evaluations on a diverse set of PDEs demonstrate that our method is highly data-efficient, more generalizable, and even outperforms conventional vision-pretrained models.</description>

      <title>Uniform Memory Retrieval with Larger Capacity for Modern Hopfield Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a two-stage memory retrieval dynamics for modern Hopfield models, termed $\mathtt{U\text{-}Hop}$, with enhanced memory capacity. Our key contribution is a learnable feature map $\Phi$ which transforms the Hopfield energy function into kernel space. This transformation ensures convergence between the local minima of energy and the fixed points of retrieval dynamics within the kernel space. Consequently, the kernel norm induced by $\Phi$ serves as a novel similarity measure. It utilizes the stored memory patterns as learning data to enhance memory capacity across all modern Hopfield models. Specifically, we accomplish this by constructing a separation loss $\mathcal{L}_\Phi$ that separates the local minima of kernelized energy by separating stored memory patterns in kernel space. Methodologically, $\mathtt{U\text{-}Hop}$ memory retrieval process consists of: (Stage I) minimizing separation loss for a more uniform memory (local minimum) distribution, followed by (Stage II) standard Hopfield energy minimization for memory retrieval. This results in a significant reduction of possible metastable states in the Hopfield energy function, thus enhancing memory capacity by preventing memory confusion. Empirically, with real-world datasets, we demonstrate that $\mathtt{U\text{-}Hop}$ outperforms all existing modern Hopfield models and state-of-the-art similarity measures, achieving substantial improvements in both associative memory retrieval and deep learning tasks.

      <title>On the Convergence of Multi-objective Optimization under Generalized Smoothness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-objective optimization (MOO) is receiving more attention in various fields such as multi-task learning. Recent works provide some effective algorithms with theoretical analysis but they are limited by the standard $L$-smooth or bounded-gradient assumptions, which are typically unsatisfactory for neural networks, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and transformers. In this paper, we study a more general and realistic class of $\ell$-smooth loss functions, where $\ell$ is a general non-decreasing function of gradient norm. We develop two novel single-loop algorithms for $\ell$-smooth MOO problems, Generalized Smooth Multi-objective Gradient descent (GSMGrad) and its stochastic variant, Stochastic Generalized Smooth Multi-objective Gradient descent (SGSMGrad), which approximate the conflict-avoidant (CA) direction that maximizes the minimum improvement among objectives. We provide a comprehensive convergence analysis of both algorithms and show that they converge to an $\epsilon$-accurate Pareto stationary point with a guaranteed $\epsilon$-level average CA distance (i.e., the gap between the updating direction and the CA direction) over all iterations, where totally $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ and $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-4})$ samples are needed for deterministic and stochastic settings, respectively. Our algorithms can also guarantee a tighter $\epsilon$-level CA distance in each iteration using more samples. Moreover, we propose a practical variant of GSMGrad named GSMGrad-FA using only constant-level time and space, while achieving the same performance guarantee as GSMGrad. Our experiments validate our theory and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</description>
