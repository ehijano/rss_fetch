      <title>Anomalies in the rotational spectra of $^{86}$Sr ULRRM dimers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomalies in the rotational structure of $^{86}$Sr $^3S_1$ dimer ultralong-range Rydberg molecules (ULRRMs) created in a cold strontium gas by two-photon excitation via the intermediate $5s5p~^3P_1$ state are reported. Measurements reveal that the distribution of product rotational states is sensitive to intermediate state detuning. Comparative studies using $^{84}$Sr $^1S_0$ and $^3S_1$, and $^{86}$Sr $^1S_0$ dimers display no similar behavior, indicating that the observed behavior is peculiar to $^{86}$Sr triplet dimers. While we have no definitive hypothesis as to the physical mechanism responsible for this behavior, possible explanations might involve the very different scattering lengths for $^{84}$Sr and $^{86}$Sr, or the interchange of spin and rotational angular momentum.</description>

      <title>Emission from driven atoms in collective strong coupling with an optical cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study self sustained cavity emission from driven atoms in collective strong coupling. The cavity emission occurs over a wide range of atom-cavity and drive laser detunings without any external input to the cavity mode. Second order correlation measurements ($g^2(\tau)$), further reveal unanticipated phenomenon in the observed cavity emission such as, (a) damped oscillations at two frequencies and (b) significantly distinct $g^2(\tau)$ for different polarization components. The intricate relation between cavity emission intensity, drive laser detuning and atom-cavity detunings is explained. A possible mechanism for the damped oscillations with two frequency components in $g^2(\tau)$ is suggested. Measurements show the existence of two separate polarization decoupled mechanisms with distinct photon statistics, through which energy is transferred from the drive field to the cavity field. The statistical properties and mechanisms underlying cavity emission, as presented in this work, are expected to provide valuable insights for extending non-destructive detection techniques to the regime of collective strong coupling.</description>

      <title>Analysis of heralded higher-fidelity two-qubit entangling gates with self-correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the quantum error correction (QEC) and noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) algorithms to function with high efficiency, the raw fidelity of quantum logic gates on physical qubits needs to satisfy strict requirement. The neutral atom quantum computing equipped with Rydberg blockade gates has made impressive progress recently, which makes it worthwhile to explore its potential in the two-qubit entangling gates, including Controlled-PHASE gate and in particular the CZ gate. Provided the quantum coherence is well preserved, improving the fidelity of Rydberg blockade gates calls for special mechanisms to deal with adverse effects caused by realistic experimental conditions. Here the heralded very-high-fidelity Rydberg blockade Controlled-PHASE gate is designed to address these issues, which contains self-correction and projection as the key steps. This trailblazing method can be built on the basis of the previously established buffer-atom-mediated gate, and a special form of symmetry under PT transformation plays a crucial role in the process. We further analyze the performance with respect to a few typical sources of imperfections. This procedure can also be regarded as quantum hardware error correction or mitigation. While this paper by itself does not cover every single subtle issue and still contains many over-simplifications, we find it reasonable to anticipate very-high-fidelity two-qubit quantum logic gate operated in the sense of heralded but probabilistic, whose gate error can reduce to the level of $10^{-4}$--$10^{-6}$ or even lower with reasonably high possibilities.</description>

      <title>Upgrades and maintenance of the CRYRING@ESR electron cooler for improved internal electron target operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electron cooler of the CRYRING@ESR storage ring at the GSI-FAIR accelerator complex is a unique instrument, which not only provides beam cooling of the stored ions, but also serves as a low-energy electron target for Dielectronic Recombination experiments. The minimisation of vacuum contamination and the response to rapid energy changes are key requirements of the cooler in electron target mode. Therefore, a test bench was prepared to study the outgassing behaviour of the electron gun components and a setup was constructed to evaluate the drift-electrode-modulation of the acceleration voltage of the cooler. The vacuum studies showed that the electron gun cathode was severely malfunctioning and resulted in its replacement. The drift-electrode-modulation of the acceleration voltage showed significant improvements compared to direct modulation of the terminal voltage of the cooler.</description>
