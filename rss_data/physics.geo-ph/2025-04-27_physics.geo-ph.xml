      <title>DFT Investigations of Major Defects in Quartz Crystal: Implications for Luminescence and ESR Dosimetry and Dating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quartz is extensively used for luminescence and ESR dosimetry as well as dating. These techniques use inherent defects introduced in quartz crystal during its crystallization in nature. The defect comprises both intrinsic as well as extrinsic defects. These defects give important luminescence properties to quartz but are not yet well understood from a theoretical perspective. Specifically, in case of luminescence dosimetry the nature of traps and their involvement in luminescence production is not exactly known. Thus, present work attempts to understand the basic physics of defects and their implication for luminescence and ESR techniques via Density Functional Theory (DFT) modelling. The work uses DFT to model the presence of some possible major impurities in quartz. Several interesting novel results are obtained that will have implications for ongoing research in Luminescence and ESR methods. The DFT modelling suggested that Oxygen deficiency in quartz crystal results in the formation of both electron and hole trapping centres. However, it is observed that these centres can be passivated by the introduction of charge compensating OH or H ions. Further, it is found that peroxy defects can be formed in the presence of either excess Oxygen or due to the absence of Silicon (Si4+), however, the nature of the traps formed in both cases is different. Besides these intrinsic defects, Al and Fe are the major impurities which are observed as defects in quartz. The modelling of these impurities suggested that negligible change in DOS is observed for Al defect and Fe generally forms a recombination centre or hole trap. In addition to these, there are several interesting first-time observations that are not reported and will be helpful for progressing luminescence and ESR dosimetry research.</description>

      <title>Changes in seismicity in a volcanically active region of the Izu Peninsula, Japan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19648v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The eastern Izu Peninsula in Japan is volcanically and seismically active. Ordinary earthquakes frequently occurred at shallow depths in 2006 and 2009, when they clustered as swarms. Beneath ordinary earthquakes, low-frequency earthquakes (LFEs) were infrequently observed. To better understand the characteristics of those LFEs, we produced a LFE catalog for 2005-2020, using the matched-filter method. Timeseries analyses based on the Epidemic-Type Aftershock Sequence model showed quiescence, i.e., a change in occurrence rate, which became quiet. For comparison, the same analysis was conducted using the Japan Meteorological Agency catalog of ordinary earthquakes, and similar results were shown. The change points for both types of earthquakes fell during and after each of the swarms, revealing an earlier start of quiescence for shallow ordinary earthquakes than for deep LFEs. Surface displacement data obtained from the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan showed that the uplift was in abatement or unobservable during the study period. Our seismicity and geodetic results are interpretatively hypothesized as being associated with magmatic activity, as follows. When the absence of a supply of magma from a depth toward the crustal magma reservoir caused no significant uplift, magma intruded from this reservoir into the shallow crust, resulting in the 2006 and 2009 swarms. Due to this intrusion, stresses decreased in and around shallow parts of the reservoir and then quiescence for ordinary earthquakes began during or after each swarm. Due to this decrease, stresses in and around deep parts of it late decreased, delaying the start of quiescence of deep LFEs.</description>

      <title>Rigorous Computation of Classical Horizontal Geodetic Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19199v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines mathematical models for processing classical horizontal geodetic (triangulation and trilateration) networks. Two rigorous parametric adjustment models are discussed. The first one is a well-known model of adjustment in the geodetic coordinate system. This model is completely rigorous (functional and stochastic parts) and uses unreduced distance and direction observations. The proposed alternative is a model of planar network adjustment with closed-form reductions of observations directly to the mapping plane. These ground-to-grid reductions are simple and universal, regardless of which map projection is used. Slightly different results of the planar network adjustment are obtained. The differences are attributed to a nonrigorous stochastic model. In theory, the stochastic properties of the reduced observations should also be adapted. However, these differences are very small and can always be neglected in geodetic and surveying practice.</description>

      <title>On the workflow, opportunities and challenges of developing foundation model in geophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Foundation models, as a mainstream technology in artificial intelligence, have demonstrated immense potential across various domains in recent years, particularly in handling complex tasks and multimodal data. In the field of geophysics, although the application of foundation models is gradually expanding, there is currently a lack of comprehensive reviews discussing the full workflow of integrating foundation models with geophysical data. To address this gap, this paper presents a complete framework that systematically explores the entire process of developing foundation models in conjunction with geophysical data. From data collection and preprocessing to model architecture selection, pre-training strategies, and model deployment, we provide a detailed analysis of the key techniques and methodologies at each stage. In particular, considering the diversity, complexity, and physical consistency constraints of geophysical data, we discuss targeted solutions to address these challenges. Furthermore, we discuss how to leverage the transfer learning capabilities of foundation models to reduce reliance on labeled data, enhance computational efficiency, and incorporate physical constraints into model training, thereby improving physical consistency and interpretability. Through a comprehensive summary and analysis of the current technological landscape, this paper not only fills the gap in the geophysics domain regarding a full-process review of foundation models but also offers valuable practical guidance for their application in geophysical data analysis, driving innovation and advancement in the field.</description>
