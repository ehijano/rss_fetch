      <title>A general multi-wave quasi-resonance theory for lattice energy diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, a multi-wave quasi-resonance framework is established to analyze energy diffusion in classical lattices, uncovering that it is fundamentally determined by the characteristics of eigenmodes. Namely, based on the presence and the absence of extended modes, lattices fall into two universality classes with qualitatively different thermalization behavior. In particular, we find that while the one with extended modes can be thermalized under arbitrarily weak perturbations in the thermodynamic limit, the other class can be thermalized only when perturbations exceed a certain threshold, revealing for the first time the possibility that a lattice cannot be thermalized, violating the hypothesis of statistical mechanics. Our study addresses conclusively the renowned Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou problem for large systems under weak perturbations, underscoring the pivotal roles of both extended and localized modes in facilitating energy diffusion and thermalization processes.</description>

      <title>Loop diagrams in the kinetic theory of waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work has given a systematic way for studying the kinetics of classical weakly interacting waves beyond leading order, having analogies with renormalization in quantum field theory. An important context is weak wave turbulence, occurring for waves which are small in magnitude and weakly interacting, such as those on the surface of the ocean. Here we continue the work of perturbatively computing correlation functions and the kinetic equation in this far-from-equilibrium state. In particular, we obtain the two-loop kinetic equation for waves with a cubic interaction. Our main result is a simple graphical prescription for the terms in the kinetic equation, at any order in the nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Classification of same-gate quantum circuits and their space-time symmetries with application to the level-spacing distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Floquet systems with translationally invariant nearest-neighbor 2-site gates. Depending on the order in which the gates are applied on an N-site system with periodic boundary conditions, there are factorially many different circuit configurations. We prove that there are only N-1 different spectrally equivalent classes which can be viewed either as a generalization of the brick-wall or of the staircase configuration. Every class, characterized by two integers, has a nontrivial space-time symmetry with important implications for the level-spacing distribution -- a standard indicator of quantum chaos. Namely, in order to study chaoticity one should not look at eigenphases of the Floquet propagator itself, but rather at the spectrum of an appropriate root of the propagator.</description>

      <title>From spectral to scattering form factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel indicator for chaotic quantum scattering processes, the scattering form factor (ScFF). It is based on mapping the locations of peaks in the scattering amplitude to random matrix eigenvalues, and computing the analog of the spectral form factor (SFF). We compute the spectral and scattering form factors of several non-chaotic systems. We determine the ScFF associated with the phase shifts of the leaky torus, closely related to the distribution of the zeros of Riemann zeta function. We compute the ScFF for the decay amplitude of a highly excited string states into two tachyons. We show that it displays the universal features expected from random matrix theory - a decline, a ramp and a plateau - and is in general agreement with the Gaussian unitary ensemble. It also shows some new features, owning to the special structure of the string amplitude, including a "bump" before the ramp associated with gaps in the average eigenvalue density. The "bump" is removed for highly excited string states with an appropriate state dependent unfolding. We also discuss the SFF for the Gaussian $\beta$- ensemble, writing an interpolation between the known results of the Gaussian orthogonal, unitary, and symplectic ensembles.</description>
