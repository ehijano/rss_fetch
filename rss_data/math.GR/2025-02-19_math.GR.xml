      <title>Hyperbolic structures on Houghton groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a group $G$, its poset of hyperbolic structures $\mathcal{H}(G)$ encodes all the possible cobounded actions of $G$ on hyperbolic spaces. In this article, we describe the poset $\mathcal{H}(H_n)$ for every Houghton group $H_n$, $n \geq 2$. In particular, we show that $H_n$ admits exactly $n$ focal hyperbolic structures. As an application, we construct the first example of a group admitting exactly one focal hyperbolic structure, answering a question of Abbott, Balasubramanya, and Osin.</description>

      <title>The Moufang Condition and Root Automorphisms for Spherical Buildings of Rank 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12857v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give direct, geometric constructions for nontrivial root elations for rank $2$ residues of higher rank buildings $\Delta$ of type $\mathsf{B_n}, \mathsf{C_n}$ and $\mathsf{H_m}$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $m \in \{3,4\}$. We show that we can extend these to the ambient building in the case that $\Delta$ has type $\mathsf{B_n}$ or $\mathsf{C_n}$. With that, we obtain a different proof for the fact that buildings of type $\mathsf{B_n}$ and $\mathsf{C_n}$ are Moufang. This geometric approach enables us to gain more insight into the root groups associated to these buildings and we obtain new results; Namely, that certain root elations generically fix more points than we previously knew and that every root elation in each point residual can be written as an even self-projectivity. Concerning $\mathsf{H_m}$, we will be able to see in a novel way why thick, spherical buildings of type $\mathsf{H_m}$ cannot exist. Altogther, this provides an alternative proof for the fact that all thick, irreducible, spherical buildings $\Delta$ of rank 3 have the Moufang property.</description>

      <title>Primitivity Testing in Free Group Algebras via Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a field and $F$ a free group. By a classical result of Cohn and Lewin, the free group algebra $K\left[F\right]$ is a free ideal ring (FIR): a ring over which the submodules of free modules are themselves free, and of a well-defined rank. Given a finitely generated right ideal $I\leq K\left[F\right]$ and an element $f\in I$, we give an explicit algorithm determining whether $f$ is part of some basis of $I$. More generally, given free $K[F]$-modules $M\le N$, we provide algorithms determining whether $M$ is a free summand of $N$, and whether $N$ admits a free splitting relative to $M$. These can also be used to obtain analogous algorithms for free groups $H\le J$.
  As an aside, we also provide an algorithm to compute the intersection of two given submodules of a free $K\left[F\right]$-module.
  A key feature of this work is the introduction of a duality, induced by a matrix with entries in a free ideal ring, between the respective algebraic extensions of its column and row spaces.</description>

      <title>Linearization of multivariate discrete difference operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2023 in (3), Uwe finds the explicit form of the map which is which is settled in ZN of finite functional degree and14 discusses how to compute its usual degree w.r.t to the derivative in the linear form, i.e. the product of ones formed by15 its orthogonal basis, and also introduces the notion of functional degree. It is the linear combination of the product of16 binomials. And this makes a big progress in the development of integer-valued functions. And this inspires the author17 to discuss this form in the separate form, i.e. the triple of finite set. In (18), Hrycaj discusses these operators in more18 abstract form. In this paper, we unifies two approaches. Seriously, we prove that the functional degree of integer-valued19 maps on integers which is computed with respect to its difference operators associated with its standard basis is exactly20 the same with the ones computed with respect to arbitrary mix discrete difference operators and we call it as multivariate21 difference operators. Since the functional degree agrees with the usual degree of integer-valued maps, we actually achieved22 the linearization of multivariate difference operators</description>

      <title>Alperin's bound and normal Sylow subgroups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group, $p$ a prime number and $P$ a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$. Recently, G. Malle, G. Navarro, and P. H. Tiep conjectured that the number of $p$-Brauer characters of $G$ coincides with that of the normaliser ${\bf N}_G(P)$ if and only if $P$ is normal in $G$. We reduce this conjecture to a question about finite simple groups and prove it for the prime $p = 2$. As a by-product of our work, we prove a reduction theorem for the blockwise version of Alperin's lower bound on $p$-Brauer characters and prove it for $2$-blocks of maximal defect. This improves recent results obtained by Malle, Navarro, and Tiep.</description>

      <title>High dimensional hyperbolic Coxeter groups that virtually fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides an iterative procedure for constructing hyperbolic Coxeter groups that virtually fiber over $\mathbb{Z}$ that is flexible enough to yield infinitely many isomorphism classes in each virtual cohomological dimension (vcd) $n\geq 2$. Our procedure combines results of Jankiewicz, Norin, and Wise with a generalization of a construction due to Osajda involving a new simplicial thickening process. We also give a topological argument showing that the vcd of the right-angled Coxeter groups produced by our construction increases by exactly one with each iteration, guaranteeing that our process produces examples of every vcd.</description>

      <title>Bipartite $q$-Kneser graphs and two-generated irreducible linear groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05529v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $V:=(\mathbb{F}_q)^d$ be a $d$-dimensional vector space over the field $\mathbb{F}_q$ of order $q$. Fix positive integers $e_1,e_2$ satisfying $e_1+e_2=d$. Motivated by analysing a fundamental algorithm in computational group theory for recognising classical groups, we consider a certain quantity $P(e_1,e_2)$ which arises in both graph theory and group representation theory: $P(e_1,e_2)$ is the proportion of $3$-walks in the `bipartite $q$-Kneser graph' $\Gamma_{e_1,e_2}$ that are closed $3$-arcs. We prove that, for a group $G$ satisfying ${\rm SL}_d(q)\leqslant G\leqslant{\rm GL}_d(q)$, the proportion of certain element-pairs in $G$ called `$(e_1,e_2)$-stingray duos' which generate an irreducible subgroup is also equal to $P(e_1,e_2)$. We give an exact formula for $P(e_1,e_2)$, and prove that $1-q^{-1}-q^{-2}&lt; P(e_1,e_2)&lt; 1-q^{-1}-q^{-2}+2q^{-3}-2q^{-5}$ for $2\leqslant e_2\leqslant e_1$ and $q\geqslant2$.These bounds have implications for the complexity analysis of the state-of-the-art algorithms to recognise classical groups, which we discuss in the final section.</description>

      <title>A connection between Lipschitz and Kazhdan constants for groups of homeomorphisms of the real line</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We exhibit an obstruction for groups with Relative Property (T) to act on the real line by bi-Lipschitz homeomorphisms. This condition is expressed in terms of the Lipschitz and Kazhdan constants associated to finite generating subsets. As an application, we obtain an explicit lower bound for the Lipschitz constants associated to actions of the semidirect product $\mathbb{F}_2\ltimes\mathbb{Z}^2$. We also obtain an upper bound for the Kazhdan constants of pairs of orderable groups, depending only on the cardinal of the generating subset.</description>

      <title>Vanishing Elements of Prime Power Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13605v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An element $x$ in a finite group $G$ is said to be \textit{vanishing} if some (complex) irreducible character of $G$ takes value $0$ at $x$. In this article, we prove that every finite simple group, except $\mathrm{SL}_2(4)$ and $\mathrm{SL}_2(8)$, contains a vanishing element of prime power order whose conjugacy class size is divisible by three distinct primes. We use this result to prove that if $p$ is a prime, which does not divide the conjugacy class size of any vanishing element of prime power order in $G$, then $G$ has normal $p$-complement and abelian Sylow $p$-subgroup; this generalizes a result of Dolfi et al. ($2010$). We also prove that in a non-solvable finite group $G$, if the conjugacy class size of all the vanishing elements of prime power order has at most two distinct prime divisors, then $G/\mathrm{Sol}(G)$ is a direct product of mutually isomorphic simple groups among $\mathrm{SL}_2(4)$ and $\mathrm{SL}_2(8)$. ($\mathrm{Sol}(G)$ is the largest normal solvable subgroup of $G$.) This generalizes a result of Robati ($2020$).</description>

      <title>The Freeness Problem for Automaton Semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the freeness problems for automaton semigroups and for automaton monoids are undecidable and, thereby, solve an open problem listed by Grigorchuk, Nekrashevych and Sush\-chansk\u{\i}i. We achieve this using a new technique to encode Post's Correspondence Problem into automaton semigroups and monoids and our result even holds if we restrict the alphabet of the input automata to a constant size. The encoding allows us to precisely control the relations in the generated semigroup/monoid and the construction is quite versatile. In fact, we obtain further undecidability results on various semigroup notions (left cancellativity, equidivisibility and extending homomorphisms). Our construction can also be adapted to show that the free presentation problem for automaton monoids is undecidable (and yields a weaker statement in the semigroup case).</description>

      <title>Hybrid spherical designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spherical $t$-designs are finite point sets on the unit sphere that enable exact integration of polynomials of degree at most $t$ via equal-weight quadrature. This concept has recently been extended to spherical $t$-design curves by the use of normalized path integrals. However, explicit examples of such curves are rare.
  We construct new spherical $t$-design curves for small $t$ based on the edges of a distinct subclass of convex polytopes. We then introduce hybrid $t$-designs that combine points and curves for exact polynomial integration of higher degree. Our constructions are based on the vertices and edges of dual pairs of convex polytopes and polynomial invariants of their symmetry group. A notable result is a hybrid $t$-design for $t=19$.</description>
