      <title>$BMO$ and gradient estimates for solutions of critical elliptic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we explore several applications of the recently introduced spaces of functions of bounded $\beta$-dimensional mean oscillation for $\beta \in (0,n]$ to regularity theory of critical exponent elliptic equations. One interesting consequence of these considerations is the observation that for $F \in L^1$, $\operatorname*{div} F=0$, the solution of \begin{align*} -\operatorname*{div}( |\nabla U|^{n-2} \nabla U) &amp;= F \mbox{ in } \Omega,\newline
  U &amp;=0 \mbox{ on }\partial \Omega. \end{align*}
  satisfies
  \begin{align*} \|\nabla U \|_{L^n} \mathbb \leq C \, \|F\|^{1/(n-1)}_{L^1}, \end{align*} where the constant $C$ is independent of $F$.</description>

      <title>Discrete inverse problems with internal functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of finding the resistors in a resistor network from measurements of the power dissipated by the resistors under different loads. We give sufficient conditions for local uniqueness, i.e. conditions that guarantee that the linearization of this non-linear inverse problem admits a unique solution. Our method is inspired by a method to study local uniqueness of inverse problems with internal functionals in the continuum, where the inverse problem is reformulated as a redundant system of differential equations. We use our method to derive local uniqueness conditions for other discrete inverse problems with internal functionals including a discrete analogue of the inverse Schr\"odinger problem and problems where the resistors are replaced by impedances and dissipated power at the zero and a positive frequency are available. Moreover, we show that the dissipated power measurements can be obtained from measurements of thermal noise induced currents.</description>

      <title>Linear and Non linear stability for the kinetic plasma sheath on a bounded interval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14079v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasma sheaths are inhomogeneous equilibrium that form when a plasma is in contact with an absorbing wall. We prove linear and non linear stability of a kinetic sheath equilibrium for a Vlasov-Poisson type system in a bounded interval. Notably, in the linear setting, we obtain exponential decay of the fluctuation provided the rate of injection of particles at equilibrium is smaller that the rate of absorption at the wall. In the non linear setting, we prove a similar result for small enough equilibrium and small localized perturbation of the equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Strong well-posedness and separation properties for a bulk-surface convective Cahn--Hilliard system with singular potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the well-posedness of a general class of bulk-surface convective Cahn--Hilliard systems with singular potentials. For this model, we first prove the existence of a global-in-time weak solution by approximating the singular potentials via a Yosida approximation, applying the corresponding results for regular potentials, and eventually passing to the limit in this approximation scheme. Then, we prove the uniqueness of weak solutions and its continuous dependence on the velocity fields and the initial data. Afterwards, assuming additional regularity of the domain as well as the velocity fields, we establish higher regularity properties of weak solutions and eventually the existence of strong solutions. In the end, we discuss strict separation properties for logarithmic type potentials in both two and three dimensions.</description>

      <title>Regularity and uniqueness to multi-phase problem with variable exponent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a new class of multi phase operators with variable exponents, which reflects the inhomogeneous characteristics of hardness changes when multiple different materials are combined together. We at first deal with the corresponding functional spaces, namely the Musielak-Orlicz Sobolev spaces, hence we investigate their regularity properties and the extension of the classical Sobolev embedding results to the new context. Then, we focus on the regularity properties of our operators, and prove that these operators are bounded, continuous, strictly monotone, coercive and satisfy the (S_+)-property. Further, we discuss suitable problems driven by such operators. In particular, we deal with Dirichlet problems in which the nonlinearity is gradient dependent. Under very general assumptions, we establish the existence of a nontrivial solution for such problems. Also, we give additional conditions on the nonlinearity which guarantee the uniqueness of solution. Lastly, we produce some local regularity results (namely, Caccioppoli-type inequality, Sobolev-Poincar\'e-type inequalities and higher integrability) for minimizers of the integral functionals corresponding to the operators.</description>

      <title>Partial mass dynamics of the defocussing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the long time dynamics of the defocussing NLS equation. Compared with previous literature, we revisit the direct and inverse scattering map to obtain asymptotics in some weighted energy space that requires less restrictive decay and regularity assumptions. The main result is derived from the nonlinear steepest descent method and an approximation argument in the spirit of \textit{Riemann-Lebesgue} lemma.</description>

      <title>Comparing three possible hypoelliptic Laplacians on the 5-dimensional Cartan group via div-Curl type estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On general Carnot groups, the definition of a possible hypoelliptic Hodge-Laplacian on forms using the Rumin complex has been considered by Rumin, who introduced a 0-order pseudodifferential operator on forms. However, for questions regarding regularity for example, where one needs sharp estimates, this 0-order operator is not suitable. Up to now, there have only been very few attempts to define hypoelliptic Hodge-Laplacians on forms that would allow for such sharp estimates. Indeed, this question is rather difficult to address in full generality, the main issue being that the Rumin exterior differential $d_c$ is not homogeneous on arbitrary Carnot groups.
  In this note, we consider the specific example of the free Carnot group of step 3 with 2 generators, and we introduce three possible definitions of hypoelliptic Hodge-Laplacians. We compare how these three possible Laplacians can be used to obtain sharp div-curl type inequalities akin to those considered by Bourgain &amp; Brezis and Lanzani &amp; Stein for the de Rham complex, or their subelliptic counterparts obtained by Baldi, Franchi &amp; Pansu for the Rumin complex on Heisenberg groups. ha il menu contestuale</description>

      <title>Shubin calculi for actions of graded Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we develop a calculus of Shubin type pseudodifferential operators on certain non-compact spaces, using a groupoid approach similar to the one of van Erp and Yuncken. More concretely, we consider actions of graded Lie groups on graded vector spaces and study pseudodifferential operators that generalize fundamental vector fields and multiplication by polynomials. Our two main examples of elliptic operators in this calculus are Rockland operators with a potential and the generalizations of the harmonic oscillator to the Heisenberg group due to Rottensteiner-Ruzhansky.
  Deforming the action of the graded group, we define a tangent groupoid which connects pseudodifferential operators to their principal (co)symbols. We show that our operators form a calculus that is asymptotically complete. Elliptic elements in the calculus have parametrices, are hypoelliptic, and can be characterized in terms of a Rockland condition. Moreover, we study the mapping properties as well as the spectra of our operators on Sobolev spaces and compare our calculus to the Shubin calculus on $\mathbb R^n$ and its anisotropic generalizations.</description>

      <title>Pseudodifferential damping estimates and stability of relaxation shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A bottleneck in the theory of large-amplitude and multi-d viscous and relaxation shock stability is the development of nonlinear damping estimates controlling higher by lower derivatives. These have traditionally proceeded from time-evolution bounds based on Friedrichs symmetric and Kawashima or Goodman type energy estimates. Here, we propose an alternative program based on frequency-dependent pseudodifferential time-space damping estimates in the spirit of Kreiss. These are seen to be equivalent in the linear case to high-frequency spectral stability, and, just as for the constant-coefficient analysis of Kreiss, sharp in a pointwise, fixed-frequency, sense. This point of view leads to a number of simplifications and extensions using already-existing analysis. We point to the new issue of turning points, analogous to glancing points in the constant-coefficient case as an important direction for further development.</description>

      <title>Robust error estimates of PINN in one-dimensional boundary value problems for linear elliptic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) to approximate solutions to one-dimensional boundary value problems for linear elliptic equations and establish robust error estimates of PINN regardless of the quantities of the coefficients. In particular, we rigorously demonstrate the existence and uniqueness of solutions using the Sobolev space theory based on a variational approach. Deriving $L^2$-contraction estimates, we show that the error, defined as the mean square for differences at the sample points between the true solution and our trial function, is dominated by the training loss. Furthermore, we show that as the quantities of the coefficients for the differential equation increase, the error-to-loss ratio rapidly decreases. Our theoretical and experimental results confirm the robustness of the error regardless of the quantities of the coefficients.</description>

Abstract: We consider a recently proposed model for the propagation of one-photon states in a random medium of two-level atoms. We demonstrate the existence of Anderson localization of single photon states in an energy band centered at the resonant energy of the atoms. Additionally, for a Bosonic model of the atoms the results can be extended to multiple photon states.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of the inverse source problem for fractional diffusion-wave equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study addresses the inverse source problem for the fractional diffusion-wave equation, characterized by a source comprising spatial and temporal components. The investigation is primarily concerned with practical scenarios where data is collected subsequent to an incident. We establish the uniqueness of either the spatial or the temporal component of the source, provided that the temporal component exhibits an asymptotic expansion at infinity. Taking anomalous diffusion as a typical example, we gather the asymptotic behavior of one of the following quantities: the concentration on partial interior region or at a point inside the region, or the flux on partial boundary or at a point on the boundary. The proof is based on the asymptotic expansion of the solution to the fractional diffusion-wave equation. Notably, our approach does not rely on the conventional vanishing conditions for the source components. We also observe that the extent of uniqueness is dependent on the fractional order.</description>

      <title>On the Convergence of the Variational Iteration Method for Klein-Gordon Problems with Variable Coefficients II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate convergence for the Variational Iteration Method (VIM) which was introduced and described in \cite{He0},\cite{He1}, \cite{He2}, and \cite{He3}. We prove the convergence of the iteration scheme for a linear Klein-Gorden equation with a variable coefficient whose unique solution is known. The iteration scheme depends on a {\em Lagrange multiplier}, $\lambda(r,s)$, which is represented as a power series. We show that the VIM iteration scheme converges uniformly on compact intervals to the unique solution. We also prove convergence when $\lambda(r,s)$ is replaced by any of its partial sums. The first proof follows a familiar pattern, but the second requires a new approach. The second approach also provides some detail regarding the structure of the iterates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The compact Riemannian manifolds $\mathcal{M}$ and $\mathcal{N}$ for which the trace operator from the first-order Sobolev space of mappings $\smash{\dot{W}}^{1, p} (\mathcal{M}, \mathcal{N})$ to the fractional Sobolev-Slobodecki\u{\i} space $\smash{\smash{\dot{W}}^{1 - 1/p, p}} (\partial \mathcal{M}, \mathcal{N})$ is surjective when $1 &lt; p &lt; \dim \mathcal{M}$ are characterised. The traces are extended using a new construction which can be carried out assuming the absence of the known topological and analytical obstructions. When $p \ge \dim \mathcal{M}$ the same construction provides a Sobolev extension with linear estimates for maps that have a continuous extension, provided that there are no known analytical obstructions to such a control.</description>

Abstract: We classify the surfaces translating under the flows by sub-affine-critical powers of the Gauss curvature. This, in particular, lists all translating solitons possibly model Type II singularities for convex closed solutions in all positive powers. The surfaces are entire graphs, and therefore our result corresponds to the Liouville theorem for the degenerate Monge--Amp\`ere equations $\det D^2 u=(1+|Du|^2)^{2-\frac{1}{2\alpha}}$ on $\mathbb{R}^2$ in the range $0&lt;\alpha &lt;1/4$. The result also reveals that the moduli spaces of solutions are homeomorphic to either Euclidean spaces or cylinders.</description>

      <title>Curvature Varifolds with Orthogonal Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.08045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.08045v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the class $S^m_\perp(\Omega)$ of $m$-dimensional surfaces in $\bar{\Omega} \subset {\mathbb R}^n$ which intersect $S = \partial \Omega$ orthogonally along the boundary. A piece of an affine $m$-plane in $S^m_\perp(\Omega)$ is called an orthogonal slice. We prove estimates for the area by the $L^p$-integral of the second fundamental form in three cases: first when $\Omega$ admits no orthogonal slices, second for $m = p = 2$ if all orthogonal slices are topological disks, and finally for all $\Omega$ if the surfaces are confined to a neighborhood of $S$. The orthogonality constraint has a weak formulation for curvature varifolds. We classify those varifolds of vanishing curvature. As an application, we prove for any $\Omega$ the existence of an orthogonal $2$-varifold which minimizes the $L^2$ curvature in the integer rectifiable class.</description>

      <title>Characteristic Gluing with $\Lambda$ 1. Linearised Einstein equations on four-dimensional spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.10052v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a gluing theorem for linearised vacuum gravitational fields in Bondi gauge on a class of characteristic surfaces in static vacuum four-dimensional backgrounds with cosmological constant $\Lambda \in \mathbb{R}$ and arbitrary topology of the compact cross-sections of the null hypersurface. This generalises and complements, in the linearised case, the pioneering analysis of Aretakis, Czimek and Rodnianski, carried-out on light-cones in Minkowski spacetime.</description>

      <title>Heat kernel estimates for boundary traces of reflected diffusions on uniform domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the boundary trace processes of reflected diffusions on uniform domains. We obtain stable-like heat kernel estimates for such a boundary trace process when the diffusion on the underlying ambient space satisfies sub-Gaussian heat kernel estimates. Our arguments rely on new results of independent interest such as sharp two-sided estimates and the volume doubling property of the harmonic measure, the existence of a continuous extension of the Na\"im kernel to the topological boundary, and the Doob--Na\"im formula identifying the Dirichlet form of the boundary trace process as the pure-jump Dirichlet form whose jump kernel with respect to the harmonic measure is exactly (the continuous extension of) the Na\"im kernel.</description>
