      <title>Non-distributive Lattices, Stable Matchings, and Linear Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that all finite lattices, including non-distributive lattices, arise as stable matching lattices under standard assumptions on choice functions. In the process, we introduce new tools to reason on general lattices for optimization purposes: the partial representation of a lattice, which partially extends Birkhoff's representation theorem to non-distributive lattices; the distributive closure of a lattice, which gives such a partial representation; and join constraints, which can be added to the distributive closure to obtain a representation for the original lattice. Then, we use these techniques to show that the minimum cost stable matching problem under the same standard assumptions on choice functions is NP-hard, by establishing a connection with antimatroid theory.</description>

      <title>On constrained intersection representations of graphs and digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of determining optimal directed intersection representations of DAGs in a model introduced by Kostochka, Liu, Machado, and Milenkovic [ISIT2019]: vertices are assigned color sets so that there is an arc from a vertex $u$ to a vertex $v$ if and only if their color sets have nonempty intersection and $v$ gets assigned strictly more colors than $u$, and the goal is to minimize the total number of colors. We show that the problem is polynomially solvable in the class of triangle-free and Hamiltonian DAGs and also disclose the relationship of this problem with several other models of intersection representations of graphs and digraphs.</description>

      <title>Tight Lower Bound for Multicolor Discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the following asymptotically tight lower bound for $k$-color discrepancy: For any $k \geq 2$, there exists a hypergraph with $n$ vertices such that its $k$-color discrepancy is at least $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$. This improves on the previously known lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{n/\log k})$ due to Caragiannis et al. (arXiv:2502.10516). As an application, we show that our result implies improved lower bounds for group fair division.</description>

      <title>Searching in trees with heavy group sets of fixed size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the following generalization of the binary search problem: A searcher is required to find a hidden element $x$ in a tree $T$. To do so, they iteratively perform queries to an oracle about a chosen vertex $v$. After each such call, the oracle responds whether the target was found and if not, the searcher receives as a reply the neighbor of $v$ that lays on the shortest path towards $x$. Additionally, each vertex $v$ may have a different query cost $w(v)$. The goal is to find the optimal querying strategy for the searcher which minimizes the worst case query cost required to find $x$. The problem is known to be NP-hard even in restricted classes of trees such as bounded diameter spiders [Cicalese et al. 2016] and no constant factor approximation algorithm is known for the general case. Inspired by recent studies [Dereniowski et al. 2022, Dereniowski et al. 2024], instead of restricted classes of trees, we explore restrictions on the weight function. We introduce the concept of a heavy group set of a vertex $HG(v,w)$. We show that if for every $v\in T$: $|HG(v,w)|\leq k$ an $O(\log\log n)$-approximation can be found within $2^{O(\log^2k)}\cdot\text{poly}(n)$ time.</description>

      <title>Solving Partial Dominating Set and Related Problems Using Twin-Width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Partial vertex cover and partial dominating set are two well-investigated optimization problems. While they are $\rm W[1]$-hard on general graphs, they have been shown to be fixed-parameter tractable on many sparse graph classes, including nowhere-dense classes. In this paper, we demonstrate that these problems are also fixed-parameter tractable with respect to the twin-width of a graph. Indeed, we establish a more general result: every graph property that can be expressed by a logical formula of the form $\phi\equiv\exists x_1\ldots \exists x_k \#y\,\psi(x_1,\ldots,x_k,y)\ge t$, where $\psi$ is a quantifier-free formula, $t$ is an arbitrary number, and $\#y$ is a counting quantifier, can be evaluated in time $f(d,k)n$, where $n$ is the number of vertices and $d$ is the width of a contraction sequence that is part of the input. Notably, this includes problems such as connected partial dominating set and independent partial dominating set.</description>

      <title>Clustering of return words in languages of interval exchanges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A word over an ordered alphabet is said to be clustering if identical letters appear adjacently in its Burrows-Wheeler transform. Such words are strictly related to (discrete) interval exchange transformations. We use an extended version of the well-known Rauzy induction to show that every return word in the language generated by a regular interval exchange transformation is clustering, partially answering a question of Lapointe (2021).</description>

      <title>Treewidth Parameterized by Feedback Vertex Number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide the first algorithm for computing an optimal tree decomposition for a given graph $G$ that runs in single exponential time in the feedback vertex number of $G$, that is, in time $2^{O(\text{fvn}(G))}\cdot n^{O(1)}$, where $\text{fvn}(G)$ is the feedback vertex number of $G$ and $n$ is the number of vertices of $G$. On a classification level, this improves the previously known results by Chapelle et al. [Discrete Applied Mathematics '17] and Fomin et al. [Algorithmica '18], who independently showed that an optimal tree decomposition can be computed in single exponential time in the vertex cover number of $G$.
  One of the biggest open problems in the area of parameterized complexity is whether we can compute an optimal tree decomposition in single exponential time in the treewidth of the input graph. The currently best known algorithm by Korhonen and Lokshtanov [STOC '23] runs in $2^{O(\text{tw}(G)^2)}\cdot n^4$ time, where $\text{tw}(G)$ is the treewidth of $G$. Our algorithm improves upon this result on graphs $G$ where $\text{fvn}(G)\in o(\text{tw}(G)^2)$. On a different note, since $\text{fvn}(G)$ is an upper bound on $\text{tw}(G)$, our algorithm can also be seen either as an important step towards a positive resolution of the above-mentioned open problem, or, if its answer is negative, then a mark of the tractability border of single exponential time algorithms for the computation of treewidth.</description>

      <title>Computing Distances on Graph Associahedra is Fixed-parameter Tractable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An elimination tree of a connected graph $G$ is a rooted tree on the vertices of $G$ obtained by choosing a root $v$ and recursing on the connected components of $G-v$ to obtain the subtrees of $v$. The graph associahedron of $G$ is a polytope whose vertices correspond to elimination trees of $G$ and whose edges correspond to tree rotations, a natural operation between elimination trees. These objects generalize associahedra, which correspond to the case where $G$ is a path. Ito et al. [ICALP 2023] recently proved that the problem of computing distances on graph associahedra is NP-hard. In this paper we prove that the problem, for a general graph $G$, is fixed-parameter tractable parameterized by the distance $k$. Prior to our work, only the case where $G$ is a path was known to be fixed-parameter tractable. To prove our result, we use a novel approach based on a marking scheme that restricts the search to a set of vertices whose size is bounded by a (large) function of $k$.</description>

      <title>Subexponential and Parameterized Mixing Times of Glauber Dynamics on Independent Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$, the hard-core model defines a probability distribution over its independent sets, assigning to each set of size $k$ a probability of $\frac{\lambda^k}{Z}$, where $\lambda&gt;0$ is a parameter known as the fugacity and $Z$ is a normalization constant. The Glauber dynamics is a simple Markov chain that converges to this distribution and enables efficient sampling. Its mixing time--the number of steps needed to approach the stationary distribution--has been widely studied across various graph classes, with most previous work emphasizing the dichotomy between polynomial and exponential mixing times, with a particular focus on sparse classes of graphs.
  Inspired by the modern fine-grained approach to computational complexity, we investigate subexponential mixing times of the Glauber dynamics on geometric intersection graphs, such as disk graphs. We also study parameterized mixing times by focusing on two structural parameters that can remain small even in dense graphs: the tree independence number and the path independence number. We show that Glauber dynamics mixes in polynomial time on graphs with bounded path independence number and in quasi-polynomial time when the tree independence number is bounded. Moreover, we prove both bounds are tight, revealing a clear separation between the two parameters.
  This work provides a simple and efficient algorithm for sampling from the hard-core model. Unlike classical approaches that rely explicitly on geometric representations or on constructing decompositions such as tree decompositions or separator trees, our analysis only requires their existence to establish mixing time bounds--these structures are not used directly by the algorithm itself.</description>

      <title>Light Edge Fault Tolerant Graph Spanners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There has recently been significant interest in fault tolerant spanners, which are spanners that still maintain their stretch guarantees after some nodes or edges fail. This work has culminated in an almost complete understanding of the three-way tradeoff between stretch, sparsity, and number of faults tolerated. However, despite some progress in metric settings, there have been no results to date on the tradeoff in general graphs between stretch, lightness, and number of faults tolerated.
  We initiate the study of light edge fault tolerant (EFT) graph spanners, obtaining the first such results. First, we observe that lightness can be unbounded if we use the traditional definition (normalizing by the MST). We then argue that a natural definition of fault-tolerant lightness is to instead normalize by a min-weight fault tolerant connectivity preserver; essentially, a fault-tolerant version of the MST. However, even with this, we show that it is still not generally possible to construct $f$-EFT spanners whose weight compares reasonably to the weight of a min-weight $f$-EFT connectivity preserver.
  In light of this lower bound, it is natural to then consider bicriteria notions of lightness, where we compare the weight of an $f$-EFT spanner to a min-weight $(f' &gt; f)$-EFT connectivity preserver. The most interesting question is to determine the minimum value of $f'$ that allows for reasonable lightness upper bounds. Our main result is a precise answer to this question: $f' = 2f$. In particular, we show that the lightness can be untenably large (roughly $n/k$ for a $k$-spanner) if one normalizes by the min-weight $(2f-1)$-EFT connectivity preserver. But if one normalizes by the min-weight $2f$-EFT connectivity preserver, then we show that the lightness is bounded by just $O(f^{1/2})$ times the non-fault tolerant lightness (roughly $n^{1/k}$, for a $(1+\epsilon)(2k-1)$-spanner).</description>

      <title>On graphs with a simple structure of maximal cliques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We say that a hereditary graph class $\mathcal{G}$ is \emph{clique-sparse} if there is a constant $k=k(\mathcal{G})$ such that for every graph $G\in\mathcal{G}$, every vertex of $G$ belongs to at most $k$ maximal cliques, and any maximal clique of $G$ can be intersected in at most $k$ different ways by other maximal cliques.
  We provide various characterisations of clique-sparse graph classes, including a list of five parametric forbidden induced subgraphs. We show that recent techniques for proving induced analogues of Menger's Theorem and the Grid Theorem of Robertson and Seymour can be lifted to prove induced variants in clique-sparse graph classes when replacing ``treewidth'' by ''tree-independence number''.</description>
