      <title>Electron scattering on $^4$He from coupled-cluster theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a coupled-cluster calculation for the electron-$^4$He scattering in the region of the quasi-elastic peak. We show the longitudinal and transverse responses separately, and discuss results within two distinct theoretical methods: the Lorentz integral transform and spectral functions. The comparison between them allows to investigate the role of final state interactions, two-body currents and relativistic effects.</description>

      <title>Opportunities and open questions in modern $\beta$ decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For well over half a century, precision studies of neutron and nuclear $\beta$ decays have been at the forefront of searches for exotic electroweak physics. Recent advances in nuclear ab initio theory and the widespread use of effective field theories means that its modern understanding is going through a transitional phase. This has been propelled by current tensions in the global data set leading to renewed scrutiny of its theoretical ingredients. In parallel, a host of novel techniques and methods are being investigated that are able to sidestep many traditional systematic uncertainties and require a diverse palette of skills and collaboration with material science and condensed matter physics. We highlight the current opportunities and open questions with the aim of facilitating the transition to a more modern understanding of $\beta$ decay.</description>

      <title>Effect of the charge asymmetry and orbital angular momentum in the entrance channel on the hindrance to complete fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hindrance to complete fusion is studied as a function of the charge asymmetry of colliding nuclei and orbital angular momentum of the collision. The formation and evolution of a dinuclear system (DNS) in the heavy ion collisions at energies near the Coulomb barrier is calculated in the framework of the DNS model. The DNS evolution is considered as nucleon transfer between its fragments. The results prove that a hindrance at formation of a compound nucleus (CN) is related with the quasifission process which is breakup of the DNS into products instead to reach the equilibrated state of the CN. The role of the angular momentum in the charge (mass) distribution of the reaction products for the given mass asymmetry of the colliding nuclei has been demonstrated. The results of this work have been compared with the measured data for the quasifission yields in the $^{12}$C+$^{204}$Pb and $^{48}$Ca+$^{168}$Er reactions to show the role of the mass asymmetry of the entrance channel.</description>

      <title>Nuclear coherent $\pi^0$ photoproduction with charge-exchange and spin-flip rescattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present an updated model for nuclear $\pi^0$ photoproduction, which incorporates pion second-order rescattering on intermediate excited nuclear states. Our approach is based on the distorted wave impulse approximation in momentum space. The many-body medium effects are incorporated in the complex effective $\Delta$ self-energy, employing the results of the recently developed second-order pion-nucleus scattering potential. The experimental data for ${}^{12}$C and ${}^{40}$Ca are successfully described without the need to fit the model parameters of the photoproduction amplitude as a result of incorporating the second-order part of nuclear photoproduction potential, which involves intermediate nucleon spin-flip and charge exchange.</description>

      <title>The collisional energy loss of a heavy-quark in a semi-quark-gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By utilizing a background field effective theory, we compute the collisional energy loss of a heavy-quark moving through a semi-quark-gluon plasma characterized by nontrivial holonomy for Polyakov loops. We consider the elastic scatterings between the incident heavy-quark and the thermal partons with both hard and soft momentum transfers. Our results show that the heavy-quark energy loss is significantly suppressed in the semi-quark-gluon plasma due to a background field that is self-consistently generated in the effective theory. On the other hand, the suppression strongly depends on the temperature of the plasma which becomes negligible above 2~3 times the critical temperature. For a realistic coupling constant, ignoring a relatively weak dependence on the heavy-quark velocity, the suppression on the collisional energy loss can be approximated by an overall factor determined solely by the background field.</description>

      <title>Energy loss of a heavy fermion in a collisional QED plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the energy loss of heavy fermions moving in a plasma, taking into account the modification of the photon collective modes induced by collisions using a Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook collisional kernel. We include contributions from both hard and soft scatterings of the heavy fermion using a collisionally modified hard-thermal-loop resummed propagator. Using this method, one does not need to introduce a separation scale between hard- and soft-momentum exchanges. To place our calculation in context, we review other theoretical approaches to computing the collisional energy loss of fermions and discuss the systematics and results obtained in each approach compared to using a resummed propagator for both hard and soft momentum exchanges. Our final results indicate that self-consistently including the effect of collisions in the self-energies of the resummed propagator results in an increased energy loss compared to using collisionless hard-thermal-loop propagators. The effect becomes larger as the magnitude of the coupling constant and the velocity of the fermion increase.</description>

      <title>SPINAS: Spinor Amplitude Subroutines for Constructive Diagram Evaluations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SPINAS is a C++ package created for the implementation and numerical computation of phase-space points of constructive amplitudes in particle physics. This package contains a suite of classes and methods for handling particles, propagators, spinor products, and processes. SPINAS is structured to offer straightforward usability while ensuring maximum efficiency. This is achieved through a design that emphasizes the storage and reuse of intermediate results within amplitude calculations for each phase-space point. We include a user guide describing how to use the components, a complete example of how to use SPINAS for a scattering amplitude, a discussion of the design and implementation useful for those wishing to contribute, and a discussion of our validation of this package, including both a validation of individual components of the package and a comparison of a complete set of Standard Model processes with Feynman diagrams.</description>

      <title>Nucleon charge and magnetisation distributions: flavour separation and zeroes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A symmetry-preserving truncation of the quantum field equations describing hadron properties is used to deliver parameter-free predictions for all nucleon elastic electromagnetic form factors and their flavour separation to large values of momentum transfer, $Q^2$. The proton electric form factor, $G_E^p$, possesses a zero, whereas that of the neutron, $G_E^n$, does not. The difference owes to the behaviour of the Pauli form factor of the proton's singly-represented valence $d$-quark. Consequently, $G_E^n&gt;G_E^p$ on a material large-$Q^2$ domain. These predictions can be tested in modern experiments.</description>

      <title>First identification of a doublet wobbling excitation mode in $^{105}$Pd</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An experimental investigation of $^{105}$Pd has revealed, for the first time, the existence of two wobbling bands both having one phonon configuration and originating from the coupling of the wobbling phonon to the ground state band and to its signature partner. The doublet one-phonon wobbling bands are, in turn, found to be the signature partner bands. These observations have been drawn from the measured ratios of the inter-band and intra-band gamma transition rates. The model calculations based on the triaxial projected shell model (TPSM) approach have been performed and are found to be in good agreement with the experimental observations. These calculations provide an insight into the nature of the observed structures at a microscopic level.</description>

      <title>Variance Minimisation of the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick Model on a Quantum Computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing can potentially provide advantages for specific computational tasks. The simulation of fermionic systems is one such task that lends itself well to quantum computation, with applications in nuclear physics and electronic systems. Here we present work in which we use a variance minimisation method to find the full spectrum of energy eigenvalues of the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model; an exactly-solvable nuclear shell model-type system. We perform these calculations using both quantum simulators and real quantum hardware accessed via IBM cloud-based quantum computers. Using these IBM quantum computers we are able to obtain all eigenvalues for the cases of three and seven fermions (nucleons) in the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model.</description>

      <title>BHAC-QGP: three-dimensional MHD simulations of relativistic heavy-ion collisions, I. Methods and tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present BHAC-QGP, a new numerical code to simulate the evolution of matter created in heavy-ion collisions in the presence of electromagnetic fields. It is derived from the Black Hole Accretion Code (BHAC), which has been designed to model astrophysical processes in a general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamical description. As the original Black Hole Accretion Code, BHAC-QGP benefits from the use of Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR), which allows us to dynamically adjust the resolution where necessary, and makes use of time-dependent Milne coordinates and the ultrarelativistic equation of state, $P = e/3$. We demonstrate that BHAC-QGP accurately passes a number of systematic and rigorous tests.</description>

      <title>BHAC-QGP: three-dimensional MHD simulations of relativistic heavy-ion collisions, II. Application to Au-Au collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present BHAC-QGP, a new numerical code to simulate the evolution of matter created in heavy-ion collisions. BHAC-QGP is based on the Black Hole Accretion Code (BHAC), which has been designed to model astrophysical processes through the solution of the equations of general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics. Like the mother code, BHAC-QGP uses Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR), which allows for a dynamic adjustment of the resolution in regions of the computational domain where a particularly high accuracy is needed. We here discuss a number of applications of BHAC-QGP to Au-Au collisions at Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) energies and show that the code is able to reproduce results of other simulations of these scenarios, but with much higher accuracy.</description>

      <title>Momentum Shell in Quarkyonic Matter from Explicit Duality: A Dual Model for Cold, Dense QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.04304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a model of cold QCD matter that bridges nuclear and quark matter through the duality relation between quarks and baryons. The baryon number and energy densities are expressed as functionals of either the baryon momentum distribution, $f_{\rm B}$, or the quark distribution, $f_{\rm Q}$, which are subject to the constraints on fermions, $0 \le f_{\rm B,Q} \le 1$. The theory is ideal in the sense that the confinement of quarks into baryons is reflected in the duality relation between $f_{\rm Q}$ and $f_{\rm B}$, while other possible interactions among quarks and baryons are all neglected. The variational problem with the duality constraints is formulated and we explicitly construct analytic solutions, finding two distinct regimes: A nuclear matter regime at low density and a Quarkyonic regime at high density. In the Quarkyonic regime, baryons underoccupy states at low momenta but form a momentum shell with $f_{\rm B}=1$ on top of a quark Fermi sea. Such a theory describes a rapid transition from a soft nuclear equation of state to a stiff Quarkyonic equation of state. At this transition, there is a rapid increase in the pressure.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamization in hybrid Bjorken flow attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.05480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hybrid fluid models, consisting of two sectors with more weakly and more strongly self-interacting degrees of freedom coupled consistently as in the semi-holographic framework, have been shown to exhibit an attractor surface for Bjorken flow. Retaining only the simple viscid fluid descriptions of both sectors, we find that, on the attractor surface, the hydrodynamization times of both subsectors decrease with increasing total energy density at the respective point of hydrodynamization following a conformal scaling, reach their minimum values, and subsequently rise rapidly. The minimum values are obtained when the respective energy densities are of the order of the inverse of the dimensionful inter-system coupling. Restricting to attractor curves which can be matched to glasma models at a time set by the saturation scale for both $p$-$p$ and Pb-Pb collisions, we find that the more weakly coupled sector hydrodynamizes much later, and the strongly coupled sector hydrodynamizes earlier in $p$-$p$ collisions, since the total energy densities at the respective hydrodynamization times of these sectors fall inside and outside of the conformal window. This holds true also for phenomenologically relevant solutions that are significantly away from the attractor surface at the time we match to glasma models.</description>

      <title>Target mass corrections in lepton--nucleus DIS: theory and applications to nuclear PDFs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.07715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the wide range of kinematics covered by current and planned deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) facilities, we revisit the formalism, practical implementation, and numerical impact of target mass corrections (TMCs) for DIS on unpolarized nuclear targets. An important aspect is that we only use nuclear and later partonic degrees of freedom, carefully avoiding a picture of the nucleus in terms of nucleons. After establishing that formulae used for individual nucleon targets $(p,n)$, derived in the Operator Product Expansion (OPE) formalism, are indeed applicable to nuclear targets, we rewrite expressions for nuclear TMCs in terms of \mbox{re-scaled} (or averaged) kinematic variables. As a consequence, we find a representation for nuclear TMCs that is approximately independent of the nuclear target. We go on to construct a single-parameter fit for all nuclear targets that is in good numerical agreement with full computations of TMCs. We discuss in detail qualitative and quantitative differences between nuclear TMCs built in the OPE and the parton model formalisms, as well as give numerical predictions for current and future facilities.</description>

      <title>Multi-charmed and singled charmed hadrons from coalescence: yields and ratios in different collision systems at LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.03687v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the production of charmed and multi-charmed hadrons in ultra-relativistic Heavy Ion Collisions coupling the transport approach for charm dynamics in the medium to an hybrid hadronization model of coalescence plus fragmentation. In this paper, we mainly discuss the particle yields for single charmed and multi-charmed baryons focusing mainly on the production of $\Xi_{cc}$ and $\Omega_{ccc}$. We provide first predictions for PbPb collision in 0-10% centrality class and then we explore the system size dependence through KrKr, to ArAr and OO collisions, planned within the ALICE3 experiment. In these cases, a monotonic behavior for the yields emerges which can be tested in future experimental data. We found about three order of magnitude increase in the production of $\Omega_{ccc}$ in PbPb collisions compared with the yield in small collision systems like OO collisions. Furthermore, we investigate the effects on the $\Omega_{ccc}$ particle production and spectra coming from the modification of the charm quark distribution due to the different size of the collision systems comparing also to the case of thermalized charm distributions. These results suggest that observation on the $\Omega_{ccc}$ spectra and their evolution across system size can give information about the partial thermalization of the charm quark distribution as well as to its wave function width.</description>

      <title>Configurational entropy and the $N^*(1440)$ Roper resonance in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.05413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The electroexcitation of the ${\cal N}^*(1440)$ Roper resonance, which defines the first radially excited state of the nucleon, is examined within the soft-wall AdS/QCD model. Such excited Fock states are characterized by the leading three-quark component, which determines the main properties of Roper resonance. The differential configurational entropy (DCE) was used in the nuclear interaction with a gauge vector field for ${\cal N}^*(1440)$ transition. Comparing the main results with the recent data of the CLAS Collaboration at JLab shows a good agreement on the accuracy of the computed data.</description>

      <title>Production of true para-muonium in linearly polarized photon fusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: True muonium (TM) -- the bound state of $\mu^+\mu^-$ -- has not been discovered yet. It was demonstrated that searching for TM via $\gamma\gamma$ fusions in heavy ion collisions is feasible due to the enhancement of the atom number. We study the production of the true para-muonium (pTM) in the collisions of linearly polarized photons in the experiments of heavy-ion collisions, calculate the production rate as well as the transverse spectrum of pTM, and explore the discovery potential in nuclear experiments. Our results show that there is a significant correlation between the linearly polarized photon distribution and the transverse momentum distribution of pTM. The optimal kinematic region of the generated pTM is identified, which can provide a theoretical guide to the detection of pTM in experiments.</description>

      <title>Next-to-eikonal corrections to dijet production in Deep Inelastic Scattering in the dilute limit of the Color Glass Condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the effects of next-to-eikonal corrections on dijet production in Deep Inelastic Scattering off nuclear targets in the framework of the Color Glass Condensate. They require the knowledge of correlators of fields in the target beyond those computed in the standard McLerran-Venugopalan model, specifically those between transverse and boost-enhanced components, and of the recoil of the fields. We neglect the latter, while for the former we develop a linear model valid for large nuclei. We considered the unpolarized cross sections for dijet production in the approximation of a homogenous dilute nucleus, obtaining simple analytic expressions for the cross sections at nex-to-eikonal accuracy, valid in the limit of total dijet momentum and dijet momentum imbalance larger than the saturation scale of the nucleus. We perform a numerical study of the results at energies of the Electron Ion Collider, finding $\mathcal{O}(10\%)$ effects in the cross sections at large total momentum. We also analyze the azimuthal asymmetries between total momentum and imbalance, finding that non-eikonal corrections induce odd azimuthal harmonics for the situation of jets with equal momentum fractions from the virtual photon, where they are absent in the eikonal approximation. Finally, in the eikonal approximation we have compared the results of our analytic expansion valid in the dilute limit of the target, and the full Color Glass Condensate results in the McLerran-Venugopalan model and their correlation limit. Our analytic expressions match the correlation limit ones in the region where both should be simultaneously valid and reproduce very well the full Color Glass Condensate results in its validity region.</description>

      <title>Simulating Meson Scattering on Spin Quantum Simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Studying high-energy collisions of composite particles, such as hadrons and nuclei, is an outstanding goal for quantum simulators. However, preparation of hadronic wave packets has posed a significant challenge, due to the complexity of hadrons and the precise structure of wave packets. This has limited demonstrations of hadron scattering on quantum simulators to date. Observations of confinement and composite excitations in quantum spin systems have opened up the possibility to explore scattering dynamics in spin models. In this article, we develop two methods to create entangled spin states corresponding to wave packets of composite particles in analog quantum simulators of Ising spin Hamiltonians. One wave-packet preparation method uses the blockade effect enabled by beyond-nearest-neighbor Ising spin interactions. The other method utilizes a quantum-bus-mediated exchange, such as the native spin-phonon coupling in trapped-ion arrays. With a focus on trapped-ion simulators, we numerically benchmark both methods and show that high-fidelity wave packets can be achieved in near-term experiments. We numerically study scattering of wave packets for experimentally realizable parameters in the Ising model and find inelastic-scattering regimes, corresponding to particle production in the scattering event, with prominent and distinct experimental signals. Our proposal, therefore, demonstrates the potential of observing inelastic scattering in near-term quantum simulators.</description>
