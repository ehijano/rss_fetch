      <title>Direct Evidence Of Apex Hypha Interactions During Vegetative Growth Of Fungal Thallus Via Comprehensive Network And Trajectory Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mycelium of a filamentous fungus is a growing, branching network of numerous entangled hyphae exhibiting polarised apical growth. Expansion occurs during the vegetative phase from a single ascospore, driven by the need to explore and occupy surrounding space limiting competitors, enhancing nutrient uptake, and promoting spore dispersal. Radial, rapid, and rectilinear growth combined with frequent branching appears adaptive. However, passive growth without interactions or feedback may produce suboptimal networks, as neither local density nor potential connectivity is considered. Reorientations of the apex near existing hyphae suggest apex hypha feedback. Yet, the diversity of behaviours, spontaneous fluctuations, and limited apical trajectories studied leave open the question of active regulation. To investigate possible apex hypha interactions, we analyse a dataset of Podospora anserina thallus growth by reconstructing all apical trajectories postbranching and fitting them with a classical Langevin model that incorporates potential interactions. Comparing isolated and nonisolated hyphae trajectories allows to identify a clear signature of interaction composed of abrupt deceleration and reorientation. This work opens the path towards a systematic exploration of hyphal interactions.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised learning predicts plant growth trajectories from multi-modal industrial greenhouse data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantifying organism-level phenotypes, such as growth dynamics and biomass accumulation, is fundamental to understanding agronomic traits and optimizing crop production. However, quality growing data of plants at scale is difficult to generate. Here we use a mobile robotic platform to capture high-resolution environmental sensing and phenotyping measurements of a large-scale hydroponic leafy greens system. We describe a self-supervised modeling approach to build a map from observed growing data to the entire plant growth trajectory. We demonstrate our approach by forecasting future plant height and harvest mass of crops in this system. This approach represents a significant advance in combining robotic automation and machine learning, as well as providing actionable insights for agronomic research and operational efficiency.</description>

      <title>PAST: A multimodal single-cell foundation model for histopathology and spatial transcriptomics in cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While pathology foundation models have transformed cancer image analysis, they often lack integration with molecular data at single-cell resolution, limiting their utility for precision oncology. Here, we present PAST, a pan-cancer single-cell foundation model trained on 20 million paired histopathology images and single-cell transcriptomes spanning multiple tumor types and tissue contexts. By jointly encoding cellular morphology and gene expression, PAST learns unified cross-modal representations that capture both spatial and molecular heterogeneity at the cellular level. This approach enables accurate prediction of single-cell gene expression, virtual molecular staining, and multimodal survival analysis directly from routine pathology slides. Across diverse cancers and downstream tasks, PAST consistently exceeds the performance of existing approaches, demonstrating robust generalizability and scalability. Our work establishes a new paradigm for pathology foundation models, providing a versatile tool for high-resolution spatial omics, mechanistic discovery, and precision cancer research.</description>

      <title>Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration is not associated with mental health among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples in Australia: a cross-sectional exploratory study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: To investigate the association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration and mental health, measured using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale 5 (K5), among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples. Methods: We used cross-sectional data from the 2012-2013 Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Survey. Multiple linear regression was used to test the association between serum 25(OH)D concentration and K5, adjusting for age, sex, education, remoteness, socioeconomic status, season of blood collection, smoking, and alcohol intake (n = 1,983). We also stratified the analysis by sex and by remoteness. Results: There was no statistically significant association between serum 25(OH) concentration and K5 in the total population, nor when stratified by sex. When stratified by remoteness, higher serum 25(OH)D concentration was statistically significantly associated with lower K5 scores among those living remotely (adjusted \b{eta}: -0.18; 95% CI: -0.35, -0.01). Conclusions: Serum 25(OH)D concentration was inversely associated with psychological distress only among those living remotely. Implications for Public Health: Given the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and the observed association between serum 25(OH)D concentration and psychological distress among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples living remotely, public health strategies to improve vitamin D status among this population group are warranted.</description>

      <title>DeepRetro: Retrosynthetic Pathway Discovery using Iterative LLM Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrosynthesis, the identification of precursor molecules for a target compound, is pivotal for synthesizing complex molecules, but faces challenges in discovering novel pathways beyond predefined templates. Recent large language model (LLM) approaches to retrosynthesis have shown promise but effectively harnessing LLM reasoning capabilities for effective multi-step planning remains an open question. To address this challenge, we introduce DeepRetro, an open-source, iterative, hybrid LLM-based retrosynthetic framework. Our approach integrates the strengths of conventional template-based/Monte Carlo tree search tools with the generative power of LLMs in a step-wise, feedback-driven loop. Initially, synthesis planning is attempted with a template-based engine. If this fails, the LLM subsequently proposes single-step retrosynthetic disconnections. Crucially, these suggestions undergo rigorous validity, stability, and hallucination checks before the resulting precursors are recursively fed back into the pipeline for further evaluation. This iterative refinement allows for dynamic pathway exploration and correction. We demonstrate the potential of this pipeline through benchmark evaluations and case studies, showcasing its ability to identify viable and potentially novel retrosynthetic routes. In particular, we develop an interactive graphical user interface that allows expert human chemists to provide human-in-the-loop feedback to the reasoning algorithm. This approach successfully generates novel pathways for complex natural product compounds, demonstrating the potential for iterative LLM reasoning to advance state-of-art in complex chemical syntheses.</description>

      <title>eegFloss: A Python package for refining sleep EEG recordings using machine learning models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) allows monitoring of brain activity, providing insights into the functional dynamics of various brain regions and their roles in cognitive processes. EEG is a cornerstone in sleep research, serving as the primary modality of polysomnography, the gold standard in the field. However, EEG signals are prone to artifacts caused by both internal (device-specific) factors and external (environmental) interferences. As sleep studies are becoming larger, most rely on automatic sleep staging, a process highly susceptible to artifacts, leading to erroneous sleep scores. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing eegFloss, an open-source Python package to utilize eegUsability, a novel machine learning (ML) model designed to detect segments with artifacts in sleep EEG recordings. eegUsability has been trained and evaluated on manually artifact-labeled EEG data collected from 15 participants over 127 nights using the Zmax headband. It demonstrates solid overall classification performance (F1-score is approximately 0.85, Cohens kappa is 0.78), achieving a high recall rate of approximately 94% in identifying channel-wise usable EEG data, and extends beyond Zmax. Additionally, eegFloss offers features such as automatic time-in-bed detection using another ML model named eegMobility, filtering out certain artifacts, and generating hypnograms and sleep statistics. By addressing a fundamental challenge faced by most sleep studies, eegFloss can enhance the precision and rigor of their analysis as well as the accuracy and reliability of their outcomes.</description>

      <title>PLAME: Leveraging Pretrained Language Models to Generate Enhanced Protein Multiple Sequence Alignments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protein structure prediction is essential for drug discovery and understanding biological functions. While recent advancements like AlphaFold have achieved remarkable accuracy, most folding models rely heavily on multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) to boost prediction performance. This dependency limits their effectiveness on low-homology proteins and orphan proteins, where MSA information is sparse or unavailable. To address this limitation, we propose PLAME, a novel MSA design model that leverages evolutionary embeddings from pretrained protein language models. Unlike existing methods, PLAME introduces pretrained representations to enhance evolutionary information and employs a conservation-diversity loss to enhance generation quality. Additionally, we propose a novel MSA selection method to effectively screen high-quality MSAs and improve folding performance. We also propose a sequence quality assessment metric that provides an orthogonal perspective to evaluate MSA quality. On the AlphaFold2 benchmark of low-homology and orphan proteins, PLAME achieves state-of-the-art performance in folding enhancement and sequence quality assessment, with consistent improvements demonstrated on AlphaFold3. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the MSA selection method, while extensive case studies on various protein types provide insights into the relationship between AlphaFold's prediction quality and MSA characteristics. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PLAME can serve as an adapter achieving AlphaFold2-level accuracy with the ESMFold's inference speed.</description>

      <title>The effect of local ventilation on a spatiotemporal model of airborne disease transmission in indoor spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We incorporate local ventilation effects into a spatially dependent generalisation of the Wells--Riley model for airborne disease transmission. Aerosol production and removal through ventilation, biological deactivation, and gravitational settling as well as transport around a recirculating air-conditioning flow and turbulent mixing are modelled using an advection--diffusion--reaction equation. The local ventilation model, motivated by air purifiers, is compared with the global ventilation model for a weak purifier (CADR = 140 m$^3$h$^{-1}$) and a strong purifier (CADR = 1,000 m$^3$h$^{-1}$). We find that, as expected, increasing the distance of the infectious person from the purifier reduces the aerosol concentration. Moreover, the concentration is generally lowest when the infectious person is upstream of the purifier, located in regions where the airflow streamlines are directed into the purifier inlet. For these infectious source locations, the global ventilation model significantly overestimates the concentration throughout the room. For infectious sources outside of these regions, there is generally good agreement between the models, particularly for the weak purifier. We also studied, for fixed distance from the purifier, how the infection risk to a susceptible person varies as the infectious person changes location. The infection risk is greatest when the susceptible person is directly downstream of the infectious person. There is better agreement between local and global ventilation models for the weak purifier than the strong purifier.</description>

      <title>A Benchmark for Quantum Chemistry Relaxations via Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computational quantum chemistry plays a critical role in drug discovery, chemical synthesis, and materials science. While first-principles methods, such as density functional theory (DFT), provide high accuracy in modeling electronic structures and predicting molecular properties, they are computationally expensive. Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have emerged as promising surrogate models that aim to achieve DFT-level accuracy while enabling efficient large-scale atomistic simulations. The development of accurate and transferable MLIPs requires large-scale, high-quality datasets with both energy and force labels. Critically, MLIPs must generalize not only to stable geometries but also to intermediate, non-equilibrium conformations encountered during atomistic simulations. In this work, we introduce PubChemQCR, a large-scale dataset of molecular relaxation trajectories curated from the raw geometry optimization outputs of the PubChemQC project. PubChemQCR is the largest publicly available dataset of DFT-based relaxation trajectories for small organic molecules, comprising approximately 3.5 million trajectories and over 300 million molecular conformations computed at various levels of theory. Each conformation is labeled with both total energy and atomic forces, making the dataset suitable for training and evaluating MLIPs. To provide baselines for future developments, we benchmark nine representative MLIP models on the dataset. Our resources are publicly available at https://huggingface.co/divelab</description>

      <title>ADPv2: A Hierarchical Histological Tissue Type-Annotated Dataset for Potential Biomarker Discovery of Colorectal Disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computational pathology (CoPath) leverages histopathology images to enhance diagnostic precision and reproducibility in clinical pathology. However, publicly available datasets for CoPath that are annotated with extensive histological tissue type (HTT) taxonomies at a granular level remain scarce due to the significant expertise and high annotation costs required. Existing datasets, such as the Atlas of Digital Pathology (ADP), address this by offering diverse HTT annotations generalized to multiple organs, but limit the capability for in-depth studies on specific organ diseases. Building upon this foundation, we introduce ADPv2, a novel dataset focused on gastrointestinal histopathology. Our dataset comprises 20,004 image patches derived from healthy colon biopsy slides, annotated according to a hierarchical taxonomy of 32 distinct HTTs of 3 levels. Furthermore, we train a multilabel representation learning model following a two-stage training procedure on our ADPv2 dataset. We leverage the VMamba architecture and achieving a mean average precision (mAP) of 0.88 in multilabel classification of colon HTTs. Finally, we show that our dataset is capable of an organ-specific in-depth study for potential biomarker discovery by analyzing the model's prediction behavior on tissues affected by different colon diseases, which reveals statistical patterns that confirm the two pathological pathways of colon cancer development. Our dataset is publicly available at https://zenodo.org/records/15307021</description>
