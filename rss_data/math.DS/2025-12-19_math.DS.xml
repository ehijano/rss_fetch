      <title>A discrete one-species chemostat model with delayed response in the growth and non-constant supply</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A non-autonomous discrete delayed system for a one-species chemostat based on an Ellermeyer model for the continuous case is studied. Conditions for the persistence or the extinction of the solutions are obtained respectively in terms of the lower and upper Bohl exponents for a scalar linear equation associated to the problem. Furthermore, the condition for persistence also implies the attractiveness, that is, the existence of a bounded solution that attracts all the others. As a special case, when the nutrient supply is $\omega$-periodic, the picture is complete: the condition for persistence implies the existence of an attractive non-trivial $\omega$-periodic solution, while non-persistence implies extinction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is studying the problem of almost periodicity of almost periodic lattice dynamical systems of the form $u_{i}'=\nu (u_{i-1}-2u_i+u_{i+1})-\lambda u_{i}+F(u_i)+f_{i}(t)\ (i\in \mathbb Z,\ \lambda &gt;0)$. We prove the existence a unique almost periodic solution of this system if the nonlinearity $F$ is monotone.</description>

      <title>Information theory and discriminative sampling for model discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fisher information and Shannon entropy are fundamental tools for understanding and analyzing dynamical systems from complementary perspectives. They can characterize unknown parameters by quantifying the information contained in variables, or measure how different initial trajectories or temporal segments of a trajectory contribute to learning or inferring system dynamics. In this work, we leverage the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) within the data-driven framework of {\em sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics} (SINDy). We visualize information patterns in chaotic and non-chaotic systems for both single trajectories and multiple initial conditions, demonstrating how information-based analysis can improve sampling efficiency and enhance model performance by prioritizing more informative data. The benefits of statistical bagging are further elucidated through spectral analysis of the FIM. We also illustrate how Fisher information and entropy metrics can promote data efficiency in three scenarios: when only a single trajectory is available, when a tunable control parameter exists, and when multiple trajectories can be freely initialized. As data-driven model discovery continues to gain prominence, principled sampling strategies guided by quantifiable information metrics offer a powerful approach for improving learning efficiency and reducing data requirements.</description>

      <title>Local Lyapunov Analysis via Micro-Ensembles: finite-time Lyapunov exponent Estimation and KNN-Based Predictive Comparison in Complex-Valued BAM Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finite-time Lyapunov exponents (FTLEs) quantify short-horizon trajectory divergence and provide a local, spatially resolved view of transient instabilities and synchronization behavior in nonlinear dynamics. This work studies a class of fractional-order complex-valued bidirectional associative memory (BAM) neural networks and proposes a unified analytical and data-driven framework for synchronization and local stability assessment. Using fractional Lyapunov stability theory together with Mittag-Leffler functions, sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee global Mittag-Leffler synchronization of the drive-response systems under a linear error-feedback controller. In addition, an explicit conservative time-to-tolerance estimate is obtained via a standard upper bound on the Mittag-Leffler function. Numerical simulations corroborate the theory and demonstrate rapid decay of synchronization errors in both real and imaginary state components. To complement the model-based guarantees, two trajectory-driven Lyapunov proxies are introduced: (i) micro-ensemble FTLE estimation based on the geometric-mean growth of small perturbations, and (ii) a k-nearest neighbors (kNN) prediction-error index that quantifies local instability through short-term forecast errors. Both proxies reveal oscillatory transient divergence patterns and consistently reflect the stabilizing effect of the designed controller. The proposed integration of fractional calculus, synchronization control, and data-driven Lyapunov diagnostics provides a robust methodology for complex-valued fractional-order neural networks, with potential applications in secure communications and nonlinear signal processing.</description>

      <title>Emergence of higher-order interactions in systems of coupled Kuramoto oscillators with time delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms that govern collective synchronization is a paramount task in nonlinear dynamics. While higher-order (many-body) interactions have recently emerged as a powerful framework for capturing collective behaviors, real-world examples regarding dynamics remain scarce. Here, we show that higher-order interactions naturally emerge from time-delayed pairwise coupling in Kuramoto oscillators. By expanding the delay term up to second order in the coupling strength, we derive an effective Kuramoto model featuring both two-body and three-body interactions, but without delay, hence, easier to be analyzed. Numerical simulations show that this reduced model can reproduce the bistability and synchronization transitions of the original time-delayed system. Furthermore, applying the Ott-Antonsen ansatz, we obtain a stability diagram for incoherent and synchronized states that closely matches the results of the original model. Our findings reveal that time delays can be effectively recast in the form of higher-order interactions, offering a new perspective on how delayed interactions shape the dynamics.</description>

      <title>On the existence of full dimensional KAM tori for 1D periodic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we will prove the existence of full dimensional tori for 1-dimensional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation \begin{eqnarray}\label{maineq0} \mathbf{i}u_{t}-u_{xx}+V*u+\epsilon f(x)|u|^{4}u=0,\ x\in\mathbb{T}=\mathbb{R}/2\pi\mathbb{Z}, \end{eqnarray} with boundary conditions, where $V*$ is the Fourier multiplier, and $f(x)$ is Gevrey smooth. Here the radius of the invariant tori satisfies a slower decay, i.e. \[ I_n\sim e^{-2\ln^{\sigma}|n|}, \mbox{as}\ n\rightarrow\infty, \] for any $ \sigma&gt; 2, $ which extends results of Bourgain \cite{BJFA2005} and Cong \cite{cong2024} to the case that the nonlinear perturbation depends explicitly on the space variable $x$.</description>

      <title>Nekhoroshev type stability for non-local semilinear Schr\"odinger equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates Nekhoroshev-type stability for solutions of ultra-differentiable regularity in Schr\"odinger equations with non-local nonlinear terms, employing the method of rational normal forms. We establish the first rigorous results for logarithmic ultra-differentiable regularity in infinite-dimensional Hamiltonian systems without external parameters. Under Gevrey class regularity assumptions, we achieve the stability times matching Bourgain's conjectured optimal stability time in \cite{B04}. Furthermore, we introduce a novel global vector field norm adapted to the rational normal form framework. This norm eliminate the need for degree tracking during the iteration process, thereby enabling a unified treatment of nonlinear terms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper combines the decay of high modes with the smallness introduced by high orders, leading to a normal form lemma for infinite-dimensional Hamiltonian systems under ultra-differentiable regularity. We prove the sub-exponential stability time of a wide class of Hamiltonian PDEs, including the Schr\"odinger equation with convolution potentials, fractional-order Schr\"odinger equations, and beam equations with metrics. When the conditions are equivalent to previous ones, the stability time we obtain reaches Bourgain's predicted optimal bound. Furthermore, we approach earlier results under lower conditions. These results are discussed within a general framework we propose, which applies to the ultra-differential class.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics a la Souriau on K\"ahler Non Compact Symmetric Spaces for Cartan Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we clarify several issues concerning the abstract geometrical formulation of thermodynamics on non compact symmetric spaces $\mathrm{U/H}$ that are the mathematical model of hidden layers in the new paradigm of Cartan Neural Networks. We introduce a distinction between the generalized thermodynamics associated with Dynamical Systems and the challenging proposal of Gibbs probability distributions on $\mathrm{U/H}$ provided by generalized thermodynamics {\`a} la Souriau. Main result is the proof that $\mathrm{U/H}$.s supporting Gibbs distributions are only the K\"ahler ones. For the latter, we solve the problem of determining the space of temperatures, namely of Lie algebra elements for which the partition function converges. The space of generalized temperatures is the orbit under the adjoint action of $\mathrm{U}$ of a positivity domain in the Cartan subalgebra $C_c\subset\mathbb{H}$ of the maximal compact subalgebra $\mathbb{H}\subset\mathbb{U}$. We illustrate how our explicit constructions for the Poincar\'e and Siegel planes might be extended to the whole class of Calabi-Vesentini manifolds utilizing Paint Group symmetry. Furthermore we claim that Rao's, Chentsov's, Amari's Information Geometry and the thermodynamical geometry of Ruppeiner and Lychagin are the very same thing. The most important property of the Gibbs probability distributions provided by the here introduced setup is their covariance with respect to the action of the full group of symmetries $\mathrm{U}$. The partition function is invariant against $\mathrm{U}$ transformations and the set of its arguments, namely the generalized temperatures, can be always reduced to a minimal set whose cardinality is equal to the rank of the compact denominator group $\mathrm{H}\subset \mathrm{U}$.</description>

      <title>Tiny Recursive Control: Iterative Reasoning for Efficient Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural network controllers increasingly demand millions of parameters, and language model approaches push into the billions. For embedded aerospace systems with strict power and latency constraints, this scaling is prohibitive. We present Tiny Recursive Control (TRC), a neural architecture based on a counterintuitive principle: capacity can emerge from iteration depth rather than parameter count. TRC applies compact networks (approximately 1.5M parameters) repeatedly through a two-level hierarchical latent structure, refining control sequences by simulating trajectories and correcting based on tracking error. Because the same weights process every refinement step, adding iterations increases computation without increasing memory. We evaluate TRC on nonlinear control problems including oscillator stabilization and powered descent with fuel constraints. Across these domains, TRC achieves near-optimal control costs while requiring only millisecond-scale inference on GPU and under 10~MB memory, two orders of magnitude smaller than language model baselines. These results demonstrate that recursive reasoning, previously confined to discrete tasks, transfers effectively to continuous control synthesis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the algebraic dynamics on Markov cubics generated by Vieta involutions, in the tropicalized setting. It turns out that there is an invariant subset of the tropicalized Markov cubic where the action by Vieta involutions can be modeled by that of $(\infty,\infty,\infty)$-triangle reflection group on the hyperbolic plane.
  This understanding of the tropicalized algebraic dynamics produces some results on Markov cubics over non-archimedean fields, including the existence of the Fatou domain and finitude of orbits with rational points having prime power denominators.</description>

Abstract: Given two H\"older potentials $\phi_+$ and $\psi_-$ for the unilateral shift, we define anisotropic Banach spaces of distributions on the bilateral shift space with a finite alphabet. On these spaces, the transfer operator for the bilateral shift is quasicompact with a spectral gap, and the unique Gibbs state associated with $\phi_+$ spans its $1$-eigenspace. This result allows us to establish exponential decay of correlations for H\"older observables and a wide range of measures on the bilateral shift space.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Borel liftings in complex analysis and PDE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish Borel equivariant analogues of several classical theorems from complex analysis and PDE. The starting point is an equivariant Weierstrass theorem for entire functions: there exists a Borel mapping which assigns to each non-periodic positive divisor $d$ an entire function $f_d$ with divisor of zeros $\mathrm{div}(f_d)=d$ and which commutes with translation, $f_{d-w}(z)=f_d(z+w)$. We also examine the existence of equivariant Borel right inverses for the distributional Laplacian, the heat operator, and the $\bar{\partial}$-operator on the space of smooth functions. We demonstrate that Borel equivariant inverses for these maps exist on the free part of the range. In general, the freeness assumptions cannot be omitted and Borelness cannot be strengthened to continuity. Our positive results follow from a theorem establishing sufficient conditions for the existence of equivariant Borel liftings. Two key ingredients are Runge-type approximation theorems and the existence of Borel toasts, which are Borel analogues of Rokhlin towers from ergodic theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09520v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For Anosov diffeomorphisms on the $3$-torus which are strongly partially hyperbolic with expanding center, we construct systems of strong unstable and center stable Margulis measures which are holonomy-invariant. This allows us to obtain a characterization of the measures of maximal unstable entropy in terms of their conditional measures along the strong unstable leaves. Moreover, we show that the Margulis systems identify with Pollicott-Ruelle (co)-resonant states for the action on 2-forms. This shows that the unstable topological entropy and a measure of maximal unstable entropy can be retrieved from the spectral approach.</description>

      <title>Empirical Laws for Iterated Correlation Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the discrete dynamical system obtained by repeatedly applying the Pearson correlation operator to a real matrix. Each step centers every row, normalizes each centered row to unit Euclidean norm, and forms the Gram matrix of the resulting rows. This produces a nonlinear map that underlies the classical CONCOR and GAP procedures. Despite its simple formulation and long history, the global behavior of this iteration has remained analytically unresolved.
  We present a geometric formulation that separates directions associated with changes in row means and row norms from directions that preserve them. This formulation clarifies why local analysis does not extend to a global convergence theorem: the iteration is nonlinear, the structure of its fixed-point set is not fully characterized, and standard uniform contractive or Fejer-type techniques do not directly apply.
  Empirically, the iteration stabilizes at a block plus or minus one pattern, exhibits finite total variation, and displays rapid decay once trajectories enter a neighborhood of a fixed pattern. We develop a dimension-uniform experimental framework and perform a large-scale numerical study over dimensions from 3 to 2000 with thousands of random initializations. Using the Frobenius step size, the entrywise step size, and the one-step ratio, we identify four universal empirical laws that persist uniformly across all tested dimensions. These observations provide a quantitative, dimension-uniform description of the iteration and formulate a precise target for future global analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1408.5805v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is an almost self-contained monograph (containing some new results) on left-orderable groups which mostly rely on dynamical and probabilistic aspects, but also on geometric, combinatorial, analytic, and topological ones.
  This new version contains many improvements, corrections and updates, many of them suggested by the referees and colleagues along the last years.</description>

      <title>Iterated function systems of holomorphic maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21124v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We unify and advance a host of works on iterated function systems of holomorphic self-maps of hyperbolic Riemann surfaces. Our foremost result is a generalisation to left iterated function systems of an unpublished and little known theorem of Heins on iteration in the unit disc. Applications abound -- to work of Benini et al. on transcendental dynamics, to the theory of hyperbolic steps of holomorphic maps, and to left semiconjugacy in the unit disc. We extend other work of Benini et al. and Ferreira on relatively compact left iterated function systems, and we prove a hyperbolic distance inequality for holomorphic maps that generalises a theorem of Bracci, Kraus, and Roth. Additionally, we strengthen results of the first author and Christodoulou on left iterated function systems, removing the need for Bloch domains, and we answer an open question from their work. Finally, we establish a version of the Heins theorem for right iterated functions systems, and we generalise theorems of Beardon and Kuznetsov on right iterated function systems in relatively compact semigroups of holomorphic maps.</description>

      <title>Degenerate symplectic fixed points and Gromov-Witten invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04191v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a connection between Gromov-Witten invariants and the number of fixed points of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms on a closed rational symplectic manifold via deformed Hamiltonian spectral invariants. We generalize Givental's symplectic fixed point theorem for Fano toric manifolds to closed rational symplectic manifolds which admit nonzero Gromov-Witten invariants with fixed marked points and one point insertion. We prove a new cuplength estimate of symplectic fixed points involved in deformed spectral invariants. We extend Schwarz's quantum cuplength to the notion of deformed quantum cuplength for symplectic periods and employ it to estimate the number of fixed points of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms on monotone symplectic manifolds with nonzero mixed Gromov-Witten invariants.</description>
