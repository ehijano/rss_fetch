      <title>Symmetry criteria for the equality of interior and exterior shape factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lienhard (2019) reported that the shape factor of the interior of a simply-connected region ($\Omega$) is equal to that of its exterior ($\mathbb{R}^2\backslash\Omega$) under the same boundary conditions. In that study, numerical examples supported the claim in particular cases; for example, it was shown that for certain boundary conditions on circles and squares, the conjecture holds. In the present paper, we show that the conjecture is not generally true, unless some additional condition is met. We proceed by elucidating why the conjecture does in fact hold in all of the examples analysed by Lienhard. We thus deduce a simple criterion which, when satisfied, ensures the equality of interior and exterior shape factors in general. Our criterion notably relies on a beautiful and little-known symmetry method due to Hersch (1982) which we introduce in a tutorial manner.</description>

      <title>Local smoothing for the Hermite wave equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show local smoothing estimates in $L^p$-spaces for solutions to the Hermite wave equation. For this purpose, we obtain a parametrix given by a Fourier Integral Operator, which we linearize. This leads us to analyze local smoothing estimates for solutions to Klein-Gordon equations. We show $\ell^2$-decoupling estimates adapted to the mass parameter to obtain local smoothing with essentially sharp derivative loss. In one dimension as consequence of square function estimates, we obtain estimates sharp up to endpoints. Finally, we elaborate on the implications of local smoothing estimates for Hermite Bochner--Riesz means.</description>

      <title>Complex generalized Gauss-Radau quadrature rules for Hankel transforms of integer order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex Gaussian quadrature rules for oscillatory integral transforms have the advantage that they can achieve optimal asymptotic order. However, their existence for Hankel transform can only be guaranteed when the order of the transform belongs to $[0,1/2]$. In this paper we consider the construction of generalized Gauss-Radau quadrature rules for Hankel transform. We show that, if adding certain value and derivative information at the left endpoint, then complex generalized Gauss-Radau quadrature rules for Hankel transform of integer order can be constructed with theoretical guarantees. Orthogonal polynomials that are closely related to such quadrature rules are investigated and their existence for even degrees is proved. Numerical experiments are presented to confirm our findings.</description>

      <title>Discretized sum-product type problems: Energy variants and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.02277v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide estimates for the additive discretized energy of \[\sum_{c\in C} |\{(a_1, a_2, b_1, b_2)\in A^2\times B^2: |(a_1 +cb_1) - (a_2 + cb_2)|\le \delta\}|_{\delta},\] that depend on non-concentration conditions of the sets. Our proof follows the Guth-Katz-Zahl approach (2021) with appropriate changes along the way clarifying and optimizing many of the steps. Several applications will also be discussed.</description>

      <title>Preserving positivity for rank-constrained matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.0042</link>
      <description>arXiv:1406.0042v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entrywise functions preserving the cone of positive semidefinite matrices have been studied by many authors, most notably by Schoenberg [Duke Math. J. 9, 1942] and Rudin [Duke Math. J. 26, 1959]. Following their work, it is well-known that entrywise functions preserving Loewner positivity in all dimensions are precisely the absolutely monotonic functions. However, there are strong theoretical and practical motivations to study functions preserving positivity in a fixed dimension $n$. Such characterizations for a fixed value of $n$ are difficult to obtain, and in fact are only known in the $2 \times 2$ case. In this paper, using a novel and intuitive approach, we study entrywise functions preserving positivity on distinguished submanifolds inside the cone obtained by imposing rank constraints. These rank constraints are prevalent in applications, and provide a natural way to relax the elusive original problem of preserving positivity in a fixed dimension. In our main result, we characterize entrywise functions mapping $n \times n$ positive semidefinite matrices of rank at most $l$ into positive semidefinite matrices of rank at most $k$ for $1 \leq l \leq n$ and $1 \leq k &lt; n$. We also demonstrate how an important necessary condition for preserving positivity by Horn and Loewner [Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 136, 1969] can be significantly generalized by adding rank constraints. Finally, our techniques allow us to obtain an elementary proof of the classical characterization of functions preserving positivity in all dimensions obtained by Schoenberg and Rudin.</description>
