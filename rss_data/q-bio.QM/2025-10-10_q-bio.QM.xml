      <title>Decoding the dark proteome: Deep learning-enabled discovery of druggable enzymes in Wuchereria bancrofti</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wuchereria bancrofti, the parasitic roundworm responsible for lymphatic filariasis, permanently disables over 36 million people and places 657 million at risk across 39 countries. A major bottleneck for drug discovery is the lack of functional annotation for more than 90 percent of the W. bancrofti dark proteome, leaving many potential targets unidentified. In this work, we present a novel computational pipeline that converts W. bancrofti's unannotated amino acid sequence data into precise four-level Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers and drug candidates. We utilized a DEtection TRansformer to estimate the probability of enzymatic function, fine-tuned a hierarchical nearest neighbor EC predictor on 4,476 labeled parasite proteins, and applied rejection sampling to retain only four-level EC classifications at 100 percent confidence. This pipeline assigned precise EC numbers to 14,772 previously uncharacterized proteins and discovered 543 EC classes not previously known in W. bancrofti. A qualitative triage emphasizing parasite-specific targets, chemical tractability, biochemical importance, and biological plausibility prioritized six enzymes across five separate strategies: anti-Wolbachia cell-wall inhibition, proteolysis blockade, transmission disruption, purinergic immune interference, and cGMP-signaling destabilization. We curated a 43-compound library from ChEMBL and BindingDB and co-folded across multiple protein conformers with Boltz-2. All six targets exhibited at least moderately strong predicted binding affinities below 1 micromolar, with moenomycin analogs against peptidoglycan glycosyltransferase and NTPase inhibitors showing promising nanomolar hits and well-defined binding pockets. While experimental validation remains essential, our results provide the first large-scale functional map of the W. bancrofti dark proteome and accelerate early-stage drug development for the species.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Surgical Data Imbalance with Dual-Prediction Video Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surgical video datasets are essential for scene understanding, enabling procedural modeling and intra-operative support. However, these datasets are often heavily imbalanced, with rare actions and tools under-represented, which limits the robustness of downstream models. We address this challenge with $SurgiFlowVid$, a sparse and controllable video diffusion framework for generating surgical videos of under-represented classes. Our approach introduces a dual-prediction diffusion module that jointly denoises RGB frames and optical flow, providing temporal inductive biases to improve motion modeling from limited samples. In addition, a sparse visual encoder conditions the generation process on lightweight signals (e.g., sparse segmentation masks or RGB frames), enabling controllability without dense annotations. We validate our approach on three surgical datasets across tasks including action recognition, tool presence detection, and laparoscope motion prediction. Synthetic data generated by our method yields consistent gains of 10-20% over competitive baselines, establishing $SurgiFlowVid$ as a promising strategy to mitigate data imbalance and advance surgical video understanding methods.</description>

      <title>Learning from Limited Multi-Phase CT: Dual-Branch Prototype-Guided Framework for Early Recurrence Prediction in HCC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early recurrence (ER) prediction after curative-intent resection remains a critical challenge in the clinical management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Although contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) with full multi-phase acquisition is recommended in clinical guidelines and routinely performed in many tertiary centers, complete phase coverage is not consistently available across all institutions. In practice, single-phase portal venous (PV) scans are often used alone, particularly in settings with limited imaging resources, variations in acquisition protocols, or patient-related factors such as contrast intolerance or motion artifacts. This variability results in a mismatch between idealized model assumptions and the practical constraints of real-world deployment, underscoring the need for methods that can effectively leverage limited multi-phase data. To address this challenge, we propose a Dual-Branch Prototype-guided (DuoProto) framework that enhances ER prediction from single-phase CT by leveraging limited multi-phase data during training. DuoProto employs a dual-branch architecture: the main branch processes single-phase images, while the auxiliary branch utilizes available multi-phase scans to guide representation learning via cross-domain prototype alignment. Structured prototype representations serve as class anchors to improve feature discrimination, and a ranking-based supervision mechanism incorporates clinically relevant recurrence risk factors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DuoProto outperforms existing methods, particularly under class imbalance and missing-phase conditions. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the dual-branch, prototype-guided design. Our framework aligns with current clinical application needs and provides a general solution for recurrence risk prediction in HCC, supporting more informed decision-making.</description>

      <title>Quantification of protein homodimer affinity using native mass spectrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological processes rely on finely tuned homo- and heteromeric interactions between (biomacro)molecules. The strength of an interaction, typically given by the dissociation constant (KD), plays a crucial role in basic research and must be monitored throughout the development of drugs and agrochemicals. An ideal method for KD determination is applicable to various analytes with a large range of affinities, tolerates complex matrix compositions, does not require labeling, and simultaneously provides information on the structural integrity of the binding partners. Native mass spectrometry meets these criteria but typically struggles with homooligomeric complexes due to overlapping mass signals. To overcome this, we resolve monomer/dimer contributions to overlapping MS-peaks by separately analyzing the charge state distribution of each oligomeric species via sample dilution and covalent crosslinking. Following this approach, we show that quantitative Laser-Induced Liquid Bead Ion Desorption mass spectrometry (qLILBID-MS) accurately captures the affinities of Bovine Serum Albumin and chemically induced dimers of Tryparedoxin, an oxidoreductase from human pathogenic Trypanosoma brucei parasites, with various molecular glues and homodimer affinities. Conveniently, qLILBID-MS requires a fraction of sample used by other methods such as isothermal titration calorimetry and yields previously inaccessible protein homodimer KDs in the high micromolar range, which allowed us to monitor the gradual decrease in homodimer affinity via mutation of crucial dimer interface contacts. Overall, qLILBID-MS is a sensitive, robust, fast, scalable, and cost-effective alternative to quantify protein/protein interactions that can accelerate contemporary drug discovery workflows, e.g. the efficient screening for proximity inducing molecules like proteolysis targeting chimera and molecular glues.</description>

      <title>Upconverting microgauges reveal intraluminal force dynamics in vivo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The forces generated by action potentials in muscle cells shuttle blood, food and waste products throughout the luminal structures of the body. Although non-invasive electrophysiological techniques exist, most mechanosensors cannot access luminal structures non-invasively. Here we introduce non-toxic ingestible mechanosensors to enable the quantitative study of luminal forces and apply them to study feeding in living Caenorhabditis elegans roundworms. These optical 'microgauges' comprise NaY0.8Yb0.18Er0.02F4@NaYF4 upconverting nanoparticles embedded in polystyrene microspheres. Combining optical microscopy and atomic force microscopy to study microgauges in vitro, we show that force evokes a linear and hysteresis-free change in the ratio of emitted red to green light. With fluorescence imaging and non-invasive electrophysiology, we show that adult C. elegans generate bite forces during feeding on the order of 10 micronewtons and that the temporal pattern of force generation is aligned with muscle activity in the feeding organ. Moreover, the bite force we measure corresponds to Hertzian contact stresses in the pressure range used to lyse the bacterial food of the worm. Microgauges have the potential to enable quantitative studies that investigate how neuromuscular stresses are affected by aging, genetic mutations and drug treatments in this organ and other luminal organs.</description>

      <title>PRESCRIBE: Predicting Single-Cell Responses with Bayesian Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In single-cell perturbation prediction, a central task is to forecast the effects of perturbing a gene unseen in the training data. The efficacy of such predictions depends on two factors: (1) the similarity of the target gene to those covered in the training data, which informs model (epistemic) uncertainty, and (2) the quality of the corresponding training data, which reflects data (aleatoric) uncertainty. Both factors are critical for determining the reliability of a prediction, particularly as gene perturbation is an inherently stochastic biochemical process. In this paper, we propose PRESCRIBE (PREdicting Single-Cell Response wIth Bayesian Estimation), a multivariate deep evidential regression framework designed to measure both sources of uncertainty jointly. Our analysis demonstrates that PRESCRIBE effectively estimates a confidence score for each prediction, which strongly correlates with its empirical accuracy. This capability enables the filtering of untrustworthy results, and in our experiments, it achieves steady accuracy improvements of over 3% compared to comparable baselines.</description>

      <title>Evaluating multi-season occupancy models with autocorrelation fitted to heterogeneous datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting species distributions using occupancy models accounting for imperfect detection is now commonplace in ecology. Recently, modelling spatial and temporal autocorrelation was proposed to alleviate the lack of replication in occupancy data, which often prevents model identifiability. However, how such models perform in highly heterogeneous datasets where missing or single-visit data dominates remains an open question. Motivated by an heterogeneous fine-scale butterfly occupancy dataset, we evaluate the performance of a multi-season occupancy model with spatial and temporal random effects to a skewed (Poisson) distribution of the number of surveys per site, overlap of covariates between occupancy and detection submodels, and spatiotemporal clustering of observations. Results showed that the model is robust to heterogeneous data and covariate overlap. However, when spatiotemporal gaps were added, site occupancy was biased towards the average occupancy, itself overestimated. Random effects did not correct the influence of gaps, due to identifiability issues of variance and autocorrelation parameters. Occupancy analysis of two butterfly species further confirmed these results. Overall, multi-season occupancy models with autocorrelation are robust to heterogeneous data and covariate overlap, but still present identifiability issues and are challenged by severe data gaps, which compromise predictions even in data-rich areas.</description>

      <title>BixBench: a Comprehensive Benchmark for LLM-based Agents in Computational Biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00096v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and LLM-based agents show great promise in accelerating scientific research. Existing benchmarks for measuring this potential and guiding future development continue to evolve from pure recall and rote knowledge tasks, towards more practical work such as literature review and experimental planning. Bioinformatics is a domain where fully autonomous AI-driven discovery may be near, but no extensive benchmarks for measuring progress have been introduced to date. We therefore present the Bioinformatics Benchmark (BixBench), a dataset comprising over 50 real-world scenarios of practical biological data analysis with nearly 300 associated open-answer questions designed to measure the ability of LLM-based agents to explore biological datasets, perform long, multi-step analytical trajectories, and interpret the nuanced results of those analyses. We evaluate the performance of two frontier LLMs (GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet) using a custom agent framework we open source. We find that even the latest frontier models only achieve 17% accuracy in the open-answer regime, and no better than random in a multiple-choice setting. By exposing the current limitations of frontier models, we hope BixBench can spur the development of agents capable of conducting rigorous bioinformatic analysis and accelerate scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>Papanicolaou Stain Unmixing for RGB Image Using Weighted Nucleus Sparsity and Total Variation Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Papanicolaou stain, consisting of five dyes, provides extensive color information essential for cervical cancer cytological screening. The visual observation of these colors is subjective and difficult to characterize. Direct RGB quantification is unreliable because RGB intensities vary with staining and imaging conditions. Stain unmixing offers a promising alternative by quantifying dye amounts. In previous work, multispectral imaging was utilized to estimate the dye amounts of Papanicolaou stain. However, its application to RGB images presents a challenge since the number of dyes exceeds the three RGB channels. This paper proposes a novel training-free Papanicolaou stain unmixing method for RGB images. This model enforces (i) nonnegativity, (ii) weighted nucleus sparsity for hematoxylin, and (iii) total variation smoothness, resulting in a convex optimization problem. Our method achieved excellent performance in stain quantification when validated against the results of multispectral imaging. We further used it to distinguish cells in lobular endocervical glandular hyperplasia (LEGH), a precancerous gastric-type adenocarcinoma lesion, from normal endocervical cells. Stain abundance features clearly separated the two groups, and a classifier based on stain abundance achieved 98.0% accuracy. By converting subjective color impressions into numerical markers, this technique highlights the strong promise of RGB-based stain unmixing for quantitative diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Anticipating the Selectivity of Intramolecular Cyclization Reaction Pathways with Neural Network Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reaction mechanism search tools have demonstrated the ability to provide insights into likely products and rate-limiting steps of reacting systems. However, reactions involving several concerted bond changes - as can be found in many key steps of natural product synthesis - can complicate the search process. To mitigate these complications, we present a mechanism search strategy particularly suited to help expedite exploration of an exemplary family of such complex reactions, cyclizations. We provide a cost-effective strategy for identifying relevant elementary reaction steps by combining graph-based enumeration schemes and machine learning techniques for intermediate filtering. Key to this approach is our use of a neural network potential (NNP), AIMNet2-rxn, for computational evaluation of each candidate reaction pathway. In this article, we evaluate the NNP's ability to estimate activation energies, demonstrate the correct anticipation of stereoselectivity, and recapitulate complex enabling steps in natural product synthesis.</description>
