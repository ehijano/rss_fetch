      <title>Sandpiles with finite-range interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the sandpile model with Yukawa-type interactions, whose effective range is tuned by an external parameter $R$. Our results reveal that at specific values of $R$, the system exhibits giant avalanches that span the system, leading to percolation. The probability of such giant avalanches demonstrates two distinct regimes as a function of $R$: for sufficiently small $R$, it increases monotonically, whereas for large $R$ it undergoes threshold dynamics, so that at certain values of $R$, the percolation probability exhibits abrupt jumps. We refer it to as \textit{pseudo-percolation transitions}, based on which we propose a hierarchical percolation model at the mean-field level: each percolation transition corresponds to percolation within a disc of radius $R$. We further examine both local and global geometrical observables. The local quantities include avalanche size, mass, and duration and sub-avalanche mass, while for the global characterization we analyze the loop length and gyration radius of the external perimeter, as well as the mass of sub-avalanches. Remarkably, all these observables exhibit power-law scaling for all values of $R$, with exponents that vary systematically with $R$. Notably, in the vicinity of the pseudo-percolation transition points, the exponents approach characteristic values, signaling a distinct critical behavior.</description>

      <title>Plasticity-induced multistability on fast and slow timescales enables optimal information encoding and spontaneous sequence discrimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural circuits exhibit remarkable computational flexibility, enabling adaptive responses to noisy and ever-changing environmental cues. A fundamental question in neuroscience concerns how a wide range of behaviors can emerge from a relatively limited set of underlying biological mechanisms. In particular, the interaction between activities of neuronal populations and plasticity modulation of synaptic connections may endow neural circuits with a variety of functional responses when coordinated over different characteristic timescales. Here, we develop an information-theoretic framework to quantitatively explore this idea. We consider a stochastic model for neural activities that incorporates the presence of a coupled dynamic plasticity and time-varying stimuli. We show that long-term plasticity modulations play the functional role of steering neural activities towards a regime of optimal information encoding. By constructing the associated phase diagram, we demonstrate that either Hebbian or anti-Hebbian plasticity may become optimal strategies depending on how the external input is projected to the target neural populations. Conversely, short-term plasticity enables the discrimination of temporal ordering in sequences of inputs by navigating the emergent multistable attractor landscape. By allowing a degree of variability in external stimuli, we also highlight the existence of an optimal variability for sequence discrimination at a given plasticity strength. In summary, the timescale of plasticity modulation shapes how inputs are represented in neural activities, thereby fundamentally altering the computational properties of the system. Our approach offers a unifying information-theoretic perspective of the role of plasticity, paving the way for a quantitative understanding of the emergence of complex computations in coupled neuronal-synaptic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Quantum vs Classical Thermal Transport at Low Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work aims to understand how quantum mechanics affects heat transport at low temperatures. In the classical setting, by considering a simple paradigmatic model, our simulations reveal the emergence of Negative Differential Thermal Resistance (NDTR): paradoxically, increasing the temperature bias by lowering the cold bath temperature reduces the steady-state heat current. In sharp contrast, the quantum version of the model, treated via a Lindblad master equation, exhibits no NDTR: the heat current increases monotonically with thermal bias. This marked divergence highlights the fundamental role of quantum effects in low-temperature thermal transport and underscores the need to reconsider classical predictions when designing and optimizing nanoscale thermal devices.</description>

      <title>Supervised and Unsupervised Deep Learning Applied to the Majority Vote Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ deep learning techniques to investigate the critical properties of the continuous phase transition in the majority vote model. In addition to deep learning, principal component analysis is utilized to analyze the transition. For supervised learning, dense neural networks are trained on spin configuration data generated via the kinetic Monte Carlo method. Using independently simulated configuration data, the neural network accurately identifies the critical point on both square and triangular lattices. Classical unsupervised learning with principal component analysis reproduces the magnetization and enables estimation of critical exponents, typically obtained via Monte Carlo importance sampling. Furthermore, deep unsupervised learning is performed using variational autoencoders, which reconstruct input spin configurations and generate artificial outputs. The autoencoders detect the phase transition through the loss function, quantifying the preservation of essential data features. We define a correlation function between the real and reconstructed data, and find that this correlation function is universal at the critical point. Variational autoencoders also serve as generative models, producing artificial spin configurations.</description>

      <title>Potential renormalisation, Lamb shift and mean-force Gibbs state -- to shift or not to shift?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08941v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Often, the microscopic interaction mechanism of an open quantum system gives rise to a `counter term' which renormalises the system Hamiltonian. Such term compensates for the distortion of the system's potential due to the finite coupling to the environment. Even if the coupling is weak, the counter term is, in general, not negligible. Similarly, weak-coupling master equations feature a number of `Lamb-shift terms' which, contrary to popular belief, cannot be neglected. Yet, the practice of vanishing both counter term and Lamb shift when dealing with master equations is almost universal; and, surprisingly, it can yield better results. By accepting the conventional wisdom, one may approximate the dynamics more accurately and, importantly, the resulting master equation is guaranteed to equilibrate to the correct steady state in the high-temperature limit. In this paper we discuss why is this the case. Specifically, we show that, if the potential distortion is small -- but non-negligible -- the counter term does not influence any dissipative processes to second order in the coupling. Furthermore, we show that, for large environmental cutoff, the Lamb-shift terms approximately cancel any coherent effects due to the counter term -- this renders the combination of both contributions irrelevant in practice. We thus provide precise conditions under which the open-system folklore regarding Lamb shift and counter terms is rigorously justified.</description>

      <title>Spectra of random graphs with discrete scale invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random graphs defined by an occurrence probability that is invariant under node aggregation have been identified recently in the context of network renormalization. The invariance property requires that edges are drawn with a specific probability that, in the annealed case, depends on a necessarily infinite-mean node fitness. The diverging mean determines many properties that are uncommon in models with independent edges, but at the same time widespread in real-world networks. Here we focus on the leading eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix of the model, where the n nodes are assigned a Pareto($\alpha$)-distributed fitness with 0 &lt; $\alpha$ &lt; 1. We find that the leading eigenvalues are all of order square root of n, alternate in sign and are located at the intersection between the real axis and a logarithmic spiral in the complex plane, which we characterize analytically in terms of the Gamma function. We also calculate the associated eigenvectors, finding that they display complexvalued scaling exponents and log-periodicity, which are signatures of discrete scale invariance. In contrast with the typical finite-rank behaviour of random graphs with finite-mean variables, we find that a growing number of the leading eigenvalues emerges from the bulk, whose edge extends up to order square root of n and therefore reaches the same scale as that of the structural eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>From Quantum Tsallis Entropy to Strange Metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified framework connecting quantum Tsallis statistics to electronic transport in strongly interacting systems. Starting from R\'enyi and Tsallis entropies, we construct a quantum Tsallis distribution that reduces to the conventional Fermi--Dirac distribution when $q=1$. For $q$ slightly deviating from unity, the correction term in the occupation function can be mapped to a $q$-deformed Schwarzian action, corresponding to soft reparametrization modes. Coupling these soft modes to electrons via the Fermi Golden Rule yields a modified scattering rate, which reproduces conventional Fermi-liquid behavior at low temperatures and linear-in-temperature resistivity at high temperatures. Using the memory matrix formalism, we analyze magnetotransport, finding a linear-in-field magnetoresistance and a Hall angle consistent with Anderson's two-lifetime scenario. At sufficiently low temperatures, both magnetoresistance and Hall response smoothly recover Fermi-liquid quadratic behaviors. This approach provides a controlled interpolation between Fermi-liquid and non-Fermi-liquid regimes, quantitatively linking $q$-deformation, soft-mode dynamics, and experimentally measurable transport coefficients in strange metals.</description>

      <title>Free mutual information and higher-point OTOCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a quantity called the free mutual information (FMI), adapted from concepts in free probability theory, as a new physical measure of quantum chaos. This quantity captures the spreading of a time-evolved operator in the space of all possible operators on the Hilbert space, which is doubly exponential in the number of degrees of freedom. It thus provides a finer notion of operator spreading than the well-understood phenomenon of operator growth in physical space. We derive two central results which apply in any physical system: first, an explicit ``Coulomb gas'' formula for the FMI of two observables $A(t)$ and $B$ in terms of the eigenvalues of the product operator $A(t)B$; and second, a general relation expressing the FMI as a weighted sum of all higher-point out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs). This second result provides a precise information-theoretic interpretation for the higher-point OTOCs as collectively quantifying operator ergodicity and the approach to freeness. This physical interpretation is particularly useful in light of recent progress in experimentally measuring higher-point OTOCs. We identify universal behaviours of the FMI and higher-point OTOCs across a variety of chaotic systems, including random unitary circuits and chaotic spin chains, which indicate that spreading in the doubly exponential operator space is a generic feature of quantum many-body chaos. At the same time, the non-generic behavior of the FMI in various non-chaotic systems, including certain unitary designs, shows that there are cases where an operator spreads in physical space but remains localized in operator space. The FMI is thus a sharper diagnostic of chaos than the standard 4-point OTOC.</description>

      <title>Thermal states emerging from low-entanglement background in disordered spin models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermalization in isolated quantum systems is governed by the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, while strong disorder can induce its breakdown via many-body localization. Here we show that disorder can also generate a narrow band of thermal eigenstates embedded in an otherwise non-thermal spectrum. We illustrate this generic mechanism using paradigmatic spin-1 models, including Heisenberg, XY, and Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) models with several types of disorder. By analyzing their level statistics, entanglement properties and quench dynamics, we show that the disorder-induced states are genuinely thermal and we trace their origin to the null space of the disorder term in the Hamiltonian. Our results demonstrate that disorder can give rise to an unexpected coexistence of thermal and non-thermal dynamics within the same many-body spectrum.</description>

      <title>Simulation of bilayer Hamiltonians based on monitored quantum trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the study of open quantum systems it is often useful to treat mixed states as pure states of a fictitious doubled system. In this work we explore the opposite approach: mapping isolated bilayer systems to open monolayer systems. Specifically, we show that arbitrary bilayer Hamiltonians possessing an antiunitary layer exchange symmetry, and subject to a constraint on the sign of interlayer couplings, can be mapped to Lindbladians on a monolayer system with some of the jump operators postselected on a fixed outcome ("monitored"). Low-energy states of the bilayer Hamiltonian then correspond to late-time states of the monolayer dynamics. Simulating the latter by quantum trajectory methods has the potential of substantially reducing the computational cost of estimating low-energy observables in the bilayer Hamiltonian by effectively halving the system size. The overhead due to sampling quantum trajectories can be controlled by a suitable importance sampling scheme. We show that, when the quantum trajectories exhibit free fermion dynamics, our approach reduces to the auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) method. This provides a physically transparent interpretation of the AFQMC sign-free criteria in terms of properties of quantum dynamics. Finally, we benchmark our approach on the 1D quantum Ashkin-Teller model.</description>

      <title>Effective delocalization in the one-dimensional Anderson model with stealthy disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study analytically and numerically the Anderson model in one dimension with "stealthy" disorder, defined as having a power spectrum that vanishes in a continuous band of wave numbers. Motivated by recent studies on the optical transparency properties of stealthy hyperuniform layered media, we compute the localization length via the perturbation theory expansion of the self-energy. We find that, for fixed energy and small but finite disorder strength, there exists for any finite length system a range of stealthiness $\chi$ for which the localization length exceeds the system size. This kind of "effective delocalization" is the result of the novel kind of correlated disorder that spans a continuous range of length scales, a defining characteristic of stealthy systems. Moreover, we support our analytical results with numerical simulations. Our results may serve as a first step in investigating the role of stealthy disorder in quantum systems, which is of both theoretical and experimental relevance.</description>

      <title>Quantum speed limit for the OTOC from an open systems perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scrambling, the delocalization of initially localized quantum information, is commonly characterized by the out-of-time ordered correlator (OTOC). Employing the OTOC-Renyi-2 entropy theorem we derive a quantum speed limit for the OTOC, which sets an lower bound for the rate with which information can be scrambled. This bound becomes particularly tractable by describing the scrambling of information in a closed quantum system as an effective decoherence process of an open system interacting with an environment. We prove that decay of the OTOC can be bounded by the strength of the system-environment coupling and two-point environmental correlation functions. We validate our analytic bound numerically using the non-integrable transverse field Ising model. Our results provide a universal and model-agnostic quantitative framework for understanding the dynamical limits of information spreading across quantum many-body physics, condensed matter, and engineered quantum platforms.</description>

      <title>Learning quantum many-body data locally: A provably scalable framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) holds great promise for extracting insights from complex quantum many-body data obtained in quantum experiments. This approach can efficiently solve certain quantum problems that are classically intractable, suggesting potential advantages of harnessing quantum data. However, addressing large-scale problems still requires significant amounts of data beyond the limited computational resources of near-term quantum devices. We propose a scalable ML framework called Geometrically Local Quantum Kernel (GLQK), designed to efficiently learn quantum many-body experimental data by leveraging the exponential decay of correlations, a phenomenon prevalent in noncritical systems. In the task of learning an unknown polynomial of quantum expectation values, we rigorously prove that GLQK substantially improves polynomial sample complexity in the number of qubits $n$, compared to the existing shadow kernel, by constructing a feature space from local quantum information at the correlation length scale. This improvement is particularly notable when each term of the target polynomial involves few local subsystems. Remarkably, for translationally symmetric data, GLQK achieves constant sample complexity, independent of $n$. We numerically demonstrate its high scalability in two learning tasks on quantum many-body phenomena. These results establish new avenues for utilizing experimental data to advance the understanding of quantum many-body physics.</description>

      <title>Frozen-corner enumeration of Alternating Sign Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An Alternating Sign Matrix (ASM) is a square matrix with entries in $\{0,1,-1\}$, and such that: $i)$ in each row and columns, nonzero entries alternate in sign; $ii)$ for any given row or column, entries sum up to 1. We define the frozen-square enumeration as the enumeration of $n\times n$ ASMs under the refinement of having, located in a corner, an $s\times s$ square of entries that are all zeroes. We state a conjectural formula for such enumeration, in terms of a Fredholm type determinant of some $s\times s$ matrix whose entries are given explicitely. We provide numerical support in favour of our conjecture. We also illustrate the relevance of the conjectured formula in connection with the limit shape observed in large ASMs, its fluctuations, and the Tracy--Widom distribution.</description>

      <title>Thermal-nonthermal transition of the charged particle production in pp collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the internal energy of charged particle production in minimum bias pp collisions using a thermostatistical approach by analyzing the $p_\text{T}$ spectrum reported by the ALICE Collaboration across LHC energies. To do this, we define temperature as the slope of the $p_\text{T}$ spectrum at low $p_\text{T}$ values and Shannon's entropy as the system's entropy, calculated considering the normalized $p_\text{T}$ spectrum. We found that the internal energy for the Hagedorn and Tricomi functions behaves linearly with temperature at low temperatures but becomes nonlinear at LHC energies, showing a thermal-nonthermal transition in the production of charged particles in pp collisions. Our estimation of the transition center of mass energy is $\sqrt{s^*}=27(11)\text{ keV}$ at baryon chemical potential $\mu_B=0$, which explains why the production of high $p_\text{T}$ hadrons has always been observed, even in earlier experiments, which may also encompass other experiments colliding e$^-$p or e$^+$e$^-$.</description>

      <title>Large deviations for probability graphons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a large deviation principle (LDP) for probability graphons, which are symmetric functions from the unit square into the space of probability measures. This notion extends classical graphons and provides a flexible framework for studying the limit behavior of large dense weighted graphs. In particular, our result generalizes the seminal work of Chatterjee and Varadhan (2011), who derived an LDP for Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs via graphon theory. We move beyond their binary (Bernoulli) setting to encompass arbitrary edge-weight distributions. Specifically, we analyze the distribution on probability graphons induced by random weighted graphs in which edges are sampled independently from a common reference probability measure supported on a compact Polish space. We prove that this distribution satisfies an LDP with a good rate function, expressed as an extension of the Kullback-Leibler divergence between probability graphons and the reference measure. This theorem can also be viewed as a Sanov-type result in the graphon setting. Our work provides a rigorous foundation for analyzing rare events in weighted networks and supports statistical inference in structured random graph models under distributional edge uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Necessary and sufficient symmetries in Event-Chain Monte Carlo with generalized flows and Application to hard dimers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Event-Chain Monte Carlo (ECMC) methods generate continuous-time and non-reversible Markov processes which often display significant accelerations compared to reversible counterparts. However their generalization to any system may appear less straightforward. In this work, our aim is to distinctly define the essential symmetries that such ECMC algorithms must adhere to, differentiating between necessary and sufficient conditions. This exploration intends to delineate the balance between requirements that could be overly limiting in broad applications and those that are fundamentally essential. To do so, we build on the recent analytical description of such methods as generating Piecewise Deterministic Markov Processes (PDMP). Thus, starting with translational flows, we establish the necessary rotational invariance of the probability flows, along with determining the minimum event rate. This rate identifies with the corresponding infinitesimal Metropolis rejection rate. Obeying such conditions ensures the correct invariance for any ECMC scheme. Subsequently, we extend these findings to encompass schemes involving deterministic flows that are more general than mere translational ones. Specifically, we define two classes of interest of general flows: the ideal and uniform-ideal ones. They respectively suppresses or reduces the event rates. From there, we implement a comprehensive non-reversible sampling of a systems of hard dimers by introducing rotational flows, which are uniform-ideal. This implementation results in a speed-up of up to $\sim 3$ compared to the state-of-the-art ECMC/Metropolis hybrid scheme.</description>

      <title>Crossover of Critical Behavior in Dynamic Phase Transitions of Multilayer Ising Model Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the crossover of critical behavior for the dynamic phase transition (DPT) in ferromagnetic thin films using Monte Carlo simulations of the kinetic Ising model, focusing on the scaling behavior of the dynamic order parameter under a time-dependent external magnetic field. Specifically, we study the transition of the critical behavior of such multilayer film systems from two-dimensional (2D) to three-dimensional (3D) as a function of the film thickness and the distance to the critical point, which enables dimensional crossover observations. Our results indicate that the effective critical exponents exhibit a clear transition in their scaling behavior, with thinner films showing 2D-like characteristics and thicker films displaying 3D-like behavior, for both the DPT and the thermodynamic phase transitions (TPT). Quantitatively, the crossover from 2D to 3D behavior occurs at larger film thicknesses for the DPT compared to the TPT, suggesting that DPT and TPT are governed by distinctly different length scales and underlying surface effects. These findings are in agreement with experimental observations in ultrathin Co films, where dynamic and thermodynamic critical exponents were found to differ. Therefore, our study provides an in-depth explanation for critical phenomena in thin-film ferromagnets driven by a time-dependent magnetic field. By comparing the dimensional crossover properties of both TPT and DPT, we present a comprehensive understanding of how thin-film geometry and surface effects influence the scaling laws and critical behavior in nonequilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>Characterizing spin ordering via maximal row correlation in classical spin models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An order parameter, termed the maximal row correlation, is proposed for classical spin systems. Monte Carlo simulations on various Potts models suggest that this order parameter is applicable to a broad range of spin systems, including those defined on irregular lattices, systems with frustration, and systems exhibiting partial orders, provided some degree of spin ordering is present. This approach offers a unified framework for investigating phase transitions in such complex systems. The associated critical exponents are estimated via finite-size scaling analysis and show good agreement with established values.</description>

      <title>Stability of universal properties against perturbations of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the stability of universal properties at continuous phase transitions against perturbations of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm used to simulate the system. We consider the three dimensional XY model as test bed, and both local (single site Metropolis) and global (single cluster) updates, introducing deterministic truncation-like perturbations and stochastic perturbations in the acceptance probabilities. In (almost) all the cases we find a remarkable stability of the universal properties, even against large perturbations of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm, with critical exponents and scaling curves consistent with those of the standard XY model within statistical uncertainties. Only for the single cluster update with very large truncation error does something different happen, but large scaling corrections prevent us from precisely assessing the critical properties of the transition, and, in particular, to understand whether the critical behavior observed corresponds to a known universality class.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the melting of a domain wall in free-fermion chains, where the periodic variation of the hopping amplitudes gives rise to a band structure. It is shown that the entanglement grows logarithmically in time, and the prefactor is proportional to the number of filled bands in the initial state. For a dimerized chain the particle density and current are found to have the same expressions as in the homogeneous case, up to a rescaling of the velocity. The universal contribution to the entropy profile is then doubled, while the non-universal part can be extracted numerically from block-Toeplitz matrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observing super-diffusive fluctuations from Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality in isotropic integrable spin chains is usually challenging as it requires a fairly large number of spins in interaction. We demonstrate in this paper, in the context of classical spins, that accounting for boundary effects lowers the bar, down to a few dozen spins in some cases. Additionally, boundaries control the relaxation to stationarity, which leads to many new universal scaling functions to explore, both in periodic spin chains and for open chains with magnetization imposed by reservoirs at the ends.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Power and efficiency are fundamental criteria for evaluating the performance of thermodynamic cycles. However, it is generally impossible to maximize both simultaneously. In particular, achieving maximum efficiency inevitably leads to vanishing power as the cycle duration approaches infinity. A quantitative characterization of this trade-off yields significant theoretical and practical implications. In this letter, we analytically derive an exact bound constraining power and efficiency in low-dissipation finite-time heat engines. This bound specifies the maximum power attainable at any prescribed efficiency, thereby providing a benchmarking for evaluating the performance of heat engines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The equilibrium behaviours of a trilayered 6-state clock model has been investigated by Monte Carlo simulation. The intralayer interaction is considered ferromagnetic, whereas the interlayer interaction is antiferromagnetic. Periodic boundary conditions(PBC) are applied in XY plane and open boundary condition (OBC) is applied along Z-direction. The thermodynamic behaviours of sublattice magnetisation, total magnetisation, magnetic susceptibility and the specific heat are studied as functions of the temperature. The interesting compensation phenomenon, i.e., the vanishing of the total magnetisation even with nonvanishing sublattice magnetisation, has been observed. The compensation temperature and the critical temperature are found to depend on the strength of single-site anisotropy. The comprehensive phase diagram is shown in the temperature-anisotropy plane. The finite size analysis has been done through the temperature dependence of fourth order Binder cumulant, and the scaling exponents are estimated.</description>

Abstract: Spin systems are important to understand various physical properties in quantum many-body systems. We numerically study the Gaussian fixed lines (GFLs) of the $S=1/2$ XXZ chain with next-nearest neighbor (NNN) interaction in the XY phase. The GFLs are the set of points where the coefficient of the umklapp scattering vanishes. We show that the GFLs pass through the ``special points'', which are defined as the points where the $sl_2$ loop algebra symmetry governs in low-energy physics. In addition, we have discussed the Tomonaga-Luttinger parameter K, and the metamagnetism influences the shape of the GFLs.</description>

      <title>A Variational Principle for Extended Irreversible Thermodynamics: Heat Conducting Viscous Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17079v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extended irreversible thermodynamics is a theory that expands the classical framework of nonequilibrium thermodynamics by going beyond the local-equilibrium assumption. A notable example of this is the Maxwell-Cattaneo heat flux model, which introduces a time lag in the heat flux response to temperature gradients. In this paper, we develop a variational formulation of the equations of extended irreversible thermodynamics by introducing an action principle for a nonequilibrium Lagrangian that treats thermodynamic fluxes as independent variables. A key feature of this approach is that it naturally extends both Hamilton's principle of reversible continuum mechanics and the earlier variational formulation of classical irreversible thermodynamics. The variational principle is initially formulated in the material (Lagrangian) description, from which the Eulerian form is derived using material covariance (or relabeling symmetries). The tensorial structure of the thermodynamic fluxes dictates the choice of objective rate in the Eulerian description, and plays a central role in the emergence of nonequilibrium stresses - arising from both viscous and thermal effects - that are essential to ensure thermodynamic consistency. This framework naturally results in the Cattaneo-Christov model for heat flux. We also investigate the extension of the approach to accommodate higher-order fluxes and the general form of entropy fluxes. The variational framework presented in this paper has promising applications in the development of structure-preserving and thermodynamically consistent numerical methods. It is particularly relevant for modeling systems where entropy production is a delicate issue that requires careful treatment to ensure consistency with the laws of thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Extremal monomial property of q-characters and polynomiality of the X-series</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00260v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The character of every irreducible finite-dimensional representation of a simple Lie algebra has the highest weight property. The invariance of the character under the action of the Weyl group W implies that there is a similar "extremal weight property" for every weight obtained by applying an element of W to the highest weight. In this paper we conjecture an analogous "extremal monomial property" of the q-characters of simple finite-dimensional modules over the quantum affine algebras, using the braid group action on q-characters defined by Chari. In the case of the identity element of W, this is the highest monomial property of q-characters proved in arXiv:math/9911112. Here we prove it for simple reflections. Somewhat surprisingly, the extremal monomial property for each w in W turns out to be equivalent to polynomiality of the "X-series" corresponding to w, which we introduce in this paper. We show that these X-series are equal to certain limits of the generalized Baxter operators for all w in W. Thus, we find a new bridge between q-characters and the spectra of XXZ-type quantum integrable models associated to quantum affine algebras. This leads us to conjecture polynomiality of all generalized Baxter operators, extending the results of arXiv:1308.3444.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work has shown that the entanglement of finite-temperature eigenstates in chaotic quantum many-body local Hamiltonians can be accurately described by an ensemble of random states with an internal $U(1)$ symmetry. We build upon this result to investigate the universal symmetry-breaking properties of such eigenstates. As a probe of symmetry breaking, we employ the entanglement asymmetry, a quantum information observable that quantifies the extent to which symmetry is broken in a subsystem. This measure enables us to explore the finer structure of finite-temperature eigenstates in terms of the $U(1)$-symmetric random state ensemble; in particular, the relation between the Hamiltonian and the effective conserved charge in the ensemble. Our analysis is supported by analytical calculations for the symmetric random states, as well as exact numerical results for the Mixed-Field Ising spin-$1/2$ chain, a paradigmatic model of quantum chaoticity.</description>

      <title>The response of a quantum system to a collision: an autonomous derivation of Kubo's formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the response of a quantum system induced by a collision with a quantum particle, using the time-independent framework of scattering theory. After deriving the dynamical map for the quantum system, we show that it encodes a non-perturbative response function obeying a general fluctuation-dissipation relation. We show that Kubo's formula emerges autonomously in the Born approximation, where the time-dependent perturbation is determined by particle's evolution through the potential region.</description>

      <title>Pontus-Mpemba effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mpemba effects occur after a sudden quench of control parameters if for ''far'' (or ''hot'') initial states with respect to a final target state, the relaxation time toward the target state is shorter than for ''close'' (or ''cold'') initial states. Following a strategy of fishermen in Pontus described by Aristotle, we introduce the Pontus-Mpemba effect as a two-step protocol which includes the time needed for preparing the system in the ''far'' initial state that can now be an arbitrary nonequilibrium state. Our protocol needs no parameter distance concept and applies to general (classical or quantum) systems. We find that all possible Pontus-Mpemba effects fall into three classes and illustrate the theory for open Markovian two-state quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Burgers rings as topological signatures of Eshelby-like plastic events in glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Eshelby-like quadrupolar structures serve as the fundamental microscopic units for characterizing plastic instabilities in amorphous solids and play a crucial role in explaining their mechanical failure, including the formation of shear bands. However, identifying Eshelby-like plastic events in glasses remains challenging due to their inherent structural and dynamical complexity. In this work, we show that Eshelby-like structures can be precisely identified and localized using a topological invariant known as the continuous Burgers vector. By combining analytical and simulation techniques, we reveal the emergence of a topological Burgers ring around Eshelby plastic events, enabling the precise identification of their center of mass and capturing their orientation as well. This proposed method offers a clear and unambiguous framework to locate and characterize the plastic rearrangements that govern plasticity in glasses.</description>

      <title>Diffusion in the Inverted Triangular Soft Lorentz Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23792v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate diffusion in a two-dimensional inverted soft Lorentz gas, where attractive Fermi-type potential wells are arranged in a triangular lattice. This configuration contrasts with earlier studies of soft Lorentz gases involving repulsive scatterers. By systematically varying the gap width and softness of the potential, we explore a rich landscape of diffusive behaviors. We present numerical simulations of the mean squared displacement and compute diffusion coefficients, identifying tongue-like structures in parameter space associated with quasiballistic transport. Furthermore, we develop an extension to the Machta-Zwanzig approximation that incorporates correlated multi-hop trajectories and correct for the influence of localized periodic orbits. Our findings highlight the qualitative and quantitative differences between inverted and repulsive soft Lorentz gases and offer new insights into transport phenomena in smooth periodic potentials.</description>

      <title>Growth of block diagonal operators and symmetry-resolved Krylov complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work addresses how the growth of invariant operators is influenced by their underlying symmetry structure. For this purpose, we introduce the symmetry-resolved Krylov complexity, which captures the time evolution of each block into which an operator, invariant under a given symmetry, can be decomposed. We find that, at early times, the complexity of the full operator is equal to the average of the symmetry-resolved contributions. At later times, however, the interplay among different charge sectors becomes more intricate. In general, the symmetry-resolved Krylov complexity depends on the charge sector, although in some cases this dependence disappears, leading to a form of Krylov complexity equipartition. Our analysis lays the groundwork for a broader application of symmetry structures in the study of Krylov space complexities with implications for thermalization and universality in many-body quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Emergence: from physics to biology, sociology, and computer science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many systems involve numerous interacting parts and the whole system can have properties that the individual parts do not. I take this novelty as the defining characteristic of an emergent property. Other characteristics associated with emergence discussed include universality, order, complexity, unpredictability, irreducibility, diversity, self-organisation, discontinuities, and singularities. Emergent phenomena are widespread across physics, biology, social sciences, and computing, and are central to major scientific and societal challenges. Understanding emergence involves considering the stratification of reality across different scales (energy, time, length, complexity), each with its distinct ontology and epistemology, leading to semi-autonomous scientific disciplines. A central challenge is bridging the gap between macroscopic emergent properties and microscopic component interactions. Identifying an intermediate mesoscopic scale where new, weakly interacting entities or modular structures emerge is key. Theoretical approaches, such as effective theories (describing phenomena at a specific scale) and toy models (simplified systems for analysis), are vital. The Ising model exemplifies how toy models can elucidate emergence characteristics. Emergence is central to condensed matter physics, chaotic systems, fluid dynamics, nuclear physics, quantum gravity, neural networks, protein folding, and social segregation. An emergent perspective should influence scientific strategy by shaping research questions, methodologies, priorities, and resource allocation. An elusive goal is the design and control of emergent properties.</description>

      <title>The Gamma Expansion of the Level Two Large Deviation Rate Functional for Reversible Diffusion Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fix a smooth Morse function $U\colon \mathbb{R}^{d}\to\mathbb{R}$ with finitely many critical points, and consider the solution of the stochastic differential equation \[ d\boldsymbol{x}_{\epsilon}(t)=-\nabla U(\boldsymbol{x}_{\epsilon}(t))\,dt \,+\,\sqrt{2\epsilon}\, d\boldsymbol{w}_{t}\,, \] where $(\boldsymbol{w}_{t})_{t\ge0}$ represents a $d$-dimensional Brownian motion, and $\epsilon&gt;0$ a small parameter. Denote by $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^{d})$ the space of probability measures on $\mathbb{R}^d$, and by $\mathcal{I}_{\epsilon} \colon \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^{d})\to[0,\,\infty]$ the Donsker--Varadhan level two large deviations rate functional. We express $\mathcal{I}_\epsilon$ as $\mathcal{I}_\epsilon = \epsilon^{-1} \mathcal{J}^{(-1)} + \mathcal{J}^{(0)} + \sum_{1\le p\le \mathfrak{q}} (1/\theta^{(p)}_\epsilon) \, \mathcal{J}^{(p)}$, where $\mathcal{J}^{(p)}\colon \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^d) \to [0,+\infty]$ stand for rate functionals independent of $\epsilon$ and $\theta^{(p)}_\epsilon$ for sequences such that $\theta^{(1)}_\epsilon \to\infty$, $\theta^{(p)}_\epsilon / \theta^{(p+1)}_\epsilon \to 0$ for $1\le p&lt; \mathfrak{q}$. The speeds $\theta^{(p)}_\epsilon$ correspond to the time-scales at which the diffusion $\boldsymbol{x}_{\epsilon}(\cdot)$ exhibits a metastable behaviour, while the functional $\mathcal{J}^{(p)}$ represent the level two, large deviations rate functionals of the finite-state, continuous-time Markov chains which describe the evolution of the diffusion $\boldsymbol{x}_{\epsilon}(\cdot)$ among the wells in the time-scale $\theta^{(p)}_\epsilon$.</description>
