      <title>Integrated Image Reconstruction and Target Recognition based on Deep Learning Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational microwave imaging (CMI) has gained attention as an alternative technique for conventional microwave imaging techniques, addressing their limitations such as hardware-intensive physical layer and slow data collection acquisition speed to name a few. Despite these advantages, CMI still encounters notable computational bottlenecks, especially during the image reconstruction stage. In this setting, both image recovery and object classification present significant processing demands. To address these challenges, our previous work introduced ClassiGAN, which is a generative deep learning model designed to simultaneously reconstruct images and classify targets using only back-scattered signals. In this study, we build upon that framework by incorporating attention gate modules into ClassiGAN. These modules are intended to refine feature extraction and improve the identification of relevant information. By dynamically focusing on important features and suppressing irrelevant ones, the attention mechanism enhances the overall model performance. The proposed architecture, named Att-ClassiGAN, significantly reduces the reconstruction time compared to traditional CMI approaches. Furthermore, it outperforms current advanced methods, delivering improved Normalized Mean Squared Error (NMSE), higher Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and better classification outcomes for the reconstructed targets.</description>

      <title>Comparative Study of Generative Models for Early Detection of Failures in Medical Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The medical device industry has significantly advanced by integrating sophisticated electronics like microchips and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to enhance the safety and usability of life-saving devices. These complex electro-mechanical systems, however, introduce challenging failure modes that are not easily detectable with conventional methods. Effective fault detection and mitigation become vital as reliance on such electronics grows. This paper explores three generative machine learning-based approaches for fault detection in medical devices, leveraging sensor data from surgical staplers,a class 2 medical device. Historically considered low-risk, these devices have recently been linked to an increasing number of injuries and fatalities. The study evaluates the performance and data requirements of these machine-learning approaches, highlighting their potential to enhance device safety.</description>

      <title>Over-the-Air ODE-Inspired Neural Network for Dual Task-Oriented Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analog machine-learning hardware platforms promise greater speed and energy efficiency than their digital counterparts. Specifically, over-the-air analog computation allows offloading computation to the wireless propagation through carefully constructed transmitted signals. In addition, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is emerging as a promising solution for next-generation wireless networks, offering the ability to tailor the communication environment. Leveraging the advantages of RIS, we design and implement the ordinary differential equation (ODE) neural network using over-the-air computation (AirComp) and demonstrate its effectiveness for dual tasks. We engineer the ambient wireless propagation environment through distributed RISs to create an architecture termed the over-the-air ordinary differential equation (Air-ODE) network. Unlike the conventional digital ODE-inspired neural network, the Air-ODE block utilizes the physics of wave reflection and the reconfigurable phase shifts of RISs to implement an ODE block in the analog domain, enhancing spectrum efficiency. Moreover, the advantages of Air-ODE are demonstrated in a deep learning-based semantic communication (DeepSC) system by extracting effective semantic information to reduce the data transmission load, while achieving the dual functions of image reconstruction and semantic tagging simultaneously at the receiver. Simulation results show that the analog Air-ODE network can achieve similar performance to the digital ODE-inspired network. Specifically, for the image reconstruction and semantic tagging task, compared with the analog network without the Air-ODE block, the Air-ODE block can achieve around 2 times gain in both reconstruction quality and tagging accuracy.</description>

      <title>Experiment Study on Reference-Path-Aided System Calibration for mmWave Bistatic ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) has been regarded as a key enabling technology for next-generation wireless networks. Compared to monostatic ISAC, bistatic ISAC can eliminate the critical challenge of self-interference cancellation and is well compatible with the existing network infrastructures. However, the synchronization between the transmitter and the sensing receiver becomes a crucial problem. The extracted channel state information (CSI) for sensing under communication synchronization contains different types of system errors, such as the sampling time offset (STO), carrier frequency offset (CFO), and random phase shift, which can severely degrade sensing performance or even render sensing infeasible. To address this problem, a reference-path-aided system calibration scheme is designed for mmWave bistatic ISAC systems, where the line-of-sight (LoS) path can be blocked. By exploiting the delay-angle sparsity feature in mmWave ISAC systems, the reference path, which can be either a LoS or a non-LoS (NLoS) path, is first identified. By leveraging the fact that all the paths suffer the same system errors, the channel parameter extracted from the reference path is utilized to compensate for the system errors in all other paths. A mmWave ISAC system is developed to validate our design. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can support precise estimation of Doppler shift and delay, maintaining time-synchronization errors within 1 nanosecond.</description>

      <title>Autoregressive Stochastic Clock Jitter Compensation in Analog-to-Digital Converters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with the mathematical modeling and compensation of stochastic discrete time clock jitter in Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs). Two novel, computationally efficient de-jittering sample pilots-based algorithms for baseband signals are proposed: one consisting in solving a sequence of weighted least-squares problems and another that fully leverages the correlated jitter structure in a Kalman filter-type routine. Alongside, a comprehensive and rigorous mathematical analysis of the linearization errors committed is presented, and the work is complemented with extensive synthetic simulations and performance benchmarking with the scope of gauging and stress-testing the techniques in different scenarios.</description>

      <title>Statistical CSI Acquisition for Multi-frequency Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-frequency massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) communication is a promising strategy for both 5G and future 6G systems, ensuring reliable transmission while enhancing frequency resource utilization. Statistical channel state information (CSI) has been widely adopted in multi-frequency massive MIMO transmissions to reduce overhead and improve transmission performance. In this paper, we propose efficient and accurate methods for obtaining statistical CSI in multi-frequency massive MIMO systems. First, we introduce a multi-frequency massive MIMO channel model and analyze the mapping relationship between two types of statistical CSI, namely the angular power spectrum (APS) and the spatial covariance matrix, along with their correlation across different frequency bands. Next, we propose an autoregressive (AR) method to predict the spatial covariance matrix of any frequency band based on that of another frequency band. Furthermore, we emphasize that channels across different frequency bands share similar APS characteristics. Leveraging the maximum entropy (ME) criterion, we develop a low-complexity algorithm for high-resolution APS estimation. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the AR-based covariance prediction method and demonstrate the high-resolution estimation capability of the ME-based approach. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of multi-frequency cooperative transmission by applying the proposed methods to obtain statistical CSI from low-frequency bands and utilizing it for high-frequency channel transmission. This approach significantly enhances high-frequency transmission performance while effectively reducing system overhead.</description>

      <title>Duplex Self-Aligning Resonant Beam Communications and Power Transfer with Coupled Spatially Distributed Laser Resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sustainable energy supply and high-speed communications are two significant needs for mobile electronic devices. This paper introduces a self-aligning resonant beam system for simultaneous light information and power transfer (SLIPT), employing a novel coupled spatially distributed resonator (CSDR). The system utilizes a resonant beam for efficient power delivery and a second-harmonic beam for concurrent data transmission, inherently minimizing echo interference and enabling bidirectional communication. Through comprehensive analyses, we investigate the CSDR's stable region, beam evolution, and power characteristics in relation to working distance and device parameters. Numerical simulations validate the CSDR-SLIPT system's feasibility by identifying a stable beam waist location for achieving accurate mode-match coupling between two spatially distributed resonant cavities and demonstrating its operational range and efficient power delivery across varying distances. The research reveals the system's benefits in terms of both safety and energy transmission efficiency. We also demonstrate the trade-off among the reflectivities of the cavity mirrors in the CSDR. These findings offer valuable design insights for resonant beam systems, advancing SLIPT with significant potential for remote device connectivity.</description>

      <title>Temperature-Resilient LC-RIS Phase-Shift Design for Multi-user Downlink Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reflecting antenna elements in most reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) use semiconductor-based (e.g., positive-intrinsic-negative (PIN) diodes and varactors) phase shifters. Although effective, a drawback of this technology is the high power consumption and cost, which become particularly prohibitive in millimeter-wave (mmWave)/sub-Terahertz range. With the advances in Liquid Crystals (LCs) in microwave engineering, we have observed a new trend in using LC for realizing phase shifter networks of RISs. LC-RISs are expected to significantly reduce the fabrication costs and power consumption. However, the nematic LC molecules are sensitive to temperature variations. Therefore, implementing LC-RIS in geographical regions with varying temperatures requires temperature-resilient designs. The mentioned temperature variation issue becomes more significant at higher temperatures as the phase shifter range reduces in warmer conditions, whereas it expands in cooler ones. In this paper, we study the impact of temperature on the operation of LC-RISs and develop a temperature-resilient phase shift design. Specifically, we formulate a max-min signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio optimization for a multi-user downlink mmWave network that accounts for the impact of temperature in the LC-RIS phase shifts. The simulation results demonstrate a significant improvement for the considered set of parameters when using our algorithm compared to the baseline approach, which neglects the temperature effects.</description>

      <title>From Sleep Staging to Spindle Detection: Evaluating End-to-End Automated Sleep Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automation of sleep analysis, including both macrostructural (sleep stages) and microstructural (e.g., sleep spindles) elements, promises to enable large-scale sleep studies and to reduce variance due to inter-rater incongruencies. While individual steps, such as sleep staging and spindle detection, have been studied separately, the feasibility of automating multi-step sleep analysis remains unclear. Here, we evaluate whether a fully automated analysis using state-of-the-art machine learning models for sleep staging (RobustSleepNet) and subsequent spindle detection (SUMOv2) can replicate findings from an expert-based study of bipolar disorder. The automated analysis qualitatively reproduced key findings from the expert-based study, including significant differences in fast spindle densities between bipolar patients and healthy controls, accomplishing in minutes what previously took months to complete manually. While the results of the automated analysis differed quantitatively from the expert-based study, possibly due to biases between expert raters or between raters and the models, the models individually performed at or above inter-rater agreement for both sleep staging and spindle detection. Our results demonstrate that fully automated approaches have the potential to facilitate large-scale sleep research. We are providing public access to the tools used in our automated analysis by sharing our code and introducing SomnoBot, a privacy-preserving sleep analysis platform.</description>

      <title>Chirp-Based Aliasing Analysis of Arrays in the Spherical Wavefront Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In antenna arrays, wave propagation modeling based on Euclidean principles is typically represented by steering vectors or signals. This paper provides a new, chirp-based, interpretation of steering vectors in the Spherical Wavefront Regime (SWR), establishing a relationship between the spatial spectrum of the received (resp. transmitted) signal and the geometry of the array and the source (resp. target). Leveraging the well-known sampling theorem, we analyze aliasing effects arising from spatial sampling with a finite number of antennas and understand how these effects degrade the Ambiguity Function (AF). Our framework provides geometric insight into these degradations, offering a deeper understanding of the non-space-invariant aliasing mechanisms in the SWR. The proposed approach is formulated for general antenna arrays and then instantiated to Circular Array and to Uniform Linear Array structures operating in Near Field conditions.</description>

      <title>Rodent Breathing Waveforms in ApoE Rats: Statistical and Entropic Differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene variations are involved in lipid metabolism and cholesterol transport, with the ApoE4 allele being a known risk factor associated with neurodegenerative conditions later in life. Emerging evidence suggests these genetic variations may also influence respiratory function and vitality. However, the specific impact of different ApoE genotypes on breathing patterns remains largely unexplored. This work investigates differences in breathing waveform characteristics and entropy statistics derived from plethysmography (PLETH) data between rat models possessing two distinct ApoE genotypes (referred to herein as gene59 and gene95). Findings reveal significant distributional differences in common plethysmography metrics and approximate entropy between the two genotypes, observed during both active and resting states. Additionally, the study examines the transient impact of sighs (deep breaths) on these breathing metrics, demonstrating that entropy and other measures are altered in the breaths immediately following a sigh.</description>

      <title>On the Multiangle Discrete Fractional Fourier Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efficiently computed multiangle centered discrete fractional Fourier transform (MA-CDFRFT) [1] has proven as a useful tool for time-frequency analysis; however, its scope is limited to the centered discrete fractional Fourier transform (CDFRFT). Meanwhile, extensive research on the standard DFRFT has lead to a better understanding of this transform as well as numerous possible choices for eigenvectors for implementation. In this letter we present a simple adaptation of the MA-CDFRFT which allows us to efficiently compute its standard counterpart, which we call the multiangle DFRFT (MA-DFRFT). Furthermore, we formalize the symmetries inherent to the MA-CDFRFT and MA-DFRFT to halve the number of FFTs needed to compute these transforms, paving the way for applications in resource constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Hybrid-Field 6D Movable Antenna for Terahertz Communications: Channel Modeling and Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study a six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA)-enhanced Terahertz (THz) network that supports a large number of users with a few antennas by controlling the three-dimensional (3D) positions and 3D rotations of antenna surfaces/subarrays at the base station (BS). However, the short wavelength of THz signals combined with a large 6DMA movement range extends the near-field region. As a result, a user can be in the far-field region relative to the antennas on one 6DMA surface, while simultaneously residing in the near-field region relative to other 6DMA surfaces. Moreover, 6DMA THz channel estimation suffers from increased computational complexity and pilot overhead due to uneven power distribution across the large number of candidate position-rotation pairs, as well as the limited number of radio frequency (RF) chains in THz bands. To address these issues, we propose an efficient hybrid-field generalized 6DMA THz channel model, which accounts for planar wave propagation within individual 6DMA surfaces and spherical waves among different 6DMA surfaces. Furthermore, we propose a low-overhead channel estimation algorithm that leverages directional sparsity to construct a complete channel map for all potential antenna position-rotation pairs.
  Numerical results show that the proposed hybrid-field channel model achieves a sum rate close to that of the ground-truth near-field channel model and confirm that the channel estimation method yields accurate results with low complexity.</description>

      <title>Impact of Weather on Satellite Communication: Evaluating Starlink Resilience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Satellite communications have emerged as one of the most feasible solutions to provide global wireless coverage and connect the unconnected. Starlink dominates the market with over 7,000 operational satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO) and offers global high-speed and low-latency Internet service for stationary and mobile use cases, including in-motion connectivity for vehicles, vessels, and aircraft. Starlink terminals are designed to handle extreme weather conditions. Starlink recommends a flat high performance (FHP) terminal for users living in areas with extreme weather conditions. The earlier studies evaluated Starlink's FHP throughput for stationary and in-motion users without providing a detailed analysis of how weather affects its performance. There remains a need to investigate the impact of weather on FHP's throughput. In this paper, we address this shortcoming by analyzing the impact of weather on Starlink's performance in Oulu, Finland, a city located in Northern Europe near the Arctic Circle. Our measurements reveal that rain degrades median uplink and downlink throughput by 52.27% and 37.84%, respectively. On the contrary, there was no noticeable impact on the round-trip time. Additionally, we also examine the impact of cloud cover on the Starlink throughput. The linear regression analysis reveals the negative relationship between throughput and cloud cover. The cloud cover of up to 12.5% has around 20% greater throughput than the cloud cover of 87.5%</description>

      <title>Max-Min Secrecy Rate and Secrecy Energy Efficiency Optimization for RIS-Aided VLC Systems: RSMA Versus NOMA</title>

Abstract: Integrating VLC with the RIS significantly enhances physical layer security by enabling precise directional signal control and dynamic adaptation to the communication environment. These capabilities strengthen the confidentiality and security of VLC systems. This paper presents a comprehensive study on the joint optimization of VLC AP power allocation, RIS association, and RIS elements orientation angles for secure VLC systems, while considering RSMA and power-domain NOMA schemes. Specifically, two frameworks are proposed to maximize both the minimum secrecy rate (SR) and the minimum secrecy energy efficiency (SEE) by jointly optimizing power allocation, RIS association, and RIS elements orientation angles for both power-domain NOMA and RSMA-based VLC systems. The proposed frameworks consider random device orientation and guarantee the minimum user-rate requirement. The proposed optimization frameworks belong to the class of mixed integer nonlinear programming, which has no known feasible solution methodology to guarantee the optimal solution. Moreover, the increased degree of freedom and flexibility from the joint consideration of power control, RIS association and element orientation results in a large set of decision variables and constraints, which further complicates the optimization problem. To that end, we utilize a genetic algorithm-based solution method, which through its exploration and exploitation capabilities can obtain a good quality solution. Additionally, comprehensive simulations show that the RSMA scheme outperforms the power-domain NOMA scheme across both the SR and SEE metrics over various network parameters. Furthermore, useful insights on the impact of minimum user rate requirement, number of RIS elements, and maximum VLC AP transmit power on the minimum SR and SEE performances are provided.</description>

      <title>Accurate and Fast Channel Estimation for Fluid Antenna Systems with Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluid antenna systems (FAS) offer enhanced spatial diversity for next-generation wireless systems. However, acquiring accurate channel state information (CSI) remains challenging due to the large number of reconfigurable ports and the limited availability of radio-frequency (RF) chains -- particularly in high-dimensional FAS scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient posterior sampling-based channel estimator that leverages a diffusion model (DM) with a simplified U-Net architecture to capture the spatial correlation structure of two-dimensional FAS channels. The DM is initially trained offline in an unsupervised way and then applied online as a learned implicit prior to reconstruct CSI from partial observations via posterior sampling through a denoising diffusion restoration model (DDRM). To accelerate the online inference, we introduce a skipped sampling strategy that updates only a subset of latent variables during the sampling process, thereby reducing the computational cost with minimal accuracy degradation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significantly higher estimation accuracy and over 20x speedup compared to state-of-the-art compressed sensing-based methods, highlighting its potential for practical deployment in high-dimensional FAS.</description>

      <title>Massive MIMO-OFDM Channel Acquisition with Time-Frequency Phase-Shifted Pilots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a channel acquisition approach with time-frequency phase-shifted pilots (TFPSPs) for massive multi-input multi-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems. We first present a triple-beam (TB) based channel tensor model, allowing for the representation of the space-frequency-time (SFT) domain channel as the product of beam matrices and the TB domain channel tensor. By leveraging the specific characteristics of TB domain channels, we develop TFPSPs, where distinct pilot signals are simultaneously transmitted in the frequency and time domains. Then, we present the optimal TFPSP design and provide the corresponding pilot scheduling algorithm. Further, we propose a tensor-based information geometry approach (IGA) to estimate the TB domain channel tensors. Leveraging the specific structure of beam matrices and the properties of TFPSPs, we propose a low-complexity implementation of the tensor-based IGA. We validate the efficiency of our proposed channel acquisition approach through extensive simulations. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of our approach. The proposed approach can effectively suppress inter-UT interference with low complexity and limited pilot overhead, thereby enhancing channel estimation performance. Particularly in scenarios with a large number of UTs, the channel acquisition method outperforms existing approaches by reducing the normalized mean square error (NMSE) by more than 8 dB.</description>

      <title>Fluid Antenna-Assisted MU-MIMO Systems with Decentralized Baseband Processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fluid antenna system (FAS) has emerged as a disruptive technology, offering unprecedented degrees of freedom (DoF) for wireless communication systems. However, optimizing fluid antenna (FA) positions entails significant computational costs, especially when the number of FAs is large. To address this challenge, we introduce a decentralized baseband processing (DBP) architecture to FAS, which partitions the FA array into clusters and enables parallel processing. Based on the DBP architecture, we formulate a weighted sum rate (WSR) maximization problem through joint beamforming and FA position design for FA-assisted multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems. To solve the WSR maximization problem, we propose a novel decentralized block coordinate ascent (BCA)-based algorithm that leverages matrix fractional programming (FP) and majorization-minimization (MM) methods. The proposed decentralized algorithm achieves low computational, communication, and storage costs, thus unleashing the potential of the DBP architecture. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm under the DBP architecture reduces computational time by over 70% compared to centralized architectures with negligible WSR performance loss.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Precoding for Near-Field Secure Communications: Implementation and Performance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increase in antenna apertures and transmission frequencies in next-generation wireless networks is catalyzing advancements in near-field communications (NFC). In this paper, we investigate secure transmission in near-field multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) scenarios. Specifically, with the advent of extremely large-scale antenna arrays (ELAA) applied in the NFC regime, the spatial degrees of freedom in the channel matrix are significantly enhanced. This creates an expanded null space that can be exploited for designing secure communication schemes. Motivated by this observation, we propose a near-field dynamic hybrid beamforming architecture incorporating artificial noise, which effectively disrupts eavesdroppers at any undesired positions, even in the absence of their channel state information (CSI). Furthermore, we comprehensively analyze the dynamic precoder's performance in terms of the average signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio, achievable rate, secrecy capacity, secrecy outage probability, and the size of the secrecy zone. In contrast to far-field secure transmission techniques that only enhance security in the angular dimension, the proposed algorithm exploits the unique properties of spherical wave characteristics in NFC to achieve secure transmission in both the angular and distance dimensions. Remarkably, the proposed algorithm is applicable to arbitrary modulation types and array configurations. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves approximately 20\% higher rate capacity compared to zero-forcing and the weighted minimum mean squared error precoders.</description>

      <title>Integrating Communication, Sensing, and Security: Progress and Prospects of PLS in ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sixth generation of wireless networks defined several key performance indicators (KPIs) for assessing its networks, mainly in terms of reliability, coverage, and sensing. In this regard, remarkable attention has been paid recently to the integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) paradigm as an enabler for efficiently and jointly performing communication and sensing using the same spectrum and hardware resources. On the other hand, ensuring communication and data security has been an imperative requirement for wireless networks throughout their evolution. The physical-layer security (PLS) concept paved the way to catering to the security needs in wireless networks in a sustainable way while guaranteeing theoretically secure transmissions, independently of the computational capacity of adversaries. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to consider a balanced trade-off between communication reliability, sensing, and security in future networks, such as the 5G and beyond, and the 6G. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive and system-wise review of designed secure ISAC systems from a PLS point of view. In particular, the impact of various physical-layer techniques, schemes, and wireless technologies to ensure the sensing-security trade-off is studied from the surveyed work. Furthermore, the amalgamation of PLS and ISAC is analyzed in a broader impact by considering attacks targeting data confidentiality, communication covertness, and sensing spoofing. The paper also serves as a tutorial by presenting several theoretical foundations on ISAC and PLS, which represent a practical guide for readers to develop novel secure ISAC network designs.</description>

      <title>WaveSleepNet: An Interpretable Network for Expert-like Sleep Staging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although deep learning algorithms have proven their efficiency in automatic sleep staging, the widespread skepticism about their "black-box" nature has limited its clinical acceptance. In this study, we propose WaveSleepNet, an interpretable neural network for sleep staging that reasons in a similar way to sleep experts. In this network, we utilize the latent space representations generated during training to identify characteristic wave prototypes corresponding to different sleep stages. The feature representation of an input signal is segmented into patches within the latent space, each of which is compared against the learned wave prototypes. The proximity between these patches and the wave prototypes is quantified through scores, indicating the prototypes' presence and relative proportion within the signal. The scores are served as the decision-making criteria for final sleep staging. During training, an ensemble of loss functions is employed for the prototypes' diversity and robustness. Furthermore, the learned wave prototypes are visualized by analysing occlusion sensitivity. The efficacy of WaveSleepNet is validated across three public datasets, achieving sleep staging performance that are on par with the state-of-the-art models when several WaveSleepNets are combine into a larger network. A detailed case study examined the decision-making process of the WaveSleepNet which aligns closely with American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) manual guidelines. Another case study systematically explained the misidentified reason behind each sleep stage. WaveSleepNet's transparent process provides specialists with direct access to the physiological significance of its criteria, allowing for future adaptation or enrichment by sleep experts.</description>

      <title>Context-Enhanced CSI Tracking Using Koopman-Inspired Dual Autoencoders in Dynamic Wireless Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20123v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel framework for Channel State Information (CSI) tracking and prediction, integrating Physics-Informed Autoencoders (PIAE) and learned Koopman operator to represent CSI as a nonlinear dynamical system influenced by exogenous contextual inputs. The proposed method enables real-time updates to the Channel Knowledge Map (CKM), ensuring enhanced reliability and responsiveness of communication systems in dynamic environments. The architecture consists of dual autoencoders: one for CSI and another for contextual information, coupled through a lifted state space where the Koopman operator captures the linear evolution of CSI dynamics. By combining Koopman operator theory, state space representation, and real-time CSI reconstruction, this work offers a robust and scalable solution for dynamic CSI tracking. These findings highlight the potential of Physics-Informed Autoencoders to revolutionize communication systems by delivering accurate, real-time CSI predictions while maintaining stringent data privacy standards.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid proliferation of devices and increasing data traffic in cellular networks necessitate advanced solutions to meet these escalating demands. Massive MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) technology offers a promising approach, significantly enhancing throughput, coverage, and spatial multi-plexing. Despite its advantages, massive MIMO systems often lack flexible software controls over hardware, limiting their ability to optimize operational expenditure (OpEx) by reducing power consumption while maintaining performance. Current software-controlled methods, such as antenna muting combined with digital beamforming and hybrid beamforming, have notable limitations. Antenna muting struggles to maintain throughput and coverage, while hybrid beamforming faces hardware constraints that restrict scalability and future-proofing. This work presents PhaseMO, a versatile approach that adapts to varying network loads. PhaseMO effectively reduces power consumption in low-load scenarios without sacrificing coverage and overcomes the hardware limitations of hybrid beamforming, offering a scalable and future-proof solution. We will show that PhaseMO can achieve up to 30% improvement in energy efficiency while avoiding about 10% coverage reduction and 5dB increase in UE transmit power.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Channel prediction is crucial for high-mobility vehicular networks, as it enables the anticipation of future channel conditions and the proactive adjustment of communication strategies. However, achieving accurate vehicular channel prediction is challenging due to significant Doppler effects and rapid channel variations resulting from high-speed vehicle movement and complex propagation environments. In this paper, we propose a novel delay-Doppler (DD) domain channel prediction framework tailored for high-mobility vehicular networks. By transforming the channel representation into the DD domain, we obtain an intuitive, sparse, and stable depiction that closely aligns with the underlying physical propagation processes, effectively reducing the complex vehicular channel to a set of time-series parameters with enhanced predictability. Furthermore, we leverage the large artificial intelligence (AI) model to predict these DD-domain time-series parameters, capitalizing on their advanced ability to model temporal correlations. The zero-shot capability of the pre-trained large AI model facilitates accurate channel predictions without requiring task-specific training, while subsequent fine-tuning on specific vehicular channel data further improves prediction accuracy. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our DD-domain channel prediction framework and the superior accuracy of the large AI model in predicting time-series channel parameters, thereby highlighting the potential of our approach for robust vehicular communication systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20500v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural receivers have recently become a popular topic, where the received signals can be directly decoded by data driven mechanisms such as machine learning and deep learning. In this paper, we propose two novel neural network based orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) receivers performing channel estimation and equalization tasks and directly predicting log likelihood ratios (LLRs) from the received in phase and quadrature phase (IQ) signals. The first network, the Dual Attention Transformer (DAT), employs a state of the art (SOTA) transformer architecture with an attention mechanism. The second network, the Residual Dual Non Local Attention Network (RDNLA), utilizes a parallel residual architecture with a non local attention block. The bit error rate (BER) and block error rate (BLER) performance of various SOTA neural receiver architectures is compared with our proposed methods across different signal to noise ratio (SNR) levels. The simulation results show that DAT and RDNLA outperform both traditional communication systems and existing neural receiver models.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Attention-Based Model for 5G Radio-based Outdoor Localization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radio-based localization in dynamic environments, such as urban and vehicular settings, requires systems that efficiently adapt to varying signal conditions and environmental changes. Factors like multipath interference and obstructions introduce different levels of complexity that affect the accuracy of the localization. Although generalized models offer broad applicability, they often struggle to capture the nuances of specific environments, leading to suboptimal performance in real-world deployments. In contrast, specialized models can be tailored to particular conditions, enabling more precise localization by effectively handling domain-specific variations, which also results in reduced execution time and smaller model size. However, deploying multiple specialized models requires an efficient mechanism to select the most appropriate one for a given scenario. In this work, we develop an adaptive localization framework that combines shallow attention-based models with a router/switching mechanism based on a single-layer perceptron. This enables seamless transitions between specialized localization models optimized for different conditions, balancing accuracy and computational complexity. We design three low-complex models tailored for distinct scenarios, and a router that dynamically selects the most suitable model based on real-time input characteristics. The proposed framework is validated using real-world vehicle localization data collected from a massive MIMO base station and compared to more general models.</description>

      <title>On-device Anomaly Detection in Conveyor Belt Operations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conveyor belts are crucial in mining operations by enabling the continuous and efficient movement of bulk materials over long distances, which directly impacts productivity. While detecting anomalies in specific conveyor belt components has been widely studied, identifying the root causes of these failures, such as changing production conditions and operator errors, remains critical. Continuous monitoring of mining conveyor belt work cycles is still at an early stage and requires robust solutions. Recently, an anomaly detection method for duty cycle operations of a mining conveyor belt has been proposed. Based on its limited performance and unevaluated long-term proper operation, this study proposes two novel methods for classifying normal and abnormal duty cycles. The proposed approaches are pattern recognition systems that make use of threshold-based duty-cycle detection mechanisms, manually extracted features, pattern-matching, and supervised tiny machine learning models. The explored low-computational models include decision tree, random forest, extra trees, extreme gradient boosting, Gaussian naive Bayes, and multi-layer perceptron. A comprehensive evaluation of the former and proposed approaches is carried out on two datasets. Both proposed methods outperform the former method, with the best-performing approach being dataset-dependent. The heuristic rule-based approach achieves the highest performance in the same dataset used for algorithm training, with 97.3% for normal cycles and 80.2% for abnormal cycles. The ML-based approach performs better on a dataset including the effects of machine aging, scoring 91.3% for normal cycles and 67.9% for abnormal cycles. Implemented on two low-power microcontrollers, the methods demonstrate efficient, real-time operation with energy consumption of 13.3 and 20.6 ${\mu}$J during inference. These results offer valuable insights for detecting ...</description>

      <title>A Tutorial on Six-Dimensional Movable Antenna for 6G Networks: Synergizing Positionable and Rotatable Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18240v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA) is a new
  and revolutionary technique that fully exploits the wireless
  channel spatial variations at the transmitter/receiver by flexibly
  adjusting the three-dimensional (3D) positions and/or 3D rotations
  of antennas/antenna surfaces (sub-arrays), thereby improving the performance of wireless
  networks cost-effectively without the need to deploy additional
  antennas. It is thus expected that
  the integration of new 6DMAs into future sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks will fundamentally enhance
  antenna agility and adaptability, and introduce new degrees
  of freedom (DoFs) for system design. Despite its great potential,
  6DMA faces new challenges to be efficiently implemented in wireless
  networks, including corresponding architectures, antenna position and rotation optimization, channel estimation,
  and system design from both communication and sensing perspectives. In
  this paper, we provide a tutorial on 6DMA-enhanced wireless
  networks to address the above issues by unveiling associated new channel models, hardware implementations and
  practical position/rotation constraints, as well as various appealing applications in
  wireless networks. Moreover, we discuss two special cases of 6DMA, namely, rotatable 6DMA with fixed antenna position and positionable 6DMA with fixed antenna rotation, and highlight their respective design challenges and applications.
  We further present prototypes developed for 6DMA-enhanced communication along with experimental results obtained with these prototypes. Finally, we outline promising directions for further investigation.</description>

Abstract: Exact parameter and trajectory inference in state-space models is typically achieved by one of two methods: particle marginal Metropolis-Hastings (PMMH) or particle Gibbs (PGibbs). PMMH is a pseudo-marginal algorithm which jointly proposes a new trajectory and parameter, and accepts or rejects both at once. PGibbs instead alternates between sampling from the trajectory, using an algorithm known as conditional sequential Monte Carlo (CSMC) and the parameter in a Hastings-within-Gibbs fashion. While particle independent Metropolis Hastings (PIMH), the parameter-free version of PMMH, is known to be statistically worse than CSMC, PGibbs can induce a slow mixing if the parameter and the state trajectory are very correlated. This has made PMMH the method of choice for many practitioners, despite theory and experiments favouring CSMC over PIMH for the parameter-free problem. In this article, we describe a formulation of PGibbs which bypasses the Gibbs step, essentially marginalizing over the trajectory distribution in a fashion similar to PMMH. This is achieved by considering the implementation of a CSMC algortihm for the state-space model integrated over the joint distribution of the current parameter and the parameter proposal. We illustrate the benefits of method on a simple example known to be challenging for PMMH.</description>
