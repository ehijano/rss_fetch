      <title>Generative Monte Carlo Sampling for Constant-Cost Particle Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Generative Monte Carlo (GMC), a novel paradigm for particle transport simulation that integrates generative artificial intelligence directly into the stochastic solution of the linear Boltzmann equation. By reformulating the cell-transmission problem as a conditional generation task, we train neural networks using conditional flow matching to sample particle exit states, including position, direction, and path length, without simulating scattering histories. The method employs optical coordinate scaling, enabling a single trained model to generalize across any material. We validate GMC on two canonical benchmarks, namely a heterogeneous lattice problem characteristic of nuclear reactor cores and a linearized hohlraum geometry representative of high-energy density radiative transfer. Results demonstrate that GMC preserves the statistical fidelity of standard Monte Carlo, exhibiting the expected $1/\sqrt{N}$ convergence rate while maintaining accurate scalar flux profiles. While standard Monte Carlo computational cost scales linearly with optical thickness in the diffusive limit, GMC achieves constant $O(1)$ cost per cell transmission, yielding order-of-magnitude speedups in optically thick regimes. This framework strategically aligns particle transport with modern computing architectures optimized for neural network inference, positioning transport codes to leverage ongoing advances in AI hardware and algorithms.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Machine Learning for Two-Phase Moving-Interface and Stefan Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Stefan problem is a classical free-boundary problem that models phase-change processes and poses computational challenges due to its moving interface and nonlinear temperature-phase coupling. In this work, we develop a physics-informed neural network framework for solving two-phase Stefan problems. The proposed method explicitly tracks the interface motion and enforces the discontinuity in the temperature gradient across the interface while maintaining global consistency of the temperature field. Our approach employs two neural networks: one representing the moving interface and the other for the temperature field. The interface network allows rapid categorization of thermal diffusivity in the spatial domain, which is a crucial step for selecting training points for the temperature network. The temperature network's input is augmented with a modified zero-level set function to accurately capture the jump in its normal derivative across the interface. Numerical experiments on two-phase dynamical Stefan problems demonstrate the superior accuracy and effectiveness of our proposed method compared with the ones obtained by other neural network methodology in literature. The results indicate that the proposed framework offers a robust and flexible alternative to traditional numerical methods for solving phase-change problems governed by moving boundaries. In addition, the proposed method can capture an unstable interface evolution associated with the Mullins-Sekerka instability.</description>

      <title>Macular: a multi-scale simulation platform for the retina and the primary visual system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We developed Macular, a simulation platform with a graphical interface, designed to produce in silico experiment scenarios for the retina and the primary visual system. A scenario consists of generating a three-dimensional structure with interconnected layers, each layer corresponding to a type of 'cell' in the retina or visual cortex. The cells can correspond to neurons or more complex structures (such as cortical columns). The inputs are arbitrary videos. The user can use the cells and synapses provided with the software, or create their own using a graphical interface where they enter the constituent equations in text format (e.g., LaTeX). They also create the three-dimensional structure via the graphical interface. Macular then automatically generates and compiles the C++ code and generates the simulation interface. This allows the user to view the input video and the three-dimensional structure in layers. It also allows the user to select cells and synapses in each layer and view the activity of their state variables. Finally, the user can adjust the phenomenological parameters of the cells or synapses via the interface. We provide several example scenarios, corresponding to published articles, including an example of a retino-cortical model. Macular was designed for neurobiologists and modelers, specialists in the primary visual system, who want to test hypotheses in silico without the need for programming. By design, this tool allows natural or altered conditions (pharmacology, pathology, development) to be simulated.</description>

      <title>Optical Downlink Modeling for LEO and MEO Satellites under Atmospheric Turbulence with a Quantum State Tomography Use Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the link budget for free-space optical systems involving Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) satellites. We develop a detailed model of the satellite-to-ground channel that accounts for the primary physical processes affecting transmittance: atmospheric absorption and scattering, free-space diffraction, and turbulence-induced fluctuations. The study introduces a general method for computing transmittance along a slant path between a satellite and an optical ground station, incorporating zenith angle, slant range, and altitude-dependent attenuation. The proposed framework is intended to support the design and evaluation of space-based optical links and serves as a critical tool for defining technical specifications in satellite communication demonstrators and simulations. Numerical estimates are provided to illustrate the magnitude of losses under typical operational conditions, including the role of aperture averaging. In addition to the link budget analysis, we introduce a satellite-based quantum use case. We propose a scheme for quantum state tomography performed on states generated by an onboard photon source on an LEO or MEO satellite and transmitted to the optical ground station. This approach enables continuous verification of the quality of quantum resources that can be used to perform quantum protocols within quantum information networks.</description>

      <title>Traveling chimeras and collective coordination in beta-cell networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pancreatic $\beta$-cells play a central role in maintaining glucose homeostasis through the pulsatile secretion of insulin. This essential function relies not only on intracellular regulatory mechanisms but also on coordinated interactions among $\beta$-cells within the islets of Langerhans. Disruptions in this intercellular coordination are increasingly implicated in metabolic disorders such as type~I and type~II diabetes. In this work, we employ a computational framework to investigate the collective dynamics of a network of coupled $\beta$-cells interacting through a nonlocally coupled ring topology that incorporates both electrical and metabolic coupling pathways. This topology captures short- and long-range interactions known to shape islet communication. Numerical simulations reveal a variety of emergent behaviors, including synchronization, traveling waves, and traveling chimera states, in which coherent and incoherent domains coexist and propagate across the network. These findings provide new insight into the mechanisms governing coordinated $\beta$-cell activity and the regulation of pulsatile insulin secretion. By clarifying how coupling structure and intercellular communication shape islet-wide dynamics, this work contributes to a deeper understanding of the dysfunctions underlying diabetes.</description>

      <title>From STLS to Projection-based Dictionary Selection in Sparse Regression for System Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we revisit dictionary-based sparse regression, in particular, Sequential Threshold Least Squares (STLS), and propose a score-guided library selection to provide practical guidance for data-driven modeling, with emphasis on SINDy-type algorithms. STLS is an algorithm to solve the $\ell_0$ sparse least-squares problem, which relies on splitting to efficiently solve the least-squares portion while handling the sparse term via proximal methods. It produces coefficient vectors whose components depend on both the projected reconstruction errors, here referred to as the scores, and the mutual coherence of dictionary terms. The first contribution of this work is a theoretical analysis of the score and dictionary-selection strategy. This could be understood in both the original and weak SINDy regime. Second, numerical experiments on ordinary and partial differential equations highlight the effectiveness of score-based screening, improving both accuracy and interpretability in dynamical system identification. These results suggest that integrating score-guided methods to refine the dictionary more accurately may help SINDy users in some cases to enhance their robustness for data-driven discovery of governing equations.</description>

      <title>Multimode Jahn-Teller Effect in Negatively Charged Nitrogen-Vacancy Center in Diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimode Jahn-Teller (JT) effect in a negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in its excited state is studied by first-principles calculations based on density function theory (DFT). The activation pathways of the JT distortions are analyzed to elucidate and quantify the contribution of different vibrational modes. The results show that the dominant vibrational modes in the JT distortions are closely related to the phonon sideband observed in two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES), consistent with ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulation results. Our calculations provide a new way to understand the origin and the mechanism of the vibronic coupling of the system. The obtained dominant vibrational modes coupled to the NV centre and their interactions with electronic states provides new insights into dephasing, relaxation and optically driven quantum effects, and are critical for the application to quantum information, magnetometry and sensing.</description>

      <title>Electrically tunable spin qubits in strain-engineered graphene p-n junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strain engineering enables quantum confinement in pristine graphene without degrading its intrinsic mobility and spin coherence. Here, we extend previously proposed strain-induced charge-qubit architectures by incorporating spin degrees of freedom through Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) and Zeeman fields, enabling spin-qubit operation in single-layer graphene (SLG). In a graphene p-n junction, a strain-induced nanobubble generates a pseudo-magnetic field that forms double quantum dots with gate-tunable level hybridization. Tight-binding quantum transport simulations and a four-band model reveal two distinct avoided crossings: spin-conserving gaps at zero detuning and spin-flip gaps at finite detuning, the latter increasing with SOC strength while the former decreases. Time-domain simulations confirm detuning-dependent Rabi oscillations corresponding to these two operational regimes. These results demonstrate that strain-induced confinement combined with tunable SOC provides a viable mechanism for coherent spin manipulation in pristine graphene, positioning strained SLG as a promising platform for scalable spin-based quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>How nanotextured interfaces influence the electronics in perovskite solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10691v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Perovskite solar cells have reached power conversion efficiencies that rival those of established silicon photovoltaics. Nanotextures in perovskite solar cells scatter the incident light, thereby improving optical absorption. In addition, experiments show that nanotextures impact electronic performance, although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study investigates the underlying theoretical reasons by combining multi-dimensional optical and charge-transport simulations for a single-junction perovskite solar cell. Our numerical results reveal that texturing redistributes the electric field, influencing carrier accumulation and recombination dynamics. We find that moderate texturing heights ($\leq 300$ nm) always increase the power conversion efficiency, regardless of surface recombination velocities. Our study also clarifies why experiments have reported that texturing both increased and reduced open-circuit voltages in perovskite solar cells: this behaviour originates from variations in surface recombination at the untextured electron transport layer. In contrast, surface recombination at the textured hole transport layer strongly affects the short-circuit current density, with lower recombination rates keeping it closer to the optical ideal. These findings provide new insights into the opto-electronic advantages of texturing and offer guidance for the design of next-generation textured perovskite-based solar cells, light emitting diodes, and photodetectors.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Turing Instability and Emergent Spectral Scaling in Chiral Active Turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21012v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spontaneous emergence of coherent structures from chaotic backgrounds is a hallmark of active biological swarms. We investigate this self-organization by simulating an ensemble of polar chiral active agents that couple locally via a Kuramoto interaction. We demonstrate that the system's transition from chaos to active turbulence is characterized by quantized loop phase currents and coherent clustering, and that this transition is strictly governed by a kinetic Turing instability. By deriving the continuum kinetic theory for the model, we identify that the competition between local phase-locking and active agent motility selects a critical structural wavenumber. The instability then drives the system into a state of developed, active turbulence that exhibits stable, robust power-laws in spectral density, suggestive of universality and consistent with observations from a broad range of turbulent phenomena. Our results bridge the gap between discrete chimera states and continuous fluid turbulence, suggesting that the statistical scaling laws of active turbulence can arise from fundamental kinetic instability criteria.</description>

      <title>Beyond symmetry protection: Robust feedback-enforced edge states in non-Hermitian stacked quantum spin Hall systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional wisdom holds that, in the simplest time-reversal-symmetric setting, strongly coupling two QSH layers yields a trivial $\mathbb Z_2$ phase and no protected topological edge states. We demonstrate that, in a regime with intermediate inter-layer coupling (neither in the strong or weak coupling regimes) and competitive non-Hermitian directed amplification, bulk modes are rendered with negligible gain while arbitrary bulk excitations inevitably accumulate into robust helical edge transport modes -- without relying on any symmetry protection. Our feedback-enforced mechanism persists over broad parameter ranges and remains robust even on fractal or irregular boundaries. These findings challenge the traditional view of stacked QSH insulators as inevitably trivial, and open up new avenues for designing helical topological devices that exploit feedback-enforced non-Hermitian engineering, instead of symmetry-enforced robustness.</description>

      <title>Efficient simulation framework for modeling collective emission in ensembles of inhomogeneous solid-state emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08174v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An efficient simulation framework is proposed to model collective emission in disordered ensembles of quantum emitters. Using a cumulant expansion approach, the computational complexity scales polynomially as opposed to exponentially with the number of emitters, enabling Monte Carlo sampling over a large number of realizations. The framework is applied to model negatively charged silicon-vacancy (SiV$^{-}$) centers inside diamond. Incorporating spatial disorder and inhomogeneous broadening, we obtain statistically averaged responses over hundreds of SiV$^{-}$ clusters. These simulations reveal two signatures of collective behavior. First, dynamics of fully inverted clusters show that superradiant emission occurs only with sufficiently large emitter number and high quantum efficiency. Unlike ideal Dicke superradiance, the burst is substantially suppressed by strong near-field dipole-dipole interaction, consistent with existing theoretical predictions. Second, under continuous-wave excitation we compute photoluminescence-excitation spectra, which exhibit interaction-induced broadening in the distribution of resonance peaks. The corresponding density of states also displays a non-zero skewness. Overall, by incorporating realistic inhomogeneities in emitter clusters, our framework is able to predict statistics for disordered ensembles that can be compared to experiments directly. Our approach generalizes to other types of emitters, including atoms, molecules, and quantum dots, thus providing a practical tool for analyzing collective behavior in realistic quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Efficient Boys function evaluation using minimax approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10059v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an algorithm for efficient evaluation of Boys functions $F_0,\dots,F_{k_\mathrm{max}}$ tailored to modern computing architectures, in particular graphical processing units (GPUs), where maximum throughput is high and data movement is costly. The method combines rational minimax approximations with upward and downward recurrence relations. The non-negative real axis is partitioned into three regions, $[0,\infty\rangle = A\cup B\cup C$, where regions $A$ and $B$ are treated using rational minimax approximations and region $C$ by an asymptotic approximation. This formulation avoids lookup tables and irregular memory access, making it well suited hardware with high maximum throughput and low latency. The rational minimax coefficients are generated using the rational Remez algorithm. For a target maximum absolute error of $\varepsilon_\mathrm{tol} = 5\cdot10^{-14}$, the corresponding approximation regions and coefficients for Boys functions $F_0,\dots,F_{32}$ are provided in the appendix.</description>
