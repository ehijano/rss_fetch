      <title>Geometry and stability of species complexes: larger species speciate less often</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Species complexes are groups of closely related populations exchanging genes through dispersal. We study the dynamics of the structure of species complexes in a class of metapopulation models where demes can exchange genetic material through migration and diverge through the accumulation of new mutations. Importantly, we model the ecological feedback of differentiation on gene flow by assuming that the success of migrations decreases with genetic distance, through a specific function $h$. We investigate the effects of metapopulation size on the coherence of species structures, depending on some mathematical characteristics of the feedback function $h$. Our results suggest that with larger metapopulation sizes, species form increasingly coherent, transitive, and uniform entities. We conclude that the initiation of speciation events in large species requires the existence of idiosyncratic geographic or selective restrictions on gene flow.</description>

      <title>Simulating cell populations with explicit cell cycle length -- implications to cell cycle dependent tumour therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we present a stochastic simulation model designed to explicitly incorporate cell cycle length, overcoming limitations associated with classical compartmental models. Our approach employs a delay mechanism to represent the cell cycle, allowing the use of arbitrary distributions for cell cycle lengths. We demonstrate the feasibility of our model by fitting it to experimental data from melanoma cell lines previously studied by Vittadello et al. Notably, our model successfully replicates experimentally observed synchronization phenomena that multi-stage models could not adequately explain. By using a gamma distribution to model cell cycle lengths, we achieved excellent agreement between our simulations and empirical data, while significantly reducing computational complexity and parameter estimation challenges inherent in multi-stage approaches. Our results highlight the importance of explicitly incorporating cell cycle lengths in modeling cell populations, with potential implications for optimizing cell cycle-dependent tumor therapies.</description>

      <title>The sexy and formidable male body: men's height and weight are condition-dependent, sexually selected traits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On average men are taller and more muscular than women, which confers on them advantages related to female choice and during physical competition with other men. Sexual size dimorphisms such as these come with vulnerabilities due to higher maintenance and developmental costs for the sex with the larger trait. These costs are in keeping with evolutionary theory that posits large, elaborate, sexually selected traits are signals of health and vitality because stressor exposure (e.g.\ early disease) will compromise them (e.g.\ shorter stature) more than other traits. We provide a large-scale test of this hypothesis for the human male and show that with cross-national and cross-generational improvements in living conditions, where environmental stressors recede, men's gains in height and weight are more than double those of women's, increasing sexual size dimorphism. Our study combines evolutionary biology with measures of human wellbeing, providing novel insights into how socio-ecological factors and sexual selection shape key physical traits.</description>

      <title>Modelling the impact of phenotypic heterogeneity on cell migration: a continuum framework derived from individual-based principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective cell migration plays a crucial role in numerous biological processes, including tumour growth, wound healing, and the immune response. Often, the migrating population consists of cells with various different phenotypes. This study derives a general mathematical framework for modelling cell migration in the local environment, which is coarse-grained from an underlying individual-based model that captures the dynamics of cell migration that are influenced by the phenotype of the cell, such as random movement, proliferation, phenotypic transitions, and interactions with the local environment. The resulting, flexible, and general model provides a continuum, macroscopic description of cell invasion, which represents the phenotype of the cell as a continuous variable and is much more amenable to simulation and analysis than its individual-based counterpart when considering a large number of phenotypes. We showcase the utility of the generalised framework in three biological scenarios: range expansion; cell invasion into the extracellular matrix; and T cell exhaustion. The results highlight how phenotypic structuring impacts the spatial and temporal dynamics of cell populations, demonstrating that different environmental pressures and phenotypic transition mechanisms significantly influence migration patterns, a phenomenon that would be computationally very expensive to explore using an individual-based model alone. This framework provides a versatile and robust tool for understanding the role of phenotypic heterogeneity in collective cell migration, with potential applications in optimising therapeutic strategies for diseases involving cell migration.</description>

      <title>A mean-field theory for heterogeneous random growth with redistribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the competition between random multiplicative growth and redistribution/migration in the mean-field limit, when the number of sites is very large but finite. We find that for static random growth rates, migration should be strong enough to prevent localisation, i.e. extreme concentration on the fastest growing site. In the presence of an additional temporal noise in the growth rates, a third partially localised phase is predicted theoretically, using results from Derrida's Random Energy Model. Such temporal fluctuations mitigate concentration effects, but do not make them disappear. We discuss our results in the context of population growth and wealth inequalities.</description>

      <title>Detection of evolutionary shifts in variance under an Ornsten-Uhlenbeck model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Abrupt environmental changes can lead to evolutionary shifts in not only the optimal trait value, but also the rate of adaptation and the diffusion variance in trait evolution. While several methods exist for detecting shifts in optimal values, few explicitly model shifts in both evolutionary variance and adaptation rates. We use a multi-optima and multi-variance Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process model to describe trait evolution with shifts in both optimal value and diffusion variance and analyze how covariance between species is affected when shifts in variance occur along the phylogeny. We propose a new method that simultaneously detects shifts in both variance and optimal values by formulating the problem as a variable selection task using an L1-penalized loss function. Our method is implemented in the R package ShiVa (Detection of evolutionary Shifts in Variance). Through simulations, we compare ShiVa with methods that only consider shifts in optimal values (l1ou; PhylogeneticEM), and PCMFit. Our method demonstrates improved predictive ability and significantly reduces false positives in detecting optimal value shifts when variance shifts are present. When only shifts in optimal value occur, our method performs comparably to existing approaches. Applying ShiVa to empirical data from cordylid lizards , we find that it outperforms l1ou and PhylogeneticEM, achieving the highest log-likelihood and lowest BIC.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Impulsive Releases in Species Competition Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study focuses on optimizing species release $S_2$ to control species population $S_1$ through impulsive release strategies. We investigate the conditions required to remove species $S_1$, which is equivalent to the establishment of $S_2$. The research includes a theoretical analysis that examines the positivity, existence, and uniqueness of solutions and the conditions for the global stability of the $S_1$-free solution. In addition, we formulate an optimal control problem to maximize the effectiveness of $S_2$ releases, manage the population of $S_1$, and minimize the costs associated with this intervention strategy. Numerical simulations are conducted to validate the proposed theories and allow visualization of population dynamics under various releases scenarios.</description>
