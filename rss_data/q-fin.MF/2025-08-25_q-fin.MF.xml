      <title>Asymmetric super-Heston-rough volatility model with Zumbach effect as scaling limit of quadratic Hawkes processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hawkes processes were first introduced to obtain microscopic models for the rough volatility observed in asset prices. Scaling limits of such processes leads to the rough-Heston model that describes the macroscopic behavior. Blanc et al. (2017) show that Time-reversal asymmetry (TRA) or the Zumbach effect can be modeled using Quadratic Hawkes (QHawkes) processes. Dandapani et al. (2021) obtain a super-rough-Heston model as scaling limit of QHawkes processes in the case where the impact of buying and selling actions are symmetric. To model asymmetry in buying and selling actions, we propose a bivariate QHawkes process and derive a super-rough-Heston model as scaling limits for the price process in the stable and near-unstable regimes that preserves TRA. A new feature of the limiting process in the near-unstable regime is that the two driving Brownian motions exhibit a stochastic covariation that depends on the spot volatility.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Jump-Diffusions, with Financial Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16449v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study continuous-time reinforcement learning (RL) for stochastic control in which system dynamics are governed by jump-diffusion processes. We formulate an entropy-regularized exploratory control problem with stochastic policies to capture the exploration--exploitation balance essential for RL. Unlike the pure diffusion case initially studied by Wang et al. (2020), the derivation of the exploratory dynamics under jump-diffusions calls for a careful formulation of the jump part. Through a theoretical analysis, we find that one can simply use the same policy evaluation and $q$-learning algorithms in Jia and Zhou (2022a, 2023), originally developed for controlled diffusions, without needing to check a priori whether the underlying data come from a pure diffusion or a jump-diffusion. However, we show that the presence of jumps ought to affect parameterizations of actors and critics in general. We investigate as an application the mean--variance portfolio selection problem with stock price modelled as a jump-diffusion, and show that both RL algorithms and parameterizations are invariant with respect to jumps. Finally, we present a detailed study on applying the general theory to option hedging.</description>
