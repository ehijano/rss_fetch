      <title>On Removable Sets for Weighted Sobolev Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give sufficient geometric conditions, not involving capacities, for a compact null set to be removable for the Sobolev functions on weighted $\mathbb R^n$, defined as the closure of smooth functions in the weighted Sobolev norm. Our porosity conditions are in terms of suitable coverings by cubes. The weights are assumed to be doubling and satisfy a Poincar\'e inequality, which includes, but is not equal to, the famous class of Muckenhoupt weights. Our proofs use ideas and techniques from the theory of analysis on metric spaces.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Euler Schemes and Dissipative Evolutions in the Space of Probability Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the convergence of stochastic time-discretization schemes for evolution equations driven by random velocity fields, including examples like stochastic gradient descent and interacting particle systems. Using a unified framework based on Multivalued Probability Vector Fields, we analyze these dynamics at the level of probability measures in the Wasserstein space. Under suitable dissipativity and boundedness conditions, we prove that the laws of the interpolated trajectories converge to those of a limiting evolution governed by a maximal dissipative extension of the associated barycentric field. This provides a general measure-theoretic study for the convergence of stochastic schemes in continuous time.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we study linear relations that can be factorized as products of idempotent relations. We provide several characterizations of this class from different perspectives, extending known factorization results for operators to the more general setting of linear relations.</description>

      <title>Essential norm and integration of a family of weighted composition operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the interchange of essential norm and integration of certain families of weighted composition operators acting on the standard weighted Bergman spaces $A^p_\alpha$, where $p&gt;1$ and $\alpha\geq 0$. To be more precise, we give a sufficient condition for $ \|\int u_tC_{\phi_t}\, dt\|_e = \int \| u_tC_{\phi_t}\|_e \, dt $ to hold in terms of geometric properties of $u_t$ and $\phi_t$. We also provide some necessary conditions for the equality to hold and calculate the essential norm of some integral operators such as some Volterra operators.</description>

      <title>Near-optimal performance of square-root measurement for general score functions and quantum ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Barnum-Knill theorem states that the optimal success probability in the multiple state discrimination task is not more than the square root of the success probability when the pretty good or square-root measurement is used for this task. An assumption of the theorem is that the underlying ensemble consists of finitely many quantum states over a finite-dimensional quantum system. Motivated in part by the fact that the success probability is not a relevant metric for continuous ensembles, in this paper we provide a generalization of the notion of pretty good measurement and the Barnum-Knill theorem for general quantum ensembles, including those described by a continuous parameter space and an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. To achieve this, we also design a general metric of performance for quantum measurements that generalizes the success probability, namely, the expected gain of the measurement with respect to a positive score function. A notable consequence of the main result is that, in a Bayesian estimation task, the mean square error of the generalized pretty good measurement does not exceed twice the optimal mean square error.</description>

      <title>On maldistributed sequences and meager ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that an ideal $\mathcal{I}$ on $\omega$ is meager if and only if the set of sequences $(x_n)$ taking values in a Polish space $X$ for which all elements of $X$ are $\mathcal{I}$-cluster points of $(x_n)$ is comeager. The latter condition is also known as $\nu$-maldistribution, where $\nu: \mathcal{P}(\omega)\to \mathbb{R}$ is the $\{0,1\}$-valued submeasure defined by $\nu(A)=1$ if and only if $A\notin \mathcal{I}$. It turns out that the meagerness of $\mathcal{I}$ is also equivalent to a technical condition given by Misik and Toth in [J. Math. Anal. Appl. 541 (2025), 128667]. Lastly, we show that the analogue of the first part holds replacing $\nu$ with $\|\cdot\|_\varphi$, where $\varphi$ is a lower semicontinuous submeasure.</description>

      <title>Properties and applications of partial multiple weights for fractional integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, through the introduction of partial multiple weights, we firstly study the related Rubio de Francia extrapolation theorem within the framework of partial Muckenhoupt classes and further obtain the corresponding extrapolation theorem for two types of off-diagonal estimates. Secondly, we establish some weighted estimates for fractional integrals associated with partial Muckenhoupt weights. As applications, several basic inequalities (including the Fefferman-Phong inequality, the degenerate Poincar\'{e} inequality and the Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequality) related to partial Muckenhoupt weights are derived. Meanwhile, our results can give the characterization of the commutators of fractional integrals, which yields a partial answer to an open question proposed by D. Cruz-Uribe in the paper [D. Cruz-Uribe, Two weight inequalities for fractional integral operators and commutators, World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd., Hackensack, NJ, 2017, 25-85].</description>

      <title>Factorization of positive definite kernels. Correspondences: $C^{*}$-algebraic and operator valued context vs scalar valued kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study a class $\mathcal{M}$ of generalized positive definite kernels of the form $K\colon X\times X\to L(\mathfrak{A},L(H))$, where $\mathfrak{A}$ is a unital $C^{*}$-algebra and $H$ a Hilbert space. These kernels encode operator-valued correlations governed by the algebraic structure of $\mathfrak{A}$, and generalize classical scalar-valued positive definite kernels, completely positive (CP) maps, and states on $C^{*}$-algebras. Our approach is based on a scalar-valued kernel $\tilde{K}\colon(X\times\mathfrak{A}\times H)^{2}\to\mathbb{C}$ associated to $K$, which defines a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and enables a concrete, representation-theoretic analysis of the structure of such kernels. We show that every $K\in\mathcal{M}$ admits a Stinespring-type factorization $K(s,t)(a)=V(s)^{*}\pi(a)V(t)$. In analogy with the Radon--Nikodym theory for CP maps, we characterize kernel domination $K\leq L$ in terms of a positive operator $A\in\pi_{L}(\mathfrak{A})'$ satisfying $K(s,t)(a)=V_{L}(s)^{*}\pi_{L}(a)AV_{L}(t)$. We further show that when $\pi_{L}$ is irreducible, domination implies scalar proportionality, thus recovering the classical correspondence between pure states and irreducible representations.</description>

      <title>Cartan-Thullen theorem and Levi problem in context of generalised convexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04860v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the Cartan-Thullen theorem and its generalisation to the context of generalised convexity, which we establish herein, can be regarded as consequences of the classical theorems of functional analysis: the Banach-Steinhaus theorem and the Banach-Alaoglu theorem. Furthermore, we characterise the domains of holomorphy, and their generalisations, as the spaces that are complete, or as the spaces exhaustible by suitably defined polytopes. We also provide an abstract analogue of the Levi problem and its elementary resolution. Our results allow for a novel characterisation of Stein spaces as the holomorphically complete spaces, as well as a proof that the Bremermann-Lelong lemma is equivalent to the positive answer to the Levi problem. Another contribution of ours is the introduction of the analogues of the notions of the complex analysis to the setting of generalised convexity.</description>

      <title>Geodesic X-ray transform and streaking artifacts on simple surfaces or on spaces of constant curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06899v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The X-ray transform on the plane or on the three-dimensional Euclidean space can be considered as the measurements of CT scanners for normal human tissue. If the human body contains metal regions such as dental implants, stents in blood vessels, metal bones, etc., the beam hardening effect for the energy level of the X-ray causes streaking artifacts in its CT image. More precisely, if there are two strictly convex metal regions contained in the cross-section of normal human tissue, then streaking artifacts occur along the common tangent lines of the two regions. In this paper we study the geodesic X-ray transform and streaking artifacts on nontrapping simple compact Riemannian manifolds with strictly convex boundaries. We show that the streaking artifacts result from the propagation of conormal singularities on the boundary of metal regions along the common tangent geodesics under the strong and seemingly strange assumption that the manifolds are two dimensional or spaces of constant curvature. This condition ensures that every Jacobi field takes the form of the product of a scalar function and parallel transport along the geodesic. Our results clarify the geometric meaning of the theory, which was imperceptible in the known results on the Euclidean space.</description>

      <title>Bounded cohomology and scl of verbal wreath products</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07438v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the bounded cohomology and the stable commutator length of verbal wreath products $\Gamma \wr^{_W}A$, where $A$ has trivial bounded cohomology for a sufficiently large class of coefficients.\\ We prove that the stable commutator length always vanishes, and that the bounded cohomology vanishes in positive degrees for some such verbal wreath products; including the standard restricted wreath products (extending a recent result by Monod for lamplighters groups), as well as verbal wreath products arising from n-solvable, $n$-nilpotent, and $k$-Burnside $(k = 2, 3, 4, 6)$ verbal products.\ As an application, we show that every group of type $F_p$ isometrically embeds into a group of type $F_p$ with vanishing bounded cohomology in positive degrees for a large class of coefficients.</description>
