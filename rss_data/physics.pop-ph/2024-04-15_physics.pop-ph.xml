      <title>Interferometer measurements in interstellar communications: methods and observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extraterrestrial communication signals are hypothesized to be present in an extensive search space. Using principles of communication theory and system design, methods are studied and implemented to reduce the signal search space, while considering intentional transmitter detectability. The design and observational work reported in this paper adds material to previous related reports. (ref. arXiv:2105.03727, arXiv:2106.10168, arXiv:2202.12791, arXiv:2203.10065). In the current work, a two-element radio interferometer telescope and receiver algorithms are utilized to perform differential angle-of-arrival and multi-bandwidth measurements of delta-t delta-f polarized pulse pairs. The system enhances extraterrestrial signal detectability, while reducing signal false positives caused by noise and radio frequency interference. Statistical analysis utilizes a Right Ascension filter spanning celestial coordinate ranges that include the previously determined anomalous celestial direction: 5.25 +- 0.15 hr Right Ascension, -7.6 degrees +- 1 degree Declination. Observations were conducted during a duration of 61 days, comprising 244 hours of interferometer measurements.</description>

      <title>Simulating, Visualizing and Playing with de Sitter and anti de Sitter spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss computer simulations of de Sitter and anti de Sitter spacetimes, which are maximally symmetric, relativistic analogs of non-Euclidean geometries. We present prototype games played in these spacetimes; such games and visualizations can help the players gain intuition about these spacetimes. We discuss the technical challenges in creating such simulations, and discuss the geometric and relativistic effects that can be witnessed by the players.</description>

      <title>On minimizing cyclists' ascent times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03363v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that, given an average power, the ascent time is minimized if a cyclist maintains a constant ground speed regardless of the slope. Herein, minimizing the time is equivalent to maximizing -- for a given uphill -- the corresponding mean ascent velocity (VAM: velocit\`a ascensionale media), which is a common training metric. We illustrate the proof with numerical examples, and show that, in general, maintaining a constant instantaneous power results in longer ascent times; both strategies result in the same time if the slope is constant. To remain within the athlete's capacity, we examine the effect of complementing the average-power constraint with a maximum-power constraint. Even with this additional constraint, the ascent time is the shortest with a modified constant-speed -- not constant-power -- strategy; as expected, both strategies result in the same time if the maximum and average powers are equal to one another. Given standard available information -- including level of fitness, quantified by the power output, and ascent profile -- our results allow to formulate reliable and convenient strategies of uphill timetrials.</description>
