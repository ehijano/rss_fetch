      <title>Neural Hodge Corrective Solvers: A Hybrid Iterative-Neural Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Neural Hodge Corrective Solver (NHCS), a hybrid iterative-neural framework for partial differential equations that embeds learned corrective operators within the Discrete Exterior Calculus (DEC) formulation. The method combines classical Jacobi-Richardson iterations with data-driven corrections to refine numerical solutions while preserving the underlying topological and metric structure. NHCS employs a two-phase training strategy. In the first phase, DEC operators are learned through relative residual minimization from data. In the second phase, these operators are integrated into the iterative solver, and training targets the improvement of convergence through learned corrective updates that remain effective even for inaccurate intermediate solutions. This staggered training enables stable, progressive refinement while maintaining the structure-preserving properties of DEC discretizations. To improve multiscale adaptivity, NHCS introduces a convolutional neural network-based correction term capable of capturing fine-scale solution features via localized updates informed by global context, improving scalability over mesh component-wise neural approaches. Moreover, the proposed framework substantially reduces computational cost by avoiding Newton-Raphson-based training and the associated Jacobian evaluations of parameterized operators. The resulting solver achieves improved efficiency, robustness, and accuracy without compromising numerical stability.</description>

      <title>Transformation front kinetics in deformable ferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials such as magnetic shape-memory alloys possess an intrinsic coupling between material's magnetisation and mechanical deformation. These materials also undergo structural phase transitions, with phase boundaries separating different phases and the kinetics of the phase boundaries governed by the magnetic field and the mechanical stresses. There is a multiplicity of other materials revealing similar phenomena, e.g. magnetic perovskites. To model the propagation of the phase boundaries in deformable magnetic materials at the continuum scale, three ingredients are required: a set of governing equations for the bulk behaviour with coupled magnetic and mechanical degrees of freedom, a dependency of the phase boundary velocity on the governing factors, and a reliable computational method. The expression for the phase boundary velocity is usually obtained within the continuum thermodynamics setting, where the entropy production due to phase boundary propagation is derived, which gives a thermodynamic driving force for the phase boundary kinetics. For deformable ferromagnets, all three elements (bulk behaviour, interface kinetics, and computational approaches) have been explored, but under a number of limitations. The present paper focuses on the derivation of the thermodynamic driving force for transformation fronts in a general magneto-mechanical setting, adapts the cut-finite-element method for transformation fronts in magneto-mechanics, which allows for an exceptionally efficient handling of the propagating interfaces, without modifying the finite-element mesh, and applies the developments to qualitative modelling of magneto-mechanics of magnetic shape-memory alloys.</description>

      <title>GenASiS: General Astrophysical Simulation System. II. Self-gravitating Baryonic Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GenASiS (General Astrophysical Simulation System) is a code being developed initially and primarily, though not exclusively, for the simulation of core-collapse supernovae on the world's leading capability supercomputers. This paper -- the second in a series -- documents capabilities for Newtonian self-gravitating fluid dynamics, including tabulated microphysical equations of state treating nuclei and nuclear matter (`baryonic matter'). Computation of the gravitational potential of a spheroid, and simulation of the gravitational collapse of dust and of an ideal fluid, provide tests of self-gravitation against known solutions. In multidimensional computations of the adiabatic collapse, bounce, and explosion of spherically symmetric pre-supernova progenitors -- which we propose become a standard benchmark for code comparisons -- we find that the explosions are prompt and remain spherically symmetric (as expected), with an average shock expansion speed and total kinetic energy that are inversely correlated with the progenitor mass at the onset of collapse and the compactness parameter.</description>

      <title>The "Robert Boulton" Singularity: Semantic Tunneling and Manifold Unfolding in Recursive AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stability of generative artificial intelligence trained on recursive synthetic data is conventionally monitored via Perplexity (PPL). We demonstrate that PPL is a deceptive metric in context-stabilized regimes (L=128). Using a rigorous sliding-window protocol (N=1500), we identify a novel failure mode termed "Semantic Tunneling." While the Baseline model maintains high grammatical fluency (PPL approx. 83.9), it suffers a catastrophic loss of semantic diversity, converging within seven generations to a single, low-entropy narrative attractor: the "Robert Boulton" Singularity. This phenomenon represents a total collapse of the latent manifold (Global Effective Rank 3.62 -&gt; 2.22), where the model discards diverse world knowledge to optimize for statistically safe syntactic templates. To address this, we apply the Multi-Scale Negative Coupled Information Systems (MNCIS) framework recently established in Hou (2026) [arXiv:2601.11594]. We demonstrate that Adaptive Spectral Negative Coupling (ASNC) acts as a topological operator that actively induces "Manifold Unfolding." MNCIS forces the model to expand its effective rank from the anisotropic baseline of 3.62 to a hyper-diverse state of 5.35, effectively constructing an "Artificial Manifold" that resists the gravitational pull of semantic attractors and preserves the long-tail distribution of the training data.</description>

      <title>Structure-Preserving Learning Improves Geometry Generalization in Neural PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We aim to develop physics foundation models for science and engineering that provide real-time solutions to Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) which preserve structure and accuracy under adaptation to unseen geometries. To this end, we introduce General-Geometry Neural Whitney Forms (Geo-NeW): a data-driven finite element method. We jointly learn a differential operator and compatible reduced finite element spaces defined on the underlying geometry. The resulting model is solved to generate predictions, while exactly preserving physical conservation laws through Finite Element Exterior Calculus. Geometry enters the model as a discretized mesh both through a transformer-based encoding and as the basis for the learned finite element spaces. This explicitly connects the underlying geometry and imposed boundary conditions to the solution, providing a powerful inductive bias for learning neural PDEs, which we demonstrate improves generalization to unseen domains. We provide a novel parameterization of the constitutive model ensuring the existence and uniqueness of the solution. Our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on several steady-state PDE benchmarks, and provides a significant improvement over conventional baselines on out-of-distribution geometries.</description>

      <title>Intrinsically DRC-Compliant Nanophotonic Design via Learned Generative Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse design has enabled the systematic design of ultra-compact and high-performance nanophotonic components. Yet enforcing foundry design rules during inverse design remains a major challenge, as optimized devices frequently violate constraints on minimum feature size and spacing. Existing fabrication-constrained approaches typically rely on penalty terms, projection filters, or heuristic binarization schedules, which restrict the accessible design space, require extensive hyperparameter tuning, and often fail to guarantee compliance throughout the optimization trajectory. Here, we introduce a framework for nanophotonic inverse design with intrinsic enforcement of design rules through a generative reparameterization of the design space, restricting optimization to a learned manifold of DRC-compliant geometries. We validate this paradigm by designing representative silicon photonic components including broadband power splitters, spectral duplexers, and mode converters operating across the 1,500-1,600 nm band for both electron-beam lithography and photolithography platforms. Across all devices, the manifold-based formulation reaches state-of-the-art performance metrics with over a 5-fold reduction in computational cost compared to pixel-based representations, while ensuring fabrication-compatible geometries throughout the entire design process. By treating fabrication constraints as a fundamental property of the design representation rather than an external penalty, this work establishes a direct pathway toward broadly applicable, platform-agnostic, and intrinsically DRC-compliant nanophotonics.</description>

      <title>Fully Automated Adaptive Parameter Selection for 3-D High-order Nystr\"om Boundary Integral Equation Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an adaptive Chebyshev-based Boundary Integral Equation (CBIE) solver for electromagnetic scattering from smooth perfect electric conductor (PEC) objects. The proposed approach eliminates manual parameter tuning by introducing (i) a unified adaptive quadrature strategy for automatic selection of the near-singular interaction distance and (ii) an adaptive computation of all self- and near-singular precomputation integrals to a prescribed accuracy using Gauss-Kronrod (h-adaptive) or Clenshaw-Curtis (p-adaptive) rules and singularity-resolving changes of variables. Both h-adaptive and p-adaptive schemes are explored within this framework, ensuring high-order accuracy and robustness across a broad range of geometries without loss of efficiency. Numerical results for canonical and complex CAD geometries demonstrate that the adaptive solver achieves accuracy and convergence rates comparable to optimally tuned fixed-grid CBIE implementations, while offering automation and scalability to electrically large, geometrically complex problems.</description>

      <title>A Method for Thermal Radiation Transport Using Backward Characteristic Tracing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal radiation transport is a challenging problem in computational physics that has long been approached primarily in one of a few standard ways: approximate moment methods (for instance P$_1$ or M$_1$), implicit Monte Carlo, discrete ordinates, and long characteristics. In this work we consider the efficacy of the Method of (Long) Characteristics (MOC) applied to thermal radiation transport. Along the way we develop three major ideas: transporting MOC particles backwards in time from quadrature grids at the end of the timestep, limiting the computational cost of these backward characteristics by terminating transport once optical depths along rays become sufficiently large, and timestep-dependent closures with multigroup MOC solutions for a gray low-order system. We apply this method to a suite of standard radiation transport and radiation hydrodynamics test problems. We compare the method to several standard analytic and semi-analytic solutions, as well as implicit Monte Carlo, P$_1$, and discrete ordinates (S$_n$). We see that the method: gives excellent agreement with known results, has stability for large time steps, has the diffusion limit for large spatial cells, and achieves $\sim$20-70\% performance improvement when terminating optical depths at O(10-100) in the grey Marshak and crooked pipe problems. However, for the Coax radiation-hydrodynamics problem, we see that MOC is approximately two to three times slower than IMC-DDMC and S$_n$ in its current implementation.</description>

      <title>Ultrastable 2D glasses and packings explained by local centrosymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the most recent numerical data by Bolton-Lum \emph{et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. 136, 058201 (2026)], we demonstrate that ideal ultrastable glasses in the athermal limit (or ultrastable ideal 2D disk packings) possess a remarkably high degree of local centrosymmetry. In particular, we find that the inversion-symmetry order parameter for local force transmission introduced in Milkus and Zaccone, [Phys. Rev. 93, 094204 (2016)], is as high as $F_{IS}= 0.93546$, to be compared with $F_{IS}=1$ for perfect centrosymmetric crystals free of defects, and with $F_{IS} \sim 0.3-0.5$ for standard random packings. This observation provides a clear, natural explanation for the ultra-high shear modulus of ideal packings and ideal glasses, because the high centrosymmetry prevents non-affine relaxations which decrease the shear modulus. The same mechanism explains the absence of boson peak-like soft vibrational modes. These results also confirm what was found previous work, i.e. that the bond-orientational order parameter is a very poor correlator for the vibrational and mechanical</description>

      <title>Vacancy defects in square-triangle tilings and their implications for quasicrystals formed by square-shoulder particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Almost all observed square-triangle quasicrystals in soft-matter systems contain a large number of point-like defects, yet the role these defects play in stabilizing the quasicrystal phase remains poorly understood. In this work, we investigate the thermodynamic role of such defects in the widely observed 12-fold symmetric square-triangle quasicrystal. We develop a new Monte Carlo simulation to compute the configurational entropy of square-triangle tilings augmented to contain two types of irregular hexagons as defect tiles. We find that the introduction of defects leads to a notable entropy gain, with each defect contributing considerably more than a conventional vacancy in a periodic crystal. Intriguingly, the entropy gain is not simply due to individual defect types but isamplified by their combinatorial mixing. We then apply our findings to a microscopic model of core-corona particles interacting via a square-shoulder potential. By combining the configurational entropy with vibrational free-energy calculations, we predict the equilibrium defect concentration and confirm that the quasicrystalline phase contains a higher concentration of point-defects than a typical periodic crystal. These results provide a new understanding of the prominence of observed defects in soft-matter quasicrystals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03508v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Choosing a basis set is the first step of a quantum chemistry calculation and it sets its maximum accuracy. This choice of orbitals is limited by strong technical constraints as one must be able to compute a large number of six dimensional Coulomb integrals from these orbitals. Here we use tensor network techniques to construct representations of orbitals that essentially lift these technical constraints. We show that a large class of orbitals can be put into ``tensorized'' form including the Gaussian orbitals, Slater orbitals, linear combination thereof as well as new orbitals beyond the above. Our method provides a path for building more accurate and more compact basis sets beyond what has been accessible with previous technology. As an illustration, we construct optimized tensorized orbitals and obtain a 85% reduction of the error on the energy of the $H_2$ molecules with respect to a reference double zeta calculation (cc-pvDz) of the same size.</description>

      <title>A Neural Operator Emulator for Coastal and Riverine Shallow Water Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coastal regions and river floodplains are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of extreme weather events. Accurate real-time forecasting of hydrodynamic processes in these areas is essential for infrastructure planning and climate adaptation. Yet high-fidelity numerical models are often too computationally expensive for real-time use, and lower-cost approaches, such as traditional model order reduction algorithms or conventional neural networks, typically struggle to generalize to out-of-distribution conditions. In this study, we present the Multiple-Input Temporal Operator Network (MITONet), a novel autoregressive neural emulator that employs latent-space operator learning to efficiently approximate high-dimensional numerical solvers for complex, nonlinear problems that are governed by time-dependent, parameterized partial differential equations. We showcase MITONet's predictive capabilities by forecasting regional tide-driven dynamics in the Shinnecock Inlet in New York and riverine flow in a section of the Red River in Louisiana, both described by the two-dimensional shallow-water equations (2D SWE), while incorporating initial conditions, time-varying boundary conditions, and domain parameters such as the bottom friction coefficient. Despite the distinct flow regimes, the complex geometries and meshes, and the wide range of bottom friction coefficients studied, MITONet displays consistently high predictive skill, with anomaly correlation coefficients above 0.9, a maximum normalized root mean square error of 0.011, and computational speedups between 100x-1,250x, even for 175 days of autoregressive rollout forecast from random initial conditions and with unseen parameter values.</description>

      <title>MetaSym: A Symplectic Meta-learning Framework for Physical Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16667v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scalable and generalizable physics-aware deep learning has long been considered a significant challenge with various applications across diverse domains ranging from robotics to molecular dynamics. Central to almost all physical systems are symplectic forms, the geometric backbone that underpins fundamental invariants like energy and momentum. In this work, we introduce a novel deep learning framework, MetaSym. In particular, MetaSym combines a strong symplectic inductive bias obtained from a symplectic encoder, and an autoregressive decoder with meta-attention. This principled design ensures that core physical invariants remain intact, while allowing flexible, data efficient adaptation to system heterogeneities. We benchmark MetaSym with highly varied and realistic datasets, such as a high-dimensional spring-mesh system Otness et al. (2021), an open quantum system with dissipation and measurement backaction, and robotics-inspired quadrotor dynamics. Crucially, we fine-tune and deploy MetaSym on real-world quadrotor data, demonstrating robustness to sensor noise and real-world uncertainty. Across all tasks, MetaSym achieves superior few-shot adaptation and outperforms larger state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.</description>

      <title>Slip and friction at fluid-solid interfaces: Concept of adsorption layer</title>

Abstract: When a fluid flows past a solid surface, its macroscopic motion arises from a subtle interplay between microscopic hydrodynamic and thermodynamic effects at the fluid-solid interface. Classical hydrodynamic models often rely on an unphysical no-slip boundary condition or an arbitrarily prescribed slip length, yet both approaches lack a rigorous physical foundation. This work introduces the concept of an Adsorption Layer (AL), an interfacial region of thickness delta l, where fluid-solid molecular interactions regulate both surface adsorption/depletion and interfacial slip. By applying the energy minimization principle, we derive balance equations within the AL that couple fluid-solid friction, viscous stresses, and surface adsorption dynamics. This framework establishes a self-consistent thermodynamic coupling between the AL and the bulk fluid, unlike conventional sharp-interface models. A key finding is the often-overlooked role and coupling of pressure and chemical potential gradients in the direction normal to the interface. This theoretical advance successfully explains the confinement-induced enhancement of water slippage in carbon nanotubes, quantitatively agreeing with molecular dynamics and experimental data -- an effect classical slip models fail to reproduce. Furthermore, when extended to binary liquids, the theory captures spatial variations in slip velocity near moving contact lines, highlighting the role of interfacial friction in shaping local flow. Our results demonstrate that the slip length is not a fixed material constant but rather an emergent, geometry- and composition-dependent property arising from coupled interfacial thermodynamics and hydrodynamics. This framework provides a physically grounded description of interfacial momentum transfer, with significant implications for microfluidics and surface engineering.</description>

      <title>Continuous-time parametrization of neural quantum states for quantum dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08418v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural quantum states are a promising framework for simulating many-body quantum dynamics, as they can represent states with volume-law entanglement. As time evolves, the neural network parameters are typically optimized at discrete time steps to approximate the wave function at each point in time. Given the differentiability of the wave function stemming from the Schr\"odinger equation, here we impose a time-continuous and differentiable parameterization of the neural network by expressing its parameters as linear combinations of temporal basis functions with trainable, time-independent coefficients. We test this ansatz, referred to as the smooth neural quantum state (\textit{s}-NQS) with a loss function defined over an extended time interval, under a sudden quench of a non-integrable many-body quantum spin chain. We demonstrate accurate time evolution using a restricted Boltzmann machine as the instantaneous neural network architecture. We show that the parameterization enables accurate simulations with fewer variational parameters, independent of time-step resolution. Furthermore, the smooth neural quantum state also allows us to initialize and evaluate the wave function at times not included in the training set, both within and beyond the training interval.</description>

      <title>The hot-electron closure of the moment-based gyrokinetic plasma model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the hot-electron-limit (HEL) closure for the moment hierarchy used to solve the gyrokinetic equations, known as the gyromoment (GM) approach. By expanding the gyroaveraging kernels in the small temperature ratio limit, {\tau} = Ti/Te &lt;&lt; 1, and retaining only the essential O({\tau}) terms, we obtain a closed system for the density, parallel velocity, and parallel and perpendicular temperatures. In a Z-pinch geometry, the GM system with the HEL closure is analytically equivalent to the one developed by Ivanov et al. (2022). Numerical benchmarks confirm the closure's accuracy, reproducing established linear growth rates, nonlinear heat transport, and low collisionality dynamics. An extension to the tokamak-relevant s-{\alpha} geometry and a comparison with gyrokinetic simulations reveal the capabilities and limitations of the HEL-closed GM model: while transport levels and temporal dynamics are qualitatively preserved even at {\tau}=1, the absence of higher-order kinetic moments prevents an accurate prediction of the Dimits shift and of transport suppression.</description>

      <title>Towards fully predictive gyrokinetic full-f simulations: validation and triangularity studies in TCV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11874</link>

Abstract: Designing economical magnetic confinement fusion power plants motivates computational tools that can estimate plasma behavior from engineering parameters without direct reliance on experimental measurement of the plasma profiles. In this work, we present full-$f$ global gyrokinetic (GK) turbulence simulations of edge and scrape-off layer turbulence in tokamaks that use only magnetic geometry, heating power, and particle inventory as inputs. Unlike many modeling approaches that employ free parameters fitted to experimental data, raising uncertainties when extrapolating to reactor scales, his approach directly simulates turbulence and resulting profiles through GK without such empirical adjustments. This is achieved via an adaptive sourcing algorithm in Gkeyll that strictly controls energy injection and emulates particle sourcing due to neutral recycling. We show that the simulated kinetic profiles compare reasonably well with Thomson scattering and Langmuir probe data for Tokamak \`{a} Configuration Variable (TCV) discharge #65125, and that the simulations reproduce characteristic features such as blob transport and self-organized electric fields. Applying the same framework to study triangularity effects suggests mechanisms contributing to the improved confinement reported for negative triangularity (NT). Simulations of TCV discharges #65125 and #65130 indicate that NT increases the $E \times B$ flow shear (by about 20% in these cases), which correlates with reduced turbulent losses and a modest change in the distribution of power exhaust to the vessel wall. While the physical models contain approximations that can be refined in future work, the predictive capability demonstrated here, evolving multiple profile relaxation times with kinetic electron and ion models in hundreds of GPU hours, indicates the feasibility of using Gkeyll to support design studies of fusion devices.</description>

      <title>From Block Diagrams to Bloch Spheres: Graphical Quantum Circuit Simulation in LabVIEW</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00643v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As quantum computing transitions from theoretical physics to engineering applications, there is a growing need for accessible simulation tools that bridge the gap between abstract linear algebra and practical implementation. While text-based frameworks (like Qiskit or Cirq) are standard, they often present a steep learning curve for students and engineers accustomed to graphical system design. This paper introduces QuVI (Quantum Virtual Instrument), an open-source quantum circuit toolkit developed natively within the NI LabVIEW environment. Moving beyond initial proof-of-concept models, QuVI establishes a robust framework that leverages LabVIEW's "dataflow" paradigm, in which wires represent data and nodes represent operations, to provide an intuitive, visual analog to standard quantum circuit notation while enabling the seamless integration of classical control structures like loops and conditionals. The toolkit's capabilities are demonstrated by constructing and visualizing fundamental quantum algorithms and verifying results against theoretical predictions. By translating "Block Diagrams" directly into quantum state evolutions ("Bloch Spheres"), QuVI offers educators and researchers a powerful platform for prototyping quantum logic without leaving the graphical engineering workspace.</description>
