      <title>Fourier Synthetic Aperture-based Time-resolved Terahertz Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz microscopy has attracted attention owing to distinctive characteristics of the THz frequency region, particularly non-ionizing photon energy, spectral fingerprint, and transparency to most nonpolar materials. Nevertheless, the well-known Rayleigh diffraction limit imposed on THz waves commonly constrains the resultant imaging resolution to values beyond the millimeter scale, consequently limiting the applicability in numerous emerging applications for chemical sensing and complex media imaging. In this theoretical and numerical work, we address this challenge by introducing a new imaging approach, based on acquiring high-spatial frequencies by adapting the Fourier synthetic aperture approach to the terahertz spectral range, thus surpassing the diffraction-limited resolution. Our methodology combines multi-angle terahertz pulsed illumination with time-resolved field measurements, as enabled by the state-of-the-art time-domain spectroscopy technique. We demonstrate the potential of the approach for hyperspectral terahertz imaging of semi-transparent samples and show that the technique can reconstruct spatial and temporal features of complex inhomogeneous samples with subwavelength resolution.</description>

      <title>Dual wavelength brillouin laser terahertz source stabilized to carbonyl sulfide rotational transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical-based terahertz sources are important for many burgeoning scientific and technological applications. Among such applications is precision spectroscopy of molecules, which exhibit rotational transitions at terahertz frequencies. Stemming from precision spectroscopy is frequency discrimination and stabilization of terahertz sources. Because many molecular species exist in the gas phase at room temperature, their transitions are prime candidates for practical terahertz frequency references. We demonstrate the stabilization of a low phase-noise, dual-wavelength Brillouin laser (DWBL) terahertz oscillator to a rotational transition of carbonyl sulfide (\ce{OCS}). We achieve an instability of $1.2\times10^{-12}/\sqrt{\tau}$, where $\tau$ is the averaging time in seconds. The signal-to-noise ratio and intermodulation limitations of the experiment are also discussed. We thus demonstrate a highly stable and spectrally pure terahertz frequency source. Our presented architecture will likely benefit metrology, spectroscopy, precision terahertz studies, and beyond.</description>

      <title>A Flat Plasmonic Biosensing Interface on Optical Fiber End-Facet via SPP-MIM Hybridization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We found that the specific dispersion of metal-insulator-metal (MIM) waveguide allows the hybridization of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) and the waveguide, which is not possible with dielectric waveguides. The SPP-MIM hybridization structure forms such a meta-film that integrates the previously incompatible respective merits of SPR and LSPR, including flat interfaces, high sensitivities, short evanescent fields and easy coupling with confined light. On the other hand, to achieve stable and reproducible performance is one of the greatest unresolved challenges for the development of nanophotonic biosensors. We point out that the key is to obtain well-controlled biomolecular behaviors using simple physical interfaces, for which the SPP-MIM meta-film provides a capable solution. We embed the SPP-MIM meta-film with a plasmonic crystal cavity and integrate it on a single-mode fiber's end-facet to detect biomolecular interactions. This device demonstrates highly reproducible sensorgrams and convincing detection of biotinylated proteins at down to 30 fM, with the sensorgrams following the Langmuir model. By unprecedentedly having both high sensitivity and high reproducibility, our device proposal provides a comprehensive solution for optical fiber-tip plasmonic devices to turn into a useful industrial biosensing technology.</description>

      <title>Light Trapping by Non-Hermitian Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the exceptional features of non-Hermitian systems is the unidirectional wave interactions. Simultaneous modulation of the real and the imaginary part of the interaction potentials (of the refractive index and the gain/loss in the case of optical systems) can result in unequal coupling coefficients between the fields of different parts of the system. The unidirectional coupling can also be arranged not only between the internal fields of the system but also between internal fields and external radiation. At a particular (exceptional) point the situation can be achieved, that the external radiation is efficiently coupled into the system, but the internal radiation cannot escape backwards. In this way, the incident radiation can be trapped inside the non-Hermitian system and, eventually, can be efficiently absorbed there. We realize this idea in non-Hermitically modulated thin films. The modulation consists of a Hermitian part - the periodic corrugation of the surfaces of a thin film, and a non-Hermitian part - the modulation of losses along the film. We prove numerically and demonstrate experimentally that the incident radiation, coupled with such a non-Hermitian thin film, is unidirectionally trapped into a planar mode of the film, does not escape from the film (or escape weakly due to experimental imperfections), and is efficiently absorbed there.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Adaptive Reconfiguration of Light Structure in Optical Fibers with Programmable Silicon Photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The demand for structured light with a reconfigurable spatial and polarization distribution has been increasing across a wide range of fundamental and advanced photonics applications, including microscopy, imaging, sensing, communications, and quantum information processing. Nevertheless, the unique challenge in manipulating light structure after optical fiber transmission is the necessity to dynamically address the inherent unknown fiber transmission matrix, which can be affected by factors like variations in the fiber stress and inter-modal coupling. In this study, we demonstrated that the beam structure at the fiber end including its spatial and polarization distribution can be precisely and adaptively reconfigured by a programmable silicon photonic processor, without prior knowledge of the optical fiber systems and their changes in the transmission matrices. Our demonstrated photonic chip can generate and control the full set of spatial and polarization modes or their superposition in a two-mode few-mode optical fiber. High-quality beam structures can be obtained in experiments. In addition, efficient generation is achieved by our proposed chip-to-fiber emitter while using a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor compatible fabrication technology. Our findings present a scalable pathway towards achieving a portable and reliable system capable of achieving precise control, efficient emission, and adaptive reconfiguration for structured light in optical fibers.</description>

      <title>Oscillator Chain: A Simple Model for Universal Description of Excitation of Waveguiding Modes in Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A universal mathematical description of various micro-optical schemes related with Fano resonances is missing. This concerns, for instance, the novel micro-optical designs, such as micro-ring resonators, or especially thin films, couple to a continuum, and thus showing Fano resonances. Usually, such micro-optic circuits are simulated numerically, frequently by the use of commercial software. We fill this gap of the lack of universal analytical model. by introducing and exploring a simple mechanical equivalent, the oscillator chain, to simulate such schemes involving Fano resonances. The model does not necessary provide the rigorous description of more complicated micro-optical schemes, however does capture the main properties of such Fano-related optical systems. The model captures different modifications of thin film: thin film with amplification, non-Hermitical thin films, and others. It also covers the case of multiple Fano resonances in thin film. The model is compared with the rigorously calculated (Rigorous Coupled Wave analysis) wave propagation in thin films.</description>

      <title>Lying mirror</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an all-optical system, termed the "lying mirror", to hide input information by transforming it into misleading, ordinary-looking patterns that effectively camouflage the underlying image data and deceive the observers. This misleading transformation is achieved through passive light-matter interactions of the incident light with an optimized structured diffractive surface, enabling the optical concealment of any form of secret input data without any digital computing. These lying mirror designs were shown to camouflage different types of input image data, exhibiting robustness against a range of adversarial manipulations, including random image noise as well as unknown, random rotations, shifts, and scaling of the object features. The feasibility of the lying mirror concept was also validated experimentally using a structured micro-mirror array along with multi-wavelength illumination at 480, 550 and 600 nm, covering the blue, green and red image channels. This framework showcases the power of structured diffractive surfaces for visual information processing and might find various applications in defense, security and entertainment.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Spectral fluorescence microscopy via Event-based &amp; CMOS image-sensor fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a widefield fluorescence microscope that integrates an event-based image sensor (EBIS) with a CMOS image sensor (CIS) for ultra-fast microscopy with spectral distinction capabilities. The EBIS achieves temporal resolution of $\sim10\thinspace\mu$s ($\sim\thinspace$50,000 frames/s), while the CIS provides diffraction-limited spatial resolution. A diffractive optical element encodes spectral information into a diffractogram, which is recorded by the CIS. The diffractogram is processed using a deep neural network to resolve the fluorescence of two beads, whose emission peaks are separated by only 7 nm and exhibit an 88\% spectral overlap. We validate our microscope by imaging the capillary flow of fluorescent beads, demonstrating a significant advancement in ultra-fast spectral microscopy. This technique holds broad potential for elucidating foundational dynamic biological processes.</description>

      <title>Design and Optimization of a Metamaterial Absorber for Solar Energy Harvesting in the THz Frequency Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the design and comprehensive characterization of a novel three-layer metamaterial absorber, engineered to exploit the unique optical properties of gold, vanadium dioxide, and silicon dioxide. At the core of this design, silicon dioxide serves as a robust substrate that supports an intricately structured layer of gold and a top layer of vanadium dioxide. This configuration is optimized to harness and enhance absorption capabilities effectively across a broadband terahertz (THz) spectrum. The absorber demonstrates an extensive absorption bandwidth of 3.00 THz, spanning frequencies from 2.414 THz to 5.417 THz. Remarkably, throughout this range, the device maintains a consistently high absorption efficiency, exceeding 90%. This efficiency is characterized by two sharp absorption peaks located at 2.638 THz and 5.158 THz, which signify the precise tuning of the metamaterial structure to interact optimally with specific THz frequencies. The absorbance of the proposed model is almost equal to 99%. This absorber is polarization insensitive. The development of this absorber involved a series of theoretical simulations backed by experimental validations, which helped refine the metamaterial's geometry and material composition. This process illuminated the critical role of the dielectric properties of silicon dioxide and the plasmonic effects induced by gold and vanadium dioxide layers, which collectively contribute to the high-performance metrics observed.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A transverse radiative heat flux induced by the gradient of spin angular momentum of photons in non-reciprocal systems is predicted. This thermal analog of the inverse spin Hall effect is analyzed in magneto-optical networks exhibiting C4 symmetry, under the action of spatially variable external magnetic fields. This finding opens new avenues for thermal management and energy conversion with non-reciprocal systems through a localized and dynamic control of the spin angular momentum of light.</description>

      <title>Shot-noise limited, 10 MHz swept-source optical coherence tomography for retinal imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Akinetic swept-sources are essential for high-speed optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging. Time-stretched supercontinuum (TSSC) lasers have proven to be efficient for multi-MHz swept-sources. However, lack of low-noise broadband lasers and of large dispersion devices in the water low-absorption band at 1060 nm have limited the biomedical applications of TSSC lasers. In this letter, an approach to tune the wavelength around 1050 nm over 90 nm with low-noise at 10 MHz is presented. This is based on all-normal dispersion (ANDi) supercontinuum dynamics, and employs a long chirped fiber Bragg grating (CFBG) to time-stretch a broadband pulse with a duty cycle of 93 %. Retinal images are demonstrated, with a sensitivity of 84 dB - approaching the shot noise limit. We believe this high-speed low-noise swept-source will greatly promote the development of OCT techniques for biomedical applications.</description>

      <title>Exact Solutions Disentangle Higher-Order Topology in 2D Non-Hermitian Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the exact closed-form solutions for higher-order topological states as well as explicit energy-spectrum relationships in two-dimensional (2D) non-Hermitian multi-orbital lattices with generalized boundary conditions. These analytical solutions unequivocally confirm that topological edge states in a 2D non-Hermitian system which feature point-gap topology must undergo the non-Hermitian skin effect along the edge. Under double open boundary conditions, the occurrence of the non-Hermitian skin effect for either topological edge states or bulk states can be accurately predicted by our proposed winding numbers. We unveil that the zero-energy topological corner state only manifests itself on a corner where two nearby gapped edge states intersect, and thus can either disappear completely or strengthen drastically due to the non-Hermitian skin effect of gapped topological edge states. Our analytical results offer direct insight into the non-Bloch band topology in two or higher dimensions and trigger experimental investigations into related phenomena such as quadrupole topological insulators and topological lasing.</description>

      <title>Approaching High-efficiency Spatial Light Modulation with Lossy Phase-change Material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prevalent high intrinsic absorption in the crystalline state of phase-change materials (PCMs), typically leads to a decline in modulation efficiency for phase-change metasurfaces, underutilizing their potential for quasi-continuous phase-state tuning. This research introduces a concise design approach that maximizes the exploitation of the quasi-continuous phase transition properties of PCM, achieving high-efficiency spatial light modulation. By optimizing the metasurface design, the phase modulation process is strategically localized in a low crystallization ratio state, significantly reducing the impact of material absorption on modulation efficiency. Utilizing GSST as an example, numerical simulations demonstrate a minimum reflectance of 46.5% at the target wavelength of 1550 nm, with a phase modulation depth of 246.6{\deg}. The design is fruther extended to dynamic polarization modulation by incorporating structural anisotropy, enabling independent control of amplitude and phase modulation in orthogonal polarization directions. This strategy not only circumvents the efficiency limitations of crystalline states but also harnesses the full potential of PCMs for multifunctional photonic applications.</description>

      <title>MINFLUX -- molecular resolution with minimal photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical super-resolution microscopy is a key technology for structural biology that optimally complements electron microscopy because of its high contrast and live-cell compatibility. MINFLUX is an emerging super-resolution technique that measures the precise position of single fluorophores by targeted scanning of a patterned excitation beam featuring a minimum. It achieves unprecedented localization precision for a given number of detected photons. In combination with switchable fluorophores, it can be used for super-resolution imaging with nanometer resolution. For tracking of single fluorophores, it greatly outperforms camera-based techniques and achieves nanometer spatial and sub-millisecond temporal resolution over long tracks. Here, we introduce the basic principle of MINFLUX and explain how it can reach such high photon efficiencies. We then discuss the potential and limitations of MINFLUX for super-resolution imaging and single-fluorophore tracking, describe recent extensions and variations of MINFLUX and give an outlook to future developments.</description>

      <title>On-demand acoustic shaping of Mossbauer gamma-ray photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a technique that makes it possible to transform the intensity of a quasi-monochromatic single-photon wave packet, emitted by a radioactive M\"ossbauer gamma-ray source, into a sequence of short bursts with an arbitrary number of bursts, including a single burst. In addition, the technique allows one to individually and independently control, on demand, the moments of the burst appearance, as well as the peak intensity, duration and shape of each burst in the sequence. The technique is based on the transmission of M\"ossbauer (recoilless) photons through a resonantly absorbing medium, which is rapidly displaced at some moments of time relative to the source (or vice versa) along the photon propagation direction at a distance less than the photon wavelength, and returned to its original position. The burst durations can be comparable to the duration of the single-photon pulses produced by synchrotrons but have the controlled spectral-temporal characteristics. We show that the proposed technique can be implemented on the basis of currently available equipment with use of 14.4-keV recoilless photons, emitted by Co-57 source, and Fe-57 absorber, which opens up prospects for its applications in M\"ossbauer spectroscopy and x-ray quantum optics.</description>

      <title>Polarization-Insensitive Integration of Nanoparticle-on-a-Slit Cavities with Dielectric Waveguides for On-chip Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amongst the available plasmonic nanostructures, nanoparticle-on-a-mirror (NPoM) cavities - consisting of metal nanoparticles separated from a metal mirror by a molecular-size monolayer - provide the ultimate light confinement in gaps even below 1 nm. A variation of the NPoM cavity is the nanoparticle-on-a-slit (NPoS) configuration, where the nanoparticle is placed on a functionalized narrow slit created on a metal plate so that there are two nanometric-scale gaps for plasmonic localization. Interestingly, the NPoS cavity can also perform as a dual dipole antenna to localize both infrared and visible light, which is useful in molecular optomechanics. For many applications, it is desirable to integrate such cavities on a chip and provide access to (and collection from) the hot spots via photonic integrated waveguides. In this work, we propose, design, and experimentally demonstrate the efficient integration of NPoS plasmonic cavities with dielectric waveguides on a silicon-based chip. To this end, we use silicon-nitride slot waveguides and show that both the fundamental TE and TM modes can be used to drive the cavity, making our device polarization-independent. We demonstrate our concept by performing surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy of BPT molecules on a chip fabricated by standard silicon fabrication tools mixed with the deterministic positioning of gold nanospheres on the gap of a plasmonic dipole antenna.</description>

      <title>Surface acoustic waves Brillouin photonics on a silicon nitride chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seamlessly integrating stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) in a low-loss and mature photonic integration platform remains a complicated task. Virtually all current approaches fall short in simultaneously achieving strong SBS, low losses, and technological scalability. In this work we incorporate stong SBS into a standard silicon nitride platform by a simple deposition of a tellurium oxide layer, a commonly used material for acousto-optic modulators. In these heterogeneously integrated waveguides, we harness novel SBS interactions actuated by surface acoustic waves (SAWs) leading to more than two orders of magnitude gain enhancement. Three novel applications are demonstrated in this platform: (i) a silicon nitride Brillouin amplifier with 5 dB net optical gain, (ii) a compact intermodal stimulated Brillouin laser (SBL) capable of high purity radio frequency (RF) signal generation with 7 Hz intrinsic linewidth, and (iii) a widely tunable microwave photonic notch filter with ultra-narrow linewidth of 2.2 MHz enabled by Brillouin induced opacity. These advancements can unlock an array of new RF and optical technologies to be directly integrated in silicon nitride.</description>

      <title>A Liquid-Core Fiber Platform for Classical and Entangled Two-Photon Absorption Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a toluene-filled fiber platform for two-photon absorption measurements. By confining both the light and molecular sample inside the 5 $\mu$m hollow core of the fiber, we increase the distance over which the nonlinear light-matter interaction occurs. With only a 7.3 nL excitation volume, we measure classical two-photon absorption (C2PA) at an average laser power as low as 1.75 nW, which is a 45-fold improvement over a conventional free-space technique. We use this platform to attempt to measure entangled two-photon absorption (E2PA), a process with a limited operating regime due to a crossover in dominating processes from E2PA to C2PA as photon flux is increased. Recently, several teams of researchers have reported that E2PA cross sections are much smaller than previously claimed. As a result, the process dominates at photon fluxes so low that it is extremely difficult or impossible to measure using conventional free-space techniques. In this report, we implement the first E2PA measurement using a waveguide. We see no evidence of E2PA, and we set an upper bound on the cross section consistent with these recent reports.</description>

      <title>Surface-Emitting Resonator Interference Microscopy for Label-Free Monitoring of Membrane Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cellular membrane dynamics play an important role in a variety of physiological processes. However, due to the stringent light-coupling conditions required for exciting evanescent waves, label-free mapping of cellular membrane dynamics on curved substrates remains challenging. Here, we report surface-emitting resonator interference microscopy (SERIM), which employs the evanescent wave naturally present in the near-field region of a whispering gallery mode (WGM) resonator to probe the subcellular membrane dynamics. The WGM resonator provides strong optical feedback for enhancing the light-mattering interaction and also provides a biomimetic curvature interface to investigate the membrane dynamics. The interaction of the evanescent wave with the cell membrane caused significant scattering, forming a highly sensitive interference pattern. We found that the time-resolved interference patterns can be utilized to extract subcellular membrane dynamics with a diffractive limited spatial resolution. We further employed the SERIM to investigate the spatial heterogeneity of membrane dynamics during migration, and also stimulus responses to temperature and drugs. In striking contrast to the conventional label-free methods, the easy excitation of the evanescent wave makes SERIM a versatile label-free strategy for studying cellular behavior on a curved surface. Our work holds promise for sensitive detection of subtle biochemical and biophysical information during cell-substrate interaction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an experimental platform for linear-optical quantum information processing. Our setup utilizes multiphoton generation using a high-quality single-photon source, which is demultiplexed across multiple spatial channels, a custom-designed, programmable, low-loss photonic chip, and paired with high-efficiency single-photon detectors. We demonstrate the platform's capability in producing heralded arbitrary two-qubit dual-rail encoded states, a crucial building block for large-scale photonic quantum computers. The programmable chip was fully characterized through a calibration process that allowed us to create a numerical model accounting for fabrication imperfections and measurement errors. As a result, using on-chip quantum state tomography (QST), we achieved high-fidelity quantum state preparation, with a fidelity of 98.5\% specifically for the Bell state.</description>

      <title>Simulating quantum emitters in arbitrary photonic environments using FDTD: beyond the semi-classical regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a numerical algorithm that integrates quantum two-level systems (TLSs) into the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) framework for simulating quantum emitters in arbitrary 3D photonic environments. Conventional methods struggle with these systems due to their semi-classical nature and spurious self-interactions that arise when a TLS is driven by its own radiation field. We address these issues by determining the correct electric field for driving the TLS, as well as the current source used in FDTD for modeling photon emission. Our method, focusing on single-excitation states, employs a total field-incident field (TF-IF) technique to eliminate self-interactions, enabling precise simulations of photon emission and scattering. The algorithm also successfully models complex phenomena such as resonant energy transfer, superradiance, and vacuum Rabi splitting. This powerful computational tool is expected to substantially advance research in nanophotonics, quantum physics, and beyond.</description>

Abstract: Scattering problems are the classical tools for modeling of light-matter interaction. In this paper, we investigate the solution of the dipole scattering problem under different incident radiation.s In particular, we compare the two cases of incident plane and spherically incoming fields. With this comparison, we disclose the two distinct groups of current-sourced and current-free scattered fields, which exhibit independent dynamics and dissimilar effects of the scatterer. We demonstrate how these fields by interfering each other make the resultant electric dipole moment of the scattered fields resonant and, thus, give rise to all the spectral features observed in the classical solution for dipole scattering of light.</description>

      <title>Fluorophore signal detection and imaging enhancement in high refractive index nanowire biosensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High refractive index semiconductor nanowires have recently been demonstrated experimentally as an efficient platform for enhancing the signal in fluorescence-based biosensors. Here, we study through modelling how a vertical GaP nanowire (i) enhances the excitation intensity at the position of the fluorophore attached to the nanowire sidewall, (ii) enhances the probability to collect photons emitted from the fluorophore by directing them preferentially into the numerical aperture of the collection objective, and (iii) through the Purcell effect increases the quantum yield of the fluorophore. With appropriate choice for the geometry of the nanowire, we can reach a larger than $10^2$ enhancement in signal compared to a corresponding conventional planar biosensor platform. We model also imaging-based detection. There, we find that thanks to waveguiding in the nanowire, we can beat the limitations set by the depth of view in conventional microscopy, enabling the use of a long nanowire to enhance the binding-area for fluorophores. As an example, we can focus to the top of a 4000 nm long nanowire and reach a 25 times sharper image from a fluorophore at the bottom of the nanowire, as compared to such a 4000 nm defocusing in a conventional planar biosensor platform.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Physics-Informed Neural Networks for the Inverse Design of Finite-Size Hyperuniform Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07878v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we employ multiscale physics-informed neural networks (MscalePINNs) for the inverse retrieval of the spatially inhomogeneous effective permittivity and for the homogenization of finite-size photonic media with stealthy hyperuniform (SHU) disordered geometries. Specifically, we show that MscalePINNs can capture the fast spatial variations of complex fields scattered by arrays of dielectric nanocylinders arranged according to isotropic SHU point patterns, thus enabling a systematic methodology to inversely retrieve their effective dielectric profiles. Our approach extends the recently developed high-frequency homogenization theory of hyperuniform media and retrieves more general permittivity profiles for applications-relevant finite-size SHU systems, unveiling unique features related to their isotropic nature. In particular, we numerically corroborate the existence of a transparency region beyond the long-wavelength approximation, enabling effective and isotropic homogenization even without disorder-averaging, in contrast to the case of uncorrelated Poisson random patterns. The flexible multiscale network approach introduced here enables the efficient inverse design of more general effective media and finite-size metamaterials with isotropic electromagnetic responses beyond the limitations of traditional homogenization theories.</description>

      <title>Intuitive understanding of extinction of small particles in absorbing and active host media within the MLWA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In an absorbing or an active host medium characterized by a complex refractive index $n_2=n_2'+{\rm i}n_2''$, our previously developed modified dipole long-wave approximation (MLWA) is shown to essentially overly with the exact Mie theory results for spherical nanoparticle with radius $a\lesssim 25$ nm ($a\lesssim 20$ nm) in the case of Ag and Au (Al and Mg) nanoparticles. The agreement for Au and Ag (Al and Mg) nanoparticles, slightly better in the case of Au than Ag, continues to be acceptable up to $a\sim 50$ nm ($a\sim 40$ nm), and can be used, at least qualitatively, up to $a\sim 70$~nm ($a\sim 50$ nm) correspondingly. A first order analytic perturbation theory (PT) in a normalized extinction coefficient, $\bar\kappa=n_2''/n_2'$, around a nonabsorbing host is developed within the dipole MLWA and its properties are investigated. It is shown that, in a suitable parameter range, the PT can reliably capture the effect of host absorption or gain on the extinction efficiency of various plasmonic nanoparticles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Excitonic semiconductors such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are attractive for next-generation photovoltaics (PVs) with low cost, light weight, and low material consumption. In WS2 and other TMDCs, the simultaneous large optical constants and strong exciton resonance can result in the primary photogenerated species being self-hybridized exciton-polaritons emerging from the strong coupling of excitons and optical cavity modes formed by the WS2. We show that strong coupling can benefit photovoltaic performance, with external quantum efficiencies and power conversion efficiencies enhanced by an order of magnitude, approaching values of 55 and 2%, respectively. Thickness dependent device characterization is performed to study the polariton dispersion, revealing anomalous internal quantum efficiency and fill factor behavior that are attributed to polariton-modified exciton transport processes. Our results uncover a significant mechanism in the photoconversion process for PVs from high index, excitonic semiconductors and indicate the utility of strong coupling for optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of the thin-film lithium niobate platform has established it as a premier choice for high-performance photonics integration. High-speed optical coherent receivers are essential for supporting the large communication capacities required by data center interconnects. Although high-speed photodiodes have been demonstrated on the thin-film LiNbO3 platform, the development of an ultrahigh-speed optical coherent receiver on this platform has not yet been realized. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate an ultra-wideband PD and ultrahigh-speed optical coherent receiver on an InP-LiNbO3 wafer-level heterogeneous integration platform. The fabricated single PD exhibits a record-high bandwidth of 140 GHz and successfully receives a high-quality 100-Gbaud pulse amplitude modulation (PAM4) signal. Furthermore, a thin-film LiNbO3 optical coherent receiver, featuring a large balanced detection bandwidth of 60 GHz, a large common mode rejection ratio (CMRR) exceeding 20 dB, and a low energy consumption of 9.6 fJ per bit, enables an ultrahigh-speed coherent reception with advanced modulation formats. The single-polarization I-Q coherent receiver, incorporating a compact 2x4 90 optical hybrid and a balanced photodetector array, achieves a receiving capacity of 600 Gbps per channel with 100-Gbaud 64 quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) signal and 512 Gbps per channel with 128-Gbaud 16 QAM signal. Additionally, we demonstrate a long-distance reception of 100 Gbaud quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) and 16 QAM signals over transmission distances of 1040 km and 25 km. A seven-channel single-polarization I-Q coherent receiving chip achieves a total receiving capacity of 3.584 Tbps. This heterogeneous-integrated thin-film LiNbO3 optical coherent receiver shows the potential for Pbps-scale applications in future hyperscale data center interconnects.</description>

      <title>Enhanced optomechanical coupling between an optically levitated particle and an ultrahigh Q optical microcavity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exploring the dynamics of an optically levitated dielectric micro- and nanoparticle is an exciting new subject in quantum science. Recent years have witnessed rapid advancements in attaining quantum-limited optical detection and control of a nanoscale particle by coupling its motion to a high-finesse optical cavity in the resolved-sideband regime. In order to control the particle deeper in the quantum regime, it is necessary to significantly enhance the coupling between the particle and the cavity. Here, we present a novel platform that can allow for achieving this. Our system consists of a conventional optical tweezer and a toroidal optical microcavity with an ultrahigh quality (Q) factor. The optomechanical coupling between the particle and the cavity is established by placing the particle in the near field of the cavity. The significantly reduced mode volume allows us to achieve a 50-fold increase in the single photon optomechanical coupling compared to a conventional Fabry-P\'erot cavity with macroscopic mirrors, while ultralow loss of the cavity brings the system close to the resolved-sideband regime. Our approach paves the way for enabling quantum experiments on levitated mesoscopic particles with high quantum cooperativity near the resolved-sideband regime.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic Focus Measurement System for a Wide-Field Infrared Space Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a technique for measuring focus errors in a cryogenic, wide-field, near-infrared space telescope. The measurements are made with a collimator looking through a large vacuum window, with a reflective cold filter to reduce background thermal infrared loading on the detectors and optics. The vacuum window and cold filter introduce wavefront error which we characterize using an autocollimating microscope. For the $200\textrm{ mm}$ diameter aperture $f/3$ space telescope, SPHEREx, we achieve a focus position measurement with a $\sim15 \textrm{ }\mu \textrm{m systematic}$ and a $\sim 5\textrm{ }\mu \textrm{m statistical}$ error.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Pockels Coefficient of Ferroelectric Nitride ScAlN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nitride ferroelectrics have recently emerged as promising alternatives to oxide ferroelectrics due to their compatibility with mainstream semiconductor processing. ScAlN, in particular, has exhibited remarkable piezoelectric coupling strength ($K^2$) comparable to that of lithium niobate (LN), making it a valuable choice for RF filters in wireless communications. Recently, ScAlN has sparked interest in its use for nanophotonic devices, chiefly due to its large bandgap facilitating operation in blue wavelengths coupled with promises of enhanced nonlinear optical properties such as a large second-order susceptibility ($\chi^{(2)}$). It is still an open question whether ScAlN can outperform oxide ferroelectrics concerning the Pockels effect -- an electro-optic coupling extensively utilized in optical communications devices. In this paper, we present a comprehensive theoretical analysis and experimental demonstration of ScAlN's Pockels effect. Our findings reveal that the electro-optic coupling of ScAlN, despite being weak at low Sc concentration, may be significantly enhanced and exceed LiNbO$_3$ at high levels of Sc doping, which points the direction of continued research efforts to unlock the full potential of ScAlN.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Design Rules for Tunable Emission in Graphene Quantum Dots: A High-Throughput TDDFT and Machine Learning Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations of fluorescence emission energies for 284 distinct graphene quantum dots (GQDs) of varying shapes (square, hexagonal, and amorphous) and sizes ($\sim$1-2 nm). These GQDs are doped with one or two elements from B, N, O, S, and P at dopant percentages of 1.5%, 3%, 5%, and 7%. Our study systematically investigates the trends and patterns in emission energies as a function of shape, size, dopant type and dopant percentage. Twelve structures are identified to have emission wavelengths in the visible spectrum. The emission energies derived from our calculations can guide the formulation of specific GQD mixtures to achieve desired emission spectra within and beyond the visible range for industrial applications. Furthermore, the extensive dataset, including emission energies along with molecular structures generated in this work, creates a DFT dateset for further machine learning studies.</description>

      <title>Testing the tomographic Fermi liquid hypothesis with high-order cyclotron resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05147v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent theoretical studies of carrier-carrier scattering in degenerate two-dimensional systems have revealed radically different relaxation times for odd and even angular harmonics of distribution function. This theoretical concept, dubbed as 'tomographic Fermi liquid', is yet challenging to test with dc electrical measurements as electron scattering weakly affects the electrical resistivity. Here, we show that linewidth and amplitude of electromagnetic absorption at the multiple harmonics of the cyclotron resonance carries all necessary information to test the tomographic Fermi liquid hypothesis. Namely, the height and inverse width of $m$-th order cyclotron resonance ($m \ge 2$) is proportional to the lifetime of $m$-th angular harmonic of electron distribution function $\tau_m$, if probed at wavelengths exceeding the cyclotron radius $R_c$. Measurements of high-order cyclotron resonance at short wavelengths order of $R_c$ also enable a direct determination of all lifetimes $\tau_m$ from a simple linear system of equations that we hereby derive. Extraction of cyclotron resonance lifetimes from an experiment on terahertz photoconductivity in graphene shows that third-order resonance is systematically narrower than second-order one, supporting the prediction of tomographic Fermi liquid hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Molecular Quantum Control Algorithm Design by Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11839v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precision measurements of polyatomic molecules offer an unparalleled paradigm to probe physics beyond the Standard Model. The rich internal structure within these molecules makes them exquisite sensors for detecting fundamental symmetry violations, local position invariance, and dark matter. While trapping and control of diatomic and a few very simple polyatomic molecules have been experimentally demonstrated, leveraging the complex rovibrational structure of more general polyatomics demands the development of robust and efficient quantum control schemes. In this study, we present a general, reinforcement-learning-designed, quantum logic approach to prepare molecular ions in a single, pure quantum state. The reinforcement learning agent optimizes the pulse sequence, each followed by a projective measurement, and probabilistically manipulates the collapse of the quantum system to a single state. The performance of the control algorithm is numerically demonstrated in the case of a CaH$^+$ ion, with up to 96 thermally populated eigenstates and under the disturbance of environmental thermal radiation. We expect that the method developed, with physics-informed learning, will be directly implemented for quantum control of polyatomic molecular ions with densely populated structures, enabling new experimental tests of fundamental theories.</description>
