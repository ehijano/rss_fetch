      <title>Inner-outer factorization of analytic matrix-valued functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a study of inner-outer factorization for analytic matrix-valued functions focusing on representations of the factors in terms of multiplicative integrals. Included is a brief introduction to the theory of multiplicative integrals and an exposition of V. P. Potapov's representation theorem for contractive matrix-valued functions in terms of Blaschke-Potapov factors and multiplicative integrals.</description>

      <title>The Hartogs-Bochner extension for monogenic functions of several vector variables and the Dirac complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Holomorphic functions in several complex variables are generalized to regular functions in several quaternionic variables, and further to monogenic functions of several vector variables, which are annihilated by several Dirac operators on $k$ copies of the Euclidean space $\mathbb R^n$. As the Dolbeault complex in complex analysis, the Dirac complex resolving several Dirac operators plays the fundamental role to investigate monogenic functions. Although the spaces in the Dirac complex are complicated irreducible modules of ${\rm GL}(k),$ we give a simple characterization of the first four spaces, which allows us to write down first three operators in the Dirac complex explicitly and to show this part to be an elliptic complex. Then the PDE method can be applied to obtain solutions to the non-homogeneous several Dirac equations under the compatibility condition, which implies the Hartogs' phenomenon for monogenic functions. Moreover, we find the boundary version of several Dirac operators and introduce the notion of a tangentially monogenic function, corresponding to tangential Cauchy-Riemann operator and CR functions in several complex variables, and establish the Hartogs-Bochner extension for tangentially monogenic functions on the boundary of a domain.</description>

      <title>The Critical Beta-splitting Random Tree IV: Mellin analysis of Leaf Height</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the critical beta-splitting model of a random $n$-leaf rooted tree, clades are recursively split into sub-clades, and a clade of $m$ leaves is split into sub-clades containing $i$ and $m-i$ leaves with probabilities $\propto 1/(i(m-i))$. The height of a uniform random leaf can be represented as the absorption time of a certain {\em harmonic descent} Markov chain. Recent work on these heights $D_n$ and $L_n$ (corresponding to discrete or continuous versions of the tree) has led to quite sharp expressions for their asymptotic distributions, based on their Markov chain description. This article gives even sharper expressions, based on an $n \to \infty$ limit tree structure described via exchangeable random partitions in the style of Haas et al (2008). Within this structure, calculations of moments lead to expressions for Mellin transforms, and then via Mellin inversion we obtain sharp estimates for the expectation, variance, Normal approximation and large deviation behavior of $D_n$.</description>

      <title>On the Gauss map assignment for minimal surfaces and the Osserman curvature estimate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gauss map of a conformal minimal immersion of an open Riemann surface $M$ into $\mathbb{R}^n$, $n\ge 3$, is a holomorphic map $M\to{\bf Q}^{n-2}\subset \mathbb{CP}^{n-1}$. Denote by ${\rm CMI}_{\rm full}(M,\mathbb{R}^n)$ and $\mathscr{O}_{\rm full}(M,{\bf Q}^{n-2})$ the spaces of full conformal minimal immersions $M\to\mathbb{R}^n$ and full holomorphic maps $M\to{\bf Q}^{n-2}$, respectively, endowed with the compact-open topology. In this paper we show that the Gauss map assignment $\mathscr{G}:{\rm CMI}_{\rm full}(M,\mathbb{R}^n)\to \mathscr{O}_{\rm full}(M,{\bf Q}^{n-2})$, taking a full conformal minimal immersion to its Gauss map, is an open map. This implies, in view of a result of Forstneric and the authors, that $\mathscr{G}$ is a quotient map. The same results hold for the map $(\mathscr{G},Flux):{\rm CMI}_{\rm full}(M,\mathbb{R}^n)\to \mathscr{O}_{\rm full}(M,{\bf Q}^{n-2})\times H^1(M,\mathbb{R}^n)$, where $Flux:{\rm CMI}_{\rm full}(M,\mathbb{R}^n)\to H^1(M,\mathbb{R}^n)$ is the flux assignment.
  As application, we establish that the set of maps $G\in \mathscr{O}_{\rm full}(M,{\bf Q}^{n-2})$ such that the family $\mathscr{G}^{-1}(G)$ of all minimal surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^n$ with the Gauss map $G$ satisfies the classical Osserman curvature estimate, is meagre in the space of holomorphic maps $M\to {\bf Q}^{n-2}$.</description>

      <title>$\epsilon$-Approximability and Quantitative Fatou Property on Lipschitz-graph domains for a class of non-harmonic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the class of functions on Lipschitz-graph domains satisfying a differential-oscillation condition and show that such functions are $\epsilon$-approximable. As a consequence we obtain the quantitative Fatou theorem in the spirit of works e.g. by Garnett and Bortz-Hofmann. Such a class contains harmonic functions, as well as non-harmonic ones, for example nonnegative subharmonic functions, as illustrated by our discussion.</description>

      <title>Entanglement principle for the fractional Laplacian with applications to inverse problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove an entanglement principle for fractional Laplace operators on $\mathbb R^n$ for $n\geq 2$ as follows; if different fractional powers of the Laplace operator acting on several distinct functions on $\mathbb R^n$, which vanish on some nonempty open set $O$, are known to be linearly dependent on $O$, then all the functions must be globally zero. This remarkable principle was recently discovered to be true for smooth functions on compact Riemannian manifolds without boundary \cite{FKU24}. Our main result extends the principle to the noncompact Euclidean space stated for tempered distributions under suitable decay conditions at infinity. We also present applications of this principle to solve new inverse problems for recovering anisotropic principal terms as well as zeroth order coefficients in fractional polyharmonic equations. Our proof of the entanglement principle uses the heat semigroup formulation of fractional Laplacian to establish connections between the principle and the study of several topics including interpolation properties for holomorphic functions under certain growth conditions at infinity, meromorphic extensions of holomorphic functions from a subdomain, as well as support theorems for spherical mean transforms on $\mathbb R^n$ that are defined as averages of functions over spheres.</description>

      <title>CR functions at CR singularities: approximation, extension, and hulls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06431v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study three possible definitions of the notion of CR functions at CR singular points, their extension to a fixed-neighborhood of the singular point, and analogues of the Baouendi--Tr\`eves approximation in a fixed neighborhood. In particular, we give a construction of certain disc hulls, which, if large enough, give the fixed-neighborhood extension and approximation properties. We provide many examples showing the distinctions between the classes and the various properties studied.</description>
