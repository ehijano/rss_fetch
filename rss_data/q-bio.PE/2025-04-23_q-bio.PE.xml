      <title>Applied Antifragility in Natural Systems: Evolutionary Antifragility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter introduces evolutionary antifragility as the time-scale interaction characteristics of a natural dynamic system. It describes the benefit derived from input distribution unevenness, based on the emergent system dynamics and its uncertain and volatile interactions with the operating environment described by unknown disturbances. We consider methods for the detection, analysis, and modelling of cancer, environmental, microbiota, and social systems antifragility.

      <title>Generating heterogeneous data on gene trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce GenPhylo, a Python module that simulates nucleotide sequence data along a phylogeny avoiding the restriction of continuous-time Markov processes. GenPhylo uses directly a general Markov model and therefore naturally incorporates heterogeneity across lineages. We solve the challenge of generating transition matrices with a pre-given expected number of substitutions (the branch length information) by providing an algorithm that can be incorporated in other simulation software.</description>

      <title>Computational Typology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Typology is a subfield of linguistics that focuses on the study and classification of languages based on their structural features. Unlike genealogical classification, which examines the historical relationships between languages, typology seeks to understand the diversity of human languages by identifying common properties and patterns, known as universals. In recent years, computational methods have played an increasingly important role in typological research, enabling the analysis of large-scale linguistic data and the testing of hypotheses about language structure and evolution. This article provides an illustration of the benefits of computational statistical modeling in typology.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Network Surrogates to leverage Mechanistic Expert Knowledge towards Reliable and Immediate Pandemic Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: During the COVID-19 crisis, mechanistic models have guided evidence-based decision making. However, time-critical decisions in a dynamical environment limit the time available to gather supporting evidence. Infectious disease dynamics are often heterogeneous on a spatial or demographic scale, requiring appropriately resolved models. In addition, with a large number of potential interventions, all scenarios can barely be computed on time, even when using supercomputing facilities. We suggest to couple complex mechanistic models with data-driven surrogate models to allow for on-the-fly model adaptations by public health experts and decision makers. We build upon a spatially and demographically resolved infectious disease metapopulation model and train a graph neural network for data sets representing prevaccination phases of a pandemic. The resulting networks reached an execution time of a fraction of a second, a speeding up the metapopulation up to four orders of magnitude. The approach yields large potential for on-the-fly execution and, thus, facilitates integration into low-barrier web applications for use in pandemic decision-making.</description>
