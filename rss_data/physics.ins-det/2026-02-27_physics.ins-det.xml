      <title>Detector-level assessment of alternative target nuclei for CEvNS experiments under realistic experimental conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering (CEvNS) provides a sensitive probe of neutrino interactions at low momentum transfer, but its experimental observation is strongly constrained by detector-related effects such as energy threshold, resolution, noise, and event-selection criteria. In this work, we perform a detector-level assessment of CEvNS nuclear recoil observability under realistic experimental conditions, with particular emphasis on the role of detector response in shaping measurable recoil spectra. Using detailed Geant4-based simulations, CEvNS interactions are modeled for a set of alternative target nuclei spanning light to intermediate mass ranges. The true nuclear recoil energy distributions are propagated through a simplified yet realistic detector-response chain incorporating energy smearing, noise-induced fluctuations, threshold cuts, and veto-based event selection. We present a systematic analysis of recoil energy spectra before and after detector effects, response matrices linking true and reconstructed energies, and energy-dependent selection efficiencies. The results demonstrate that detector response effects significantly modify the observable CEvNS signal, particularly in the near-threshold region where most recoil events are concentrated. Differences in efficiency turn-on behavior and reconstructed energy distributions highlight the target-nucleus dependence of CEvNS observability under identical detector conditions. Rather than focusing on absolute event-rate predictions, this study emphasizes the relative impact of detector effects on signal accessibility and target performance. The presented framework provides a consistent methodology for evaluating and comparing prospective CEvNS target materials at the detector level, offering practical guidance for future low-threshold CEvNS experiments and detector design optimization.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning on Heterogeneous, Edge, and Quantum Hardware for Particle Physics (ML-HEQUPP)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next generation of particle physics experiments will face a new era of challenges in data acquisition, due to unprecedented data rates and volumes along with extreme environments and operational constraints. Harnessing this data for scientific discovery demands real-time inference and decision-making, intelligent data reduction, and efficient processing architectures beyond current capabilities. Crucial to the success of this experimental paradigm are several emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) and silicon microelectronics, and the advent of quantum algorithms and processing. Their intersection includes areas of research such as low-power and low-latency devices for edge computing, heterogeneous accelerator systems, reconfigurable hardware, novel codesign and synthesis strategies, readout for cryogenic or high-radiation environments, and analog computing. This white paper presents a community-driven vision to identify and prioritize research and development opportunities in hardware-based ML systems and corresponding physics applications, contributing towards a successful transition to the new data frontier of fundamental science.</description>

      <title>Fused-Silica Activation Cherenkov Detector for Pulsed D--T Fusion Yields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a compact, non-toxic, low-cost neutron-yield diagnostic for pulsed D--T fusion systems using an undoped fused-silica (SiO$2$) rod as both activation target and Cherenkov radiator. D--T neutrons (14.1 MeV) activate $^{28}$Si and $^{16}$O to produce short-lived $^{28}$Al ($T{1/2}=134,\mathrm{s}$) and $^{16}$N ($T_{1/2}=7.13,\mathrm{s}$). The resulting $\beta^-$ particles exceed the Cherenkov threshold and generate UV--visible light detected by a fast photomultiplier tube. A SiO$_2$ rod of dimensions $6,\mathrm{in}\times1,\mathrm{in}$ (length $\times$ diameter) is optically coupled and read out with a CAEN DT5730 digitizer operating in list mode with digital pulse processing. The post-pulse count rate is fit using fixed $^{16}$N and $^{28}$Al half-lives together with background terms to infer neutron fluence. Testing at the ZEUS D--T Dense Plasma Focus established a reference calibration and agreement with a praseodymium-calibrated silver activation detector. Measurements near a D--D Dense Plasma Focus show no activation signal, confirming D--T selectivity. The diagnostic enables pulse-to-pulse yield measurements within minutes following a pulse and is being deployed on Helion Energy's seventh fusion prototype, Polaris.</description>

      <title>Charge collection parameterization of MALTA2, a depleted monolithic active pixel sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fast simulation method is presented for a depleted monolithic active pixel sensor, which uses a data driven parameterization of the charge collection and propagation. This approach provides an efficient alternative to TCAD simulations, particularly for sensors whose proprietary process details - such as doping profiles or implant geometries - are unavailable. Data was obtained with a MALTA2 sensor fabricated in a 180 nm CMOS imaging technology on 30 {\mu}m epitaxial silicon using the MALTA beam telescope at CERN SPS. The model reproduces the measured inpixel efficiency with high accuracy and enables a realistic yet computationally lightweight analog pixel simulation. This method will be further employed in optimizing the digital sensor design for applications in high-rate particle tracking and high-granularity calorimetry.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Canadian subatomic physics community establishes its scientific, and thus funding, priorities through periodic Long-Range Plans (LRP). The community is now putting together a new LRP, which will be in effect from 2027 through 2034, with its scope extending through 2041. As part of this process, the Canadian Institute of Nuclear Physics (CINP) has put together a strategic report, following an extensive consultation process. The report describes the broad and ambitious research program undertaken by the Canadian nuclear physics research community, both onshore and abroad, touching on key questions regarding the origin, evolution, and structure of visible matter in the universe. This document provides a grid of different Canadian nuclear physics projects undertaken now and in the future, and their associated timelines. It concludes with specific recommendations for maximizing Canadian scientific output in nuclear physics.</description>

      <title>Testing beyond the Standard Model scenarios in next-generation long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this thesis, we assess the sensitivity of next-generation long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments, DUNE, T2HK, and T2HKK, to three popular beyond the Standard Model (BSM) scenarios. Within the three BSM studies, we examine: (i) long-range neutrino-matter interactions induced by flavor-dependent, anomaly-free gauged baryon-lepton symmetries mediated by ultra-light vector boson, showing that DUNE and T2HK can constrain, discover, and in some favorable cases distinguish among different symmetries; (ii) Lorentz invariance violation (LIV), where we derive analytical dependencies of CPT-conserving and CPT-violating LIV parameters on baseline and energy, highlighting the superior reach of DUNE in probing all the LIV parameters, in contrast to T2HK, which is essentially blind to the CPT-conserving LIV parameters; and (iii) active-sterile oscillations over a broad range of $\Delta m^2_{41}$, where we derive sensitivity to CP phases for benchmark choices of $\Delta m^2_{41}$ and establish exclusion limits, emphasizing the role of near detectors. Together, these studies show that future long-baseline facilities not only resolve the neutrino mass ordering, value of $\delta_{\rm CP}$, and $\theta_{23}$ octant, but also provide powerful probes of BSM physics.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating Single Photon Counting with Kinetic Inductance Detectors from 3.8 to 25 $\mu$m</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the primary objectives of modern astronomy is the atmospheric characterization of Earth-like exoplanets at visible and infrared wavelengths. Achieving this goal requires extremely sensitive detectors capable of measuring faint signal of the exoplanet at the single-photon level while maintaining near-zero dark count rates. In the infrared, however, conventional semiconducting detector technologies struggle to meet these stringent requirements. In this work we demonstrate single-photon counting with superconducting Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors at the wavelengths 3.8, 8.5, 18.5, and 25 $\mu$m and measure resolving powers ($E/\delta E$) of 9.9, 5.9, 3.2, and 3.3, respectively, with corresponding dark count rates of 4, 8, 34, and 48 mHz. Our membrane-based devices reach phonon-loss limited performance at 3.8 $\mu$m, more than doubling the performance attainable with comparable solid-substrate devices. These results showcase the detector technology in the mid-infrared and the intricate measurement setup required for these sensitive detectors. We discuss how the detector design and measurement setup can be further optimized to increase the detector performance in the mid-infrared.</description>

      <title>Hard X-Ray Zernike-Type Phase-Contrast Imaging with a Two-Block Crystal System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel scheme for Zernike-type hard X-ray phase-contrast imaging is proposed. The scheme relies on X-ray dynamical diffraction in a two-block crystal system with parallel crystal plates of equal thickness. A phase shifter providing a $\pi/2$ phase shift is placed in the inter-block gap of the crystal system. The method operates in a scanning geometry. The proposed imaging setup is compact and does not require conventional focusing optics. Numerical simulations of phase-contrast image formation are performed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.23338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microwave sounding is the leading driver of global numerical weather forecasting, but is limited by the scalability of such instruments. With modern machining and commercial microwave components, it is now possible to design low size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP-C) microwave spectrometers while maintaining wide bandwidth performance. Here we report on the status of CubeSounder, a spectrometer tailored for water vapor radiometry that utilizes passive wave guide filter banks. After developing a prototype and high altitude balloon payload, we demonstrated CubeSounder on commercial stratospheric balloon flights. We report on our design process, especially the simulation and fabrication of the custom millimeter-wave filter banks. We also report the initial results of the data collected from the balloon flights.</description>

      <title>Design and Implementation of a UDP-Based Command Interface for the INO ICAL Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient command interface is a critical requirement for experiments employing a large number of front-end DAQ modules and control servers. In the context of the INOICAL (India-based Neutrino Observatory Iron Calorimeter) experiment, this involves 28,800 Resistive Plate Chamber(RPC), charged particle detectors. The acquisition and control of these detectors are facilitated through Front End data acquisition modules known as RPC-DAQs. These modules consists of Ethernet interfaces for data and command connectivity to a server. Each module acts as a network node with a unique IP address. The collective group of hundreds of modules is controlled by a common server over a Local Area Network (LAN). UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is the most commonly used networking protocol which supports Multicast as well as Unicast, can be easily adapted to INO ICAL Experiment. A server can send commands to group of DAQs or any particular DAQ. But UDP may have the problem of packet loss and reliability. To mitigate these issues, this paper suggests a simpler approach that modifies the UDP protocol by implementing a handshaking scheme and checksum, similar to those found in more reliable protocols like TCP. The proposed solution optimizes the use of UDP as a reliable command interface in the INO ICAL experiment, ensuring seamless data acquisition and control. Also, this paper shows the performance study of the custom hybrid UDP Command Interface in the prototype ICAL experiment called Mini Iron Calorimeter (Mini ICAL) which houses 20 units of RPCs and electronics. This work not only addresses the challenges of the INO ICAL experiment but also underscores the adaptability and robustness of the proposed protocol for usage in mini-ICAL and beyond.</description>

      <title>In-situ Radiation Damage Study of Silicon Carbide Detectors Subjected to Clinical Proton Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Silicon carbide (SiC) planar PiN diodes from two different manufacturers were irradiated with 252.7 MeV protons from a medical synchrotron. Over the course of two 8h irradiation shifts, the samples were exposed to increasing fluences ranging from 1.4e+11 to 3.5e+13 p+/cm^2. Electrical characterizations, including IV and CV measurements, were performed both before and after irradiation using probe stations, and for selected samples even in-situ between fluence steps directly at the irradiation facility. The results show a gradual compensation of the effective epitaxial doping concentration with each incremental fluence step, observed as a reduction in capacitance before full depletion and confirmed by the extracted effective doping concentration. From these measurements, linear donor removal rates are determined for all sample groups, with values ranging from 4.2/cm to 6.4/cm. These findings provide a quantitative basis for understanding radiation-induced charge carrier removal in 4H-SiC devices and are relevant for predicting the performance and lifetime of future radiation-hard detector technologies, including 4H-SiC LGADs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01764v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primary cosmic rays when interact with our atmosphere, produce a cascade of lighter secondary particles namely pion, kaon, neutrons, muons, electrons, positrons and neutrinos. Muons are one of the most abundant and easily detectable particles at the ground surface using a large variety of particle detectors. Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) of 2m x 2m in dimension were developed to be used in large scale as the active detector elements in the Iron Calorimeter (ICAL) which was planned to be built by the India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO). As a spin-off of this work, a portable stack of eight, one square foot RPC detectors is developed named as Cosmic Muon Tracker (CMT). It could be used to conduct small-scale particle detector experiments as well as training Students. We will discuss design, integration, characterisation and some of the applications of this detector in this paper.</description>

Abstract: We report the first results on ultracold neutron production from a new spallation-driven superfluid $^4$He (He-II) source at TRIUMF, which is being prepared for a new, precise measurement of the neutron electric dipole moment. A total of $(9.3 \pm 0.8)\times 10^{5}$ ultracold neutrons were observed at a proton beam current of \SI{37}{\uA}, when the target was irradiated for a period of \SI{60}{\s}. The results are in fair agreement with expectations based on a detailed simulation of neutron transport and ultracold neutron source cryogenics. There is some indication that the new source might not be as limited by the conduction of heat through the He-II as originally expected. The results indicate that the source is likely to make its ultimate production goals, once the liquid deuterium cold moderator system is completed, with the expectation that $5.7\times 10^7$~UCNs would be detected in the same experiment with full liquid levels. This would, for example, correspond to delivery of $1.4\times 10^6$~UCNs delivered to each of two nEDM measurement cells, and a statistical uncertainty of $1\times 10^{-27}~e$cm on the neutron EDM in 280 days of running.</description>

      <title>Electron Recoil via Sample Momentum Transfer under Optical-Mode Excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13084v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interaction between free electrons and optical modes underlies a variety of quantum and nanoscale light-matter phenomena, yet the associated momentum exchange with the sample largely remained overlooked. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the momentum transfer from free electrons to planar samples during optical mode excitation using momentum-resolved electron energy-loss spectroscopy. The momentum transfer to the sample modifies the apparent dispersion relation which is significant when the planner sample is tilted. Under specific conditions, the sample receives momentum opposite to the electron beam direction.</description>
