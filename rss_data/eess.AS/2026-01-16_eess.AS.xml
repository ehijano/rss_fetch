      <title>Multi-Level Embedding Conformer Framework for Bengali Automatic Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bengali, spoken by over 300 million people, is a morphologically rich and lowresource language, posing challenges for automatic speech recognition (ASR). This research presents an end-to-end framework for Bengali ASR, building on a Conformer-CTC backbone with a multi-level embedding fusion mechanism that incorporates phoneme, syllable, and wordpiece representations. By enriching acoustic features with these linguistic embeddings, the model captures fine-grained phonetic cues and higher-level contextual patterns. The architecture employs early and late Conformer stages, with preprocessing steps including silence trimming, resampling, Log-Mel spectrogram extraction, and SpecAugment augmentation. The experimental results demonstrate the strong potential of the model, achieving a word error rate (WER) of 10.01% and a character error rate (CER) of 5.03%. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining multi-granular linguistic information with acoustic modeling, providing a scalable approach for low-resource ASR development.</description>

      <title>Nearest Kronecker Product Decomposition Based Subband Adaptive Filter: Algorithms and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the nearest Kronecker product (NKP) decomposition-based normalized least mean square (NLMS-NKP) algorithm has demonstrated superior convergence performance compared to the conventional NLMS algorithm. However, its convergence rate exhibits significant degradation when processing highly correlated input signals. To address this problem, we propose a type-I NKP-based normalized subband adaptive filter (NSAF) algorithm, namely NSAF-NKP-I. Nevertheless, this algorithm incurs substantially higher computational overhead than the NLMS-NKP algorithm. Remarkably, our enhanced type-II NKP-based NSAF (NSAF-NKP-II) algorithm achieves equivalent convergence performance while substantially reducing computational complexity. Furthermore, to enhance robustness against impulsive noise interference, we develop two robust variants: the maximum correntropy criterion-based robust NSAF-NKP (RNSAF-NKP-MCC) and logarithmic criterion-based robust NSAF-NKP (RNSAF-NKP-LC) algorithms. Additionally, detailed analyses of computational complexity, step-size range, and theoretical steady-state performance are provided for theproposed algorithms. To enhance the practicability of the NSAF-NKP-II algorithm in complex nonlinear environments, we further devise two nonlinear implementations: the trigonometric functional link network-based NKP-NSAF (TFLN-NSAF-NKP) and Volterra series expansion-based NKP-NSAF (Volterra-NKP-NSAF) algorithms. In active noise control (ANC) systems, we further propose the filtered-x NSAF-NKP-II (NKP-FxNSAF) algorithm. Simulation experiments in echo cancellation, sparse system identification, nonlinear processing, and ANC scenarios are conducted to validate the superiority of the proposed algorithms over existing state-of-the-art counterparts.</description>

      <title>VoiceSculptor: Your Voice, Designed By You</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite rapid progress in text-to-speech (TTS), open-source systems still lack truly instruction-following, fine-grained control over core speech attributes (e.g., pitch, speaking rate, age, emotion, and style). We present VoiceSculptor, an open-source unified system that bridges this gap by integrating instruction-based voice design and high-fidelity voice cloning in a single framework. It generates controllable speaker timbre directly from natural-language descriptions, supports iterative refinement via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and provides attribute-level edits across multiple dimensions. The designed voice is then rendered into a prompt waveform and fed into a cloning model to enable high-fidelity timbre transfer for downstream speech synthesis. VoiceSculptor achieves open-source state-of-the-art (SOTA) on InstructTTSEval-Zh, and is fully open-sourced, including code and pretrained models, to advance reproducible instruction-controlled TTS research.</description>

      <title>Stable Differentiable Modal Synthesis for Learning Nonlinear Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modal methods are a long-standing approach to physical modelling synthesis. Extensions to nonlinear problems are possible, including the case of a high-amplitude vibration of a string. A modal decomposition leads to a densely coupled nonlinear system of ordinary differential equations. Recent work in scalar auxiliary variable techniques has enabled construction of explicit and stable numerical solvers for such classes of nonlinear systems. On the other hand, machine learning approaches (in particular neural ordinary differential equations) have been successful in modelling nonlinear systems automatically from data. In this work, we examine how scalar auxiliary variable techniques can be combined with neural ordinary differential equations to yield a stable differentiable model capable of learning nonlinear dynamics. The proposed approach leverages the analytical solution for linear vibration of system's modes so that physical parameters of a system remain easily accessible after the training without the need for a parameter encoder in the model architecture. As a proof of concept, we generate synthetic data for the nonlinear transverse vibration of a string and show that the model can be trained to reproduce the nonlinear dynamics of the system. Sound examples are presented.</description>

      <title>Audio Generation Through Score-Based Generative Modeling: Design Principles and Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful deep generative techniques, producing high-quality and diverse samples in applications in various domains including audio. While existing reviews provide overviews, there remains limited in-depth discussion of these specific design choices. The audio diffusion model literature also lacks principled guidance for the implementation of these design choices and their comparisons for different applications. This survey provides a comprehensive review of diffusion model design with an emphasis on design principles for quality improvement and conditioning for audio applications. We adopt the score modeling perspective as a unifying framework that accommodates various interpretations, including recent approaches like flow matching. We systematically examine the training and sampling procedures of diffusion models, and audio applications through different conditioning mechanisms. To provide an integrated, unified codebase and to promote reproducible research and rapid prototyping, we introduce an open-source codebase (https://github.com/gzhu06/AudioDiffuser) that implements our reviewed framework for various audio applications. We demonstrate its capabilities through three case studies: audio generation, speech enhancement, and text-to-speech synthesis, with benchmark evaluations on standard datasets.</description>

      <title>Keep the beat going: Automatic drum transcription with momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12596v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How can we process a piece of recorded music to detect and visualize the onset of each instrument? A simple, interpretable approach is based on partially fixed nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). Yet despite the method's simplicity, partially fixed NMF is challenging to apply because the associated optimization problem is high-dimensional and non-convex. This paper explores two optimization approaches that preserve the nonnegative structure, including a multiplicative update rule and projected gradient descent with momentum. These techniques are derived from the previous literature, but they have not been fully developed for partially fixed NMF before now. Results indicate that projected gradient descent with momentum leads to the higher accuracy among the two methods, and it satisfies stronger local convergence guarantees.</description>

      <title>Bridging the gap: A comparative exploration of Speech-LLM and end-to-end architecture for multilingual conversational ASR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01461v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The INTERSPEECH 2025 Challenge on Multilingual Conversational Speech Language Models (MLC-SLM) promotes multilingual conversational ASR with large language models (LLMs). Our previous SHNU-mASR system adopted a competitive parallel-speech-encoder architecture that integrated Whisper and mHuBERT with an LLM. However, it faced two challenges: simple feature concatenation may not fully exploit complementary information, and the performance gap between LLM-based ASR and end-to-end(E2E) encoder-decoder ASR remained unexplored. In this work, we present an enhanced LLM-based ASR framework that combines fine-tuned Whisper and mHuBERT encoders with an LLM to enrich speech representations. We first evaluate E2E Whisper models with LoRA and full fine-tuning on the MLC-SLM ASR task, and then propose cross-attention-based fusion mechanisms for the parallel-speech-encoder. On the official evaluation set of the MLC-SLM Challenge, our system achieves a CER/WER of 10.69%, ranking on par with the top-ranked Track 1 systems, even though it uses only 1,500 hours of baseline training data compared with their large-scale training sets. Nonetheless, we find that our final LLM-based ASR still does not match the performance of a fine-tuned E2E Whisper model, providing valuable empirical guidance for future Speech-LLM design. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/1535176727/MLC-SLM.</description>
