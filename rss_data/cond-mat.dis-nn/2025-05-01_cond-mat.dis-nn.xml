      <title>Rare Trajectories in a Prototypical Mean-field Disordered Model: Insights into Landscape and Instantons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For disordered systems within the random first-order transition (RFOT) universality class, such as structural glasses and certain spin glasses, the role played by activated relaxation processes is rich to the point of perplexity. Over the last decades, various efforts have attempted to formalize and systematize such processes in terms of instantons similar to the nucleation droplets of first- order phase transitions. In particular, Kirkpatrick, Thirumalai, and Wolynes proposed in the late '80s an influential nucleation theory of relaxation in structural glasses. Already within this picture, however, the resulting structures are far from the compact objects expected from the classical droplet description. In addition, an altogether different type of single-particle hopping-like instantons has recently been isolated in molecular simulations. Landscape studies of mean-field spin glass models have further revealed that simple saddle crossing does not capture relaxation in these systems. We present here a landscape-agnostic study of rare dynamical events, which delineates the richness of instantons in these systems. Our work not only captures the structure of metastable states, but also identifies the point of irreversibility, beyond which activated relaxation processes become a fait accompli. An interpretation of the associated landscape features is articulated, thus charting a path toward a complete understanding of RFOT instantons.</description>

      <title>Emergent Synaptic Plasticity from Tunable Dynamics of Probabilistic Bits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probabilistic (p-) computing, which leverages the stochasticity of its building blocks (p-bits) to solve a variety of computationally hard problems, has recently emerged as a promising physics-inspired hardware accelerator platform. A functionality of importance for p-computers is the ability to program-and reprogram-the interaction strength between arbitrary p-bits on-chip. In natural systems subject to random fluctuations, it is known that spatiotemporal noise can interact with the system's nonlinearities to render useful functionalities. Leveraging that principle, here we introduce a novel scheme for tunable coupling that inserts a ''hidden'' p-bit between each pair of computational p-bits. By modulating the fluctuation rate of the hidden p-bit relative to the synapse speed, we demonstrate both numerically and analytically that the effective interaction between the computational p-bits can be continuously tuned. Moreover, this tunability is directional, where the effective coupling from one computational p-bit to another can be made different from the reverse. This synaptic-plasticity mechanism could open new avenues for designing (re-)configurable p-computers and may inspire novel algorithms that leverage dynamic, hardware-level tuning of stochastic interactions.</description>

      <title>Efficient Learning Implies Quantum Glassiness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show a surprising relation between quantum learning theory and algorithmic hardness. We demonstrate that finding near-ground states of certain sparse disordered quantum systems is average-case hard for "Lipschitz" quantum algorithms if there exists an efficient, local learning algorithm -- such as the classical shadows algorithm -- for estimating the energy of a state of the system. A corollary of our result is that many standard quantum algorithms fail to find near-ground states of these systems, including short-time Lindbladian dynamics, short-time quantum annealing, phase estimation, and shallow-depth variational quantum algorithms. To achieve this, we introduce a topological property of quantum systems that we call the quantum overlap gap property (QOGP). This property is only satisfied by systems with an efficient local learning algorithm for the energy. We prove that systems which exhibit this topological property in their low-energy space are intractable for quantum algorithms whose outputs are stable under perturbations to their inputs. We then prove that the QOGP is satisfied for a sparsified variant of the quantum $p$-spin model, giving the first known algorithmic hardness-of-approximation result for quantum algorithms in finding the ground state of a non-stoquastic, noncommuting quantum system. Our resulting lower bound for quantum algorithms optimizing this model using Lindbladian evolution matches the best-known time lower bound for classical Langevin dynamics optimizing classical $p$-spin models. For this reason we suspect that finding ground states of typical quantum $p$-spin models using quantum algorithms is, in practice, as intractable as the classical $p$-spin model is for classical algorithms. Inversely, we show that the Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model does not exhibit the QOGP, consistent with previous evidence that the model is rapidly mixing at low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Exact mobility edges in quasiperiodic network models with slowly varying potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasiperiodic models are important physical platforms to explore Anderson transitions in low dimensional systems, yet the exact mobility edges (MEs) are generally hard to be determined analytically. To date, the MEs in only a few models can be determined exactly. In this manuscript, we propose a new class of network models characterized by quasiperiodic slowly varying potentials and the absence of hidden self-duality, and exactly determine their MEs. We take the mosaic models with slowly varying potentials as examples to illustrate this result and derive its MEs from the effective Hamiltonian. In this method, we can integrate out the periodic sites to obtain an effective Hamiltonian with energy-dependent potentials $g(E)V$ and effective eigenenergy $f(E)$, which directly yields the MEs at $f(E) = \pm(2t^\kappa \pm g(E)V)$, where $\kappa \in \mathbb{Z}^+$. With this idea in hand, we then generalize our method to more quasiperiodic network models, including those with much more complicated geometries and non-Hermitian features. Finally, we propose the realization of these models using optical waveguides and show that the Anderson transition can be observed even in small physical systems (with lattice sites about $L = 50 - 100$). Our results provide some key insights into the understanding and realization of exact MEs in experiments.</description>

      <title>Strong ergodicity breaking in dynamical mean-field equations for mixed p-spin glasses</title>

Abstract: The analytical solution to the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of mean-field spin glasses has profoundly shaped our understanding of glassy dynamics, which take place in many diverse physical systems. In particular, the idea that during the aging dynamics, the evolution becomes slower and slower, but keeps wandering in an unbounded space (a manifold of marginal states), thus forgetting any previously found configuration, has been one of the key hypotheses to achieve an analytical solution. This hypothesis, called weak ergodicity breaking, has recently been questioned by numerical simulations and attempts to solve the dynamical mean-field equations (DMFE). In this work, we introduce a new integration scheme for solving DMFE that allows us to reach very large integration times, $t=O(10^6)$, in the solution of the spherical (3+4)-spin model, quenched from close to the mode coupling temperature down to zero temperature. Thanks to this new solution, we can provide solid evidence for strong ergodicity breaking in the out-of-equilibrium dynamics on mixed p-spin glass models. Our solution to the DMFE shows that the out-of-equilibrium dynamics undergo aging, but in a restricted space: the initial condition is never forgotten, and the dynamics takes place closer and closer to configurations reached at later times. During this new restricted aging dynamics, the fluctuation-dissipation relation is richer than expected.</description>

      <title>Time-tronics: from temporal printed circuit board to quantum computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time crystalline structures can be created in periodically driven systems. They are temporal lattices which can reveal different condensed matter behaviours ranging from Anderson localization in time to temporal analogues of many-body localization or topological insulators. However, the potential practical applications of time crystalline structures have yet to be explored. Here, we pave the way for time-tronics where temporal lattices are like printed circuit boards for realization of a broad range of quantum devices. The elements of these devices can correspond to structures of dimensions higher than three and can be arbitrarily connected and reconfigured at any moment. Moreover, our approach allows for the construction of a quantum computer, enabling quantum gate operations for all possible pairs of qubits. Our findings indicate that the limitations faced in building devices using conventional spatial crystals can be overcome by adopting crystalline structures in time.</description>

      <title>Global Topological Dirac Synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synchronization is a fundamental dynamical state of interacting oscillators, observed in natural biological rhythms and in the brain. Global synchronization which occurs when non-linear or chaotic oscillators placed on the nodes of a network display the same dynamics as received great attention in network theory. Here we propose and investigate Global Topological Dirac Synchronization on higher-order networks such as cell and simplicial complexes. This is a state where oscillators associated to simplices and cells of arbitrary dimension, coupled by the Topological Dirac operator, operate at unison. By combining algebraic topology with non-linear dynamics and machine learning, we derive the topological conditions under which this state exists and the dynamical conditions under which it is stable. We provide evidence of 1-dimensional simplicial complexes (networks) and 2-dimensional simplicial and cell complexes where Global Topological Dirac Synchronization can be observed. Our results point out that Global Topological Dirac Synchronization is a possible dynamical state of simplicial and cell complexes that occur only in some specific network topologies and geometries, the latter ones being determined by the weights of the higher-order networks</description>

      <title>Topology of Monitored Quantum Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06133v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interplay between unitary dynamics and quantum measurements induces diverse phenomena in open quantum systems with no counterparts in closed quantum systems at equilibrium. Here, we generally classify Kraus operators and their effective non-Hermitian dynamical generators, thereby establishing the tenfold classification for symmetry and topology of monitored free fermions. Our classification elucidates the role of topology in measurement-induced phase transitions and identifies potential topological terms in the corresponding nonlinear sigma models. Furthermore, we establish the bulk-boundary correspondence in monitored quantum dynamics: nontrivial topology in spacetime manifests itself as topologically nontrivial steady states and gapless boundary states in Lyapunov spectra, such as Lyapunov zero modes and chiral edge modes, leading to the topologically protected slowdown of dynamical purification.</description>
