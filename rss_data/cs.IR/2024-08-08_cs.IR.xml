      <title>Pairwise Judgment Formulation for Semantic Embedding Model in Web Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic Embedding Model (SEM), a neural network-based Siamese architecture, is gaining momentum in information retrieval and natural language processing. In order to train SEM in a supervised fashion for Web search, the search engine query log is typically utilized to automatically formulate pairwise judgments as training data. Despite the growing application of semantic embeddings in the search engine industry, little work has been done on formulating effective pairwise judgments for training SEM. In this paper, we make the first in-depth investigation of a wide range of strategies for generating pairwise judgments for SEM. An interesting (perhaps surprising) discovery reveals that the conventional pairwise judgment formulation strategy wildly used in the field of pairwise Learning-to-Rank (LTR) is not necessarily effective for training SEM. Through a large-scale empirical study based on query logs and click-through activities from a major commercial search engine, we demonstrate the effective strategies for SEM and highlight the advantages of a hybrid heuristic (i.e., Clicked &gt; Non-Clicked) in comparison to the atomic heuristics (e.g., Clicked &gt; Skipped) in LTR. We conclude with best practices for training SEM and offer promising insights for future research.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Exposure Bias in Online Learning to Rank Recommendation: A Novel Reward Model for Cascading Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exposure bias is a well-known issue in recommender systems where items and suppliers are not equally represented in the recommendation results. This bias becomes particularly problematic over time as a few items are repeatedly over-represented in recommendation lists, leading to a feedback loop that further amplifies this bias. Although extensive research has addressed this issue in model-based or neighborhood-based recommendation algorithms, less attention has been paid to online recommendation models, such as those based on top-K contextual bandits, where recommendation models are dynamically updated with ongoing user feedback. In this paper, we study exposure bias in a class of well-known contextual bandit algorithms known as Linear Cascading Bandits. We analyze these algorithms in their ability to handle exposure bias and provide a fair representation of items in the recommendation results. Our analysis reveals that these algorithms fail to mitigate exposure bias in the long run during the course of ongoing user interactions. We propose an Exposure-Aware reward model that updates the model parameters based on two factors: 1) implicit user feedback and 2) the position of the item in the recommendation list. The proposed model mitigates exposure bias by controlling the utility assigned to the items based on their exposure in the recommendation list. Our experiments with two real-world datasets show that our proposed reward model improves the exposure fairness of the linear cascading bandits over time while maintaining the recommendation accuracy. It also outperforms the current baselines. Finally, we prove a high probability upper regret bound for our proposed model, providing theoretical guarantees for its performance.</description>

      <title>Understanding and Modeling Job Marketplace with Pretrained Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Job marketplace is a heterogeneous graph composed of interactions among members (job-seekers), companies, and jobs. Understanding and modeling job marketplace can benefit both job seekers and employers, ultimately contributing to the greater good of the society. However, existing graph neural network (GNN)-based methods have shallow understandings of the associated textual features and heterogeneous relations. To address the above challenges, we propose PLM4Job, a job marketplace foundation model that tightly couples pretrained language models (PLM) with job market graph, aiming to fully utilize the pretrained knowledge and reasoning ability to model member/job textual features as well as various member-job relations simultaneously. In the pretraining phase, we propose a heterogeneous ego-graph-based prompting strategy to model and aggregate member/job textual features based on the topological structure around the target member/job node, where entity type embeddings and graph positional embeddings are introduced accordingly to model different entities and their heterogeneous relations. Meanwhile, a proximity-aware attention alignment strategy is designed to dynamically adjust the attention of the PLM on ego-graph node tokens in the prompt, such that the attention can be better aligned with job marketplace semantics. Extensive experiments at LinkedIn demonstrate the effectiveness of PLM4Job.</description>

      <title>Judgment2vec: Apply Graph Analytics to Searching and Recommendation of Similar Judgments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In court practice, legal professionals rely on their training to provide opinions that resolve cases, one of the most crucial aspects being the ability to identify similar judgments from previous courts efficiently. However, finding a similar case is challenging and often depends on experience, legal domain knowledge, and extensive labor hours, making veteran lawyers or judges indispensable. This research aims to automate the analysis of judgment text similarity. We utilized a judgment dataset labeled as the "golden standard" by experts, which includes human-verified features that can be converted into an "expert similarity score." We then constructed a knowledge graph based on "case-article" relationships, ranking each case using natural language processing to derive a "Node2vec similarity score." By evaluating these two similarity scores, we identified their discrepancies and relationships. The results can significantly reduce the labor hours required for legal searches and recommendations, with potential applications extending to various fields of information retrieval.</description>

      <title>Pairing Clustered Inverted Indexes with kNN Graphs for Fast Approximate Retrieval over Learned Sparse Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learned sparse representations form an effective and interpretable class of embeddings for text retrieval. While exact top-k retrieval over such embeddings faces efficiency challenges, a recent algorithm called Seismic has enabled remarkably fast, highly-accurate approximate retrieval. Seismic statically prunes inverted lists, organizes each list into geometrically-cohesive blocks, and augments each block with a summary vector. At query time, each inverted list associated with a query term is traversed one block at a time in an arbitrary order, with the inner product between the query and summaries determining if a block must be evaluated. When a block is deemed promising, its documents are fully evaluated with a forward index. Seismic is one to two orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art inverted index-based solutions and significantly outperforms the winning graph-based submissions to the BigANN 2023 Challenge. In this work, we speed up Seismic further by introducing two innovations to its query processing subroutine. First, we traverse blocks in order of importance, rather than arbitrarily. Second, we take the list of documents retrieved by Seismic and expand it to include the neighbors of each document using an offline k-regular nearest neighbor graph; the expanded list is then ranked to produce the final top-k set. Experiments on two public datasets show that our extension, named SeismicWave, can reach almost-exact accuracy levels and is up to 2.2x faster than Seismic.</description>

      <title>wav2graph: A Framework for Supervised Learning Knowledge Graph from Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) and search engines by providing structured, interconnected data that improves reasoning and context-awareness. However, KGs only focus on text data, thereby neglecting other modalities such as speech. In this work, we introduce wav2graph, the first framework for supervised learning knowledge graph from speech data. Our pipeline are straightforward: (1) constructing a KG based on transcribed spoken utterances and a named entity database, (2) converting KG into embedding vectors, and (3) training graph neural networks (GNNs) for node classification and link prediction tasks. Through extensive experiments conducted in inductive and transductive learning contexts using state-of-the-art GNN models, we provide baseline results and error analysis for node classification and link prediction tasks on human transcripts and automatic speech recognition (ASR) transcripts, including evaluations using both encoder-based and decoder-based node embeddings, as well as monolingual and multilingual acoustic pre-trained models. All related code, data, and models are published online.</description>

      <title>MMREC: LLM Based Multi-Modal Recommender System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The importance of recommender systems is growing rapidly due to the exponential increase in the volume of content generated daily. This surge in content presents unique challenges for designing effective recommender systems. Key among these challenges is the need to effectively leverage the vast amounts of natural language data and images that represent user preferences. This paper presents a novel approach to enhancing recommender systems by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and deep learning techniques. The proposed framework aims to improve the accuracy and relevance of recommendations by incorporating multi-modal information processing and by the use of unified latent space representation. The study explores the potential of LLMs to better understand and utilize natural language data in recommendation contexts, addressing the limitations of previous methods. The framework efficiently extracts and integrates text and image information through LLMs, unifying diverse modalities in a latent space to simplify the learning process for the ranking model. Experimental results demonstrate the enhanced discriminative power of the model when utilizing multi-modal information. This research contributes to the evolving field of recommender systems by showcasing the potential of LLMs and multi-modal data integration to create more personalized and contextually relevant recommendations.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Traffic Flow Prediction with Multi-Segment Fusion Tensor Graph Convolutional Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate traffic Flow Prediction can assist in traffic management, route planning, and congestion mitigation, which holds significant importance in enhancing the efficiency and reliability of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). However, existing traffic flow prediction models suffer from limitations in capturing the complex spatial-temporal dependencies within traffic networks. In order to address this issue, this study proposes a multi-segment fusion tensor graph convolutional network (MS-FTGCN) for traffic flow prediction with the following three-fold ideas: a) building a unified spatial-temporal graph convolutional framework based on Tensor M-product, which capture the spatial-temporal patterns simultaneously; b) incorporating hourly, daily, and weekly components to model multi temporal properties of traffic flows, respectively; c) fusing the outputs of the three components by attention mechanism to obtain the final traffic flow prediction results. The results of experiments conducted on two traffic flow datasets demonstrate that the proposed MS-FTGCN outperforms the state-of-the-art models.</description>

      <title>Scalable Transformer for High Dimensional Multivariate Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep models for Multivariate Time Series (MTS) forecasting have recently demonstrated significant success. Channel-dependent models capture complex dependencies that channel-independent models cannot capture. However, the number of channels in real-world applications outpaces the capabilities of existing channel-dependent models, and contrary to common expectations, some models underperform the channel-independent models in handling high-dimensional data, which raises questions about the performance of channel-dependent models. To address this, our study first investigates the reasons behind the suboptimal performance of these channel-dependent models on high-dimensional MTS data. Our analysis reveals that two primary issues lie in the introduced noise from unrelated series that increases the difficulty of capturing the crucial inter-channel dependencies, and challenges in training strategies due to high-dimensional data. To address these issues, we propose STHD, the Scalable Transformer for High-Dimensional Multivariate Time Series Forecasting. STHD has three components: a) Relation Matrix Sparsity that limits the noise introduced and alleviates the memory issue; b) ReIndex applied as a training strategy to enable a more flexible batch size setting and increase the diversity of training data; and c) Transformer that handles 2-D inputs and captures channel dependencies. These components jointly enable STHD to manage the high-dimensional MTS while maintaining computational feasibility. Furthermore, experimental results show STHD's considerable improvement on three high-dimensional datasets: Crime-Chicago, Wiki-People, and Traffic. The source code and dataset are publicly available https://github.com/xinzzzhou/ScalableTransformer4HighDimensionMTSF.git.</description>

      <title>MM-Forecast: A Multimodal Approach to Temporal Event Forecasting with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an emerging and intriguing problem of multimodal temporal event forecasting with large language models. Compared to using text or graph modalities, the investigation of utilizing images for temporal event forecasting has not been fully explored, especially in the era of large language models (LLMs). To bridge this gap, we are particularly interested in two key questions of: 1) why images will help in temporal event forecasting, and 2) how to integrate images into the LLM-based forecasting framework. To answer these research questions, we propose to identify two essential functions that images play in the scenario of temporal event forecasting, i.e., highlighting and complementary. Then, we develop a novel framework, named MM-Forecast. It employs an Image Function Identification module to recognize these functions as verbal descriptions using multimodal large language models (MLLMs), and subsequently incorporates these function descriptions into LLM-based forecasting models. To evaluate our approach, we construct a new multimodal dataset, MidEast-TE-mm, by extending an existing event dataset MidEast-TE-mini with images. Empirical studies demonstrate that our MM-Forecast can correctly identify the image functions, and further more, incorporating these verbal function descriptions significantly improves the forecasting performance. The dataset, code, and prompts are available at https://github.com/LuminosityX/MM-Forecast.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Semantic Graph Based Approach With Sentiment Analysis For User Interest Retrieval From Social Sites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blogs and social networking sites serve as a platform to the users for expressing their interests, ideas and thoughts. Targeted marketing uses the recommendation systems for suggesting their services and products to the users or clients. So the method used by target marketing is extraction of keywords and main topics from the user generated texts. Most of conventional methods involve identifying the personal interests just on the basis of surveys and rating systems. But the proposed research differs in manner that it aim at using the user generated text as a source medium for identifying and analyzing the personal interest as a knowledge base area of users. Semantic graph based approach is proposed research work that identifies the references of clients and users by analyzing their own texts such as tweets. The keywords need to be extracted from the text generated by the user on the social networking sites. This can be made possible by using several algorithms that extracts the keywords automatically from the available content provided by the user. Based on frequency and degree it ranks the extracted keywords. Furthermore, semantic graph based model assists in providing useful suggestions just by extracting the interests of users by analyzing their contents from social media. In this approach graph comprises of nodes and edges where nodes represents the keywords extracted by the algorithm and edges shows the semantic connection between the nodes. The method does not require internet related user activities like surveys or ratings to gather user interest related information.</description>

      <title>Read and Think: An Efficient Step-wise Multimodal Language Model for Document Understanding and Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the contents of multimodal documents is essential to accurately extract relevant evidence and use it for reasoning. Existing document understanding models tend to generate answers with a single word or phrase directly, ignoring the source document's evidence and lacking interpretability. In this work, we address the lack of step-wise capabilities through data augmentation and extension. Specifically, We use Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which have strong visual understanding and reasoning abilities, as data generators to generate step-wise question-and-answer pairs for document images and use a high-performance LLM as the error detector to filter out noisy data. This step-wise data generation pipeline is implemented using both template-based and few-shot methods. We then use the generated high-quality data to train a humanized document understanding and reasoning model, specifically designed to solve complex questions that require reasoning or multi-hop question answering, dubbed DocAssistant. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and application value of step-wise generation, showing a 5 improvement on InfoVQA with complex layouts and a 7 improvement on ChartQA with complex reasoning, compared to directly generated answers. We hope our work highlights the potential of synthetic data and encourages further exploration of multi-modal document reasoning capabilities.</description>

      <title>Data Imputation using Large Language Model to Accelerate Recommendation System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper aims to address the challenge of sparse and missing data in recommendation systems, a significant hurdle in the age of big data. Traditional imputation methods struggle to capture complex relationships within the data. We propose a novel approach that fine-tune Large Language Model (LLM) and use it impute missing data for recommendation systems. LLM which is trained on vast amounts of text, is able to understand complex relationship among data and intelligently fill in missing information. This enriched data is then used by the recommendation system to generate more accurate and personalized suggestions, ultimately enhancing the user experience. We evaluate our LLM-based imputation method across various tasks within the recommendation system domain, including single classification, multi-classification, and regression compared to traditional data imputation methods. By demonstrating the superiority of LLM imputation over traditional methods, we establish its potential for improving recommendation system performance.</description>

      <title>An Autonomous GIS Agent Framework for Geospatial Data Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Powered by the emerging large language models (LLMs), autonomous geographic information systems (GIS) agents have the potential to accomplish spatial analyses and cartographic tasks. However, a research gap exists to support fully autonomous GIS agents: how to enable agents to discover and download the necessary data for geospatial analyses. This study proposes an autonomous GIS agent framework capable of retrieving required geospatial data by generating, executing, and debugging programs. The framework utilizes the LLM as the decision-maker, selects the appropriate data source (s) from a pre-defined source list, and fetches the data from the chosen source. Each data source has a handbook that records the metadata and technical details for data retrieval. The proposed framework is designed in a plug-and-play style to ensure flexibility and extensibility. Human users or autonomous data scrawlers can add new data sources by adding new handbooks. We developed a prototype agent based on the framework, released as a QGIS plugin (GeoData Retrieve Agent) and a Python program. Experiment results demonstrate its capability of retrieving data from various sources including OpenStreetMap, administrative boundaries and demographic data from the US Census Bureau, satellite basemaps from ESRI World Imagery, global digital elevation model (DEM) from OpenTopography.org, weather data from a commercial provider, the COVID-19 cases from the NYTimes GitHub. Our study is among the first attempts to develop an autonomous geospatial data retrieval agent.</description>

Abstract: The regular spanners (characterised by vset-automata) are closed under the algebraic operations of union, join and projection, and have desirable algorithmic properties. The core spanners (introduced by Fagin, Kimelfeld, Reiss, and Vansummeren (PODS 2013, JACM 2015) as a formalisation of the core functionality of the query language AQL used in IBM's SystemT) additionally need string-equality selections and it has been shown by Freydenberger and Holldack (ICDT 2016, Theory of Computing Systems 2018) that this leads to high complexity and even undecidability of the typical problems in static analysis and query evaluation. We propose an alternative approach to core spanners: by incorporating the string-equality selections directly into the regular language that represents the underlying regular spanner (instead of treating it as an algebraic operation on the table extracted by the regular spanner), we obtain a fragment of core spanners that, while having slightly weaker expressive power than the full class of core spanners, arguably still covers the intuitive applications of string-equality selections for information extraction and has much better upper complexity bounds of the typical problems in static analysis and query evaluation.</description>

      <title>Retrieval Augmented Thought Process for Private Data Handling in Healthcare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the strong potential to assist both clinicians and the general public with their extensive medical knowledge. However, their application in healthcare is constrained due to concerns about the privacy of data used in training, which prevents the integration of private and personal information because of security and ethical issues. Moreover, if their capabilities can be enhanced with information retrieval to access up-to-date knowledge, the current integration of LLMs with Information retrieval lacks robustness to imperfect retrieval, which can hinder their effectiveness and even reduce overall performance. In this work, we address this challenge by introducing the Retrieval-Augmented Thought Process (RATP). Given access to external knowledge, RATP formulates the thought generation of LLMs as a multiple-step decision process. To optimise such a thought process, RATP leverages Monte-Carlo Tree Search and learns a proxy reward function that permits cost-efficient inference. On a private dataset of electronic medical records, deliberately excluded from any LLM training set, RATP achieves 35% additional accuracy compared to in-context retrieval-augmented generation for the question-answering task.</description>

      <title>On the Convergence of No-Regret Dynamics in Information Retrieval Games with Proportional Ranking Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Publishers who publish their content on the web act strategically, in a behavior that can be modeled within the online learning framework. Regret, a central concept in machine learning, serves as a canonical measure for assessing the performance of learning agents within this framework. We prove that any proportional content ranking function with a concave activation function induces games in which no-regret learning dynamics converge. Moreover, for proportional ranking functions, we prove the equivalence of the concavity of the activation function, the social concavity of the induced games and the concavity of the induced games. We also study the empirical trade-offs between publishers' and users' welfare, under different choices of the activation function, using a state-of-the-art no-regret dynamics algorithm. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the choice of the ranking function and changes in the ecosystem structure affect these welfare measures, as well as the dynamics' convergence rate.</description>
