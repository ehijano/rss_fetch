      <title>Learning the climate of dynamical systems with state-space systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-space systems encompass a broad class of algorithms used for modeling and forecasting time series. For such systems to be effective, two objectives must be met: (i) accurate point forecasts of the time series must be produced, and (ii) the long-term statistical behaviour of the underlying data-generating process must be replicated. The latter objective, often referred to as learning the climate, is closely related to the task of producing accurate distribution forecasts. Empirical evidence shows that distribution forecasts are far more stable than point forecasts, which are sensitive to initial conditions. In this work, we rigorously study this phenomenon for state-space systems. The main result shows that, if the underlying data-generating process is structurally stable and possesses a mixing or an attracting measure, then a sufficiently regular initial probability distribution remains close to the true future distribution at arbitrarily long time horizons when forecasted by a $C^1-$close state-space proxy. Thus, under these conditions, learning the climate of a dynamic process with a universal family of state-space systems is feasible with arbitrarily high accuracy.</description>

      <title>Estimates for the 2D Navier-Stokes equations: the effects of forcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mathematical estimates for the Navier-Stokes equations are traditionally expressed in terms of the Grashof number, which is a dimensionless measure of the magnitude of the forcing and hence a control parameter of the system. However, experimental measurements and statistical theories of turbulence are based on the Reynolds number. Thus, a meaningful comparison between mathematical and physical results requires a conversion of the mathematical estimates to a Reynolds-dependent form. In two dimensions, this was achieved under the assumption that the second derivative of the forcing is square integrable. Nonetheless, numerical simulations have shown that the phenomenology of turbulence is sensitive to the degree of regularity of the forcing. Therefore, we extend the available estimates for the energy and enstrophy dissipation rates as well as the attractor dimension to forcings in the Sobolev space of order $s$; i.e. forcings whose Fourier coefficients decay with the wavenumber $k$ faster than $k^{-s-1}$. We consider the range $-1\leqslant s\leqslant 2$, where $s=2$ corresponds to the known estimates, and $s=-1$ is the smallest value of $s$ for which weak solutions are known to exist. The main result is the existence of three distinct regimes as a function of the regularity of the forcing.</description>

      <title>Consecutive-gap ratio distribution for crossover ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of spectrum statistics, such as the consecutive-gap ratio distribution, has revealed many interesting properties of many-body complex systems. Here we propose a two-parameter surmise expression for such distribution to describe the crossover between the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE) and Poisson statistics. This crossover is observed in the isotropic Heisenberg spin-$1/2$ chain with disordered local field, exhibiting the Many-Body Localization (MBL) transition. Inspired by the analysis of stability in dynamical systems, this crossover is presented as a flow pattern in the parameter space, with the Poisson statistics being the fixed point of the system, which represents the MBL phase. We also analyze an isotropic Heisenberg spin-$1/2$ chain with disordered local exchange coupling and a zero magnetic field. In this case, the system never achieves the MBL phase because of the spin rotation symmetry. This case is more sensitive to finite-size effects than the previous one, and thus the flow pattern resembles a two-dimensional random walk close to its fixed point. We propose a system of linearized stochastic differential equations to estimate this fixed point. We study the continuous-state Markov process that governs the probability of finding the system close to this fixed point as the disorder strength increases. In addition, we discuss the conditions under which the stationary probability distribution is given by a bivariate normal distribution.</description>

      <title>Interferometric and Bipartite OTOC for Non-Markovian Open Quantum Spin-Chains and Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The information scrambling phenomena in an open quantum system modeled by Ising spin chains coupled to Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) baths are observed via an interferometric method for obtaining out-of-time-ordered correlators ($\mathcal{F}-$OTOC). We also use an anisotropic bath connecting to a system of tilted field Ising spin chain in order to confirm that such situations are suitable for the emergence of ballistic spreading of information manifested in the light cones in the $\mathcal{F}-$OTOC profiles. Bipartite OTOC is also calculated for a bipartite open system, and its behavior is compared with that of the $\mathcal{F}-$OTOC of a two-spin open system to get a picture of what these measures reveal about the nature of scrambling in different parameter regimes. Additionally, the presence of distinct phases in the LMG model motivated an independent analysis of its scrambling properties, where $\mathcal{F}-$OTOC diagnostics revealed that quantum chaos emerges exclusively in the symmetry-broken phase.</description>
