      <title>Gromov's Compactness Theorem for the Intrinsic Timed-Hausdorff Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove Gromov's Compactness Theorem for the Intrinsic timed Hausdorff ($\tau-H$) convergence of timed-metric-spaces using timed-Fr\'echet maps. Our proof introduces the notion of "addresses" and provides a new way of stating Gromov's original compactness theorem for Gromov-Hausdorff (GH) convergence of metric spaces. We also obtain a new Arzela-Ascoli Theorem for real valued uniformly bounded Lipschitz functions on GH converging compact metric spaces. The intrinsic timed-Hausdorff distance between timed-metric-spaces was first defined by Sakovich-Sormani to define a weak notion of convergence for space-times, and our compactness theorem will soon be applied to advance their work in this direction.</description>

      <title>Characterizing rectifiability via biLipschitz pieces of Lipschitz mappings on the space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give the following characterization of rectifiable metric spaces. A metric space with positive lower Hausdorff density is rectifiable if and only if, for any subset $F$ and $f:F\to Y$, a Lipschitz map into a metric space with positive measure image (of the same dimension), there exists a positive measure subset $A\subset F$ so that $f$ is biLipschitz on $A$. We also give a characterization in terms of a full biLipschitz decomposition. These characterizations are new even for subsets of Euclidean space.
  One of our tools is Alberti representations. On the way we give a method for constructing independent Alberti representations, which may be of independent interest. We use this to characterize unrectifiable metric spaces as those spaces for which there exist a positive measure subset $S$ and a Lipschitz map $\phi$ into a lower dimensional Euclidean space so that $S$ is $\cH^1$-null with respect to all curve fragments that are quantitatively transversal to $\phi$.</description>

      <title>A continuous invariant-based asymmetry of a crystal quantifies its deviation from higher symmetry Z'=1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many crystals are highly symmetric only at some approximation because of experimental noise. In the past, deviations from symmetry in a periodic crystal were quantified by the number Z', which discretely counts geometrically non-equivalent formula units. However, Z' discontinuously changes under almost any displacement of atoms, which can arbitrarily scale up a primitive cell. This discontinuity was recently resolved by a hierarchy of invariant descriptors that continuously change under all small perturbations. We introduce a Continuous Invariant-based Asymmetry (CIA) to quantify the deviation of a periodic crystal from a higher symmetric form in physically meaningful Angstroms. Our experiments on Crystal Structure Prediction landscapes show that many simulated crystals can be filtered out as non-synthesisable not only due to high energy but also due to high values of the CIA, which is much faster to compute. On another hand, many crystals with high Z' values in the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) turned out to be almost symmetric due to low values of the CIA.</description>

      <title>Representing fine shape of local compacta by homotopy classes of ordinary maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fine shape, as defined by Melikhov, is an extension of the strong shape category of compacta (compact metrizable topological spaces) to all metrizable spaces, notable for being compatible with both \v{C}ech cohomology and Steenrod-Sitnikov homology. In this work we study fine shape of local compacta (locally compact separable metrizable spaces), and construct, for every local compactum $X$, a space $|X|$ unique up to a homotopy equivalence and such that fine shape classes from any locally compact metrizable space $Y$ to $X$ bijectively correspond to homotopy classes of ordinary maps from $Y$ to $|X|$. This correspondence is (contravariatly) functorial in $Y$, thus giving a representation of $Y$-dependent contravariant functor for a fixed $X$; the universal class corresponding to the identity map of $X$ is the homotopy class of a specific embedding of $X$ into $|X|$ that is a fine shape equivalence.</description>

      <title>The Combinatorial Loewner Property and super-multiplicativity inequalities for symmetric self-similar metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a general construction of self-similar metric spaces as limits of discrete graphs. Our framework produces many classical examples, such as the Sierpi\'nski carpet and the higher dimensional Menger sponges, but also a rich class of new examples. The main result of the work roughly speaking states: If the construction is sufficiently symmetric then the limiting object supports useful moduli estimates, namely the Combinatorial Loewner property of Bourdon--Kleiner and the super-multiplicativity inequalities. The latter are established on Menger sponges for which it had not been previously known. The main new technique the work offers is a general framework of flows and resistance estimates.</description>

      <title>Convexity and rigidity of hypersurfaces in Cartan-Hadamard manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15454v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that in Cartan-Hadamard manifolds $M^n$, $n\geq 3$, closed infinitesimally convex hypersurfaces $\Gamma$ bound convex flat regions, if curvature of $M^n$ vanishes on tangent planes of $\Gamma$. This encompasses Chern-Lashof-Sacksteder characterization of compact convex hypersurfaces in Euclidean space, and some results of Greene-Wu-Gromov on rigidity of Cartan-Hadamard manifolds. It follows that closed simply connected surfaces in $M^3$ with minimal total absolute curvature bound Euclidean convex bodies, as stated by Gromov in 1985. The proofs employ the Gauss-Codazzi equations, a generalization of Schur comparison theorem to CAT($k$) spaces, and other techniques from Alexandrov geometry outlined by Petrunin.</description>

      <title>Better Late than Never: the Complexity of Arrangements of Polyhedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{A}$ be the subdivision of $\mathbb{R}^d$ induced by $m$ convex polyhedra having $n$ facets in total. We prove that $\mathcal{A}$ has combinatorial complexity $O(m^{\lceil d/2 \rceil} n^{\lfloor d/2 \rfloor})$ and that this bound is tight. The bound is mentioned several times in the literature, but no proof for arbitrary dimension has been published before.</description>

      <title>On the dimension distortion under fractionally smooth mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We determine the extent to which certain classes of fractionally `smooth' continuous mappings between metric spaces distort various dimensions, including the Hausdorff, upper Minkowski (box-counting), and upper intermediate dimensions. Our intermediate and Minkowski dimension distortion results are new even for continuous (fractional) Sobolev and, more generally, Triebel--Lizorkin and Besov mappings between Euclidean spaces, complementing the work of Hencl-Honz\'ik (2015) and Huynh (2022). Moreover, our results also extend the aforementioned work, as well as the work of Kaufman (2000) and Fraser-Tyson (2025) to certain weighted Euclidean spaces and, more generally, to doubling metric measure spaces. As an application of our main result, we quantify the corresponding dimension distortion properties of quasisymmetric mappings for non-Ahlfors regular subsets of metric measure spaces, strengthening a result of Bishop-Hakobyan-Williams (2016).</description>
