      <title>Jackknife inference with two-way clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For linear regression models with cross-section or panel data, it is natural to assume that the disturbances are clustered in two dimensions. However, the finite-sample properties of two-way cluster-robust tests and confidence intervals are often poor. We discuss several ways to improve inference with two-way clustering. Two of these are existing methods for avoiding, or at least ameliorating, the problem of undefined standard errors when a cluster-robust variance matrix estimator (CRVE) is not positive definite. One is a new method that always avoids the problem. More importantly, we propose a family of new two-way CRVEs based on the cluster jackknife. Simulations for models with two-way fixed effects suggest that, in many cases, the cluster-jackknife CRVE combined with our new method yields surprisingly accurate inferences. We provide a simple software package, twowayjack for Stata, that implements our recommended variance estimator.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Theory for Two-Way Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.03805v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proves a new central limit theorem for a sample that exhibits two-way dependence and heterogeneity across clusters. Statistical inference for situations with both two-way dependence and cluster heterogeneity has thus far been an open issue. The existing theory for two-way clustering inference requires identical distributions across clusters (implied by the so-called separate exchangeability assumption). Yet no such homogeneity requirement is needed in the existing theory for one-way clustering. The new result therefore theoretically justifies the view that two-way clustering is a more robust version of one-way clustering, consistent with applied practice. In an application to linear regression, I show that a standard plug-in variance estimator is valid for inference.</description>

      <title>Local Identification in Instrumental Variable Multivariate Quantile Regression Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11422v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the instrumental variable quantile regression (IVQR) model of Chernozhukov and Hansen (2005), a one-dimensional unobserved rank variable monotonically determines a single potential outcome. Even when multiple outcomes are simultaneously of interest, it is common to apply the IVQR model to each of them separately. This practice implicitly assumes that the rank variable of each regression model affects only the corresponding outcome and does not affect the other outcomes. In reality, however, it is often the case that all rank variables together determine the outcomes, which leads to a systematic correlation between the outcomes. To deal with this, we propose a nonlinear IV model that allows for multivariate unobserved heterogeneity, each of which is considered as a rank variable for an observed outcome. We show that the structural function of our model is locally identified under the assumption that the IV and the treatment variable are sufficiently positively correlated.</description>

      <title>Identification by non-Gaussianity in structural threshold and smooth transition vector autoregressive models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear structural vector autoregressive models can be identified statistically without imposing restrictions on the model if the shocks are mutually independent and at most one of them is Gaussian. We show that this result extends to structural threshold and smooth transition vector autoregressive models incorporating a time-varying impact matrix defined as a weighted sum of the impact matrices of the regimes. We also discuss labelling of the shocks, maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters, and stationarity the model. The introduced methods are implemented to the accompanying R package sstvars. Our empirical application studies the effects of the climate policy uncertainty shock on the U.S. macroeconomy. In a structural logistic smooth transition vector autoregressive model consisting of two regimes, we find that a positive climate policy uncertainty shock decreases production in times of low economic policy uncertainty but slightly increases it in times of high economic policy uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Prediction Risk and Estimation Risk of the Ridgeless Least Squares Estimator under General Assumptions on Regression Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.12883v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a significant growth in research focusing on minimum $\ell_2$ norm (ridgeless) interpolation least squares estimators. However, the majority of these analyses have been limited to an unrealistic regression error structure, assuming independent and identically distributed errors with zero mean and common variance. In this paper, we explore prediction risk as well as estimation risk under more general regression error assumptions, highlighting the benefits of overparameterization in a more realistic setting that allows for clustered or serial dependence. Notably, we establish that the estimation difficulties associated with the variance components of both risks can be summarized through the trace of the variance-covariance matrix of the regression errors. Our findings suggest that the benefits of overparameterization can extend to time series, panel and grouped data.</description>
