      <title>Ant Backpressure Routing for Wireless Multi-hop Networks with Mixed Traffic Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A mixture of streaming and short-lived traffic presents a common yet challenging scenario for Backpressure routing in wireless multi-hop networks. Although state-of-the-art shortest-path biased backpressure (SP-BP) can significantly improve the latency of backpressure routing while retaining throughput optimality, it still suffers from the last-packet problem due to its inherent per-commodity queue structure and link capacity assignment. To address this challenge, we propose Ant Backpressure (Ant-BP), a fully distributed routing scheme that incorporates the multi-path routing capability of SP-BP into ant colony optimization (ACO) routing, which allows packets of different commodities to share link capacity in a first-in-first-out (FIFO) manner. Numerical evaluations show that Ant-BP can improve the latency and delivery ratio over SP-BP and ACO routing schemes, while achieving the same throughput of SP-BP under low-to-medium traffic loads.</description>

      <title>Active STAR-RIS Empowered Edge System for Enhanced Energy Efficiency and Task Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of data-intensive and low-latency applications has driven the development of multi-access edge computing (MEC) as a viable solution to meet the increasing demands for high-performance computing and storage capabilities at the network edge. Despite the benefits of MEC, challenges such as obstructions cause non-line-of-sight (NLoS) communication to persist. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and the more advanced simultaneously transmitting and reflecting (STAR)-RISs have emerged to address these challenges; however, practical limitations and multiplicative fading effects hinder their efficacy. We propose an active STAR-RIS-assisted MEC system to overcome these obstacles, leveraging the advantages of active STAR-RIS. The main contributions consist of formulating an optimization problem to minimize energy consumption with task queue stability by jointly optimizing the partial task offloading, amplitude, phase shift coefficients, amplification coefficients, transmit power of the base station (BS), and admitted tasks. Furthermore, we decompose the non-convex problem into manageable sub-problems, employing sequential fractional programming for transmit power control, convex optimization technique for task offloading, and Lyapunov optimization with double deep Q-network (DDQN) for joint amplitude, phase shift, amplification, and task admission. Extensive performance evaluations demonstrate the superiority of the proposed system over benchmark schemes, highlighting its potential for enhancing MEC system performance. Numerical results indicate that our proposed system outperforms the conventional STAR-RIS-assisted by 18.64\% and the conventional RIS-assisted system by 30.43\%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Analysis of DNS Dependencies and their Security Implications in Australia: A Comparative Study of General and Indigenous Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of internet centralization on DNS provisioning, particularly its effects on vulnerable populations such as the indigenous people of Australia. We analyze the DNS dependencies of Australian government domains that serve indigenous communities compared to those serving the general population. Our study categorizes DNS providers into leading (hyperscaler, US-headquartered companies), non-leading (smaller Australian-headquartered or non-Australian companies), and Australian government-hosted providers. Then, we build dependency graphs to demonstrate the direct dependency between Australian government domains and their DNS providers and the indirect dependency involving further layers of providers. Additionally, we conduct an IP location analysis of DNS providers to map out the geographical distribution of DNS servers, revealing the extent of centralization on DNS services within or outside of Australia. Finally, we introduce an attacker model to categorize potential cyber attackers based on their intentions and resources. By considering attacker models and DNS dependency results, we discuss the security vulnerability of each population group against any group of attackers and analyze whether the current setup of the DNS services of Australian government services contributes to a digital divide.</description>

      <title>Advancements in UWB: Paving the Way for Sovereign Data Networks in Healthcare Facilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-Wideband (UWB) technology re-emerges as a groundbreaking ranging technology with its precise micro-location capabilities and robustness. This paper highlights the security dimensions of UWB technology, focusing in particular on the intricacies of device fingerprinting for authentication, examined through the lens of state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. Furthermore, we explore various potential enhancements to the UWB standard that could realize a sovereign UWB data network. We argue that UWB data communication holds significant potential in healthcare and ultra-secure environments, where the use of the common unlicensed 2.4~GHz band-centric wireless technology is limited or prohibited. A sovereign UWB network could serve as an alternative, providing secure localization and short-range data communication in such environments.</description>

      <title>Predictability of Performance in Communication Networks Under Markovian Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13196v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the emergence of time-critical applications in modern communication networks, there is a growing demand for proactive network adaptation and quality of service (QoS) prediction. However, a fundamental question remains largely unexplored: how can we quantify and achieve more predictable communication systems in terms of performance? To address this gap, this paper introduces a theoretical framework for defining and analyzing predictability in communication systems, with a focus on the impact of observations for performance forecasting. We establish a mathematical definition of predictability based on the total variation distance between forecast and marginal performance distributions. A system is deemed unpredictable when the forecast distribution, providing the most comprehensive characterization of future states using all accessible information, is indistinguishable from the marginal distribution, which depicts the system's behavior without any observational input. This framework is applied to multi-hop systems under Markovian conditions, with a detailed analysis of Geo/Geo/1 queuing models in both single-hop and multi-hop scenarios. We derive exact and approximate expressions for predictability in these systems, as well as upper bounds based on spectral analysis of the underlying Markov chains. Our results have implications for the design of efficient monitoring and prediction mechanisms in future communication networks aiming to provide deterministic services.</description>

      <title>Fiber neural networks for the intelligent optical fiber communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical neural networks have long cast attention nowadays. Like other optical structured neural networks, fiber neural networks which utilize the mechanism of light transmission to compute can take great advantages in both computing efficiency and power cost. Though the potential ability of optical fiber was demonstrated via the establishing of fiber neural networks, it will be of great significance of combining both fiber transmission and computing functions so as to cater the needs of future beyond 5G intelligent communication signal processing. Thus, in this letter, the fiber neural networks and their related optical signal processing methods will be both developed. In this way, information derived from the transmitted signals can be directly processed in the optical domain rather than being converted to the electronic domain. As a result, both prominent gains in processing efficiency and power cost can be further obtained. The fidelity of the whole structure and related methods is demonstrated by the task of modulation format recognition which plays important role in fiber optical communications without losing the generality.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Vehicle Environmental Awareness via Federated Learning and Automatic Labeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vehicle environmental awareness is a crucial issue in improving road safety. Through a variety of sensors and vehicle-to-vehicle communication, vehicles can collect a wealth of data. However, to make these data useful, sensor data must be integrated effectively. This paper focuses on the integration of image data and vehicle-to-vehicle communication data. More specifically, our goal is to identify the locations of vehicles sending messages within images, a challenge termed the vehicle identification problem. In this paper, we employ a supervised learning model to tackle the vehicle identification problem. However, we face two practical issues: first, drivers are typically unwilling to share privacy-sensitive image data, and second, drivers usually do not engage in data labeling. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a comprehensive solution to the vehicle identification problem, which leverages federated learning and automatic labeling techniques in combination with the aforementioned supervised learning model. We have validated the feasibility of our proposed approach through experiments.</description>

      <title>2FA Sketch: Two-Factor Armor Sketch for Accurate and Efficient Heavy Hitter Detection in Data Streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02203</link>
      <description>arXiv:1909.02203v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detecting heavy hitters, which are flows exceeding a specified threshold, is crucial for network measurement, but it faces challenges due to increasing throughput and memory constraints. Existing sketch-based solutions, particularly those using Comparative Counter Voting, have limitations in efficiently identifying heavy hitters. This paper introduces the Two-Factor Armor (2FA) Sketch, a novel data structure designed to enhance heavy hitter detection in data streams. 2FA Sketch implements dual-layer protection through an improved $\mathtt{Arbitration}$ strategy for in-bucket competition and a cross-bucket conflict $\mathtt{Avoidance}$ hashing scheme. By theoretically deriving an optimal $\lambda$ parameter and redesigning $vote^+_{new}$ as a conflict indicator, it optimizes the Comparative Counter Voting strategy. Experimental results show that 2FA Sketch outperforms the standard Elastic Sketch, reducing error rates by 2.5 to 19.7 times and increasing processing speed by 1.03 times.</description>

      <title>Saihu: A Common Interface of Worst-Case Delay Analysis Tools for Time-Sensitive Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.14565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-sensitive networks, as in the context of IEEE-TSN and IETF-Detnet, require bounds on worst-case delays. Various network analysis tools compute such bounds; these tools are based on different methods and provide delay bounds that are all valid but may differ; furthermore, it is generally not known which tool will provide the best bound. To obtain the best possible bound, users need to implement multiple pieces of code with a different syntax for every tool, which is impractical and error-prone. To address this issue, we present Saihu, a Python interface that integrates the three most frequently used worst-case network analysis tools: xTFA, DiscoDNC, and Panco. They altogether implement six analysis methods. Saihu provides a general interface that enables defining a network in a single file and executing all tools simultaneously without any modification. Saihu further exports analysis results as formatted reports automatically and allows quick generation of certain types of networks. With its simplified steps of execution, Saihu reduces the burden on users and makes it accessible for anyone working with time-sensitive networks.</description>

      <title>Measurement-based Resource Allocation and Control in Data Centers: A Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09497v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data centers have become ubiquitous for today's businesses. From banks to startups, they rely on cloud infrastructure to deploy user applications. In this context, it is vital to provide users with application performance guarantees. Network interference is one of the causes of unpredictable application performance, and many solutions have been proposed over the years. The main objective of this survey is to familiarize the reader with research into network measurement-based resource allocation and control in data centers, focusing on network resources in order to provide cloud performance guarantees. We start with a primer on general network measurement techniques and data center network and applications to give the reader context. We then summarize the characteristics of network traffic and cluster workloads in data centers, which are pivotal for measurement-based allocation and control. We study and compare network monitoring in data centers, giving an overview on their evolution from Software-Defined Networking (SDN) to programmable dataplanes-based. The network monitoring information can serve as input to cluster allocation and scheduling decisions. We next categorize cluster scheduling frameworks, and perform an analysis of those that provide network guarantees in data centers, and we also look at emergent Machine Learning-driven resource allocation and control. We conclude with a discussion about future research directions.</description>

      <title>OpsEval: A Comprehensive IT Operations Benchmark Suite for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07637v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Information Technology (IT) Operations (Ops), particularly Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps), is the guarantee for maintaining the orderly and stable operation of existing information systems. According to Gartner's prediction, the use of AI technology for automated IT operations has become a new trend. Large language models (LLMs) that have exhibited remarkable capabilities in NLP-related tasks, are showing great potential in the field of AIOps, such as in aspects of root cause analysis of failures, generation of operations and maintenance scripts, and summarizing of alert information. Nevertheless, the performance of current LLMs in Ops tasks is yet to be determined. In this paper, we present OpsEval, a comprehensive task-oriented Ops benchmark designed for LLMs. For the first time, OpsEval assesses LLMs' proficiency in various crucial scenarios at different ability levels. The benchmark includes 7184 multi-choice questions and 1736 question-answering (QA) formats in English and Chinese. By conducting a comprehensive performance evaluation of the current leading large language models, we show how various LLM techniques can affect the performance of Ops, and discussed findings related to various topics, including model quantification, QA evaluation, and hallucination issues. To ensure the credibility of our evaluation, we invite dozens of domain experts to manually review our questions. At the same time, we have open-sourced 20% of the test QA to assist current researchers in preliminary evaluations of their OpsLLM models. The remaining 80% of the data, which is not disclosed, is used to eliminate the issue of the test set leakage. Additionally, we have constructed an online leaderboard that is updated in real-time and will continue to be updated, ensuring that any newly emerging LLMs will be evaluated promptly. Both our dataset and leaderboard have been made public.</description>
