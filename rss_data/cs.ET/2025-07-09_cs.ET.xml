      <title>Optimizing Cognitive Networks: Reinforcement Learning Meets Energy Harvesting Over Cascaded Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a reinforcement learning (RL) based approach to improve the physical layer security (PLS) of an underlay cognitive radio network (CRN) over cascaded channels. These channels are utilized in highly mobile networks such as cognitive vehicular networks (CVN). In addition, an eavesdropper aims to intercept the communications between secondary users (SUs). The SU receiver has full-duplex and energy harvesting capabilities to generate jamming signals to confound the eavesdropper and enhance security. Moreover, the SU transmitter extracts energy from ambient radio frequency signals in order to power subsequent transmissions to its intended receiver. To optimize the privacy and reliability of the SUs in a CVN, a deep Q-network (DQN) strategy is utilized where multiple DQN agents are required such that an agent is assigned at each SU transmitter. The objective for the SUs is to determine the optimal transmission power and decide whether to collect energy or transmit messages during each time period in order to maximize their secrecy rate. Thereafter, we propose a DQN approach to maximize the throughput of the SUs while respecting the interference threshold acceptable at the receiver of the primary user. According to our findings, our strategy outperforms two other baseline strategies in terms of security and reliability.</description>

      <title>Maximizing Reliability in Overlay Radio Networks with Time Switching and Power Splitting Energy Harvesting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cognitive radio networks (CRNs) are acknowledged for their ability to tackle the issue of spectrum under-utilization. In the realm of CRNs, this paper investigates the energy efficiency issue and addresses the critical challenge of optimizing system reliability for overlay CRN access mode. Randomly dispersed secondary users (SUs) serving as relays for primary users (PUs) are considered, in which one of these relays is designated to harvest energy through the time switching-energy harvesting (EH) protocol. Moreover, this relay amplifies-and-forwards (AF) the PU's messages and broadcasts them along with its own across cascaded $\kappa$-$\mu$ fading channels. The power splitting protocol is another EH approach utilized by the SU and PU receivers to enhance the amount of energy in their storage devices. In addition, the SU transmitters and the SU receiver are deployed with multiple antennas for reception and apply the maximal ratio combining approach. The outage probability is utilized to assess both networks' reliability. Then, an energy efficiency evaluation is performed to determine the effectiveness of EH on the system. Finally, an optimization problem is provided with the goal of maximizing the data rate of the SUs by optimizing the time switching and the power allocation parameters of the SU relay.</description>

      <title>Experimental Ground-State Energy of a 125-Site Flat Kagome Antiferromagnet via Hamiltonian Engineering on Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an instance of utility-grade quantum computation by calculating the ground-state energy of a 125-site flat Kagome lattice under the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model (KAFH), using IBM's Falcon and Hummingbird quantum processors. For spin-1/2 KAFH, our best per-site ground-state energy estimate reaches -0.417J, and after applying open-boundary corrections, it closely approaches the established thermodynamic value of -0.438J. To achieve this, we propose a hybrid approach that splits the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) into local (classical) and global (quantum) components for efficient hardware utilization. We further introduce a Hamiltonian engineering strategy that increases coupling on defect triangles to mimic loop-flip dynamics, allowing us to simplify the ansatz while retaining physical accuracy. Using a single-repetition, hardware-efficient ansatz, we entangle up to 103 qubits with high fidelity to determine the Hamiltonian's lowest eigenvalue. This work demonstrates the scalability of VQE for frustrated 2D systems and lays the foundation for future studies using deeper ansatz circuits and larger lattices.</description>

      <title>Rugsafe: A multichain protocol for recovering from and defending against Rug Pulls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rugsafe introduces a comprehensive protocol aimed at mitigating the risks of rug pulls in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. By utilizing cryptographic security measures and economic incentives, the protocol provides a secure multichain system for recovering assets and transforming rugged tokens into opportunities and rewards. Foundational to Rugsafe are specialized vaults where rugged tokens can be securely deposited, and anticoin tokens are issued as receipts. These anticoins are designed to be inversely pegged to the price movement of the underlying rugged token. Users can utilize these anticoins within the ecosystem or choose to burn them, further securing the protocol and earning additional rewards. The supply of the native Rugsafe token is dynamically adjusted based on the volume, value, and activity of rugged tokens, ensuring stability and resilience. By depositing rugged tokens into a vault on several chains, and by burning anticoins, users receive incentives on the RugSafe chain. This protocol's vaults are designed to work in heterogenous blockchain ecosystems, offering a practical and effective solution to one of the most significant challenges in the cryptocurrency market.</description>

      <title>InvestAlign: Overcoming Data Scarcity in Aligning Large Language Models with Investor Decision-Making Processes under Herd Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with investor decision-making processes under herd behavior is a critical challenge in behavioral finance, which grapples with a fundamental limitation: the scarcity of real-user data needed for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). While SFT can bridge the gap between LLM outputs and human behavioral patterns, its reliance on massive authentic data imposes substantial collection costs and privacy risks. We propose InvestAlign, a novel framework that constructs high-quality SFT datasets by leveraging theoretical solutions to similar and simple optimal investment problems rather than complex scenarios. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that training LLMs with InvestAlign-generated data achieves faster parameter convergence than using real-user data, suggesting superior learning efficiency. Furthermore, we develop InvestAgent, an LLM agent fine-tuned with InvestAlign, which demonstrates significantly closer alignment to real-user data than pre-SFT models in both simple and complex investment problems. This highlights our proposed InvestAlign as a promising approach with the potential to address complex optimal investment problems and align LLMs with investor decision-making processes under herd behavior. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/thu-social-network-research-group/InvestAlign.</description>

This review comprehensively examines recent progress in nanophotonic principles and applications, highlighting key innovations in material design, device engineering, and system integration. In renewable energy, nanophotonic allows light-trapping nanostructures and spectral control in perovskite solar cells, concentrating solar power, and thermophotovoltaics. That have significantly enhanced solar conversion efficiencies, approaching theoretical limits. For biosensing, nanophotonic platforms achieve unprecedented sensitivity in detecting biomolecules, pathogens, and pollutants, enabling real-time diagnostics and environmental monitoring. Medical applications leverage tailored light-matter interactions for precision photothermal therapy, image-guided surgery, and early disease detection. Furthermore, nanophotonics underpins next-generation optical neural networks and neuromorphic computing, offering ultra-fast, energy-efficient alternatives to von Neumann architectures. Despite rapid growth, challenges in scalability, fabrication costs, and material stability persist. Future advancements will rely on novel materials, AI-driven design optimization, and multidisciplinary approaches to enable scalable, low-cost deployment.

      <title>Are NFTs Ready to Keep Australian Artists Engaged?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) offer a promising mechanism to protect Australian and Indigenous artists' copyright. They represent and transfer the value of artwork in digital form. Before adopting NFTs to protect Australian artwork, we in this paper investigate them empericially. We focus on examining the details of NFT structure. We start from the underlying structure of NFTs to show how they represent copyright for both artists and production owners, as well as how they aim to safeguard or secure the value of digital artworks. We then involve data collection from various types of sources with different storage methods, including on-chain, centralized, and decentralized systems. Based on both metadata and artwork content, we present our analysis and discussion on the following key issues: copyright, security and artist identification. The final results of the evaluation, unfortnately, show that the NFT is NOT ready to protect Australian and Indigenous artists' copyright.</description>

      <title>No physics required! A visual-based introduction to GKP qubits for computer scientists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the significance of continuous-variable quantum computing increasing thanks to the achievements of light-based quantum hardware, making it available to learner audiences outside physics has been an important yet seldom-tackled challenge. Similarly, the rising focus on fault-tolerant quantum computing has shed light on quantum error correction schemes, turning it into the locus of attention for industry and academia alike. In this paper, we explore the widely adopted framework of quantum error correction based on continuous variable systems and suggest a guide on building a self-contained learning session targeting the famous Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code through its geometric intuition.</description>

      <title>Federated Learning-based MARL for Strengthening Physical-Layer Security in B5G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the application of a federated learning-based multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) strategy to enhance physical-layer security (PLS) in a multi-cellular network within the context of beyond 5G networks. At each cell, a base station (BS) operates as a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent that interacts with the surrounding environment to maximize the secrecy rate of legitimate users in the presence of an eavesdropper. This eavesdropper attempts to intercept the confidential information shared between the BS and its authorized users. The DRL agents are deemed to be federated since they only share their network parameters with a central server and not the private data of their legitimate users. Two DRL approaches, deep Q-network (DQN) and Reinforce deep policy gradient (RDPG), are explored and compared. The results demonstrate that RDPG converges more rapidly than DQN. In addition, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the distributed DRL approach. Furthermore, the outcomes illustrate the trade-off between security and complexity.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Multiple-Control Toffoli Quantum Circuit Design with Constraint Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14384v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As quantum technology advances, the efficient design of quantum circuits has become an important area of research. This paper provides an introduction to the MCT quantum circuit design problem for reversible Boolean functions with the necessary background in quantum computing to comprehend the problem. While this is a well-studied problem, optimization models that minimize the true objective have only been explored recently. This paper introduces a new optimization model and symmetry-breaking constraints that improve solving time by up to two orders of magnitude compared to earlier work when a Constraint Programming solver is used. Experiments with up to seven qubits and using up to 15 quantum gates result in several new best-known circuits, obtained by any method, for well-known benchmarks. Several in-depth analyses are presented to validate the effectiveness of the symmetry-breaking constraints from multiple perspectives. Finally, an extensive comparison with other approaches shows that optimization models may require more time but can provide superior circuits with optimality guarantees.</description>
