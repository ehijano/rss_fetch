      <title>On the Accelerated Expansion of the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If we look at from a quantum perspective, the most natural way in which the universe can be created is in entangled pairs whose time flow is oppositely related. This suggests the idea of the creation of a universe-antiuniverse pair. Assuming the validity of this hypothesis, in this paper, we show that the universe expands in an accelerated manner. The same reasoning holds for the anti-universe as well. This idea does not require any form of dark energy as used in the standard cosmological model of ${\Lambda}$CDM or in the modified theories of gravity.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically Schwarzschild Solutions in $f(R)$ Extension of General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the question of how to build a class of $f(R)$ extensions of General Relativity which are compatible with solar system experiments, without making any preliminary assumption on the properties of $f$. The aim is reached by perturbatively solving the modified Einstein equations around a Schwarzschild background and retrieving a posteriori the corresponding $f(R)$. This turns out to be non analytical in $R=0$ and should be intended as the leading correction to the Einstein-Hilbert action in the low curvature limit. The parameters characterizing the $f(R)$ class are then set by constraining the corrections to four different local tests with the observations. The result is a class of $f(R)$ theories built up from a purely bottom-up approach and compatible with the local tests. At a more general level, this result can help constraining exact $f(R)$ models working in Cosmology, since it provides the correct local limit. Further developments and possible extensions of the approach to Cosmology are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo methods for stationary solutions of general-relativistic Vlasov systems: Planar accretion onto a moving Schwarzschild black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform Monte Carlo simulations of stationary planar accretion of a collisionless gas onto a moving Schwarzschild black hole. In this work -- a sequel to our previous paper on the Monte Carlo method for stationary general-relativistic Vlasov systems -- we demonstrate that our approach can be extended beyond the simplifying assumptions of the spherical symmetry or axial symmetry in the planar case. Our method of computing observable quantities, such as the particle current density, can be regarded as a rigorous coarse graining scheme, adapted to a numerical grid. Main difficulties are related to the appropriate parametrization of particle trajectories and a selection of parameters consistent with assumed requirements on the distribution function.</description>

      <title>(In)stability of the black hole greybody factors and ringdowns against a small-bump correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, it has been proposed that the black hole greybody factors can be important to model ringdown spectral amplitudes. We study the stability of greybody factors against a small-bump correction in the perturbation equation. We find (I) that the greybody factor is stable in the frequency region relevant to ringdown and (II) that it is destabilized at higher frequencies, especially for a sharper bump correction. This behavior is similar to the case of higher overtones, which is also very sensitive to a small correction. We clarify this (in)stability with the WKB analysis. As the greybody factor is stable at the frequency region relevant to the main part of ringdown, we conclude that the greybody factor is suitable to model ringdown amplitude. In order to investigate a bump correction in a self-consistent manner, we consider the small-bump correction that can be realized in the general framework of effective field theory of black hole perturbations.</description>

      <title>Bianchi I spacetimes in $f\left(Q\right)$-gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kasner spacetimes are exact solutions that are self-similar and of significant interest because they can describe the dynamic evolution of kinematic variables near the singularity of the Mixmaster universe. The chaotic behavior of the Mixmaster universe is related to the Kasner relations. This study investigates Kasner and Kasner-like solutions in symmetric teleparallel $f\left( Q\right) $-gravity. We consider three families of connections for the spatially flat Friedmann-Lema\^{\i}tre-Robertson-Walker. We found that Kasner-like solutions are present in the theory when the nonmetricity scalar $Q$ vanishes. Kasner-like relations are introduced only for the field equations of the connection defined in the coincidence gauge. Finally, we perform a detailed phase-space analysis to understand the dynamics of $f\left( Q\right) $-gravity in the evolution of anisotropies and the effects of different connections on this evolution.</description>

      <title>Effect of Accretion on the evolution of Primordial Black Holes in the context of Modified Gravity Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigates the effect of accretion of cosmic fluid on the evolution of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) within the framework of Modified gravity theories. We consider a general form of the Hubble parameter, reflecting a general class of modified gravity theories and bouncing models. We then study the effect of such modified dynamics on PBH in the presence of Hawking radiation and accretion of surrounding materials. We investigate how the evolution of PBHs is influenced by accretion across different cosmological eras, considering the radiation, matter, and dark energy-dominated phases like phantom and quintessence for linear equation of state. We further incorporated Non-linear Equations of State such as Chaplygin Gas, Modified Chaplygin gas, Van der Waals model, Polytropic Fluid model. The study systematically analyzes the mass variation of PBHs in the presence of such different cosmological environments. The results will contribute to the understanding of PBH formation and evolution in modified theory of gravity, and their possibility of being detected with future experiments.</description>

      <title>Superradiance of rotating black holes surrounded by dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In rotating black hole background surrounded by dark matter, we investigated the super-radiant phenomenon of massive scalar field and its associated instability.Using the method of asymptotic matching, we computed the amplification factor of scalar wave scattering to assess the strength of super-radiance. We discussed the influence of dark matter density on amplification factor in this black hole background. Our result indicates that the presence of dark matter has suppressive influence on black hole super-radiance. We also computed the net extracted energy to further support this result. Finally, we analyzed the super-radiant instability caused by massive scalar field using the black hole bomb mechanism and found that the presence of dark matter has no influence on the super-radiant instability condition.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes and ringdown waveform of the Frolov black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the scalar perturbation over the Frolov black hole (BH), which is a regular BH induced by the quantum gravity effect. The quasinormal frequencies (QNFs) of scalar field always consistently reside in the lower half-plane, and its time-domain evolution demonstrates a decaying behavior, with the late-time tail exhibiting a power-law pattern. These observations collectively suggest the stability of the Frolov BH against scalar perturbation. Additionally, our study reveals that quantum gravity effects lead to slower decay modes. For the case of the angular quantum number $l=0$, the oscillation exhibits non-monotonic behavior with the quantum gravity parameter $\alpha_0$. However, once $l\geq 1$, the angular quantum number surpasses the influence of the quantum gravity effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider null and time-like geodesics around a spherically symmetric, non-rotating Coherent Quantum Black Hole (CQBH). The classical limit of the geometry of CQBH departs from that of the Schwarzschild spacetime at short scales and depends on one parameter $R_s$ which can be interpreted as the physical radius of the 'quantum' core. We study circular orbits, photon rings, and lensing effects and compare them with the Schwarzschild metric. Using the relativistic ray-tracing code GYOTO, we produce a simulation of the shadow and show that thin accretion disks around a CQBH possess unique ring structures that distinguish them from other theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Emergent Universe from an Unstable de Sitter Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Emergent scenario, the Universe should evolve from a non-singular state replacing the typical singularity of General Relativity, for any initial condition. For the scalar field model in [1] we show that only a subset of initial conditions leads to emergence, either from a static state (an Einstein model), or from a de Sitter state.
  Assuming a scenario based on CDM interacting with a Dark Energy fluid, we show that in general flat and open models expand from a non-singular unstable de Sitter state at high energies; for closed models this state is a transition phase with a bounce. A subset of these models are qualitatively in agreement with the observable Universe, accelerating at high energies, going through a matter-dominated decelerated era, then accelerating toward a de Sitter phase.</description>

      <title>Fourth Post-Minkowskian Local-in-Time Conservative Dynamics of Binary Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the purely local-in-time (scale-free and logarithm-free) part of the conservative dynamics of gravitationally interacting two-body systems at the fourth post-Minkowskian order, and at the thirtiest order in velocity. The gauge-invariant content of this fourth post-Minkowskian local dynamics is given in two ways: (i) its contribution to the on-shell action (for both hyperboliclike and ellipticlike motions); and (ii) its contribution to the Effective One Body Hamiltonian (in energy gauge). Our computation capitalizes on the Tutti Frutti approach [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{123}, no.23, 231104 (2019)], and on recent post-Minkowskian advances [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{128}, no.16, 161103 (2022)], [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{128}, no.16, 161104 (2022)], and [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{132}, no.22, 221401 (2024)].</description>

      <title>Exotic compact objects: a recent numerical-relativity perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beyond black holes and neutron stars, new hypothetical compact objects have been proposed as potential astrophysical entities. In general, their properties have not yet been fully explored or understood, nor has it been proven whether or not they exist in nature. They are the so-called $\textit{exotic compact objects}$, theoretical equilibrium configurations in the strong regime of gravity that involve new exotic physical phenomena deeply related to fundamental questions of theoretical physics (e.g., the nature of dark matter, the formation of singularities, or the presence of horizons). Among these exotic objects, there are those that require the existence of new fields and particles beyond the Standard Model, such as boson stars and ultralight bosons; those that seek to describe the dense equation of state of neutron stars as an even more extreme state of matter made up of free quarks; or those that exhibit additional properties related to extensions of General Relativity or even quantum gravity. However, in order to move from theoretical objects to astrophysical objects, their dynamics and stability must first be assessed by performing numerical-relativity simulations under the premise that solutions that are unstable on dynamical timescales will never completely form, being, at most, a transient state that will not be able to play any astrophysical role. Furthermore, numerical simulations also make it possible to extract the gravitational radiation from relevant astrophysical scenarios, such as the collapse of exotic stars or binary mergers, which could then be compared with current and upcoming LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA gravitational-wave detections.</description>

      <title>Scalar Dark Energy Models and Scalar-Tensor Gravity: Theoretical Explanations for the Accelerated Expansion of Present Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reason for the present accelerated expansion of the Universe stands as one of the most profound questions in the realm of science, with deep connections to both cosmology and fundamental physics. From a cosmological point of view, physical models aimed at elucidating the observed expansion can be categorized into two major classes: dark energy and modified gravity. We review various major approaches that employ a single scalar field to account for the accelerating phase of our present Universe. Dynamical system analysis is employed in several important models to seek for cosmological solutions that exhibit an accelerating phase as an attractor. For scalar field models of dark energy, we consistently focus on addressing challenges related to the fine-tuning and coincidence problems in cosmology, as well as exploring potential solutions to them. For scalar-tensor theories and their generalizations, we emphasize the importance of constraints on theoretical parameters to ensure overall consistency with experimental tests. Models or theories that could potentially explain the Hubble tension are also emphasized throughout this review.</description>

      <title>GR-Athena++: magnetohydrodynamical evolution with dynamical space-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a self-contained overview of GR-Athena++, a general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) code, that incorporates treatment of dynamical space-time, based on the recent work of (Daszuta+, 2021)[49] and (Cook+, 2023)[45].
  General aspects of the Athena++ framework we build upon, such as oct-tree based, adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) and constrained transport, together with our modifications, incorporating the Z4c formulation of numerical relativity, judiciously coupled, enables GRMHD with dynamical space-times.
  Initial verification testing of GR-Athena++ is performed through benchmark problems that involve isolated and binary neutron star space-times. This leads to stable and convergent results. Gravitational collapse of a rapidly rotating star through black hole formation is shown to be correctly handled. In the case of non-rotating stars, magnetic field instabilities are demonstrated to be correctly captured with total relative violation of the divergence-free constraint remaining near machine precision.
  The use of AMR is show-cased through investigation of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability which is resolved at the collisional interface in a merger of magnetised binary neutron stars.
  The underlying task-based computational model enables GR-Athena++ to achieve strong scaling efficiencies above $80\%$ in excess of $10^5$ CPU cores and excellent weak scaling up to $\sim 5 \times 10^5$ CPU cores in a realistic production setup. GR-Athena++ thus provides a viable path towards robust simulation of GRMHD flows in strong and dynamical gravity with exascale high performance computational infrastructure.</description>

      <title>The binding of cosmological structures by massless topological defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assuming spherical symmetry and weak field, it is shown that if one solves the Poisson equation or the Einstein field equations sourced by a topological defect, \ie~a singularity of a very specific form, the result is a localised gravitational field capable of driving flat rotation (\ie~Keplerian circular orbits at a constant speed for all radii) of test masses on a thin spherical shell without any underlying mass. Moreover, a large-scale structure which exploits this solution by assembling concentrically a number of such topological defects can establish a flat stellar or galactic rotation curve, and can also deflect light in the same manner as an equipotential (isothermal) sphere. Thus the need for dark matter or modified gravity theory is mitigated, at least in part.</description>

      <title>Feasible generation of gravity-induced entanglement by using optomechanical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the feasibility of detecting the gravity-induced entanglement (GIE) with optomechanical systems, which is the first investigation that clarifies the feasible experimental parameters to achieve a signal-to-noise ratio of S/N=1. Our proposal focuses on GIE generation between optomechanical mirrors, coupled via gravitational interactions, under continuous measurement, feedback control, and Kalman filtering process, which matured in connection with the field of gravitational wave observations. We solved the Riccati equation to evaluate the time evolution of the conditional covariance matrix for optomechanical mirrors that estimated the minimum variance of the motions. The results demonstrate that GIE is generated faster than a well-known time scale without optomechanical coupling. The fast generation of entanglement is associated with quantum-state squeezing by the Kalman filtering process, which is an advantage of using optomechanical systems to experimentally detect GIE.</description>

      <title>How the Hilbert space of two-sided black holes factorises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In AdS/CFT, two-sided black holes are described by states in the tensor product of two Hilbert spaces associated with the two asymptotic boundaries of the spacetime. Understanding how such a tensor product arises from the bulk perspective is an important open problem in holography, known as the factorisation puzzle. In this paper, we show how the Hilbert space of bulk states factorises due to non-perturbative contributions of spacetime wormholes: the trace over two-sided states with different particle excitations behind the horizon factorises into a product of traces of the left and right sides. This precisely occurs when such states form a complete basis for the bulk Hilbert space. We prove that the factorisation of the trace persists to all non-perturbative orders in $1/G_N$, consequently providing a possible resolution to the factorisation puzzle from the gravitational path integral. In the language of von Neumann algebras, our results provide strong evidence that the algebra of one-sided observables transitions from a Type II or Type III algebra, depending on whether or not perturbative gravity effects are included, to a Type I factor when including non-perturbative corrections in the bulk.</description>

Abstract: Recent developments in static patch holography proposed that quantum gravity in de Sitter space admits a dual description in terms of a quantum mechanical theory living on a timelike surface near the cosmological horizon. In parallel, geometric observables associated with the Einstein-Rosen bridge of a black hole background were suggested to compute the computational complexity of the state dual to a gravitational theory. In this work, we pursue the study of the complexity=volume and complexity=action conjectures in a Schwarzschild-de Sitter geometry perturbed by the insertion of a shockwave at finite boundary times. This analysis extends previous studies that focused either on the complexity=volume 2.0 conjecture, or on the case of a shockwave inserted along the cosmological horizon. We show that the switchback effect, describing the delay in the evolution of complexity in reaction to a perturbation, is a universal feature of the complexity proposals in asymptotically de Sitter space. The geometric origin of this phenomenon is related to the causal connection between the static patches of de Sitter space when a positive pulse of null energy is inserted in the geometry.</description>

      <title>Identifying Host Galaxies of Supermassive Black Hole Binaries Found by PTAs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) present us with exciting opportunities for multi-messenger science. These systems are thought to form naturally in galaxy mergers and therefore have the potential to produce electromagnetic (EM) radiation as well as gravitational waves (GWs) detectable with pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). Once GWs from individually resolved SMBHBs are detected, the identification of the host galaxy will be a major challenge due to the ambiguity in possible EM signatures and the poor localization capability of PTAs. In order to aid EM observations in choosing which sources to follow up, we attempt to quantify the number of plausible hosts in both realistic and idealistic scenarios. We outline a host galaxy identification pipeline that injects a single-source GW signal into a simulated PTA dataset, uses production-level techniques to recover the signal, quantifies the localization region and number of galaxies contained therein, and finally imposes cuts on the galaxies using the binary parameters estimated from the GW search. In an ideal case, we find that the 90% credible areas span 29 deg^2 to 241 deg^2, containing about 14 to 341 galaxies. After cuts, the number of galaxies remaining ranges from 22 at worst to 1 (the true host) at best. In a more realistic case, if the signal is sufficiently localized, the sky areas range from 287 deg^2 to 530 deg^2 and enclose about 285 to 1238 galaxies. After cuts, the number of galaxies is 397 at worst and 27 at best. While the signal-to-noise ratio is the primary determinant of the localization area of a given source, we find that the size of the area is also influenced by the proximity of nearby pulsars on the sky and the chirp mass of the source.</description>

      <title>The KLT kernel in twistor space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The double copy relationship between Yang-Mills theory and general relativity can be stated in terms of a field theory Kawai-Lewellen-Tye (KLT) momentum kernel, which maps two colour-ordered gluon amplitudes to a graviton amplitude at tree-level. These amplitudes can also be written in compact, helicity-graded representations on twistor space which include the famous Parke-Taylor and Hodges formulae in the maximal helicity violating sector. However, a double copy formulation of these helicity-graded formulae has proved elusive. In this paper, we use graph-theoretic methods to obtain an explicit double copy representation of the tree-level, helicity graded S-matrix of general relativity in terms of a KLT-like integral kernel in twistor space. This integral kernel glues together two colour-ordered integrands for tree-level gluon scattering on twistor space to produce tree-level graviton amplitudes, and admits a chiral splitting into positive and negative helicity degrees of freedom. Furthermore, the kernel can be inverted to obtain a new formula for the tree-level S-matrix of biadjoint scalar theory, which we verify using recursion relations. We also derive extensions of this integral kernel to graviton scattering in anti-de Sitter space and self-dual radiative spacetimes, commenting on their potential double copy interpretations.</description>

      <title>Accelerated protons produced by magnetic Penrose process in Sgr A*</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Typical mechanisms to extract energies from a rotating black hole are the Blandford-Znajek process and the Penrose process. The Penrose process requires a special condition that is difficult to occur in common astrophysical situations. However, the magnetic Penrose process (MPP) does not require such a special condition, and can produce ultra-high energy cosmic rays. When neutrons decay near a rotating black hole, the MPP efficiency of the produced proton is maximized. The supermassive black hole in Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) is likely to have a radiatively inefficient accretion flow that is hot enough to produce neutrons by nuclear reactions, which can be subsequently accelerated to high-energy by the MPP. We calculate the production rate of accelerated protons from the Sgr A* to estimated the gamma-ray flux at Earth produced by these accelerated protons and the flux of the accelerated protons themselves transported from Sgr A* to Earth. We find that these very high-energy gamma rays ($E_{\gamma}\gtrsim10\,\mathrm{TeV}$) amount to a significant fraction of the flux of the gamma-ray from the HESS J1745-290 and the central molecular zone around $100\,\mathrm{TeV}$. The accelerated proton flux, when the dimensionless spin parameter $a_{*}=0.5$ and the magnetic field strength in the vicinity of the black hole $B_{0}=100\,\mathrm{G}$, is about $1.6-4.1\%$ of the cosmic ray proton flux from KASCADE experiment at about $1\,\mathrm{PeV}$. Due to the finite decay time of neutrons which need to be transported from the accretion flow to the acceleration zone, our acceleration model can operate only around black holes with mass not much greater than $\sim10^8\,M_\odot$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the pair production, string breaking, and hadronization of a receding electron-positron pair using the bosonized version of the massive Schwinger model in quantum electrodynamics in 1+1 space-time dimensions. Specifically, we study the dynamics of the electric field in Bjorken coordinates by splitting it into a coherent field and its Gaussian fluctuations. We find that the electric field shows damped oscillations, reflecting pair production. Interestingly, the computation of the asymptotic total particle density per rapidity interval for large masses can be fitted using a Boltzmann factor, where the temperature can be related to the hadronization temperature in QCD. Lastly, we discuss the possibility of an analog quantum simulation of the massive Schwinger model using ultracold atoms, explicitly matching the potential of the Schwinger model to the effective potential for the relative phase of two linearly coupled Bose-Einstein condensates.</description>

      <title>Recovering a phase transition signal in simulated LISA data with a modulated galactic foreground</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic backgrounds of gravitational waves from primordial first-order phase transitions are a key probe of physics beyond the Standard Model. They represent one of the best prospects for observing or constraining new physics with the LISA gravitational wave observatory. However, the large foreground population of galactic binaries in the same frequency range represents a challenge, and will hinder the recovery of a stochastic background. To test the recoverability of a stochastic gravitational wave background, we use the LISA Simulation Suite to generate data incorporating both a stochastic background and an annually modulated foreground modelling the galactic binary population, and the Bayesian analysis code Cobaya to attempt to recover the model parameters. By applying the Deviance Information Criterion to compare models with and without a stochastic background we place bounds on the detectability of gravitational waves from first-order phase transitions. By further comparing models with and without the annual modulation, we show that exploiting the modulation improves the goodness-of-fit and gives a modest improvement to the bounds on detectable models.</description>

      <title>Measuring the circular polarization of gravitational waves with pulsar timing arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The circular polarization of the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) is a key observable for characterising the origin of the signal detected by Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) collaborations. Both the astrophysical and the cosmological SGWB can have a sizeable amount of circular polarization, due to Poisson fluctuations in the source properties for the former, and to parity violating processes in the early universe for the latter. Its measurement is challenging since PTA are blind to the circular polarization monopole, forcing us to turn to anisotropies for detection. We study the sensitivity of current and future PTA datasets to circular polarization anisotropies, focusing on realistic modelling of intrinsic and kinematic anisotropies for astrophysical and cosmological scenarios respectively. Our results indicate that the expected level of circular polarization for the astrophysical SGWB should be within the reach of near future datasets, while for cosmological SGWB circular polarization is a viable target for more advanced SKA-type experiments.</description>

Abstract: First-order primordial curvature perturbations are known to induce gravitational waves at the second-order, which can in turn probe the small-scale curvature perturbations near the end of the inflation. In this work, we extend the previous analysis in the Gaussian case into the non-Gaussian case, with particular efforts to obtain some thumb rules of sandwiching the associated peaks in gravitational waves induced from multiple peaks of non-Gaussian curvature perturbations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar Timing Array projects have found evidence of a stochastic background of gravitational waves (GWB) using data from an ensemble of pulsars. In the literature, minimal assumptions are made about the signal and noise processes that affect data from these pulsars, such as pulsar spin noise. These assumptions are encoded as uninformative priors in Bayesian searches, though Frequentist approaches make similar assumptions. Uninformative priors are not suitable for (noise) properties of pulsars in an ensemble, and they bias estimates of model parameters such as gravitational-wave signal parameters. Both Frequentist and Bayesian searches are affected. In this letter, more appropriate priors are proposed in the language of Hierarchical Bayesian Modeling, where the properties of the ensemble of pulsars are jointly described with the properties of the individual components of the ensemble. Results by Pulsar Timing Array projects should be re-evaluated using Hierarchical Models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00703v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the derivation of a well-defined $D\rightarrow 4$ limit for 4D Einstein Gauss-Bonnet (4DEGB) gravity coupled to a scalar field, there has been interest in testing it as an alternative to Einstein's general theory of relativity. Using the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations modified for 4DEGB gravity, we model the stellar structure of quark stars using a novel interacting quark matter equation of state. We find that increasing the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant $\alpha$ or the interaction parameter $\lambda$ both tend to increase the mass-radius profiles of quark stars described by this theory, allowing a given central pressure to support larger quark stars in general. These results logically extend to cases where $\lambda &lt; 0$, in which increasing the magnitude of the interaction effects instead diminishes masses and radii. We also analytically identify a critical central pressure in both regimes, below which no quark star solutions exist due to the pressure function having no roots. Most interestingly, we find that quark stars can exist below the general relativistic Buchdahl bound and Schwarzschild radius $R=2M$, due to the lack of a mass gap between black holes and compact stars in 4DEGB. Even for small $\alpha$ well within current observational constraints, we find that quark star solutions in this theory can describe Extreme Compact Objects (ECOs), objects whose radii are smaller than what is allowed by general relativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05332v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new lapse function that simplifies the Hamiltonian constraint, describing the interior of the black hole in terms of the Ashtekar-Barbero variables, into a more straightforward form. The new Hamiltonian leads to different equations of motion than those found in the literature, but through a suitable transformation between temporal parameters, it is found that such a choice leads us to the classical solutions of the Schwarzschild metric, still preserving the physical singularity. In order to resolve this singularity, and inspired by the minimal uncertainty approach, we modify the classical algebra between the dynamic variables of the model, imposing an effective dynamics within the black hole. As a consequence, one of the dynamic variables, denoted by $p_b$, acquires a minimum value at the singularity $t=0$, and on the other hand, the variable related to the radius of the 2-sphere, $p_c$, leads to the resolution of the classical singularity of the black hole by replacing it with a bounce that connects the interior of the black hole with the interior of the white hole. This bounce occurs in the Planck-scale region, where a new event horizon manifests. Upon crossing this horizon, the nature of the interval changes from spatial to temporal outside the white hole.</description>

Abstract: We systematically study a family of loop quantizations for the classical Kruskal spacetimes using the effective description motivated from loop quantum gravity for four generic parameters, $c_o, m, \delta_b$, and $\delta_c$, where the latter two denote the polymerization parameters that capture the underlying quantum geometry. We focus on the family where polymerization parameters are constant on dynamical trajectories and of which the Ashtekar-Olmedo-Singh (AOS) and Corichi-Singh (CS) models appear as special cases. We study general features of singularity resolution in all these models due to quantum gravity effects and analytically extend the solutions across the white hole (WH) and black hole (BH) horizons to the exterior. We find that the leading term in the asymptotic expansion of the Kretschmann scalar is $r^{-4}$. However, for AOS and CS models, black holes with masses greater than solar mass, the dominant term behaves as $r^{-6}$ for the size of the observable Universe and our analysis can be used to phenomenologically constrain the choice of parameters for other models. In addition, one can uniquely fix the parameter $c_o$ by requiring that the Hawking temperature at the BH horizon to the leading order be consistent with its classical value for a macroscopic BH. Assuming that the BH and WH masses are of the same order, we are able to identify a family of choices of $\delta_b$ and $\delta_c$ which share all the desired properties of the AOS model.</description>

Abstract: In this analysis, we study the dynamics of quantum oscillator fields within the context of a position-dependent mass (PDM) system situated in an Einstein-Maxwell space-time, incorporating a non-zero cosmological constant. The magnetic field is aligned along the symmetry axis direction. To analyze PDM quantum oscillator fields, we introduce a modification to the Klein-Gordon equation by substituting the four-momentum vector $p_{\mu} \to \Big(p_{\mu}+i\,\eta\,X_{\mu}+i\,\mathcal{F}_{\mu}\Big)$ into the Klein-Gordon equation, where the four-vector is defibed by $X_{\mu}=(0, r, 0, 0)$, $\mathcal{F}_{\mu}=(0, \mathcal{F}_r, 0, 0)$ with $\mathcal{F}_r=\frac{f'(r)}{4\,f(r)}$, and $\eta$ is the mass oscillator frequency. The radial wave equation for the relativistic modified Klein-Gordon equation is derived and subsequently solved for two distinct cases: (i) $f(r)=e^{\frac{1}{2}\,\alpha\,r^2}$, and (ii) $f(r)=r^{\beta}$, where $\alpha \geq 0, \beta \geq 0$. The resultant energy levels and wave functions for quantum oscillator fields are demonstrated to be influenced by both the cosmological constant and the geometrical topology parameter which breaks the degeneracy of the energy spectrum. Furthermore, we observed noteworthy modifications in the energy levels and wave functions when compared to the results derived in the flat space background.</description>

Abstract: Recent Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) collaborations show strong evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) with the characteristic Hellings-Downs inter-pulsar correlations. The signal may stem from supermassive black hole binary mergers, or early universe phenomena. The former is expected to be strongly anisotropic while primordial backgrounds are likely to be predominantly isotropic with small fluctuations. In case the observed SGWB is of cosmological origin, our relative motion with respect to the SGWB rest frame is a guaranteed source of anisotropy, leading to $\textit{O}(10^{-3})$ energy density fluctuations of the SGWB. For such cosmological SGWB, kinematic anisotropies are likely to be larger than the intrinsic anisotropies, akin to the cosmic microwave background (CMB) dipole anisotropy. We assess the sensitivity of current PTA data to the kinematic dipole anisotropy, and we also forecast at what extent the magnitude and direction of the kinematic dipole can be measured in the future with an SKA-like experiment. We also discuss how the spectral shape of the SGWB and the location of the pulsars to monitor affect the prospects of detecting the kinematic dipole with PTA. In the future, a detection of this anisotropy may even help resolve the discrepancy in the magnitude of the kinematic dipole as measured by CMB and large-scale structure observations.</description>

Abstract: In astronomy, we frequently face the decision problem: does this data contain a signal? Typically, a statistical approach is used, which requires a threshold. The choice of threshold presents a common challenge in settings where signals and noise must be delineated, but their distributions overlap. Gravitational-wave astronomy, which has gone from the first discovery to catalogues of hundreds of events in less than a decade, presents a fascinating case study. For signals from colliding compact objects, the field has evolved from a frequentist to a Bayesian methodology. However, the issue of choosing a threshold and validating noise contamination in a catalogue persists. Confusion and debate often arise due to the misapplication of statistical concepts, the complicated nature of the detection statistics, and the inclusion of astrophysical background models. We introduce Conformal Prediction (CP), a framework developed in Machine Learning to provide distribution-free uncertainty quantification to point predictors. We show that CP can be viewed as an extension of the traditional statistical frameworks whereby thresholds are calibrated such that the uncertainty intervals are statistically rigorous and the error rate can be validated. Moreover, we discuss how CP offers a framework to optimally build a meta-pipeline combining the outputs from multiple independent searches. We introduce CP with a toy cosmic-ray detector, which captures the salient features of most astrophysical search problems and allows us to demonstrate the features of CP in a simple context. We then apply the approach to a recent gravitational-wave Mock Data Challenge using multiple search algorithms for compact binary coalescence signals in interferometric gravitational-wave data. Finally, we conclude with a discussion on the future potential of the method for gravitational-wave astronomy.</description>

      <title>A misleading naming convention: de Sitter `tachyonic' scalar fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the concept of `tachyonic' scalar fields, characterized by a real negative squared `mass', in de Sitter (dS) spacetime. Through a rigorous group-theoretical analysis, we argue that labeling these fields as `tachyonic' lacks physical relevance, often leading to misinterpretations in scholarly discourse, as their `mass' parameter holds no genuine physical significance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate black holes and gravitational perturbations when both the scalar Gauss-Bonnet and dynamical Chern-Simons gravity sectors coexist in addition to the Einstein-Hilbert term, and both sectors are coupled to a single canonically normalized scalar field. The presence of the scalar Gauss-Bonnet gravity sector allows the scalar field to possess a non-vanishing background solution, resulting in additional couplings between odd and even-type gravitational perturbations arising from the dynamical Chern-Simons gravity sector. We illustrate the impact of these even-odd gravitational couplings in gravitational perturbations around a static spherically symmetric black hole. Although the couplings between the odd and even-type gravitational perturbations are known to appear in purely tensorial gravity theories with higher curvature corrections, we demonstrate it in scalar-tensor theories.</description>

      <title>Stability Analysis of the Cosmological Dynamics of $O(D,D)$-complete Stringy Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07825v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The massless fields in the universal NS-NS sector of string theory form $O(D, D)$ multiplets of Double Field Theory, which is a theory that provides a T-duality covariant formulation of supergravity, leading to a stringy modification of General Relativity. In this framework, it is possible to write down the extensions of the Einstein field equations and the Friedmann equations in such a way that the coupling of gravitational and matter sectors is dictated by the $O(D, D)$ symmetry universally. In this paper, we obtain the autonomous form of the $O(D, D)$-complete Friedmann equations, find the critical points and perform their stability analysis. We also include the phase portraits of the system. Cosmologically interesting cases of scalar field, radiation, and matter are separately considered and compared with the Chameleon models in a similar setting. Accelerating phases and the conditions for their existence are also given for such cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.01386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Absolute angular rotation rate measurements with sensitivity better than prad/s would be beneficial for fundamental science investigations. On this regard, large frame Earth based ring laser gyroscopes are top instrumentation as far as bandwidth, long--term operation, and sensitivity are concerned. Here, we demonstrate that the GINGERINO active--ring laser upper limiting noise is close to $2 \times 10^{-15}$ rad/s for $\sim 2 \times 10^5$ s of integration time, as estimated by the Allan deviation evaluated in a differential measurement scheme. This is more than a factor 10 better than the theoretical prediction so far accounted for ideal ring lasers shot--noise with the two beams counter--propagating inside the cavity considered as two independent propagating modes. This feature is related to the peculiarity of real ring laser system dynamics that causes phase cross--talking among the two counter--propagating modes. In this context, the independent beam model is, then, not applicable and the measured noise limit falls below the expected one.</description>

      <title>Magnetic flux eruptions at the root of time-lags in low-luminosity AGN</title>

Abstract: Sagittarius A$^\ast$ is a compact radio source at the center of the Milky Way that has not conclusively shown evidence for the presence of a relativistic jet. Nevertheless, indirect methods at radio frequencies do indicate consistent outflow signatures. Temporal shifts between features in frequency bands are known as time lags, associated with flares or outflows of the accretion system. It is possible to gain information on the emission and outflow mechanics by interpreting these time lags. By means of a combined general-relativistic magnetrohydrodynamical and radiative transfer modeling, we study the origin of the time-lags for magnetically arrested disc models at three black hole spins ($a_\ast \in \{ -0.9375, 0, 0.9375 \}$). We exclusively modeled the emission from the source across a frequency range of $\nu$ = 19-47 GHz. Our study also includes a targeted `slow light' study for one of the best-fitting `fast light' windows. We recovered the observational time-lag relations in various windows of our simulated light curves. The theoretical interpretation of these most promising time-lag windows is threefold; i) a magnetic flux eruption perturbs the jet-disc boundary and creates a flux tube, ii) the flux tube orbits and creates a clear emission feature, and iii) the flux tube interacts with the jet-disc boundary. The best-fitting windows have an intermediate (i=30$^\circ$/50$^\circ$) inclination and zero-BH-spin. The targeted `slow light' study did not yield better-fitting time-lag results, which indicates that the fast vs. slow light paradigm is often not intuitively understood and is likely influential in timing-sensitive studies. Sophisticated general-relativistic magnetrohydrodynamical models consistently capture the observational time-lag behavior, which is rooted in the complex dynamic interplay between the flux tube and coupled disk-jet system.</description>

      <title>Faster Bayesian inference with neural network bundles and new results for $f(R)$ models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the last few years, there has been significant progress in the development of machine learning methods tailored to astrophysics and cosmology. We have recently applied one of these, namely, the neural network bundle method, to the cosmological scenario. Moreover, we showed that in some cases the computational times of the Bayesian inference process can be reduced. In this paper, we present an improvement to the neural network bundle method that results in a significant reduction of the computational times of the statistical analysis. The novel aspect consists of the use of the neural network bundle method to calculate the luminosity distance of type Ia supernovae, which is usually computed through an integral with numerical methods. In this work, we have applied this improvement to the Hu-Sawicki and Starobinsky $f(R)$ models. We also performed a statistical analysis with data from type Ia supernovae of the Pantheon+ compilation and cosmic chronometers. Another original aspect of this work is the different treatment we provide for the absolute magnitude of type Ia supernovae during the inference process, which results in different estimates of the distortion parameter than the ones obtained in the literature. We show that the statistical analyses carried out with our new method require lower computational times than the ones performed with both the numerical and the neural network method from our previous work. This reduction in time is more significant in the case of a difficult computational problem such as the ones addressed in this work.</description>

Abstract: Till today, the nature of Dark Matter (DM) remains elusive despite all our efforts. This missing matter of the universe has not been observed by the already operating DM direct-detection experiments, but we can infer its gravitational effects. Galaxies and clusters of galaxies are most likely to contain DM trapped to their gravitational field. This leads us to the natural assumption that compact objects might contain DM too. Among the compact objects exist in galaxies, neutron stars are considered as natural laboratories, where theories can be tested, and observational data can be received. Thus, many models of DM have proposed it's presence in those stars. In particular, in the present study we focus on two types of dark matter particles, namely fermions and bosons with a mass range of [0.01-1.5] GeV and self-interaction strength in the range [10$^{-4}$-10$^{-1}$] MeV$^{-1}$. By employing the two-fluid model, we discovered a stable area in the M-R diagram of a celestial formation consisting of neutron star matter and DM that is substantial in size. This formation spans hundreds of kilometers in diameter and possesses a mass equivalent to 100 or more times the Solar mass. To elucidate, this entity resembles an enormous celestial body of DM, with a neutron star at its core. This implies that a supramassive stellar compact entity can exist without encountering any issues of stability and without undergoing a collapse into a black hole. In any case, the present theoretical prediction can, if combined with corresponding observations, shed light on the existence of DM and even more on its basic properties.</description>

      <title>Extreme resonant eccentricity excitation of stars around merging black-hole binary</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a star orbiting a merging black-hole binary (BHB) in a coplanar triple configuration. During the BHB's orbital decay, the system can be driven across the apsidal precession resonance, where the apsidal precession rate of the stellar orbit matches that of the inner BHB. As a result, the system gets captured into a state of resonance advection until the merger of the BHB, leading to an extreme eccentricity growth of the stellar orbit. This resonance advection occurs when the inner binary has a non-zero eccentricity and unequal masses. The resonant driving of the stellar eccentricity can significantly alter the hardening rate of the inner BHB, and produce observational signatures to uncover the presence of nearby merging or merged BHBs.</description>

      <title>$floZ$: Improved Bayesian evidence estimation from posterior samples with normalizing flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce $floZ$, an improved method based on normalizing flows, for estimating the Bayesian evidence (and its numerical uncertainty) from a set of samples drawn from the unnormalized posterior distribution. We validate it on distributions whose evidence is known analytically, up to 15 parameter space dimensions, and compare with two state-of-the-art techniques for estimating the evidence: nested sampling (which computes the evidence as its main target) and a $k$-nearest-neighbors technique that produces evidence estimates from posterior samples. Provided representative samples from the target posterior are available, our method is more robust to posterior distributions with sharp features, especially in higher dimensions. For a simple multivariate Gaussian, we demonstrate its accuracy for up to 200 dimensions with $10^5$ posterior samples. $floZ$ has wide applicability, e.g., to estimate the evidence from variational inference, Markov Chain Monte Carlo samples, or any other method that delivers samples from the unnormalized posterior density, such as simulation-based inference. We apply $floZ$ to compute the Bayes factor for the presence of the first overtone in the ringdown signal of the gravitational wave data of GW150914, finding good agreement with nested sampling.</description>

      <title>Cosmological constraints on mass-varying dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Light mass warm dark matter is an interesting and viable alternative to the cold dark matter paradigm. An intriguing variation of this scenario is the mass-varying dark matter model where the dark matter mass varies with time during its cosmic history. This is realized in multiple particle physics models. In this work, we study the cosmological constraints on such a model where the dark matter mass transitions from zero to a finite value in the early Universe. In this model, the matter power spectrum exhibits power suppression below a scale that depends on the epoch of transition, and the angular power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background show a distinctive phase shift. We use the latest cosmic microwave background and the weak lensing data to place lower limit on the transition redshift and ease the $S_8$ tension, unlike the warm dark matter model. This analysis also facilitates a marginal detection of the dark matter (DM) mass. Our findings reveal that while Planck data alone reduces the $S_8$ tension to approximately $2\sigma$, it does not sufficiently constrain the DM mass. However, when combined with the $S_8$ measurement from KIDS1000+BOSS+2dfLenS, the tension significantly decreases to roughly $1.3\sigma$, and we observe the detection of a DM mass at $41.7^{+7.81}_{-27.5}\,\mathrm{eV}$. Further analysis incorporating a combined data set from ACT and weak lensing results in an even more pronounced reduction in the tension to approximately $0.4\sigma$, alongside a higher detected mass of $51.2^{+16}_{-33.5}\,\mathrm{eV}$. We also find a better fit to the combined data compared to the $\Lambda$CDM model.</description>

      <title>Low angular momentum general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic accretion flow around rotating black holes with shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16326v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the global structure of general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic (GRMHD) accretion flows around Kerr black holes containing shock waves, where the disk is threaded by radial and toroidal magnetic fields. We self-consistently solve the GRMHD equations that govern the flow motion inside the disk and for the first time to our knowledge, we obtain the shock-induced global GRMHD accretion solutions around weakly as well as rapidly rotating black holes for a set of fundamental flow parameters, such as energy ($E$), angular momentum ($L$), radial magnetic flux ($\Phi$), and iso-rotation parameter ($F$). We show that shock properties, namely shock radius ($r_{\rm sh}$), compression ratio ($R$) and shock strength ($\Psi$) strongly depends on $E$, $L$, $\Phi$, and $F$. We observe that shock in GRMHD flow continues to exist for wide range of the flow parameters, which allows us to identify the effective domain of parameter space in $L-E$ plane where shock solutions are feasible. Moreover, we examine the modification of the shock parameter space and find that it shifts towards the lower angular momentum values with increasing $\Phi$ and black hole spin ($a_{\rm k}$). Finally, we compute the critical radial magnetic flux ($\Phi^{\rm cri}$) that admits shocks in GRMHD flow and ascertain that $\Phi^{\rm cri}$ is higher (lower) for black hole of spin $a_{\rm k} = 0.99$ ($0.0$) and vice versa.</description>
