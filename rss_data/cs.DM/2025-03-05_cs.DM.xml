      <title>Hierarchy of Hub Covering Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hub Covering Problems arise in various practical domains, such as urban planning, cargo delivery systems, airline networks, telecommunication network design, and e-mobility. The task is to select a set of hubs that enable tours between designated origin-destination pairs while ensuring that any tour includes no more than two hubs and that either the overall tour length or the longest individual edge is kept within prescribed limits. In literature, three primary variants of this problem are distinguished by their specific constraints. Each version exists in a single and multi allocation version, resulting in multiple distinct problem statements. Furthermore, the capacitated versions of these problems introduce additional restrictions on the maximum number of hubs that can be opened. It is currently unclear whether some variants are more complex than others, and no approximation bound is known. In this paper, we establish a hierarchy among these problems, demonstrating that certain variants are indeed special cases of others. For each problem, we either determine the absence of any approximation bound or provide both upper and lower bounds on the approximation guarantee.</description>

      <title>On graphs coverable by chubby shortest paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dumas, Foucaud, Perez, and Todinca [SIAM J. Disc. Math., 2024] proved that if the vertex set of a graph $G$ can be covered by $k$ shortest paths, then the pathwidth of $G$ is bounded by $\mathcal{O}(k \cdot 3^k)$.
  We prove a coarse variant of this theorem: if in a graph $G$ one can find~$k$ shortest paths such that every vertex is at distance at most $\rho$ from one of them, then $G$ is $(3,12\rho)$-quasi-isometric to a graph of pathwidth $k^{\mathcal{O}(k)}$ and maximum degree $\mathcal{O}(k)$, and $G$ admits a path-partition-decomposition whose bags are coverable by $k^{\mathcal{O}(k)}$ balls of radius at most $2\rho$ and vertices from non-adjacent bags are at distance larger than $2\rho$.
  We also discuss applications of such decompositions in the context of algorithms for finding maximum distance independent sets and minimum distance dominating sets in graphs.</description>

      <title>Boosting Rectilinear Steiner Minimum Tree Algorithms with Augmented Bounding Volume Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rectilinear Steiner minimum tree (RSMT) problem computes the shortest network connecting a given set of points using only horizontal and vertical lines, possibly adding extra points (Steiner points) to minimize the total length. RSMT solvers seek to balance speed and accuracy. In this work, we design a framework to boost existing RSMT solvers, extending the Pareto front. Combined with GeoSteiner, our algorithm reaches 5.16\% length error on nets with 1000 pins. The average time needed is 0.46 seconds. This provides an effective way to solve large-scale RSMT problems with small-scale solvers.</description>

      <title>3-Majority and 2-Choices with Many Opinions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first nearly-optimal bounds on the consensus time for the well-known synchronous consensus dynamics, specifically 3-Majority and 2-Choices, for an arbitrary number of opinions. In synchronous consensus dynamics, we consider an $n$-vertex complete graph with self-loops, where each vertex holds an opinion from $\{1,\dots,k\}$. At each discrete-time round, all vertices update their opinions simultaneously according to a given protocol. The goal is to reach a consensus, where all vertices support the same opinion. In 3-Majority, each vertex chooses three random neighbors with replacement and updates its opinion to match the majority, with ties broken randomly. In 2-Choices, each vertex chooses two random neighbors with replacement. If the selected vertices hold the same opinion, the vertex adopts that opinion. Otherwise, it retains its current opinion for that round. Improving upon a line of work [Becchetti et al., SPAA'14], [Becchetti et al., SODA'16], [Berenbrink et al., PODC'17], [Ghaffari and Lengler, PODC'18], we prove that, for every $2\le k \le n$, 3-Majority (resp.\ 2-Choices) reaches consensus within $\widetilde{\Theta}(\min\{k,\sqrt{n}\})$ (resp.\ $\widetilde{\Theta}(k)$) rounds with high probability. Prior to this work, the best known upper bound on the consensus time of 3-Majority was $\widetilde{O}(k)$ if $k \ll n^{1/3}$ and $\widetilde{O}(n^{2/3})$ otherwise, and for 2-Choices, the consensus time was known to be $\widetilde{O}(k)$ for $k\ll \sqrt{n}$.</description>

      <title>Flipping Matchings is Hard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a point set $\mathcal{P}$ and a plane perfect matching $\mathcal{M}$ on $\mathcal{P}$, a flip is an operation that replaces two edges of $\mathcal{M}$ such that another plane perfect matching on $\mathcal{P}$ is obtained. Given two plane perfect matchings on $\mathcal{P}$, we show that it is NP-hard to minimize the number of flips that are needed to transform one matching into the other.</description>

      <title>The EnvDesign Model: A Method to Solve the Environment Design Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Today, several people and organizations rely on cloud platforms. The reliability of cloud platforms depends heavily on the performance of their internal programs (agents). To better prevent regressions in cloud platforms, the design of pre-production testing environments (that test new agents, new hardwares, and other changes) must take into account the diversity of server/node properties (hardware model, virtual machine type, etc.) across the fleet and dynamically emphasize or de-emphasize the prevalence of certain node properties based on current testing priorities. This paper formulates this task as the "environment design" problem and presents the EnvDesign model, a method that uses graph theory and optimization algorithms to solve the environment design problem. The EnvDesign model was built on context and techniques that apply to combinatorial testing in general, so it can support combinatorial testing in other domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2106.03587v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A $2$-distance $k$-coloring of a graph is a proper vertex $k$-coloring where vertices at distance at most 2 cannot share the same color. We prove the existence of a $2$-distance $4$-coloring for planar subcubic graphs with girth at least 21. We also show a construction of a planar subcubic graph of girth 11 that is not $2$-distance $4$-colorable.</description>

      <title>Thick Forests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01482v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider classes of graphs, which we call thick graphs, that have the vertices of a corresponding thin graph replaced by cliques and the edges replaced by cobipartite graphs In particular, we consider the case of thick forests, which we show to be the largest class of perfect thick graphs.
  Recognising membership of a class of thick graphs is NP-complete unless the class of thin graphs is triangle-free, so we focus on this case. Even then membership can be NP-complete. However, we show that the class of thick forests can be recognised in polynomial time. We consider two well-studied combinatorial problems on thick graphs, independent sets and proper colourings. Since determining the independence or chromatic number of a perfect graph is known to be tractable, we examine the complexity of counting all independent sets and colourings in thick forests.
  Finally, we consider two parametric extensions to larger classes of thick graphs: where the parameter is the size of the thin graph, and where the parameter is its treewidth.</description>

      <title>Output-sensitive Complexity of Multi-Objective Integer Network Flow Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01786v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the output-sensitive complexity for linear multi-objective integer minimum cost flow (MOIMCF) problems and provides insights about the time complexity for enumerating all supported nondominated vectors. The paper shows that there can not exist an output-polynomial time algorithm for the enumeration of all supported nondominated vectors that determine the vectors in an ordered way in the outcome space unless NP = P. Moreover, novel methods for identifying supported nondominated vectors in bi-objective minimum cost flow (BOIMCF) problems are proposed, accompanied by a numerical comparison between decision- and objective-space methods. A novel, equivalent and more compact formulation of the minimum cost flow ILP formulation used in the e-constrained-scalarization approach is introduced, demonstrating enhanced efficiency in the numerical tests</description>

      <title>Subgraph Counting in Subquadratic Time for Bounded Degeneracy Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the classic problem of subgraph counting, where we wish to determine the number of occurrences of a fixed pattern graph $H$ in an input graph $G$ of $n$ vertices. Our focus is on bounded degeneracy inputs, a rich family of graph classes that also characterizes real-world massive networks. Building on the seminal techniques introduced by Chiba-Nishizeki (SICOMP 1985), a recent line of work has built subgraph counting algorithms for bounded degeneracy graphs. Assuming fine-grained complexity conjectures, there is a complete characterization of patterns $H$ for which linear time subgraph counting is possible. For every $r \geq 6$, there exists an $H$ with $r$ vertices that cannot be counted in linear time.
  In this paper, we initiate a study of subquadratic algorithms for subgraph counting on bounded degeneracy graphs. We prove that when $H$ has at most $9$ vertices, subgraph counting can be done in $\tilde{O}(n^{5/3})$ time. As a secondary result, we give improved algorithms for counting cycles of length at most $10$. Previously, no subquadratic algorithms were known for the above problems on bounded degeneracy graphs.
  Our main conceptual contribution is a framework that reduces subgraph counting in bounded degeneracy graphs to counting smaller hypergraphs in arbitrary graphs. We believe that our results will help build a general theory of subgraph counting for bounded degeneracy graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04970v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that given a graph G we can CMSO-transduce its modular decomposition, its split decomposition and its bi-join decomposition. This improves results by Courcelle [Logical Methods in Computer Science, 2006] who gave such transductions using order-invariant MSO, a strictly more expressive logic than CMSO. Our methods more generally yield CMSO[2]-transductions of the canonical decomposition of weakly-partitive set systems and weakly-bipartitive systems of bipartitions.</description>
