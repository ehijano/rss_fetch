      <description>arXiv:2602.11309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determinantal methods for bounding the rank and border rank of tensors or polynomials are subject to a major barrier. For instance, it is known that using determinantal methods one cannot prove a lower bound for the border rank of a 3-way tensor of size m in each direction that exceeds 6m-4. We explain the precise geometric reason for this number (and analogous bounds in more general tensor spaces) using cactus varieties and, more generally, scheme theoretic methods in algebraic geometry.</description>

      <title>On the excursion algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The excursion algebra associated to a scheme X over a finite field and a reductive group G is the algebra of global functions on the stack of arithmetic G-local systems on X. When X is a curve, this algebra acts on the space of automorphic functions. In this paper we establish some basic properties of this algebra.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian Intersections, Symplectic Reduction and Kirwan Surjectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a smooth holomorphic symplectic variety $X$ with a Hamiltonian $G$-action, $G$-invariant Lagrangians $C's$ induce Lagrangians in the symplectic quotient $X// G$. Given clean intersections $B=C_1\cap C_2$ whose conormal sequence splits, we show that $$C_1/G\times_{X// G} C_2/G\cong T^{\vee}[-1](B/G).$$ When $det(N_{B/C_2})$ is torsion, we have $Ext^{\bullet}_{X// G}(\mathcal{O}_{C_1/G}, \mathcal{O}_{C_2/G})\cong H^{\bullet}_G(B, det(N_{B/C_2})_{\delta})$ provided that the Hodge-to-de Rham degeneracy holds. Furthermore, we have a generalized version of Kirwan surjectivity $Ext^{\bullet}_{X// G}(\mathcal{O}_{C_1/G}, \mathcal{O}_{C_2/G})\twoheadrightarrow Ext^{\bullet}_{X^{ss}// G}(\mathcal{O}_{C_1^{ss}/G}, \mathcal{O}_{C_2^{ss}/G})$ if $B$ is proper. When $C_1=C_2$, this is the Kirwan surjectivity, which is now interpreted as the symmetry commutes with reduction problem in 3d B-model. We also obtain similar results for $K_{C_1/G}^{1/2}$ and $K_{C_2/G}^{1/2}$.</description>

      <title>Rational elliptic surfaces with six singular double fibres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A rational elliptic surface with section is a smooth, rational, complex, projective surface $\mathcal{X}$ that admits a relatively minimal fibration $f: \mathcal{X}\longrightarrow \bbP^1$ such that its general fibre is a smooth irreducible curve of genus one and $f$ has a section. In this paper, we classify rational elliptic surfaces with section that have exactly six singular fibres, each counted with multiplicity two. The fibres that appear with multiplicity exactly two are either of type $II$ or of type $I_2$ of the Kodaira classification. We interpret our classification from various viewpoints: a pencil of plane cubic curves, the Weierstrass equation, a double cover of $\bbF_2$ branched over an appropriate trisection of the ruling of $\bbF_2$ plus the negative section, a double cover of the plane branched along a quartic curve, plus the datum of a point on the plane. Moreover, either we give explicit normal forms for the plane quartic curve, or we indicate how to find it.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.11742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By a lattice theoretic approach, Brandhorst--Hashimoto has made the list of K3 surfaces with finite groups of automorphisms which properly contain a maximal symplectic automorphism group. We give $3$ different explicit descriptions to the $K3$ surface with an action of $\mathfrak{S}_4\times \mathfrak{S}_4$, with various characterizations, and construct an explicit isomorphism to the Schur's quartic. We also calculate the intersection of the two polarization-preserving finite automorphism groups.</description>

      <title>The Infinite Sphere and Galois Belyi maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the space of Belyi maps admits a natural parametrization by an infinite-dimensional sphere arising from Voiculescu's theory of noncommutative probability spaces. We show that this sphere decomposes into sectors, each of which corresponds to a class of Belyi maps distinguished up to isomorphism by their monodromy, encoded by a finite-index subgroup of F2. For Galois Belyi maps, our correspondence between spectral sectors of the infinite sphere and algebraic quotients of F2 yields a genuine bijection. Within this framework, distinct sectors of the sphere capture the algebraic constraints imposed on the monodromy, thereby providing a geometric organization of Belyi maps according to their associated group-theoretic data.</description>

      <title>Regularity and Automorphism Groups of Dessins d'Enfants with Uniform Passports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a smooth algebraic curve defined over a number field, one can associate a bipartite graph known as a dessin d'enfant. In this paper, we investigate the regularity and automorphism groups of dessins d'enfants with uniform passports, that is, those for which the valencies of black vertices, white vertices, and faces are constant, and study how these properties depend on the genus. Although uniformity imposes a high degree of symmetry, such dessins are not necessarily regular. Our main results are as follows: (1) A passport of the form $[a^{p}, b^{q}, n]$ (the tree case) admits a regular dessin if and only if $\gcd(p,q)=1$. (2) Every passport of the form $[n, b^{q}, n]$ of genus at least 2 admits a dessin with a trivial automorphism group. In addition, we obtain several results on uniform passports of genus 0 and 1. We also establish two theorems on the enumeration of elements in symmetric groups, which are useful for the study of automorphism groups of dessins.</description>

      <title>Weak stability conditions on coherent systems of genus four curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The derived category of coherent systems is an interesting triangulated category associated with a smooth, projective curve $C$. These categories admit Bridgeland stability conditions, as recently shown by Feyzbakhsh and Novik. Their construction depends explicitly on the higher rank Brill-Noether theory of $C$.
  In this short note, we study the Feyzbakhsh--Novik stability conditions for a general curve of genus four. We show that these stability conditions degenerate to a stability condition on the Kuznetsov component of the corresponding nodal cubic threefold, using a result of Alexeev-Kuznetsov.</description>

      <title>On real algebraic realization of round fold maps of codimension $-1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The canonical projections of the unit spheres are generalized to special generic maps and round fold maps, for example. They are generalizations from the viewpoint of singularity theory of differentiable maps and these maps restrict the topologies and the differentiable structures of the manifolds.
  We are concerned with round fold maps, defined as smooth maps locally represented as the product map of a Morse function and the identity map on a smooth manifold, and maps with singular value sets being concentric spheres. A bit different from differential topology, we are concerned with real algebraic geometric aspects of these maps. We discuss real algebraic realization of round fold maps of codimension $-1$ as our new work. Real algebraic realization of these maps is of fundamental and important studies in real algebraic geometry and a new study recently developing mainly due to the author.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.11519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present an analogue of the Milnor number for one dimensional local ring, and we show that it satisfies analogous properties to those of the Milnor number of plane curves over a field. In addition, we present two analogues of the semi-group of values for a one dimensional ring and show how they relate to our Milnor number. Finally, we use these tools and techniques to show we can relate these semigroups of one dimensional rings of finite Cohen-Macaulay type to those of the classical ADE singularities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.11559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a simple, simply-connected, simply-laced algebraic group $G$, we construct a monoidal categorification of the coordinate ring of twisted products of flag varieties. This class of varieties includes, in particular, braid varieties and restricted double Bruhat cells. In addition, we define a natural subalgebra of the bosonic extension algebra $\widehat{\mathcal{A}}$ and show that this subalgebra provides a quantization of the coordinate ring of twisted products of flag varieties.</description>

      <title>The relative minimal model program for excellent algebraic spaces and analytic spaces in equal characteristic zero</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.08732v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the relative minimal model program with scaling for locally projective morphisms of quasi-excellent algebraic spaces admitting dualizing complexes, quasi-excellent formal schemes admitting dualizing complexes, semianalytic germs of complex analytic spaces, rigid analytic spaces, Berkovich spaces, and adic spaces locally of weakly finite type over a field, all in equal characteristic zero. To do so, we prove finite generation of relative adjoint rings associated to projective morphisms of such spaces using the strategy of Cascini and Lazi\'c and the generalization of the Kawamata-Viehweg vanishing theorem to the scheme setting recently established by the second author. To prove these results uniformly, we prove GAGA theorems for Grothendieck duality and dualizing complexes to reduce to the algebraic case. In addition, we apply our methods to establish the relative minimal model program with scaling for spaces of the form above in dimensions $\le 3$ in positive and mixed characteristic, and to show that one can run the relative minimal model program with scaling for complex analytic spaces without shrinking the base at each step.</description>

Abstract: Let $k$ be an uncountable algebraically closed field of positive characteristic and let $S$ be a smooth projective connected surface over $k$. We extend the theorem on the Gysin kernel from [20, Theorem 5.1] to also be true over $k$, where it was proved over $\mathbb{C}$. This is done by showing that almost all results still hold true over $k$ via the same argument or by using \'{e}tale base arguments and then using a lift with the Comparison theorems [16, Theorems 21.1 &amp; 20.5] and Tate's Conjecture for finitely generated fields [27] and [31] as needed.</description>

      <title>On the numerically and cohomologically trivial automorphisms of elliptic surfaces II: $\chi(S)&gt;0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17033v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this second part we study first the group $Aut_{\mathbb Q}(S)$ of numerically trivial automorphisms of an algebraic properly elliptic surface $S$, that is, of a minimal algebraic surface with Kodaira dimension $\kappa(S)=1$, in the case $\chi(S) \geq 1$. Our first surprising result is that, against what has been believed for over 40 years, there exist nontrivial such groups for $p_g(S) &gt;0$. Indeed, we show even that $Aut_{\mathbb Q}(S)$ is always a 2-generated finite abelian group, but there is no absolute upper bound for its cardinality. At any rate, we give explicit and essentially optimal upper bounds for $|Aut_{\mathbb Q}(S)|$ in terms of the numerical invariants of $S$, as $\chi(S)$, or the irregularity $q(S)$, or the bigenus $P_2(S)$. Moreover, we reach an almost complete description of the possible groups $Aut_{\mathbb Q}(S)$ and we give effective criteria for such surfaces to have trivial $Aut_{\mathbb Q}(S)$. Our second surprising results concern the quite elusive group $Aut_{\mathbb Z}(S)$ of cohomologically trivial automorphisms; we are able to give the explicit upper bounds for $|Aut_{\mathbb Z}(S)|$ in special cases: 9 when $p_g(S) =0$, and we achieve the sharp upper bound 3 when $S$ (i.e., the pluricanonical elliptic fibration) is isotrivial. Also in the non isotrivial case we produce subtle examples where $Aut_{\mathbb Z}(S)$ is a group of order 2 or 3.</description>

      <title>On strong Euler-homogeneity and Saito-holonomicity for complex hypersurfaces. Applications to a conjecture on free divisors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21829v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We first develop some criteria for a general divisor to be strongly Euler-homogeneous in terms of the Fitting ideals of certain modules. We also study new variants of Saito-holonomicity, generalizing Koszul-free type properties and characterizing them in terms of the same Fitting ideals.
  Thanks to these advances, we are able to make progress in the understanding of a conjecture from 2002: a free divisor satisfying the Logarithmic Comparison Theorem (LCT) must be strongly Euler-homogeneous. Previously, it was known to be true only for ambient dimension $n \leq 3$ or assuming Koszul-freeness. We prove it in the following new cases: assuming strong Euler-homogeneity outside a discrete set of points; assuming the divisor is weakly Koszul-free; for $n=4$; for linear free divisors in $n=5$.
  Finally, we refute a conjecture stating that all linear free divisors satisfy LCT, are strongly Euler-homogeneous and have $b$-functions with symmetric roots about $-1$.</description>

Abstract: Let K be a CM-field, i.e., a totally complex quadratic extension of a totally real field F. Let X be a g-dimensional abelian variety admitting an algebra embedding of F into the rational endomorphisms of X. Let A be the product of X and Pic^0(X). We construct an embedding e of K into the rational endomorphism algebra of A associated to a choice of an F-blilinear polarization on X and a totally imaginary element q in K. We get the [K:Q]-dimensional subspace HW(A,e) of Hodge Weil classes in the d-th cohomology of A, where d:=4g/[K:Q]. We detail a strategy for proving the algebraicity of the Weil classes on all deformation of (A,e,h) as a polarized abelian variety of split Weil type, where h is an e(K) compatible polarization. We then specialize to the case F=Q, so that K is an imaginary quadratic number field. We survey how the above strategy was used to prove the algebraicity of the Weil classes on polarized abelian sixfolds of split Weil type. The algebraicity of the Weil classes on all abelian fourfold of Weil type follows. The Hodge conjecture for abelian varieties of dimension at most 5 is known to follow from the latter result.</description>

      <title>Border Bases in the Rational Weyl Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Border bases are a generalization of Gr\"obner bases for zero-dimensional ideals in polynomial rings. In this article, we introduce border bases for a non-commutative ring of linear differential operators, namely the rational Weyl algebra. We elaborate on their properties and present algorithms to compute with them. We apply this theory to represent integrable connections as cyclic $D$-modules explicitly. As an application, we visit differential equations behind a string, a Feynman as well as a cosmological integral. We also address the classification of particular $D$-ideals of a fixed holonomic rank, namely the case of linear PDEs with constant coefficients as well as Frobenius ideals. Our approach rests on the theory of Hilbert schemes of points in affine space.</description>

      <title>Torsor and Quotient Presentations for $D$-homogeneous Spectra</title>

Abstract: The $D$-graded Proj construction provides a general framework for constructing schemes from rings graded by finitely generated abelian groups $D$, yet its properties and applications remain underdeveloped compared to the classical $\mathbb{N}$-graded case. This paper establishes the essential characteristics of $D$-graded rings $S$, like the distinction between $D$-homogeneous prime ideals and $D$-prime ideals if $D$ has torsion. We particularly focus on describing the quotient by the associated group scheme, generalizing the construction of a toric variety from its Cox ring. As in the $\mathbb{N}$-graded construction, the basic affine opens of the Proj construction are given in terms of degree-zero localizations $S_{(f)}$, where $f$ in $S$ homogeneous is \emph{relevant}. We prove that $\pi_f: {\rm Spec}(S_f) \to {\rm Spec}(S_{(f)})$ is a geometric quotient under mild finiteness assumptions if $f$ is relevant, and give necessary and sufficient conditions for this map to be a pseudo ${\rm Spec}(S_0[D])$-torsor.</description>

      <title>L-equivalence and Fourier--Mukai partners of cubic fourfolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08651v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study L-equivalence in the Grothendieck ring of varieties and its interaction with categorical invariants of cubic fourfolds. Assuming a Derived Torelli-type criterion for Kuznetsov components and a mild condition on the discriminant of the transcendental lattice, we prove a counting formula for Fourier--Mukai partners of such cubic fourfolds. As an application, we exhibit cubic fourfolds with a fixed algebraic lattice admitting a unique non-trivial Fourier--Mukai partner, which is trivially L-equivalent to the original. Finally, we show that L-equivalence classes of cubic fourfolds are finite.</description>

      <title>Hermitian Distance Degree of Unitary-Invariant Matrix Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Hermitian distance degree, a real enumerative invariant counting critical points of the squared Hermitian distance function, for matrix varieties invariant under left and right unitary actions. For such a variety \(M \subset \mathbb{C}^{n\times t}\), we prove that its Hermitian distance degree equals the real Euclidean distance degree of the associated absolutely symmetric variety of singular values. Equivalently, for a generic data matrix, Hermitian distance critical points on \(M\) are obtained by lifting Euclidean distance critical points from the singular-value slice. We also establish a Hermitian slicing theorem, paralleling the Bik--Draisma principle, which reduces the critical point count to a diagonal slice. As a motivating example, we recover a geometric Hermitian analogue of the Eckart-Young theorem.</description>

      <title>A decomposition of graph a-numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the $a$-sequence $(a_0(G), a_1(G), \cdots)$ of a finite simple graph $G$, defined recursively through a combinatorial rule and known to coincide with the sequence of rational Betti numbers of the real toric variety associated with $G$.
  In this paper, we establish a combinatorial and topological decomposition formula for the $a$-sequence. As an application, we show that the $a$-sequence is monotone under graph inclusion; that is, $a_i(G) \geq a_i(H)$ for all $i \geq 0$ whenever $H$ is a subgraph of $G$, and obtain the lower and upper bounds of $a_i$-numbers. We also prove that the $a$-sequence is unimodal in $i$ for a broad class of graphs $G$, including those with a Hamiltonian circuit or a universal vertex. These results provide a new class of topological spaces whose Betti number sequences are unimodal but not necessarily log concave, contributing to the study of real loci in algebraic geometry.</description>

      <title>Reconstrucion of oriented matroids from Varchenko-Gelfand algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19905v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The algebra of $R$-valued functions on the set of chambers of a real hyperplane arrangement is called the Varchenko-Gelfand (VG) algebra. This algebra carries a natural filtration by the degree with respect to Heaviside functions, giving rise to the associated graded VG algebra. When the coefficient ring $R$ is an integral domain of characteristic $2$, the graded VG algebra is known to be isomorphic to the Orlik-Solomon algebra. In this paper, we study VG algebras over coefficient rings of characteristic different from $2$, and investigate to what extent VG algebras determine the underlying oriented matroid structures.
  Our main results concern hyperplane arrangements that are generic in codimension $2$. For such arrangements, if $R$ is an integral domain of characteristic not equal to $2$, then the oriented matroid can be recovered from both the filtered and the graded VG algebras. As a byproduct, we prove that, unlike the complexification, the cohomology ring of the complement of a $3$-plexification of a real arrangement is not determined by the intersection lattice.
  We also formulate an algorithm that is expected to reconstruct oriented matroids from VG algebras in the case of general arrangements.</description>

      <title>Ekedahl-Oort types of $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$-covers in characteristic $2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02733v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we study the Ekedahl-Oort types of $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$-Galois covers $\pi:Y \to X$ in characteristic two. When the base curve $X$ is ordinary, we show that the Ekedahl-Oort type of $Y$ is completely determined by the genus of $X$ and the ramification of $\pi$. For a general base curve $X$, we prove bounds on the Ekedahl-Oort depending on the Ekedahl-Oort type of $X$ and the ramification of $\pi$. Along the way, we develop a theory of \emph{enhanced differentials of the second kind}. This theory allows us to study algebraic de Rham cohomology in any characteristic by working directly with differentials, in contrast to the standard \v{C}ech resolution.</description>
