      <title>Topological Phase Transition under Infinite Randomness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In clean and weakly disordered systems, topological and trivial phases having a finite bulk energy gap can transit to each other via a quantum critical point. In presence of strong disorder, both the nature of the phases and the associated criticality can fundamentally change. Here we investigate topological properties of a strongly disordered fermionic chain where the bond couplings are drawn from normal probability distributions which are defined by characteristic standard deviations. Using numerical strong disorder renormalization group methods along with analytical techniques, we show that the competition between fluctuation scales renders both the trivial and topological phases gapless with Griffiths like rare regions. Moreover, the transition between these phases is solely governed by the fluctuation scales, rather than the means, rendering the critical behavior to be determined by an infinite randomness fixed point with an irrational central charge. Our work points to a host of novel topological phases and atypical topological phase transitions which can be realized in systems under strong disorder.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium Propagation for Periodic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Equilibrium propagation provides an exact method to compute the gradient of a cost function from the response to external forcing. These algorithms, in conjunction with local updates to the system parameters, may enable mechanical and electronic systems to autonomously acquire complex functionality. We extend these methods to damped dynamical systems operating in the linear regime by introducing an effective action, whose extremum corresponds to the periodic steady state. The condition of applicability is that the response function is symmetric, which is fulfilled by damped Newtonian dynamics and RLC networks. We demonstrate the viability of our method in those systems and explore novel functionality such as classifying temporal sound signals. Our work opens the door to intelligent materials that process dynamical signals, enabling temporal computations, passive and active sensors, and materials that act as frequency-dependent filters.</description>

      <title>Error-resilient Reversal of Quantum Chaotic Dynamics Enabled by Scramblons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of the arrow of time in quantum many-body systems stems from the inherent tendency of Hamiltonian evolution to scramble quantum information and increase entanglement. While, in principle, one might counteract this temporal directionality by engineering a perfectly inverted Hamiltonian to reverse entanglement growth, such a scenario is fundamentally unstable because even minor imperfections in the backward evolution can be exponentially amplified, a hallmark of quantum many-body chaos. Therefore, successfully reversing quantum many-body dynamics demands a deep understanding of the underlying structure of quantum information scrambling and chaotic dynamics. Here, by using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance on a macroscopic ensemble of randomly interacting spins, we measure the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) and validate key predictions of scramblon theory, a universal theoretical framework for information scrambling. Crucially, this theory enables us to isolate and mitigate errors in the OTOC caused by imperfections in the backward evolution. As a result, this protocol uncovers the anticipated exponential behavior of quantum many-body chaos and extracts the quantum Lyapunov exponent in a many-body experimental system for the first time. Our results push the fundamental limits of dynamical reversibility of complex quantum systems, with implications for quantum simulation and metrology.</description>

      <title>Ensemble nonlinear optical learner by electrically tunable linear scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in effective nonlinearity, achieved by exploiting multiple scatterings within the linear optical regime, has been demonstrated to be a promising approach to enable nonlinear optical processing without relying on actual material nonlinearity. Here we introduce an ensemble nonlinear optical learner, via electrically tunable linear scattering in a liquid-crystal-polymer composite film under low optical power and low applied electrical voltages. We demonstrate, through several image classification tasks, that by combining inference results from an ensemble of nonlinear optical learners realized at different applied voltages, the ensemble optical learning significantly outperforms the classification performance of individual processors. With very low-level optical power and electrical voltage requirements, and ease in reconfiguration simply by varying applied voltages, the ensemble nonlinear optical learning offers a cost-effective and flexible way to improve computing performance and enhance inference accuracy.</description>

      <title>Lost in Retraining: Roaming the Parameter Space of Exponential Families Under Closed-Loop Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Closed-loop learning is the process of repeatedly estimating a model from data generated from the model itself. It is receiving great attention due to the possibility that large neural network models may, in the future, be primarily trained with data generated by artificial neural networks themselves. We study this process for models that belong to exponential families, deriving equations of motions that govern the dynamics of the parameters. We show that maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters endows sufficient statistics with the martingale property and that as a result the process converges to absorbing states that amplify initial biases present in the data. However, we show that this outcome may be prevented by polluting the data with an infinitesimal fraction of data points generated from a fixed model, by relying on maximum a posteriori estimation or by introducing regularisation. Furthermore, we show that the asymptotic behavior of the dynamics is not reparametrisation invariant.</description>

      <title>Elastic properties of fluid mercury across the metal-nonmetal transition: Ab initio simulation study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report an ab initio molecular dynamics study of fluid mercury at temperature 1750 K in the range of densities 7-13.5 g/cm$^3$. Along this isothermal line we performed an analysis of total charge fluctuations, which make evidence of neutral atom-like screening in fluid Hg for densities less than 9.25 g/cm$^3$, which practically coincides with the emergence of the gap in electronic density of states. High-frequency shear modulus, high-frequency and adiabatic speeds of sound, shear viscosity, Maxwell relaxation time and dispersion of collective excitations are analyzed as a function of density along the isothermal line.</description>

      <title>Duality between controllability and observability for target control and estimation in networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Output controllability and functional observability are properties that enable, respectively, the control and estimation of part of the state vector. These notions are of utmost importance in applications to high-dimensional systems, such as large-scale networks, in which only a target subset of variables (nodes) is sought to be controlled or estimated. Although the duality between full-state controllability and observability is well established, the characterization of the duality between their generalized counterparts remains an outstanding problem. Here, we establish both the weak and the strong duality between output controllability and functional observability. Specifically, we show that functional observability of a system implies output controllability of a dual system (weak duality), and that under a certain geometric condition the converse holds (strong duality). As an application of the strong duality, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition for target control via static feedback. This allow us to establish a separation principle between the design of target controllers and the design of functional observers in closed-loop systems. These results generalize the classical duality and separation principles in modern control theory.</description>

      <title>On the Popov-Belevitch-Hautus tests for functional observability and output controllability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Functional observability and output controllability are properties that establish the conditions for the partial estimation and partial control of the system state, respectively. In the special case of full-state observability and controllability, the Popov-Belevitch-Hautus (PBH) tests provide conditions for the properties to hold based on the system eigenspace. Generalizations of the PBH test have been recently proposed for functional observability and output controllability, but thus far have only been proven valid for diagonalizable systems. Here, we rigorously establish the generalized PBH test for functional observability, extending its validity to a broader class of systems using Jordan decomposition. Likewise, we determine the class of systems under which the generalized PBH test is sufficient and necessary for output controllability. These results have immediate implications for observer and controller design, pole assignment, and optimal placement of sensors and drivers.</description>

      <title>Simulating Heterogeneity within Elastic and Inelastic Discrete Mechanical Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20861v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two approaches to incorporate heterogeneity in discrete models are compared. In the first, standard approach, the heterogeneity is dictated by geometrical structure of the discrete system. In the second approach, the heterogeneity is imposed by randomizing material parameters of the contacts between the rigid bodies. A similar randomization strategy is often adopted in continuous homogeneous models. The study investigates both the elastic and fracture behaviors of these model types, and compares their local and macroscale responses. It is found that the stress oscillations present in the standard discrete models built on heterogeneous geometric structures cannot be replicated by randomization of the elastically homogeneous discrete system. The marginal distributions and dependencies between the stress tensor components cannot be adequately matched. Therefore, there is a fundamental difference between these two views on discrete models. The numerical experiments performed in the paper showed that an identical response can be achieved at the macroscale by tuning the material parameters. However, the local behavior, fracturing, and internal dependencies are quite different. These findings provide insight into the potential for controlled random assignment of heterogeneity in homogeneous models. They also demonstrate the need for experimental data capable of verifying the correctness of such an approach.</description>

      <title>Probing Quantum Spin Systems with Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural Network Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01891v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural Quantum States (NQS) are a class of variational wave functions parametrized by neural networks (NNs) to study quantum many-body systems. In this work, we propose \texttt{SineKAN}, a NQS \textit{ansatz} based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), to represent quantum mechanical wave functions as nested univariate functions. We show that \texttt{SineKAN} wavefunction with learnable sinusoidal activation functions can capture the ground state energies, fidelities and various correlation functions of the one dimensional Transverse-Field Ising model, Anisotropic Heisenberg model, and Antiferromagnetic $J_{1}-J_{2}$ model with different chain lengths. In our study of the $J_1-J_2$ model with $L=100$ sites, we find that the \texttt{SineKAN} model outperforms several previously explored neural quantum state \textit{ans\"atze}, including Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), Long Short-Term Memory models (LSTMs), and Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLP) \textit{a.k.a.} Feed Forward Neural Networks, when compared to the results obtained from the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm. We find that \texttt{SineKAN} models can be trained to high precisions and accuracies with minimal computational costs.</description>

      <title>Microcanonical simulated annealing: Massively parallel Monte Carlo simulations with sporadic random-number generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of models and theories that describe complex experimental systems $\unicode{x2014}$in fields like high-energy and condensed-matter physics$\unicode{x2014}$ are becoming increasingly important. Examples include lattice gauge theories, which can describe, among others, quantum chromodynamics (the Standard Model description of strong interactions between elementary particles), and spin-glass systems. Beyond fundamental research, these computational methods also find practical applications, among many others, in optimization, finance, and complex biological problems. However, Monte Carlo simulations, an important subcategory of these methods, are plagued by a major drawback: they are extremely greedy for (pseudo) random numbers. The total fraction of computer time dedicated to random-number generation increases as the hardware grows more sophisticated, and can get prohibitive for special-purpose computing platforms. We propose here a general-purpose microcanonical simulated annealing (MicSA) formalism that dramatically reduces such a burden. The algorithm is fully adapted to a massively parallel computation, as we show in the particularly demanding benchmark of the three-dimensional Ising spin glass. We carry out very stringent numerical tests of the new algorithm by comparing our results, obtained on GPUs, with high-precision standard (i.e., random-number-greedy) simulations performed on the Janus II custom-built supercomputer. In those cases where thermal equilibrium is reachable (i.e., in the paramagnetic phase), both simulations reach compatible values. More significantly, barring short-time corrections, a simple time rescaling suffices to map the MicSA off-equilibrium dynamics onto the results obtained with standard simulations.</description>
