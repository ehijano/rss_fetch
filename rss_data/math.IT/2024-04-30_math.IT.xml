      <title>A Novel Scheme for Coded Caching with Coded Placement in Small Memory Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel achievable scheme for coded caching systems with $N$ files and $K$ users, specifically when $N \leq K$. This new scheme employs linear coding both during the placement phase - where cache contents are linear combinations of files from the library - and the delivery phase. The multi-step delivery phase enables users to decode the cached coded content and eliminate interference effectively. In the small memory regime, the proposed scheme outperforms existing methods, particularly when $K$ and $N$ values are similar, it maintains manageable sub-packetization levels, and operates over a finite field of size $3$ regardless of the system parameters.</description>

      <title>Geometric Characteristic in Phaseless Operator and Structured Matrix Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we first propose a simple and unified approach to stability of phaseless operator to both amplitude and intensity measurement, both complex and real cases on arbitrary geometric set, thus characterizing the robust performance of phase retrieval via empirical minimization method. The unified analysis involves the random embedding of concave lifting operator on tangent space. Similarly, we investigate structured matrix recovery problem through the robust injectivity of linear rank one measurement operator on arbitrary matrix set. The core of our analysis lies in bounding the empirical chaos process. We introduce Talagrand's $\gamma_{\alpha}$ functionals to characterize the relationship between the required number of measurements and the geometric constraints. Additionally, adversarial noise is generated to illustrate the recovery bounds are sharp in the above situations.</description>

      <title>Over-the-Air Fusion of Sparse Spatial Features for Integrated Sensing and Edge AI over Broadband Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 6G mobile networks are differentiated from 5G by two new usage scenarios - distributed sensing and edge AI. Their natural integration, termed integrated sensing and edge AI (ISEA), promised to create a platform for enabling environment perception to make intelligent decisions and take real-time actions. A basic operation in ISEA is for a fusion center to acquire and fuse features of spatial sensing data distributed at many agents. To overcome its communication bottleneck due to multiple access by numerous agents over hostile wireless channels, we propose a novel framework, called Spatial Over-the-Air Fusion (Spatial AirFusion), which exploits radio waveform superposition to aggregate spatially sparse features over the air. The technology is more sophisticated than conventional Over-the-Air Computing (AirComp) as it supports simultaneous aggregation over multiple voxels, which partition the 3D sensing region, and across multiple subcarriers. Its efficiency and robustness are derived from exploitation of both spatial feature sparsity and multiuser channel diversity to intelligently pair voxel-level aggregation tasks and subcarriers to maximize the minimum receive SNR among voxels under instantaneous power constraints. To optimally solve the mixed-integer Voxel-Carrier Pairing and Power Allocation (VoCa-PPA) problem, the proposed approach hinges on two useful results: (1) deriving the optimal power allocation as a closed-form function of voxel-carrier pairing and (2) discovering a useful property of VoCa-PPA that dramatically reduces the solution-space dimensionality. Both a low-complexity greedy algorithm and an optimal tree-search based approach are designed for VoCa-PPA. Extensive simulations using real datasets show that Spatial AirFusion achieves significant error reduction and accuracy improvement compared with conventional AirComp without awareness of spatial sparsity.</description>

      <title>Study of Clustering Techniques and Scheduling Algorithms with Fairness for Cell-Free MIMO Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a clustering technique based on information rates for cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks. Unlike existing clustering approaches that rely on the large scale fading coefficients of the channels and user-centric techniques, we develop an approach that is based on the information rates of cell-free massive MIMO networks. We also devise a resource allocation technique to incorporate the proposed clustering and schedule users with fairness. An analysis of the proposed clustering approach based on information rates is carried out along with an assessment of its benefits for scheduling. Numerical results show that the proposed techniques outperform existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Pose-aware 3D Beamwidth Adaptation for Mobile Extended Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a sensor-aided pose-aware beamwidth adaptation design for a conceptual extended reality (XR) Head-Mounted Display (HMD) equipped with a 2D planar array. The beam is tracked and adapted on the user side by leveraging HMD orientation estimates. The beamwidth adaptation scheme is effected by selective deactivation of elements in the 2D antenna array, employing the angular estimation covariance matrix to overlap the beam with the estimation confidence interval. The proposed method utilizes the estimation correlations to adapt the beamwidth along the confidence interval of these estimates. Compared to a beamwidth adaptation without leveraging estimation correlations, the proposed method demonstrates the gain of leveraging estimation correlations by improving the coverage area for a given outage probability threshold by approximately 16%, or equivalently increasing the power efficiency up to 18%.</description>

      <title>Binary duadic codes and their related codes with a square-root-like lower bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary cyclic codes have been a hot topic for many years, and significant progress has been made in the study of this types of codes. As is well known, it is hard to construct infinite families of binary cyclic codes [n, n+1/2] with good minimum distance. In this paper, by using the BCH bound on cyclic codes, one of the open problems proposed by Liu et al. about binary cyclic codes (Finite Field Appl 91:102270, 2023) is settled. Specially, we present several families of binary duadic codes with length 2^m-1 and dimension 2^(m-1), and the minimum distances have a square-root-like lower bound. As a by-product, the parameters of their dual codes and extended codes are provided, where the latter are self-dual and doubly-even.</description>

      <title>Joint Spectrum Partitioning and Power Allocation for Energy Efficient Semi-Integrated Sensing and Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With spectrum resources becoming congested and the emergence of sensing-enabled wireless applications, conventional resource allocation methods need a revamp to support communications-only, sensing-only, and integrated sensing and communication (ISaC) services together. In this letter, we propose two joint spectrum partitioning (SP) and power allocation (PA) schemes to maximize the aggregate sensing and communication performance as well as corresponding energy efficiency (EE) of a semi-ISaC system that supports all three services in a unified manner. The proposed framework captures the priority of the distinct services, impact of target clutters, power budget and bandwidth constraints, and sensing and communication quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. We reveal that the former problem is jointly convex and the latter is a non-convex problem that can be solved optimally by exploiting fractional and parametric programming techniques. Numerical results verify the effectiveness of proposed schemes and extract novel insights related to the impact of the priority and QoS requirements of distinct services on the performance of semi-ISaC networks.</description>

      <title>Multiport Network Modeling for Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces: Numerical Validation with a Full-Wave PEEC Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) modeling and optimization are a crucial steps in developing the next generation of wireless communications. To this aim, the availability of accurate electromagnetic (EM) models is of paramount important for the design of RIS-assisted communication links. In this work, we validate a widely-used analytical multiport network for RISs by means of a well-established full-wave numerical method based on the Partial Elements Equivalent Circuit (PEEC) approach. Numerical results show good agreement between the two methods, thus demonstrating i) the considered multiport network model being effective and ii) the PEEC method being appropriate for EM modeling of RIS-assisted wireless links.</description>

      <title>Design and Optimization of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces Using the PEEC Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design and optimization of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) are key challenges for future wireless communication systems. RISs are devices that can manipulate electromagnetic (EM) waves in a programmable way, thus enhancing the performance and efficiency of wireless links. To achieve this goal, it is essential to have reliable EM models that can capture the behavior of RISs in different scenarios. This work demonstrates that the Partial Elements Equivalent Circuit (PEEC) method is a powerful tool for EM analysis of RIS-aided wireless links. It might also be integrated with optimization algorithms in order to optimize wireless communication networks.</description>

      <title>Movable Antenna-Enhanced Wireless Powered Mobile Edge Computing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a movable antenna (MA) enhanced scheme for wireless powered mobile edge computing (WP-MEC) system, where the hybrid access point (HAP) equipped with multiple MAs first emits wireless energy to charge wireless devices (WDs), and then receives the offloaded tasks from the WDs for edge computing. The MAs deployed at the HAP enhance the spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs) by flexibly adjusting the positions of MAs within an available region, thereby improving the efficiency of both downlink wireless energy transfer (WPT) and uplink task offloading. To balance the performance enhancement against the implementation intricacy, we further propose three types of MA positioning configurations, i.e., dynamic MA positioning, semi-dynamic MA positioning, and static MA positioning. In addition, the non-linear power conversion of energy harvesting (EH) circuits at the WDs and the finite computing capability at the edge server are taken into account. Our objective is to maximize the sum computational rate (SCR) by jointly optimizing the time allocation, positions of MAs, energy beamforming matrix, receive combing vectors, and offloading strategies of WDs. To solve the non-convex problems, efficient alternating optimization (AO) frameworks are proposed. Moreover, we propose a hybrid algorithm of particle swarm optimization with variable local search (PSO-VLS) to solve the sub-problem of MA positioning. Numerical results validate the superiority of exploiting MAs over the fixed-position antennas (FPAs) for enhancing the SCR performance of WP-MEC systems.</description>

      <title>The augmented codes of a family of linear codes with locality 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we first generalize the class of linear codes by Ding and Ding (IEEE TIT, 61(11), pp. 5835-5842, 2015). Then we mainly study the augmented codes of this generalized class of linear codes. For one thing, we use Gaussian sums to determine the parameters and weight distributions of the augmented codes in some cases. It is shown that the augmented codes are self-orthogonal and have only a few nonzero weights. For another thing, the locality of the augmented codes is proved to be 2, which indicates the augmented codes are useful in distributed storage. Besides, the augmented codes are projective as the minimum distance of their duals is proved to be 3. In particular, we obtain several (almost) optimal linear codes and locally recoverable codes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear codes are widely studied due to their applications in communication, cryptography, quantum codes, distributed storage and many other fields. In this paper, we use the trace and norm functions over finite fields to construct a family of linear codes. The weight distributions of the codes are determined in three cases via Gaussian sums. The codes are shown to be self-orthogonal divisible codes with only three, four or five nonzero weights in these cases. In particular, we prove that this family of linear codes has locality 2. Several optimal or almost optimal linear codes and locally recoverable codes are derived. In particular, an infinite family of distance-optimal binary linear codes with respect to the sphere-packing bound is obtained. The self-orthogonal codes derived in this paper can be used to construct lattices and have nice application in distributed storage.</description>

Abstract: Constacyclic codes over finite fields are an important class of linear codes as they contain distance-optimal codes and linear codes with best known parameters. They are interesting in theory and practice, as they have the constacyclic structure. In this paper, an infinite class of $q$-ary negacyclic codes of length $(q^m-1)/2$ and an infinite class of $q$-ary constacyclic codes of length $(q^m-1)/(q-1)$ are constructed and analyzed. As a by-product, two infinite classes of ternary negacyclic self-dual codes with a square-root-like lower bound on their minimum distances are presented.</description>

      <title>The PRODSAT phase of random quantum satisfiability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $k$-QSAT problem is a quantum analog of the famous $k$-SAT constraint satisfaction problem. We must determine the zero energy ground states of a Hamiltonian of $N$ qubits consisting of a sum of $M$ random $k$-local rank-one projectors. It is known that product states of zero energy exist with high probability if and only if the underlying factor graph has a clause-covering dimer configuration. This means that the threshold of the PRODSAT phase is a purely geometric quantity equal to the dimer covering threshold. We revisit and fully prove this result through a combination of complex analysis and algebraic methods based on Buchberger's algorithm for complex polynomial equations with random coefficients. We also discuss numerical experiments investigating the presence of entanglement in the PRODSAT phase in the sense that product states do not span the whole zero energy ground state space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A weakly constrained code is a collection of finite-length strings over a finite alphabet in which certain substrings or patterns occur according to some prescribed frequencies. Buzaglo and Siegel (ITW 2017) gave a construction of weakly constrained codes based on row-by-row coding, that achieved the capacity of the weak constraint. In this paper, we propose a method to make this row-by-row coding scheme resilient to errors.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Potentials of Near-Field Propagation: ELAA-Empowered Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exploration of extremely large antenna arrays (ELAAs) using high-frequency spectrum has led to a paradigm shift in electromagnetic radiation field, transitioning from the common use case of far-field propagation to near-field propagation. This shift necessitates the modification of the conventional planar-wavefront approximation to more accurate spherical waves, exerting a profound impact on wireless transmission technologies encompassing communication and sensing. Concurrently, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has gained prominence in the context of the sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks owing to its ability to cater to the ever-increasing demands of future networks. In line with this evolving trend, this article presents a systematical investigation on ELAA-empowered near-field ISAC. We begin by introducing the fundamentals of near-field propagation with an emphasis on its double-edged effects to near-field communications. Then, we turn to near-field sensing and expound upon various typical applications. Following the separate elaborations on communications and sensing, we articulate in-depth advantages of ELAA-empowered ISAC in near field, particularly including featured opportunities arising from the dual-functional integrations, potential ISAC applications benefiting from the additional degrees-of-freedom in near field, and enablements of other complementary technologies. Finally, we outline key technical challenges that merit further exploration in the realm of ELAA-empowered near-field ISAC.</description>

      <title>Distributed Source Coding for Parametric and Non-Parametric Regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of communication systems dedicated to machine learning tasks is one key aspect of goal-oriented communications. In this framework, this article investigates the interplay between data reconstruction and learning from the same compressed observations, particularly focusing on the regression problem. We establish achievable rate-generalization error regions for both parametric and non-parametric regression, where the generalization error measures the regression performance on previously unseen data. The analysis covers both asymptotic and finite block-length regimes, providing fundamental results and practical insights for the design of coding schemes dedicated to regression. The asymptotic analysis relies on conventional Wyner-Ziv coding schemes which we extend to study the convergence of the generalization error. The finite-length analysis uses the notions of information density and dispersion with additional term for the generalization error. We further investigate the trade-off between reconstruction and regression in both asymptotic and non-asymptotic regimes. Contrary to the existing literature which focused on other learning tasks, our results state that in the case of regression, there is no trade-off between data reconstruction and regression in the asymptotic regime. We also observe the same absence of trade-off for the considered achievable scheme in the finite-length regime, by analyzing correlation between distortion and generalization error.</description>

      <title>Wireless Information and Energy Transfer in the Era of 6G Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless information and energy transfer (WIET) represents an emerging paradigm which employs controllable transmission of radio-frequency signals for the dual purpose of data communication and wireless charging. As such, WIET is widely regarded as an enabler of envisioned 6G use cases that rely on energy-sustainable Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks, such as smart cities and smart grids. Meeting the quality-of-service demands of WIET, in terms of both data transfer and power delivery, requires effective co-design of the information and energy signals. In this article, we present the main principles and design aspects of WIET, focusing on its integration in 6G networks. First, we discuss how conventional communication notions such as resource allocation and waveform design need to be revisited in the context of WIET. Next, we consider various candidate 6G technologies that can boost WIET efficiency, namely, holographic multiple-input multiple-output, near-field beamforming, terahertz communication, intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs), and reconfigurable (fluid) antenna arrays. We introduce respective WIET design methods, analyze the promising performance gains of these WIET systems, and discuss challenges, open issues, and future research directions. Finally, a near-field energy beamforming scheme and a power-based IRS beamforming algorithm are experimentally validated using a wireless energy transfer testbed. The vision of WIET in communication systems has been gaining momentum in recent years, with constant progress with respect to theoretical but also practical aspects. The comprehensive overview of the state of the art of WIET presented in this paper highlights the potentials of WIET systems as well as their overall benefits in 6G networks.</description>

      <title>Sparse Sampling in Fractional Fourier Domain: Recovery Guarantees and Cram\'er-Rao Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sampling theory in fractional Fourier Transform (FrFT) domain has been studied extensively in the last decades. This interest stems from the ability of the FrFT to generalize the traditional Fourier Transform, broadening the traditional concept of bandwidth and accommodating a wider range of functions that may not be bandlimited in the Fourier sense. Beyond bandlimited functions, sampling and recovery of sparse signals has also been studied in the FrFT domain. Existing methods for sparse recovery typically operate in the transform domain, capitalizing on the spectral features of spikes in the FrFT domain. Our paper contributes two new theoretical advancements in this area. First, we introduce a novel time-domain sparse recovery method that avoids the typical bottlenecks of transform domain methods, such as spectral leakage. This method is backed by a sparse sampling theorem applicable to arbitrary FrFT-bandlimited kernels and is validated through a hardware experiment. Second, we present Cram\'er-Rao Bounds for the sparse sampling problem, addressing a gap in existing literature.</description>

Abstract: University renovation is a recurring fact generated by permanent technological innovations and new methods of organizing universities and training offers. Technological interoperability standards play a determining role, not only by providing added value in terms of saving space and time, but also by changing educational models and knowledge acquisition processes. The countries of sub-Saharan Africa present an institutional framework and a particular type of university organization which requires an in-depth rereading of their operating methods for a better recovery on the path to renovation through ICT. This document offers avenues for reflection and action frameworks that focus on the achievements of norms and interoperability standards.</description>

      <title>On the Benefits of Coding for Network Slicing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Network slicing has emerged as an integral concept in 5G, aiming to partition the physical network infrastructure into isolated slices, customized for specific applications. We theoretically formulate the key performance metrics of an application, in terms of goodput and delivery delay, at a cost of network resources in terms of bandwidth. We explore an un-coded communication protocol that uses feedback-based repetitions, and a coded protocol, implementing random linear network coding and using coding-aware acknowledgments. We find that coding reduces the resource demands of a slice to meet the requirements for an application, thereby serving more applications efficiently. Coded slices thus free up resources for other slices, be they coded or not. Based on these results, we propose a hybrid approach, wherein coding is introduced selectively in certain network slices. This approach not only facilitates a smoother transition from un-coded systems to coded systems but also reduces costs across all slices. Theoretical findings in this paper are validated and expanded upon through real-time simulations of the network.</description>

      <title>Quantum resistant multi-signature scheme with optimal communication round: A Blockchain-based approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blockchain is a decentralized network to increase trust, integrity, and transparency of transactions. With the exponential growth of transactions in the realm of Blockchain, especially in Bitcoin, Blockchain size increases as all transactions must be stored and verified. In Bitcoin, validating M of N transactions involves the necessity of M authentic signatures out of the total N transactions. This procedure is so time-consuming and needs a significant storage capacity. To address these issues, several multi signature schemes have been proposed, enabling users to interactively generate a common signature on a single message. Recently, some lattice based multi signature schemes have been presented to deal with the threats of quantum computers. However, none of them have met all desirable features of multi signature schemes like aggregate public key, low numbers of communication rounds, or resistant to quantum computers. Within this paper, we present a new multi signature scheme based on lattices, known as Razhims, that has aggregate public key, necessitates solely a single round of communication, and is resistant to quantum computers. In Razhims, the aggregate public key size and the final signature size are equal to the public key size and the final signature size of a standard signature respectively, and are independent of the number of signers.</description>

      <title>Cauchy-Schwarz Divergence Information Bottleneck for Regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The information bottleneck (IB) approach is popular to improve the generalization, robustness and explainability of deep neural networks. Essentially, it aims to find a minimum sufficient representation $\mathbf{t}$ by striking a trade-off between a compression term $I(\mathbf{x};\mathbf{t})$ and a prediction term $I(y;\mathbf{t})$, where $I(\cdot;\cdot)$ refers to the mutual information (MI). MI is for the IB for the most part expressed in terms of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, which in the regression case corresponds to prediction based on mean squared error (MSE) loss with Gaussian assumption and compression approximated by variational inference. In this paper, we study the IB principle for the regression problem and develop a new way to parameterize the IB with deep neural networks by exploiting favorable properties of the Cauchy-Schwarz (CS) divergence. By doing so, we move away from MSE-based regression and ease estimation by avoiding variational approximations or distributional assumptions. We investigate the improved generalization ability of our proposed CS-IB and demonstrate strong adversarial robustness guarantees. We demonstrate its superior performance on six real-world regression tasks over other popular deep IB approaches. We additionally observe that the solutions discovered by CS-IB always achieve the best trade-off between prediction accuracy and compression ratio in the information plane.

      <title>Explaining vague language</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Why is language vague? Vagueness may be explained and rationalized if it can be shown that vague language is more useful to speaker and hearer than precise language. In a well-known paper, Lipman proposes a game-theoretic account of vagueness in terms of mixed strategy that leads to a puzzle: vagueness cannot be strictly better than precision at equilibrium. More recently, \'Egr\'e, Spector, Mortier and Verheyen have put forward a Bayesian account of vagueness establishing that using vague words can be strictly more informative than using precise words. This paper proposes to compare both results and to explain why they are not in contradiction. Lipman's definition of vagueness relies exclusively on a property of signaling strategies, without making any assumptions about the lexicon, whereas \'Egr\'e et al.'s involves a layer of semantic content. We argue that the semantic account of vagueness is needed, and more adequate and explanatory of vagueness.</description>

Abstract: Network coordination is considered in three basic settings, characterizing the generation of separable and classical-quantum correlations among multiple parties. First, we consider the simulation of a classical-quantum state between two nodes with rate-limited common randomness (CR) and communication. Furthermore, we study the preparation of a separable state between multiple nodes with rate-limited CR and no communication. At last, we consider a broadcast setting, where a sender and two receivers simulate a classical-quantum-quantum state using rate-limited CR and communication. We establish the optimal tradeoff between communication and CR rates in each setting.</description>

Abstract: An affine connection is said to be flat if its curvature tensor vanishes identically. Koszul-Vinberg (KV for abbreviation) cohomology has been invoked to study the deformation theory of flat and torsion-free affine connections on tangent bundle. In this Note, we compute explicitly the differentials of various specific KV cochains, and study their relation to classical objects in information geometry, including deformations associated with projective and dual-projective transformations of a flat and torsion-free affine connection. As an application, we also give a simple yet non-trivial example of a KV algebra of which second cohomology group does not vanish.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a cell-free massive MIMO system with multiple antennas on the users and access points. In previous works, the downlink spectral efficiency (SE) has been evaluated using the hardening bound that requires no downlink pilots. This approach works well when having single-antenna users. In this paper, we show that much higher SEs can be achieved if downlink pilots are sent since the effective channel matrix does not harden when having multi-antenna users. We propose a pilot-based downlink estimation scheme and derive a new SE expression that utilizes zero-forcing combining. We show numerically how the number of users and user antennas affects the SE.</description>

      <title>Limiting Moments of Autocorrelation Demerit Factors of Binary Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An aperiodic binary sequence of length $\ell$ is a doubly infinite sequence $f=\ldots,f_{-1},f_0,f_1,\ldots$ with $f_j \in \{-1,1\}$ when $0 \leq j &lt; \ell$ and and $f_j=0$ otherwise. Various problems in engineering and natural science demand binary sequences that do not resemble translates of themselves. The autocorrelation of $f$ at shift $s$ is the dot product of $f$ with the sequence obtained by translating $f$ by $s$ places. The demerit factor of $f$ is the sum of the squares of the autocorrelations at all nonzero shifts for the sequence obtained by normalizing $f$ to unit Euclidean norm. Low demerit factor therefore indicates low self-similarity under translation. We endow the $2^\ell$ binary sequences of length $\ell$ with uniform probability measure and consider the distribution of their demerit factors. Earlier works used combinatorial techniques to find exact formulas for the mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis of the distribution as a function of $\ell$. These revealed that for $\ell \geq 4$, the $p$th central moment of this distribution is strictly positive for every $p \geq 2$. This article shows that every $p$th central moment is a quasi-polynomial function of $\ell$ with rational coefficients divided by $\ell^{2 p}$. It also shows that, in the limit as $\ell$ tends to infinity, the $p$th standardized moment is the same as that of the standard normal distribution.</description>

      <title>Globally Optimal Resource Allocation Design for Discrete Phase Shift IRS-Assisted Multiuser Networks with Perfect and Imperfect CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) are a promising low-cost solution for achieving high spectral and energy efficiency in future communication systems by enabling the customization of wireless propagation environments. Despite the plethora of research on resource allocation design for IRS-assisted multiuser wireless communication systems, the optimal design and the corresponding performance upper bound are still not fully understood. To bridge this gap in knowledge, in this paper, we investigate the optimal resource allocation design for IRS-assisted multiuser multiple-input single-output systems employing practical discrete IRS phase shifters. In particular, we jointly optimize the beamforming vector at the base station and the discrete IRS phase shifts to minimize the total transmit power for the cases of perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI) knowledge. To this end, two novel algorithms based on the generalized Benders decomposition (GBD) method are developed to obtain the globally optimal solution for perfect and imperfect CSI, respectively. Moreover, to facilitate practical implementation, we propose two corresponding low-complexity suboptimal algorithms with guaranteed convergence by capitalizing on successive convex approximation (SCA). In particular, for imperfect CSI, we adopt a bounded error model to characterize the CSI uncertainty and propose a new transformation to convexify the robust quality-of-service constraints. Our numerical results confirm the optimality of the proposed GBD-based algorithms for the considered system for both perfect and imperfect CSI. Furthermore, we unveil that both proposed SCA-based algorithms can attain a locally optimal solution within a few iterations. Moreover, compared with the state-of-the-art solution based on alternating optimization, the proposed low-complexity SCA-based schemes achieve a significant performance gain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The framework of approximate differential privacy is considered, and augmented by leveraging the notion of ``the total variation of a (privacy-preserving) mechanism'' (denoted by $\eta$-TV). With this refinement, an exact composition result is derived, and shown to be significantly tighter than the optimal bounds for differential privacy (which do not consider the total variation). Furthermore, it is shown that $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-DP with $\eta$-TV is closed under subsampling. The induced total variation of commonly used mechanisms are computed. Moreover, the notion of total variation of a mechanism is studied in the local privacy setting and privacy-utility tradeoffs are investigated. In particular, total variation distance and KL divergence are considered as utility functions and studied through the lens of contraction coefficients. Finally, the results are compared and connected to the locally differentially private setting.</description>

      <title>Geometrically-Shaped Constellation for Visible Light Communications at Short Blocklength</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a general framework of designing geometrically shaped constellations for short-packet visible light communications with a peak- and an average-intensity constraints. By leveraging tools from large deviation theory, we first characterize the second-order asymptotics of the optimal constellation shaping region under aforementioned intensity constraints, which serves as a good performance measure for the best geometric shaping in finite blocklength. To further incorporate a sufficiently large coding gain and a nearly-maximum shaping gain, we construct multidimensional constellations by the nested structure of Construction B lattices, where the constellation shaping is implemented by controlling the boundary of the embedded sublattice, i.e., a strategy called coarsely shaping and finely coding. Fast algorithms for constellation mapping and demodulation are presented as well. As an illustrative example, we present an energy-efficient $24$-dimensional constellation design based on the Leech lattice, whose superiority over existing constellation designs is verified by numerical results.</description>

      <title>On the View-and-Channel Aggregation Gain in Integrated Sensing and Edge AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07986v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sensing and edge artificial intelligence (AI) are two key features of the sixth-generation (6G) mobile networks. Their natural integration, termed Integrated sensing and edge AI (ISEA), is envisioned to automate wide-ranging Internet-of-Tings (IoT) applications. To achieve a high sensing accuracy, multi-view features are uploaded to an edge server for aggregation and inference using an AI model. The view aggregation is realized efficiently using over-the-air computing (AirComp), which also aggregates channels to suppress channel noise. At its nascent stage, ISEA still lacks a characterization of the fundamental performance gains from view-and-channel aggregation, which motivates this work. Our framework leverages a well-established distribution model of multi-view sensing data where the classic Gaussian-mixture model is modified by adding sub-spaces matrices to represent individual sensor observation perspectives. Based on the model, we study the End-to-End sensing (inference) uncertainty, a popular measure of inference accuracy, of the said ISEA system by a novel approach involving designing a scaling-tight uncertainty surrogate function, global discriminant gain, distribution of receive Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), and channel induced discriminant loss. We prove that the E2E sensing uncertainty diminishes at an exponential rate as the number of views/sensors grows, where the rate is proportional to global discriminant gain. Given channel distortion, we further show that the exponential scaling remains with a reduced decay rate related to the channel induced discriminant loss. Furthermore, we benchmark AirComp against equally fast, traditional analog orthogonal access, which reveals a sensing-accuracy crossing point between the schemes, leading to the proposal of adaptive access-mode switching. Last, the insights from our framework are validated by experiments using real-world dataset.</description>

      <title>ORBGRAND: Achievable Rate for General Bit Channels and Application in BICM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11901v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Guessing random additive noise decoding (GRAND) has received widespread attention recently, and among its variants, ordered reliability bits GRAND (ORBGRAND) is particularly attractive due to its efficient utilization of soft information and its amenability to hardware implementation. It has been recently shown that ORBGRAND is almost capacity-achieving in additive white Gaussian noise channels under antipodal input. In this work, we first extend the analysis of ORBGRAND achievable rate to memoryless binary-input bit channels with general output conditional probability distributions. The analytical result also sheds insight into understanding the gap between the ORBGRAND achievable rate and the channel mutual information. As an application of the analysis, we study the ORBGRAND achievable rate of bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM). Numerical results indicate that for BICM, the gap between the ORBGRAND achievable rate and the channel mutual information is typically small, and hence suggest the feasibility of ORBGRAND for channels with high-order coded modulation schemes.</description>

      <title>Approaching Maximum Likelihood Decoding Performance via Reshuffling ORBGRAND</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15946v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Guessing random additive noise decoding (GRAND) is a recently proposed decoding paradigm particularly suitable for codes with short length and high rate. Among its variants, ordered reliability bits GRAND (ORBGRAND) exploits soft information in a simple and effective fashion to schedule its queries, thereby allowing efficient hardware implementation. Compared with maximum likelihood (ML) decoding, however, ORBGRAND still exhibits noticeable performance loss in terms of block error rate (BLER). In order to improve the performance of ORBGRAND while still retaining its amenability to hardware implementation, a new variant of ORBGRAND termed RS-ORBGRAND is proposed, whose basic idea is to reshuffle the queries of ORBGRAND so that the expected number of queries is minimized. Numerical simulations show that RS-ORBGRAND leads to noticeable gains compared with ORBGRAND and its existing variants, and is only 0.1dB away from ML decoding, for BLER as low as $10^{-6}$.</description>

      <title>$L_q$ Lower Bounds on Distributed Estimation via Fisher Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Van Trees inequality, also known as the Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao lower bound, is a powerful tool for establishing lower bounds for minimax estimation through Fisher information. It easily adapts to different statistical models and often yields tight bounds. Recently, its application has been extended to distributed estimation with privacy and communication constraints where it yields order-wise optimal minimax lower bounds for various parametric tasks under squared $L_2$ loss.
  However, a widely perceived drawback of the van Trees inequality is that it is limited to squared $L_2$ loss. The goal of this paper is to dispel that perception by introducing a strengthened version of the van Trees inequality that applies to general $L_q$ loss functions by building on the Efroimovich's inequality -- a lesser-known entropic inequality dating back to the 1970s. We then apply the generalized van Trees inequality to lower bound $L_q$ loss in distributed minimax estimation under communication and local differential privacy constraints. This leads to lower bounds for $L_q$ loss that apply to sequentially interactive and blackboard communication protocols. Additionally, we show how the generalized van Trees inequality can be used to obtain \emph{local} and \emph{non-asymptotic} minimax results that capture the hardness of estimating each instance at finite sample sizes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider communication over the Gaussian multiple-access channel in the regime where the number of users grows linearly with the codelength. We investigate coded CDMA schemes where each user's information is encoded via a linear code before being modulated with a signature sequence. We propose an efficient approximate message passing (AMP) decoder that can be tailored to the structure of the linear code, and provide an exact asymptotic characterization of its performance. Based on this result, we consider a decoder that integrates AMP and belief propagation and characterize the tradeoff between spectral efficiency and signal-to-noise ratio, for a given target error rate. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the benefits of the concatenated scheme at finite lengths.</description>

      <title>Semantics-Empowered Space-Air-Ground-Sea Integrated Network: New Paradigm, Frameworks, and Challenges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the coming sixth generation (6G) communication era, to provide seamless and ubiquitous connections, the space-air-ground-sea integrated network (SAGSIN) is envisioned to address the challenges of communication coverage in areas with difficult conditions, such as the forest, desert, and sea. Considering the fundamental limitations of the SAGSIN including large-scale scenarios, highly dynamic channels, and limited device capabilities, traditional communications based on Shannon information theory cannot satisfy the communication demands. Moreover, bit-level reconstruction is usually redundant for many human-to-machine or machine-to-machine applications in the SAGSIN. Therefore, it is imperative to consider high-level communications towards semantics exchange, called semantic communications. In this survey, according to the interpretations of the term "semantics", including "significance", "meaning", and "effectiveness-related information", we review state-of-the-art works on semantic communications from three perspectives, which are 1) significance representation and protection, 2) meaning similarity measurement and meaning enhancement, and 3) ultimate effectiveness and effectiveness yielding. Sequentially, three types of semantic communication systems can be correspondingly introduced, namely the significance-oriented, meaning-oriented, and effectiveness/task-oriented semantic communication systems. Implementation of the above three types of systems in the SAGSIN necessitates a new perception-communication-computing-actuation-integrated paradigm (PCCAIP), where all the available perception, computing, and actuation techniques jointly facilitates significance-oriented sampling &amp; transmission, semantic extraction &amp; reconstruction, and task decision. Finally, we point out some future challenges on semantic communications in the SAGSIN. ...</description>

      <title>Necessary and Sufficient Conditions for Capacity-Achieving Private Information Retrieval with Non-Colluding and Colluding Servers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Private Information Retrieval (PIR) is a mechanism for efficiently downloading messages while keeping the index secret. Here, PIRs in which servers do not communicate with each other are called standard PIRs, and PIRs in which some servers communicate with each other are called colluding PIRs. The information-theoretic upper bound on efficiency has been given in previous studies. However, the conditions for PIRs to keep privacy, to decode the desired message, and to achieve that upper bound have not been clarified in matrix form. In this paper, we prove the necessary and sufficient conditions for the properties of standard PIR and colluding PIR. Further, we represent the properties in matrix form.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we establish the second-order randomized identification capacity (RID capacity) of the Additive White Gaussian Noise Channel (AWGNC). On the one hand, we obtain a refined version of Hayashi's theorem to prove the achievability part. On the other, we investigate the relationship between identification and channel resolvability, then we propose a finer quantization method to prove the converse part. Consequently, the second-order RID capacity of the AWGNC has the same form as the second-order transmission capacity. The only difference is that the maximum number of messages in RID scales double exponentially in the blocklength.</description>

      <title>Sliding window-aided ordered statistics decoding for short LDPC codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative approach to the design of efficient decoders that meet the rigorous requirements of modern communication systems, particularly in terms of ultra-reliability and low-latency. We enhance an established hybrid decoding framework by proposing an ordered statistical decoding scheme augmented with a sliding window technique. This novel component replaces a key element of the current architecture, significantly reducing average complexity. A critical aspect of our scheme is the integration of a pre-trained neural network model that dynamically determines the progression or halt of the sliding window process. Furthermore, we present a user-defined soft margin mechanism that adeptly balances the trade-off between decoding accuracy and complexity. Empirical results, supported by a thorough complexity analysis, demonstrate that the proposed scheme holds a competitive advantage over existing state-of-the-art decoders, notably in addressing the decoding failures prevalent in neural min-sum decoders. Additionally, our research uncovers that short LDPC codes can deliver performance comparable to that of short classical linear codes within the critical waterfall region of the SNR, highlighting their potential for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Towards declarative comparabilities: application to functional dependencies</title>

      <description>arXiv:1909.12656v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In real life, data are often of poor quality as a result, for instance, of uncertainty, mismeasurements, missing values or bad inputs. This issue hampers an implicit yet crucial operation of every database management system: equality testing. Indeed, equality is, in the end, a context-dependent operation with a plethora of interpretations. In practice, the treatment of different types of equality is left to programmers, who have to struggle with those interpretations in their code. We propose a new lattice-based declarative framework to address this problem. It allows specification of numerous semantics for equality at a high level of abstraction. To go beyond tuple equality, we study functional dependencies (FDs) in the light of our framework. First, we define abstract FDs, generalizing classical FDs. These lead to the consideration of particular interpretations of equality: realities. Building upon realities and possible/certain answers, we introduce possible/certain FDs and give some related complexity results.</description>

      <title>Heart Disease Detection using Quantum Computing and Partitioned Random Forest Methods</title>

Abstract: Heart disease morbidity and mortality rates are increasing, which has a negative impact on public health and the global economy. Early detection of heart disease reduces the incidence of heart mortality and morbidity. Recent research has utilized quantum computing methods to predict heart disease with more than 5 qubits and are computationally intensive. Despite the higher number of qubits, earlier work reports a lower accuracy in predicting heart disease, have not considered the outlier effects, and requires more computation time and memory for heart disease prediction. To overcome these limitations, we propose hybrid random forest quantum neural network (HQRF) using a few qubits (two to four) and considered the effects of outlier in the dataset. Two open-source datasets, Cleveland and Statlog, are used in this study to apply quantum networks. The proposed algorithm has been applied on two open-source datasets and utilized two different types of testing strategies such as 10-fold cross validation and 70-30 train/test ratio. We compared the performance of our proposed methodology with our earlier algorithm called hybrid quantum neural network (HQNN) proposed in the literature for heart disease prediction. HQNN and HQRF outperform in 10-fold cross validation and 70/30 train/test split ratio, respectively. The results show that HQNN requires a large training dataset while HQRF is more appropriate for both large and small training dataset. According to the experimental results, the proposed HQRF is not sensitive to the outlier data compared to HQNN. Compared to earlier works, the proposed HQRF achieved a maximum area under the curve (AUC) of 96.43% and 97.78% in predicting heart diseases using Cleveland and Statlog datasets, respectively with HQNN. The proposed HQRF is highly efficient in detecting heart disease at an early stage and will speed up clinical diagnosis.</description>

      <title>On the Convergence of the ELBO to Entropy Sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.03077v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The variational lower bound (a.k.a. ELBO or free energy) is the central objective for many established as well as many novel algorithms for unsupervised learning. During learning such algorithms change model parameters to increase the variational lower bound. Learning usually proceeds until parameters have converged to values close to a stationary point of the learning dynamics. In this purely theoretical contribution, we show that (for a very large class of generative models) the variational lower bound is at all stationary points of learning equal to a sum of entropies. For standard machine learning models with one set of latents and one set of observed variables, the sum consists of three entropies: (A) the (average) entropy of the variational distributions, (B) the negative entropy of the model's prior distribution, and (C) the (expected) negative entropy of the observable distribution. The obtained result applies under realistic conditions including: finite numbers of data points, at any stationary point (including saddle points) and for any family of (well behaved) variational distributions. The class of generative models for which we show the equality to entropy sums contains many well-known generative models. As concrete examples we discuss Sigmoid Belief Networks, probabilistic PCA and (Gaussian and non-Gaussian) mixture models. The result also applies for standard (Gaussian) variational autoencoders, a special case that has been shown previously (Damm et al., 2023). The prerequisites we use to show equality to entropy sums are relatively mild. Concretely, the distributions of a given generative model have to be of the exponential family, and the model has to satisfy a parameterization criterion (which is usually fulfilled). Proving the equality of the ELBO to entropy sums at stationary points (under the stated conditions) is the main contribution of this work.</description>

Abstract: The Cauchy-Schwarz (CS) divergence was developed by Pr\'{i}ncipe et al. in 2000. In this paper, we extend the classic CS divergence to quantify the closeness between two conditional distributions and show that the developed conditional CS divergence can be simply estimated by a kernel density estimator from given samples. We illustrate the advantages (e.g., rigorous faithfulness guarantee, lower computational complexity, higher statistical power, and much more flexibility in a wide range of applications) of our conditional CS divergence over previous proposals, such as the conditional KL divergence and the conditional maximum mean discrepancy. We also demonstrate the compelling performance of conditional CS divergence in two machine learning tasks related to time series data and sequential inference, namely time series clustering and uncertainty-guided exploration for sequential decision making.</description>

Abstract: Quantum hypothesis testing (QHT) has been traditionally studied from the information-theoretic perspective, wherein one is interested in the optimal decay rate of error probabilities as a function of the number of samples of an unknown state. In this paper, we study the sample complexity of QHT, wherein the goal is to determine the minimum number of samples needed to reach a desired error probability. By making use of the wealth of knowledge that already exists in the literature on QHT, we characterize the sample complexity of binary QHT in the symmetric and asymmetric settings, and we provide bounds on the sample complexity of multiple QHT. In more detail, we prove that the sample complexity of symmetric binary QHT depends logarithmically on the inverse error probability and inversely on the negative logarithm of the fidelity. As a counterpart of the quantum Stein's lemma, we also find that the sample complexity of asymmetric binary QHT depends logarithmically on the inverse type II error probability and inversely on the quantum relative entropy. We then provide lower and upper bounds on the sample complexity of multiple QHT, with it remaining an intriguing open question to improve these bounds. The final part of our paper outlines and reviews how sample complexity of QHT is relevant to a broad swathe of research areas and can enhance understanding of many fundamental concepts, including quantum algorithms for simulation and search, quantum learning and classification, and foundations of quantum mechanics. As such, we view our paper as an invitation to researchers coming from different communities to study and contribute to the problem of sample complexity of QHT, and we outline a number of open directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Multi-stream Transmission for Directional Modulation Network via Distributed Multi-UAV-aided Multi-active-IRS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a revolutionary technique for the future 6G networks. The conventional far-field single-IRS-aided directional modulation(DM) networks have only one (no direct path) or two (existing direct path) degrees of freedom (DoFs). This means that there are only one or two streams transmitted simultaneously from base station to user and will seriously limit its rate gain achieved by IRS. How to create multiple DoFs more than two for DM? In this paper, single large-scale IRS is divided to multiple small IRSs and a novel multi-IRS-aided multi-stream DM network is proposed to achieve a point-to-point multi-stream transmission by creating $K$ ($\geq3$) DoFs, where multiple small IRSs are placed distributively via multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The null-space projection, zero-forcing (ZF) and phase alignment are adopted to design the transmit beamforming vector, receive beamforming vector and phase shift matrix (PSM), respectively, called NSP-ZF-PA. Here, $K$ PSMs and their corresponding beamforming vectors are independently optimized. The weighted minimum mean-square error (WMMSE) algorithm is involved in alternating iteration for the optimization variables by introducing the power constraint on IRS, named WMMSE-PC, where the majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm is used to solve the total PSM. To achieve a lower computational complexity, a maximum trace method, called Max-TR-SVD, is proposed by optimize the PSM of all IRSs. Numerical simulation results has shown that the proposed NSP-ZF-PA performs much better than Max-TR-SVD in terms of rate. In particular, the rate of NSP-ZF-PA with sixteen small IRSs is about five times that of NSP-ZF-PA with combining all small IRSs as a single large IRS. Thus, a dramatic rate enhancement may be achieved by multiple distributed IRSs.</description>
