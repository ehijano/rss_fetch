      <title>Arbitrary Polynomial Decay Rates of Neutral, Collisionless Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A multispecies, collisionless plasma is modeled by the Vlasov-Poisson system. Assuming the plasma is neutral and the electric field decays with sufficient rapidity as $t \to\infty$, we show that solutions can be constructed with arbitrarily fast, polynomial rates of decay, depending upon the properties of the limiting spatial average and its derivatives. In doing so, we establish, for the first time, a countably infinite number of asymptotic profiles for the charge density, electric field, and their derivatives, each of which is necessarily realized by a sufficiently smooth solution and exceeds the established dispersive decay rates. Finally, in each case we establish a linear $L^\infty$ scattering result for every particle distribution function, namely we show that they converge as $t \to \infty$ along the transported spatial characteristics at increasingly faster rates.</description>

      <title>Concentration on the Boundary and Sign-Changing Solutions for a Slightly Subcritical Biharmonic Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the fourth-order nonlinear elliptic problem: \begin{equation*} \begin{array}{ll}
  \Delta(a(x)\Delta u) = a(x) \left\vert u \right\vert^{p-2-\epsilon} u \ \text{ in } \ \Omega,
  \hspace{0.6cm} u = 0 \ \text{ on } \ \partial \Omega,
  \hspace{0.6cm} \Delta u = 0 \ \text{ on } \ \partial \Omega,
  \end{array}\end{equation*} where $\Omega$ is a smooth, bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^N$ with $N \geq 5$. Here, $p := \frac{2N}{N-4}$ is the Sobolev critical exponent for the embedding $H^2 \cap H_0^1(\Omega) \hookrightarrow L^p(\Omega)$, and $a \in C^2(\overline{\Omega})$ is a strictly positive function on $\overline{\Omega}$.
  We establish sufficient conditions on the function $a$ and the domain $\Omega$ for this problem to admit both positive and sign-changing solutions with an explicit asymptotic profile. These solutions concentrate and blow up at a point on the boundary $\partial \Omega$ as $\epsilon \to 0$. The proofs of the main results rely on the Lyapunov-Schmidt finite-dimensional reduction method.</description>

      <title>Boundary estimates for elliptic operators in divergence form with VMO coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish boundary regularity estimates for elliptic systems in divergence form with VMO coefficients. Additionally, we obtain nondegeneracy estimates of the Hopf-Oleinik type lemma for elliptic equations. In both cases, the moduli of continuity are expressed in terms of the $L^p$-mean oscillations of the coefficients and data.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous reconstruction of two potentials for a nonconservative Schr\"odinger equation with dynamic boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we consider an inverse problem involving the simultaneous reconstruction of two real valued potentials for a Schr\"odinger equation with mixed boundary conditions: a dynamic boundary condition of Wentzell type and a Dirichler boundary condition. The main result of this paper is a Lipschitz stability estimate for such potentials from a single measurement of the flux. This result is deduced using the Bukhgeim-Klibanov method and a suitable Carleman estimate where the weight function depends on Minkowski's functional.</description>

      <title>Homogenization of the stochastic double-porosity model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is devoted to the homogenization of elliptic equations in high-contrast media in the so-called `double-porosity' resonant regime, for which we solve two open problems of the literature in the random setting. First, we prove qualitative homogenization under very weak conditions, that cover the case of inclusions that are not uniformly bounded or separated. Second, under stronger assumptions, we provide sharp error estimates for the two-scale expansion.</description>

      <title>Global boundedness of weak solutions to a flux-limited Keller--Segel system with superlinear production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The flux-limited Keller--Segel system \begin{align*}
  \begin{cases}
  u_t = \Delta u - \chi \nabla \cdot (u|\nabla v|^{p-2}\nabla v),
  \\[]
  v_t = \Delta v - v + u^{\theta}
  \end{cases} \end{align*} is considered under homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions in a bounded domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ $(n \in \mathbb{N})$. In the case that $\theta \le 1$, existence of global bounded weak solutions was established in the previous work (arXiv:2501.04370 ; to be appear in Proceedings of the conference "Critical Phenomena in Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations, Harmonic Analysis, and Functional Inequalities."). The purpose of this paper is to prove that global bounded weak solutions can also be constructed in the case $\theta &gt; 1$ with a smallness condition on $p$.</description>

      <title>Boundary regularity for the polyharmonic Dirichlet problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove that any solution of the $m$-polyharmonic Poisson equation in a Reifenberg-flat domain with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition, is $\mathscr{C}^{m-1,\alpha}$ regular up to the boundary. To achieve this result we extend the Nirenberg method of translations to operators of arbitrary order, and then use some Mosco-convergence tools developped in a previous paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of our paper is twofold. First, we present applied mathematics results on the heat content of bounded domains with smooth boundary and with fractal boundary. Second, we discuss new findings and concepts related to fractal curvatures for domains with fractal boundary. We conjecture that fractal curvatures and their scaling exponents will emerge in the short-time heat content asymptotics of domains with fractal boundary.</description>

      <title>The integrable nonlocal nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with oscillatory boundary conditions: long-time asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Cauchy problem for the integrable nonlocal nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation \[ \I q_{t}(x,t)+q_{xx}(x,t)+2 q^{2}(x,t)\bar{q}(-x,t)=0, \] subject to the step-like initial data: $q(x,0)\to0$ as $x\to-\infty$ and $q(x,0)\simeq Ae^{2\I Bx}$ as $x\to\infty$, where $A&gt;0$ and $B\in\mathbb{R}$. The goal is to study the long-time asymptotic behavior of the solution of this problem assuming that $q(x,0)$ is close, in a certain spectral sense, to the ``step-like'' function $q_{0,R}(x)= \begin{cases} 0, &amp;x\leq R,\\ Ae^{2\I Bx}, &amp;x&gt;R, \end{cases}$ with $R&gt;0$. A special attention is paid to how $B\ne0$ affects the asymptotics.</description>

      <title>Existence of solutions for $1-$laplacian problems with singular first order terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove existence of solutions to the following problem
  \begin{equation*}
  \begin{cases}
  -\Delta_1 u +g(u)|Du|=h(u)f &amp; \text{in $\Omega$,}
  \\ u=0 &amp; \text{on $\partial\Omega$,}
  \end{cases}
  \end{equation*}
  where $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^N$, with $N\ge2$, is an open and bounded set with Lipschitz boundary, $g$ is a continuous and positive function which possibly blows up at the origin and bounded at infinity and $h$ is a continuous and nonnegative function bounded at infinity (possibly blowing up at the origin) and finally $0 \le f \in L^N(\Omega)$. As a by-product, this paper extends the results found where $g$ is a continuous and bounded function. \\We investigate the interplay between $g$ and $h$ in order to have existence of solutions.</description>

      <title>BGK model for rarefied gas in a bounded domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Bathnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) equation in a smooth bounded domain featuring a diffusive reflection boundary condition with general collision frequency. We prove that the BGK equation admits a unique global solution with an exponential convergence rate if the initial condition is a small perturbation around the global Maxwellian in the $L^\infty$ space. For the proof we utilize the dissipative nature from the linearized BGK operator and develop several estimates for the nonlinear BGK operator in $L^\infty$ framework.</description>

      <title>$L^p$-estimates for the 2D wave equation in the scaling-critical magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the $L^{p}$-estimates for the solution to the $2\mathrm{D}$-wave equation with a scaling-critical magnetic potential. Inspired by the work of \cite{FZZ}, we show that the operators $(I+\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{A}})^{-\gamma}e^{it\sqrt{\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{A}}}}$ is bounded in $L^{p}(\mathbb{R}^{2})$ for $1&lt;p&lt;+\infty$ when $\gamma&gt;|1/p-1/2|$ and $t&gt;0$, where $\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{A}}$ is a magnetic Schr\"odinger operator. In particular, we derive the $L^{p}$-bounds for the sine wave propagator $\sin(t\sqrt{\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{A}}})\mathcal{L}^{-\frac12}_{\mathbf{A}}$. The key ingredients are the construction of the kernel function and the proof of the pointwise estimate for an analytic operator family $f_{w,t}(\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{A}})$.</description>

      <title>Existence and stability of soliton-based frequency combs in the Lugiato-Lefever equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kerr frequency combs are optical signals consisting of a multitude of equally spaced excited modes in frequency space. They are generated by converting a continuous-wave pump laser within an optical microresonator. It has been observed that the interplay of Kerr nonlinearity and dispersion in the microresonator can lead to a stable optical signal consisting of a periodic sequence of highly localized ultra-short pulses, resulting in broad frequency spectrum. The discovery that stable broadband frequency combs can be generated in microresonators has unlocked a wide range of promising applications, particularly in optical communications, spectroscopy and frequency metrology. In its simplest form, the physics in the microresonator is modeled by the Lugiato-Lefever equation, a damped nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with forcing. In this paper we demonstrate that the Lugiato-Lefever equation indeed supports arbitrarily broad Kerr frequency combs by proving the existence and stability of periodic solutions consisting of any number of well-separated, strongly localized and highly nonlinear pulses on a single periodicity interval. We realize these periodic multiple pulse solutions as concatenations of individual bright cavity solitons by phrasing the problem as a reversible dynamical system and employing results from homoclinic bifurcation theory. The spatial dynamics formulation enables us to harness general results, based on Evans-function techniques and Lin's method, to rigorously establish diffusive spectral stability. This, in turn, yields nonlinear stability of the periodic multipulse solutions against localized and subharmonic perturbations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study strictly elliptic, second-order differential operators on a bounded Lipschitz domain in $\mathbb{R}^d$, subject to certain non-local Wentzell-Robin boundary conditions. We prove that such operators generate strongly continuous semigroups on $L^2$-spaces and on spaces of continuous functions. We also provide a characterisation of positivity and (sub-)Markovianity of these semigroups. Moreover, based on spectral analysis of these operators, we discuss further properties of the semigroup such as asymptotic behaviour and, in the case of a non-positive semigroup, the weaker notion of eventual positivity of the semigroup.</description>

      <title>Bubbles clustered inside for almost critical problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the existence of blowing-up solutions of the following almost critical problem $$ -\Delta u +V(x)u =u^{p-\e},\quad u&gt;0\quad\mbox{in}\quad \O,\quad u=0\quad\mbox{on}\quad \partial\O, $$
  where $\O$ is a bounded regular domain in $\mathbb{R}^n$, $n\geq 4$, $\varepsilon$ is a small positive parameter, $p+1=(2n)/(n-2)$ is the critical Soblolev exponent and the potential $V$ is a smooth positive function. We find solutions which exhibit bubbles clustered inside as $\e$ goes to zero. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first existence result for interior non-simple blowing-up positive solutions to Dirichlet problems in general domains. Our results are proven through delicate asymptotic estimates of the gradient of the associated Euler-Lagrange functional.</description>

      <title>Singular set estimates for solutions to elliptic equations in higher co-dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in quantitative unique continuation properties for solutions to uniformly elliptic, divergence form equations (with Lipschitz coefficients) has led to a good understanding of the vanishing order and size of singular and zero set of solutions. Such estimates also hold at the boundary, provided that the domain is sufficiently regular. In this work, we investigate the boundary behavior of solutions to a class of elliptic equations in the higher co-dimension setting, whose coefficients are neither uniformly elliptic, nor uniformly Lipschitz. Despite these challenges, we are still able to show analogous estimates on the singular set of such solutions near the boundary. Our main technical advance is a variant of the Cheeger-Naber-Valtorta quantitative stratification scheme using cones instead of planes.</description>

      <title>An explicitly solvable NLS model with discontinuous standing waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equation on the line in the presence of a point interaction that consists in the superposition of an attractive delta potential with a dipole interaction. In the energy space it induces a discontinuity at the origin that breaks the parity symmetry. We treat the $L^2$-subcritical and the $L^2$-critical nonlinearity. For a subcritical nonlinearity we prove the existence and the uniqueness of the Ground State at any mass, namely the positive minimizer of the associated energy among all functions with the same mass. If the mass is larger than an explicit threshold, then there exists another stationary solution, i.e. an excited state, which is positive too. For the critical nonlinearity we prove that Ground States exist only in a specific interval of masses. Furthermore, one branch of excited states exists in a range of masses disjoint from that of the Ground States. For a dipole interaction, i.e. without the Dirac's delta, all Ground States concentrate at the same value of the mass and all excited states concentrate at another value of the mass. Both masses depend on the strength of the dipole interactions. Furthermore, we provide the value of the optimal constant in the Gagliardo-Nirenberg estimate and describe in detail the bifurcation from the unperturbed soliton that gives rise to both branches of stationary states, providing the motivation for the values of the mass that characterize the two branches, in the limit of a dipole interaction of infinite strength. Since all stationary states are explicitly computed, ours is a solvable model involving a non-standard interplay of a nonlinearity with a point interaction, in the sense that is richer than in the well-known model of a delta interaction with a nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Parametric Reduced Order Models for the Generalized Kuramoto--Sivashinsky Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper studies parametric Reduced Order Models (ROMs) for the Kuramoto--Sivashinsky (KS) and generalized Kuramoto--Sivashinsky (gKS) equations. We consider several POD and POD-DEIM projection ROMs with various strategies for parameter sampling and snapshot collection. The aim is to identify an approach for constructing a ROM that is efficient across a range of parameters, encompassing several regimes exhibited by the KS and gKS solutions: weakly chaotic, transitional, and quasi-periodic dynamics. We describe such an approach and demonstrate that it is essential to develop ROMs that adequately represent the short-time transient behavior of the gKS model.</description>

      <title>Optimal control of the fidelity coefficient in a Cahn-Hilliard image inpainting model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an inpainting model proposed by A. Bertozzi et al., which is based on a Cahn--Hilliard-type equation. This equation describes the evolution of an order parameter $u \in [0,1]$ representing an approximation of the original image which occupies a bounded two-dimensional domain $\Omega$. The given image $g$ is assumed to be damaged in a fixed subdomain $D \subset \Omega$ and the equation is characterized by a linear reaction term of the form $\lambda (u - g)$. Here $\lambda = \lambda_0 \chi_{\Omega \setminus D}$ is the so-called fidelity coefficient, $\lambda_0$ being a strictly positive bounded function. The idea is that, given an initial image $u_0$, $u$ evolves towards $g$ and this process properly diffuses through the boundary of $D$ restoring the damaged image, provided that $\lambda_0$ is large enough. Here, we formulate an optimal control problem based on this fact, namely our cost functional accounts for the magnitude of $\lambda_0$. Assuming a singular potential to assure that $u$ takes its values in $[0,1]$, we first analyse the control-to-state operator and prove the existence of at least one optimal control, establishing the validity of first-order optimality conditions. Then, under suitable assumptions, we demonstrate second-order optimality conditions. All these results depend on the existence and uniqueness of a strong solution, which we obtain thanks to the strict separation property from pure phases.</description>

      <title>Internal layer solutions and coefficient recovery in time-periodic reaction-diffusion-advection equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article investigates the non-stationary reaction-diffusion-advection equation, emphasizing solutions with internal layers and the associated inverse problems. We examine a nonlinear singularly perturbed partial differential equation (PDE) within a bounded spatial domain and an infinite temporal domain, subject to periodic temporal boundary conditions. A periodic asymptotic solution featuring an inner transition layer is proposed, advancing the mathematical modeling of reaction-diffusion-advection dynamics. Building on this asymptotic analysis, we develop a simple yet effective numerical algorithm to address ill-posed nonlinear inverse problems aimed at reconstructing coefficient functions that depend solely on spatial or temporal variables. Conditions ensuring the existence and uniqueness of solutions for both forward and inverse problems are established. The proposed method's effectiveness is validated through numerical experiments, demonstrating high accuracy in reconstructing coefficient functions under varying noise conditions.</description>

      <title>Global critical points of the Standard Model on four-dimensional spacetimes of expanding type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Standard Model of elementary particle physics is one of the most successful models of contemporary theoretical physics being in full agreement with experiments. However, its mathematical structure deserves further investigations both from a geometric and an analytic point of view. The aim of this manuscript is to provide a mathematically well-defined and self-contained description of the Standard Model in terms of gauge theory and differential geometry on globally hyperbolic manifolds. Within this setup we then prove the existence of a global solution for the Euler-Lagrange equations of the Standard Model (with the conformal Higgs potential) under the assumptions that the globally hyperbolic manifold is a four-dimensional spacetime of expanding type and small initial data. This is achieved by establishing a gauge-invariant energy estimate which is of independent mathematical interest.</description>

      <title>Fragile topology on solid grounds and the Thouless conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a mathematical perspective on fragile topology in condensed matter physics. In dimension $d \le 3$, vanishing Chern classes characterize the topological phases of periodic media that exhibit localized Wannier functions. However, for special symmetries $I$ of the system, such as $C_{2z}T$ (space-time reversal), the existence of a localized set of Wannier functions that is also invariant under this symmetry $I$ may not always exist. In systems with fragile topology, Wannier functions cannot respect both the symmetry $I$ and the localization constraints. Nevertheless, this obstruction can be lifted by adding Chern-trivial line bundles, invariant under the $I$-symmetry. This allows for the construction of localized Wannier functions that respect symmetry. In the last section, we take on a broader perspective and obtain Wannier localization in dimensions $d=2,3$ without symmetry constraints for Chern nontrivial Bloch bundles. For $d=2$, we obtain the Wannier decay with Thouless exponent $\mathcal{O}(|x|^{-2})$; for $d=3$, we obtain the decay rate $\mathcal{O}(|x|^{-7/3})$.</description>

As an application, we show that the Hopf lemma holds almost everywhere on $\partial\Omega$ when $V$ is a nonnegative Hopf potential.</description>

      <title>A qualitative study of the generalized dispersive systems with time-delay: The unbounded case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.06693v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behavior of the solutions of the time-delayed higher-order dispersive nonlinear differential equation \begin{equation*} u_t(x,t)+Au(x,t) +\lambda_0(x) u(x,t)+\lambda(x) u(x,t-\tau )=0 \end{equation*} where \begin{equation*} Au=(-1)^{j+1}\partial_x^{2j+1}u+(-1)^m\partial_x^{2m}u+ \frac{1}{p+1}\partial_xu^{p+1} \end{equation*} with $m\le j$ and $1\le p&lt;2j$. Under suitable assumptions on the time delay coefficients, we prove that the system is exponentially stable if the coefficient of the delay term is bounded from below by a suitable positive constant, without any assumption on the sign of the coefficient of the undelayed feedback. Additionally, in the absence of delay, general results of stabilization are established in $H^s(\mathbb{R})$ for $s\in[0,2j+1]$. Our results generalize several previous theorems for the Korteweg-de Vries type delayed systems in the literature.</description>

      <title>A First-Order Mean-Field Game on a Bounded Domain with Mixed Boundary Conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.15952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel first-order stationary mean-field game model with a predefined decomposition of the boundary into entry and exit regions. On the entry portion, we prescribe the incoming flow of agents (Neumann-type boundary condition), while on the exit portion, we impose a constraint that prevents inward flow, complemented by an upper bound on the value function. The interior dynamics are governed by the standard first-order stationary mean-field game system, consisting of a stationary Hamilton-Jacobi equation and a stationary transport equation. We establish the existence of solutions via a rigorous variational formulation. Furthermore, we prove a partial uniqueness result for solutions via a Lasry-Lions monotone operator, which is key to the analysis of the model. In addition to the theoretical results, we present several examples that illustrate the behavior of the system, including the emergence of regions with vanishing density.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.00154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we analytically study the existence of periodic vortex cap solutions for the homogeneous and incompressible Euler equations on the rotating unit 2-sphere, which was numerically conjectured by Dritschel-Polvani and Kim-Sakajo-Sohn. Such solutions are piecewise constant vorticity distributions, subject to the Gauss constraint and rotating uniformly around the vertical axis. The proof is based on the bifurcation from zonal solutions given by spherical caps. For the one--interface case, the bifurcation eigenvalues correspond to Burbea's frequencies obtained in the planar case but shifted by the rotation speed of the sphere. The two--interfaces case (also called band type or strip type solutions) is more delicate. Though, for any fixed large enough symmetry, and under some non-degeneracy conditions to avoid spectral collisions, we achieve the existence of at most two branches of bifurcation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02023v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with the existence of guided waves and edge states in particular two-dimensional media obtained by perturbing a reference periodic medium with honeycomb symmetry. This reference medium is a thin periodic domain (the thickness is denoted $\delta$ &gt; 0) with an hexagonal structure, which is close to an honeycomb quantum graph. In a first step, we show the existence of Dirac points (conical crossings) at arbitrarily large frequencies if $\delta$ is chosen small enough. We then perturbe the domain by cutting the perfectly periodic medium along the so-called zigzag direction, and we consider either Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions on the cut edge. In the two cases, we prove the existence of edges modes as well as their robustness with respect to some perturbations, namely the location of the cut and the thickness of the perturbed edge. In particular, we show that different locations of the cut lead to almost-non dispersive edge states, the number of locations increasing with the frequency. All the results are obtained via asymptotic analysis and semi-explicit computations done on the limit quantum graph. Numerical simulations illustrate the theoretical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the behavior of shallow water waves over periodically-varying bathymetry, based on the first-order hyperbolic Saint-Venant equations. Although solutions of this system are known to generally exhibit wave breaking, numerical experiments suggest a different behavior in the presence of periodic bathymetry. Starting from the first-order variable-coefficient hyperbolic system, we apply a multiple-scale perturbation approach in order to derive a system of constant-coefficient high-order partial differential equations whose solution approximates that of the original system. The high-order system turns out to be dispersive and exhibits solitary-wave formation, in close agreement with direct numerical simulations of the original system. We show that the constant-coefficient homogenized system can be used to study the properties of solitary waves and to conduct efficient numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>A prior estimates and a blow-up criterion for the incompressible ideal MHD equations with surface tension and a closed free surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09473v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the a priori estimates and prove a blow-up criterion for the three-dimensional free boundary incompressible ideal magnetohydrodynamics equations. The fluid occupies a bounded region with a free boundary that is a closed surface, without assumptions of simple connectedness or periodicity of the region (thus, Fourier transforms cannot be applied), nor the graph assumption for the free boundary. The fluid is under the influence of surface tension, and flattening the boundaries using local coordinates is insufficient to resolve this problem. This is because local coordinates fail to preserve curvature, as the mean curvature of a flat boundary degenerates to zero. To address these challenges and circumvent the intricate issue of spatial regularity in Lagrangian coordinates, we utilize reference surfaces to represent the free boundary and develop new energy functionals that both preserve the material derivative and incorporate spatial-temporal scaling $\partial_t \sim \nabla^{\frac{3}{2}}$ in Eulerian coordinates. This method enables us to establish both low-order and high-order regularity estimates without any loss of regularity. More importantly, we prove a blow-up criterion and provide a complete classification of blow-ups, including the self-intersection of the free boundary (which the graph assumption cannot handle), the breakdown of the mean curvature, and the blow-up of the normal velocity (which Lagrangian coordinates fail to capture). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result addressing the a priori estimates and the blow-up criterion for free boundary problems with surface tension in general regions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a simple variational model describing the ground state of a superconducting charge qubit. The model gives rise to a shape optimization problem that aims at maximizing the number of qubit states at a given gating voltage. We show that for small values of the charge optimal shapes exist and are $C^{2,\alpha}$-nearly spherical sets. In contrast, we prove that balls are not minimizers for large values of the charge and conjecture that optimal shapes do not exist, with the energy favoring disjoint collections of sets.</description>

      <title>Scattering for the one dimensional Hartree Fock equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Hartree-Fock equation in 1D, for a small and localised initial data and a finite measure potential. We show that there is no long range scattering due to a nonlinear cancellation between the direct term and the exchange term for plane waves. We employ the framework of space-time resonances that enables us to single out precisely this cancellation and to obtain scattering to linear waves as a consequence.</description>

      <title>Controllability Problems for the Heat Equation in a Half-Plane Controlled by the Neumann Boundary Condition with a Point-Wise Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the paper, the problems of controllability and approximate controllability are studied for the control system $w_t=\Delta w$, $w_{x_1}(0,x_2,t)=u(t)\delta(x_2)$, $x_1&gt;0$, $x_2\in\mathbb R$, $t\in(0,T)$, where $u\in L^\infty(0,T)$ is a control. To this aid, it is investigated the set $\mathcal{R}_T(0)\subset L^2((0,+\infty)\times\mathbb R)$ of its end states which are reachable from $0$. It is established that a function $f\in\mathcal{R}_T(0)$ can be represented in the form $f(x)=g\big(|x|^2\big)$ a.e. in $(0,+\infty)\times\mathbb R$ where $g\in L^2(0,+\infty)$. In fact, we reduce the problem dealing with functions from $L^2((0,+\infty)\times\mathbb R)$ to a problem dealing with functions from $L^2(0,+\infty)$. Both a necessary and sufficient condition for controllability and a sufficient condition for approximate controllability in a given time $T$ under a control $u$ bounded by a given constant are obtained in terms of solvability of a Markov power moment problem. Using the Laguerre functions (forming an orthonormal basis of $L^2(0,+\infty)$), necessary and sufficient conditions for approximate controllability and numerical solutions to the approximate controllability problem are obtained. It is also shown that there is no initial state that is null-controllable in a given time $T$. The results are illustrated by an example.</description>

      <title>Stability estimates for critical points of a nonlocal Sobolev-type inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the stability of the following nonlocal Soblev-type inequality
  \begin{equation*}
  C_{HLS}\big(\int_{\mathbb{R}^n}\big(|x|^{-\mu} \ast u^{p}\big)u^{p} dx\big)^{\frac{1}{p}}\leq\int_{\mathbb{R}^n}|\nabla u|^2 dx , \quad \forall~u\in D^{1,2}(\mathbb{R}^n),
  \end{equation*} which is induced by the classical Sobolev inequality and the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality, where $p=\frac{2n-\mu}{n-2}$, $n\geq3$ and $\mu\in(0,n)$, is energy-critical exponent and $C_{HLS}$ is the best constant depending on $n$ and $\mu$. Up to translation and scaling, the best constant of the nonlocal Soblev inequality can be achieved by a unique family of positive and radially symmetric extremal function $W(x)$ that satisfies, up to a suitable scaling, the classical critical Hartree equation
  \begin{equation*}
  \Delta u+(|x|^{-\mu}\ast u^{p})u^{p-1}=0 \quad \mbox{in}\quad \mathbb{R}^n.
  \end{equation*} Recently, Piccione, Yang and Zhao in \cite{p-y-z24} established a nonlocal version of Struwe's profile decomposition and they only proved the nonlocal version of the quantitative stability for the one bubble case without dimension restriction and the multiple bubbles case $\kappa\geq2$ if dimension $3\leq n&lt;6-\mu$ and $\mu\in(0,n)$ with $\mu\in(0,4]$ in Ciraolo-Figalli-Maggi \cite{CFM18} and Figalli-Glaudo \cite{FG20}. We establish the quantitative stability estimates for critical point of the nonlocal Soblev inequality for $n\geq6-\mu$ and $\mu\in(0,4)$, which is an extension of the recent works by Deng-Sun-Wei in \cite{DSW21} for the classical Sobolev inequality.</description>

      <title>Tollmien-Schlichting waves near neutral stable curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the linear stability of boundary layer flows over a flat plate. Tollmien, Schlichting, Lin et al. found that there exists a neutral curve, which consists of two branches: lower branch $\alpha_{low}(Re)$ and upper branch $\alpha_{up}(Re)$. Here, $\alpha$ is the wave number and $Re$ is the Reynolds number. For any $\alpha\in(\alpha_{low},\alpha_{up})$, there exist unstable modes known as Tollmien-Schlichting (T-S) waves to the linearized Navier-Stokes system. These waves play a key role during the early stage of boundary layer transition. In a breakthrough work (Duke math Jour, 165(2016)), Grenier, Guo, and Nguyen provided a rigorous construction of the unstable T-S waves. In this paper, we confirm the existence of the neutral stable curve. To achieve this, we develop a more delicate method for solving the Orr-Sommerfeld equation by borrowing some ideas from the triple-deck theory. This approach allows us to construct the T-S waves in a neighborhood of the neutral curve.</description>

      <title>Exponentials rarely maximize Fourier extension inequalities for cones</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.00356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the existence of maximizers and the precompactness of $L^p$-normalized maximizing sequences modulo symmetries for all valid scale-invariant Fourier extension inequalities on the cone in $\mathbb R^{1+d}$. In the range for which such inequalities are conjectural, our result is conditional on the boundedness of the extension operator. Global maximizers for the $L^2$ Fourier extension inequality on the cone in $\mathbb R^{1+d}$ have been characterized in the lowest-dimensional cases $d\in\{2,3\}$. We further prove that these functions are critical points for the $L^p$ to $L^q$ Fourier extension inequality if and only if $p = 2$.</description>

      <title>On the first eigenvalue and eigenfunction of the Laplacian with mixed boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the eigenvalue problem for the Laplacian with mixed Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. For a certain class of bounded, simply connected planar domains we prove monotonicity properties of the first eigenfunction. As a consequence, we establish a variant of the hot spots conjecture for mixed boundary conditions. Moreover, we obtain an inequality between the lowest eigenvalue of this mixed problem and the lowest eigenvalue of the corresponding dual problem where the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions are interchanged. The proofs are based on a novel variational principle, which we establish.</description>

      <title>A physics-encoded Fourier neural operator approach for surrogate modeling of divergence-free stress fields in solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The purpose of the current work is the development of a so-called physics-encoded Fourier neural operator (PeFNO) for surrogate modeling of the quasi-static equilibrium stress field in solids. Rather than accounting for constraints from physics in the loss function as done in the (now standard) physics-informed approach, the physics-encoded approach incorporates or "encodes" such constraints directly into the network or operator architecture. As a result, in contrast to the physics-informed approach in which only training is physically constrained, both training and output are physically constrained in the physics-encoded approach. For the current constraint of divergence-free stress, a novel encoding approach based on a stress potential is proposed.
  As a "proof-of-concept" example application of the proposed PeFNO, a heterogeneous polycrystalline material consisting of isotropic elastic grains subject to uniaxial extension is considered. Stress field data for training are obtained from the numerical solution of a corresponding boundary-value problem for quasi-static mechanical equilibrium. This data is also employed to train an analogous physics-guided FNO (PgFNO) and physics-informed FNO (PiFNO) for comparison. As confirmed by this comparison and as expected on the basis of their differences, the output of the trained PeFNO is significantly more accurate in satisfying mechanical equilibrium than the output of either the trained PgFNO or the trained PiFNO.</description>

      <title>Foundations on k-contact geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11001v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: k-Contact geometry is a generalisation of contact geometry to analyse field theories. We develop an approach to k-contact geometry based on distributions that are distributionally maximally non-integrable and admit, locally, k commuting supplementary Lie symmetries: the k-contact distributions. We related k-contact distributions with Engel, Goursat and other distributions, which have mathematical and physical interest. We give necessary topological conditions for the existence of globally defined Lie symmetries, k-contact Lie groups are defined and studied, and we study and propose a k-contact Weinstein conjecture for co-oriented k-contact manifolds. Polarisations for k-contact distributions are introduced and it is shown that a polarised k-contact distribution is locally diffeomorphic to the Cartan distribution of the first-order jet bundle over a fibre bundle of order k. We relate k-contact manifolds to presymplectic and k-symplectic manifolds on fibre bundles of larger dimension and define types of submanifolds in k-contact geometry. We study Hamilton-De Donder-Weyl equations in Lie groups for the first time. A theory of k-contact Hamiltonian vector fields is developed, and we describe characteristics of Lie symmetries for first-order partial differential equations in a k-contact Hamiltonian manner. We use our techniques to analyse Hamilton-Jacobi and Dirac equations. Other potential applications of k-contact distributions to non-holonomic and control systems are briefly described.</description>
