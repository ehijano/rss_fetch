      <title>Quantitative ultrasound imaging of bone: anatomical images, tissue structural quality, and pulsatile blood flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an ultrasound approach which provides, with one single examination and one single device, access to three bone biomarkers: anatomy, tissue quality and blood flow. It unlocks ultrasound imaging inside bone by accounting for ultrasound wave speed heterogeneity and anisotropic wave refraction. This study reports the first \emph{in vivo} evaluation with a comparison to peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography (pQCT) and modulations of blood flow. Anatomical multi-layer bone-corrected reconstruction was validated at the tibia of healthy volunteers against pQCT and showed agreement on bone cortex interfaces. Estimation of axial and radial ultrasound wave speeds in cortical bone tissue (i.e. along the tissue symmetry axis and normal to it) demonstrated good reproducibility and positive correlation with bone mineral density measured by pQCT. Pulsatile blood flow was mapped and quantified in cortical and medullary regions. A directional ray selection method was developed to enhance blood signal extraction by reducing strong specular reflections originating from the outer and inner surfaces of the bone cortex. Physiological and non-physiological modulations of blood flow, namely head-up/head-down tilt table maneuvers and arterial occlusions, demonstrated the method sensitivity to blood flow variations. For the first time, reactive hyperemia was observed inside bone cortex. These results demonstrate the feasibility of a portable, non-ionizing, and quantitative ultrasound approach for structural, anatomical, and vascular characterization of bone tissue. This approach may offer new diagnostic capabilities for bone disorders, for instance osteoporosis, delayed fracture healing or osteonecrosis.</description>

      <title>A physics-informed, plug-and-play dose engine for gradient-based radiotherapy treatment planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiotherapy treatment planning remains a time-intensive iterative process requiring expert intervention in commercial treatment planning system (TPS). While machine learning approaches have demonstrated promise, most remain depedent on TPS-based dose calculation or surrogate dose models, preventing direct optimization of deliverable treatment plan parameters.
  We propose PyDoseRT (PDRT), a physics-informed, GPU-accelerated dose engine implemented in PyTorch that computes dose distributions directly from treatment delivery parameters (i.e., MLC leaf positions, jaw positions, gantry angles, and monitor units). The engine preserves gradient information throughout the dose computation pipeline, enabling gradient-based optimization of hardware-constrained treatment plans without the reliance on a commercial TPS.
  PDRT was evaluated on 19 and 162 clinical VMAT prostate cancer plans from two hospitals (with different treatment machines). When recalculating clinical plans, PDRT achieved high 3D gamma pass rates (mean 96.8% for 2%/2 mm and 98.9% for 3%/3 mm, depending on cohort). All optimized plans converged to clinically acceptable solutions and passed deliverability verification when imported into a commercial TPS.
  This physics-informed framework eliminates TPS dependency for radiotherapy optimization research by enabling gradient-based planning while ensuring that delivery parameters remain in the machine-feasible range. The gradient-enabled dose engine allows exploration of novel optimization strategies and objective functions while maintaining clinical validity. The proposed approach provides a research platform for investigating real-time adaptive radiotherapy concepts, automated planning workflows, and TPS-independent optimization strategies, and democratizing radiotherapy research, by exposing gradient-enabled, hardware-aware, open-source dose computation.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Vascularity in Gelatin Scaffolds via Copper-Doped Magnesium-Calcium Silicates Incorporation: In-Vitro and Ex-Ovo Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Addressing a critical challenge in current tissue-engineering practices, this study aims to enhance vascularization in 3D porous scaffolds by incorporating bioceramics laden with pro-angiogenic ions. Specifically, freeze-dried gelatin-based scaffolds were infused with sol-gel-derived powders of Cu-doped akermanite (Ca2MgSi2O7) and bredigite (Ca7MgSi4O16) at various concentrations (10, 20, and 30 wt%). The scaffolds were initially characterized for their structural integrity, biodegradability, swelling behavior, impact on physiological pH, and cytocompatibility with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The silicate incorporation effectiveness in promoting vascularity was then assessed through HUVEC attachment, capillary tube formation, and ex-ovo chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane assays. The findings revealed significant improvements in both in-vitro and ex-ovo vascularity of the gelatin scaffolds upon the addition of Cu-doped akermanite. The most effective concentrations were determined to be 10 and 20%, which led to notable HUVEC metabolic activity, a well-spread morphology with extensive peripheral filopodia and lamellipodia at 10% and a cobblestone phenotype indicative of in-vivo endothelium at 20% during cell attachment, the formation of complex networks of tubular structures, and robust vascularization in chick embryo development. Moving forward, the incorporation of Cu-doped akermanite into tissue-engineering scaffolds shows great potential for addressing the limitations of vascularization, especially for critical-sized bone defects, by facilitating the controlled release of pro-angiogenic and pro-osteogenic ions.</description>

      <title>Classical and relativistic balance of configurational forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article develops a unified variational framework for configurational (or material) forces in both Classical (3D, non-relativistic) and Relativistic (4D) Continuum Mechanics. Configurational forces describe the evolution of material defects-such as cracks, dislocations, and interfaces-which move relative to the material rather than through physical space. In the classical setting of hyperelasticity, the authors revisit the balance of configurational forces using an intrinsic Lagrangian formulation, where the material body is modeled as an abstract three-dimensional manifold. By treating the reference configuration as a variable and performing a Lagrangian variation with respect to it, they show that the configurational forces balance naturally emerges. Importantly, this balance equation is not independent: it is equivalent to the standard balance of linear momentum combined with constitutive relations, and it is expressed through the Eshelby stress tensor on the reference configuration. The framework is then extended to Relativistic Hyperelasticity within General Relativity. Matter is described by a matter field, a vector valued function, defined on the four-dimensional Universe, and the Lagrangian (i.e., Action) includes both matter and gravitational contributions. Two stress-energy tensors arise: the Noether stress-energy tensor (from variations with respect to the matter field) and the Hilbert stress-energy tensor (from variations with respect to the Universe metric). Assuming General Covariance, the authors prove that these tensors and their associated balance laws are equivalent. By introducing the notion of an observer and specializing to static spacetimes, the authors define a relativistic generalization of the deformation and derive a four-dimensional Eshelby tensor. They show that in Special Relativity, as in Classical Continuum Mechanics, the relativistic configurational forces balance is not a new equation but follows from the conservation laws of the Noether stress-energy tensor. Finally, they recover the classical configurational forces balance as the non-relativistic limit of the relativistic theory. Overall, the paper provides a rigorous geometric and variational interpretation of configurational forces, unifying classical and relativistic formulations and clarifying their deep connection with standard equilibrium equations.</description>

      <title>Deformation and Stress Evolution during Laser Powder Bed Fusion of Semi-Crystalline Polyamide-12</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) of semi-crystalline polymers such as polyamide-12 (PA12) has found increasing use in various industrial applications. However, achieving high dimensional accuracy remains a significant challenge. Despite the seemingly straightforward layer-by-layer manufacturing concept, the L-PBF process involves complex thermal histories and strongly coupled multiphysics, making the evolution of stress and deformation mechanisms still not fully understood. To address this, a comprehensive three-dimensional thermo-mechanical modeling framework is developed to simulate the L-PBF process of PA12. The model for the first time incorporates transient heat transfer, phase transformation induced volumetric shrinkage, thermoviscoelasticity, and a modified non-isothermal crystallization kinetics. To alleviate the computational burden of part-scale simulations, a dual-mesh strategy is employed to efficiently couple thermal and mechanical fields without compromising numerical accuracy, which also enables the framework to handle L-PBF simulations of arbitrarily complex three-dimensional geometries.  Particular attention is paid to the role of mechanical and thermal boundary conditions. Specifically, the underlying powder bed is modeled as a fictitious viscous medium, providing support while permitting upward displacement. Additionally, a radiative heat loss boundary condition, which more closely approximates the actual physical process, is applied to the top powder surface. The incorporation of this radiation effect significantly enhances the crystallization rate and improves the agreement with experimentally measured warpage. The model is validated against experimental warpage data under various preheating temperatures. Furthermore, strain decoupling analysis for the first time reveals that displacement induced by phase transformation is approximately 10 times greater than that caused by thermal expansion, highlighting the dominant role of crystallizationinduced shrinkage in warpage formation. Numerical tests also indicate that warpage is highly sensitive to the preheating target temperature of the PA12 powder bed, while the temperature of the newly recoated powder within the tested range has a limited effect. This work provides a predictive modeling foundation for future optimization of polymer L-PBF processes at part-scale, particularly in controlling deformation and improving dimensional accuracy.</description>

      <title>MRI Simulation and Reconstruction Framework for Magnetic Vector Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Conventional MRI is relying on the assumption of the magnetic field being homogeneous in direction and amplitude. However, with the growing interest in portable, affordable point-of-care MRI systems, these assumptions do not necessarily hold anymore due to compromises necessary to achieve a reduction in e.g. footprint, weight and portability. Simulation software may help by evaluating new encoding schemes which are optimized for non-ideal hardware but also with the design of new scanner designs. The goal of this work was to develop a MATLAB-based simulation software capable of dealing with deflected magnetic fields during signal simulation and reconstruction and enabling the evaluation of arbitrary magnetic field configurations for encoding in MRI.
  Methods: Conventional matrix-based Bloch simulation is limited in its applicability to arbitrary magnetic fields. We therefore adapted, evaluated, and validated a modified approach, achieving substantially shorter simulation time. Furthermore, it is used to predict image quality in 2D gradient echo experiments with deflected magnetic fields.
  Results: The comparison of numerical Bloch and matrix-based simulation revealed close agreement of both reconstructed images. Further, it was shown that compensation of the associated artifacts can be achieved by incorporating knowledge about the used magnetic fields into the reconstruction process.
  Conclusion: The presented and validated software package enables full consideration of angular inhomogeneities of magnetic vector fields used in MRI for signal simulation but also reconstruction removing the related artifacts. As such, the software might become a valuable tool for new low-field system designs and the investigation of new reconstruction algorithms.</description>

      <title>Enhanced sinterability and in vitro bioactivity of diopside through fluoride doping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, diopside (CaMgSi2O6) was doped with fluoride at a level of 1 mol.%, without the formation of any second phase, by a wet chemical precipitation method. The sintered structure of the synthesized nanopowders was studied by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and field-emission scanning electron microscopy. Also, the samples' in vitro apatite-forming ability in a simulated body fluid was comparatively evaluated by electron microscopy, inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. According to the results, the material's sinterability was improved by fluoride doping, as realized from the further development of sintering necks. It was also found that compared to the undoped bioceramic, a higher amount of apatite was deposited on the surface of the doped sample. It is concluded that fluoride can be considered as a doping agent in magnesium-containing silicates to improve biological, particularly bioactivity, behaviors.</description>

      <title>Patlak Parametric Image Estimation from Dynamic PET Using Diffusion Model Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic PET enables the quantitative estimation of physiology-related parameters and is widely utilized in research and increasingly adopted in clinical settings. Parametric imaging in dynamic PET requires kinetic modeling to estimate voxel-wise physiological parameters based on specific kinetic models. However, parametric images estimated through kinetic model fitting often suffer from low image quality due to the inherently ill-posed nature of the fitting process and the limited counts resulting from non-continuous data acquisition across multiple bed positions in whole-body PET. In this work, we proposed a diffusion model-based kinetic modeling framework for parametric image estimation, using the Patlak model as an example. The score function of the diffusion model was pre-trained on static total-body PET images and served as a prior for both Patlak slope and intercept images by leveraging their patch-wise similarity. During inference, the kinetic model was incorporated as a data-consistency constraint to guide the parametric image estimation. The proposed framework was evaluated on total-body dynamic PET datasets with different dose levels, demonstrating the feasibility and promising performance of the proposed framework in improving parametric image quality.</description>

      <title>Efficient Vision Mamba for MRI Super-Resolution via Hybrid Selective Scanning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: High-resolution MRI is critical for diagnosis, but long acquisition times limit clinical use. Super-resolution (SR) can enhance resolution post-scan, yet existing deep learning methods face fidelity-efficiency trade-offs. Purpose: To develop a computationally efficient and accurate deep learning framework for MRI SR that preserves anatomical detail for clinical integration. Materials and Methods: We propose a novel SR framework combining multi-head selective state-space models (MHSSM) with a lightweight channel MLP. The model uses 2D patch extraction with hybrid scanning to capture long-range dependencies. Each MambaFormer block integrates MHSSM, depthwise convolutions, and gated channel mixing. Evaluation used 7T brain T1 MP2RAGE maps (n=142) and 1.5T prostate T2w MRI (n=334). Comparisons included Bicubic interpolation, GANs (CycleGAN, Pix2pix, SPSR), transformers (SwinIR), Mamba (MambaIR), and diffusion models (I2SB, Res-SRDiff). Results: Our model achieved superior performance with exceptional efficiency. For 7T brain data: SSIM=0.951+-0.021, PSNR=26.90+-1.41 dB, LPIPS=0.076+-0.022, GMSD=0.083+-0.017, significantly outperforming all baselines (p&lt;0.001). For prostate data: SSIM=0.770+-0.049, PSNR=27.15+-2.19 dB, LPIPS=0.190+-0.095, GMSD=0.087+-0.013. The framework used only 0.9M parameters and 57 GFLOPs, reducing parameters by 99.8% and computation by 97.5% versus Res-SRDiff, while outperforming SwinIR and MambaIR in accuracy and efficiency. Conclusion: The proposed framework provides an efficient, accurate MRI SR solution, delivering enhanced anatomical detail across datasets. Its low computational demand and state-of-the-art performance show strong potential for clinical translation.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Neural Operators for Real-Time Biomechanical Modelling of Traumatic Brain Injury</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03248v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major global health concern with 69 million annual cases. While neural operators have revolutionized scientific computing, existing architectures cannot handle the heterogeneous multimodal data (anatomical imaging, scalar demographics, and geometric constraints) required for patient-specific biomechanical modeling. Objective: This study introduces the first multimodal neural operator framework for biomechanics, fusing heterogeneous inputs to predict brain displacement fields for rapid TBI risk assessment. Methods: TBI modeling was reformulated as a multimodal operator learning problem. We proposed two fusion strategies: field projection for Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) architectures and branch decomposition for Deep Operator Networks (DeepONet). Four architectures (FNO, Factorized FNO, Multi-Grid FNO, and DeepONet) were extended with fusion mechanisms and evaluated on 249 in vivo Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE) datasets (20-90 Hz). Results: Multi-Grid FNO achieved the highest accuracy (MSE = 0.0023, 94.3% spatial fidelity). DeepONet offered the fastest inference (14.5 iterations/s, 7x speedup), suitable for edge deployment. All architectures reduced computation from hours to milliseconds. Conclusion: Multimodal neural operators enable efficient, real-time, patient-specific TBI risk assessment. This framework establishes a generalizable paradigm for heterogeneous data fusion in scientific domains, including precision medicine.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an in-depth analysis on how to build and train neural networks to estimate the spatial distribution of scattered radiation fields for radiation protection dosimetry in medical radiation fields, such as those found in interventional radiology and cardiology. We present three different synthetically generated datasets with increasing complexity for training, using a Monte-Carlo Simulation application based on Geant4. On those datasets, we evaluate convolutional and fully connected architectures of neural networks to demonstrate which design decisions work well for reconstructing the fluence and spectra distributions over the spatial domain of such radiation fields. All our datasets, as well as our training pipeline, are published as open source in separate repositories.</description>
