      <title>Optimizing MV CBCT Imaging Protocols Using NTCP and Secondary Cancer Risk: A Multi-Site Study in Breast, Pelvic, and Head &amp; Neck Radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: To evaluate the cumulative radiobiological impact of daily Megavoltage Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (MV-CBCT) imaging dose based on Normal Tissue Complication Probability (NTCP) and Excess Absolute Risk (EAR) of secondary malignancies among radiotherapy patients treated for breast, pelvic, and head and neck cancers. This study investigated whether MV-CBCT imaging dose warrants protocol personalization according to patient age, anatomical treatment site, and organ-specific radiosensitivity.
  Methods: This retrospective study included cohorts of breast (n=30), pelvic (n=17), and head and neck (n=20) cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy with daily MV-CBCT. Imaging plans using two common protocols (5 MU and 10 MU per fraction) were analyzed. NTCP values were estimated using logistic and Lyman-Kutcher-Burman (LKB) models, while EAR was calculated using Schneider's Organ Equivalent Dose (OED)-based model. Statistical analysis used paired t-tests, and results were further stratified by age (under 40, 40 to 60, over 60 years).
  Results: In breast cancer patients, NTCP for lung increased significantly under the 10 MU protocol (p&lt;0.001). EAR was elevated in younger breast patients (under 40 years), with some exceeding 15 cases per 10,000 person-years. In pelvic and head and neck groups, NTCP and EAR remained low (under 1 percent), with no clinically meaningful differences between protocols. Across all sites, younger age correlated with higher secondary cancer risk.
  Conclusion: Daily 10 MU MV-CBCT presents minimal additional risk in pelvic and head and neck radiotherapy. For breast cancer patients under 40, however, it significantly increases secondary cancer risk and lung NTCP. Personalized imaging protocols are recommended based on age, treatment site, and radiosensitivity.</description>

      <title>A response matrix determined with a coincidence-based acquisition for correction of charge sharing spectral distortions in energy-resolved photon counting detectors</title>

Abstract: A model-independent method is proposed to characterize and correct charge sharing spectral distortions in energy-resolved X-ray acquisitions with pixellated photon-counting detectors. The technique is based on the determination of a coincidence-based response matrix (CBRM) through a preliminary calibration with a uniform irradiation and an arbitrary polychromatic spectrum. The calibration requires the collection of the number of coincidences between a reference pixel and its neighbours for different combinations of energy bins, in order to calculate a set of charge sharing probabilities which are independent of the input spectrum. A detector response matrix is determined, which can afterwards be applied to correct other spectra acquired with the same detector and a conventional multi-comparator electronics, without introducing penalties in terms of processing time. The technique was validated with Geant4 simulations of a 1 mm thick CdTe detector and with data collected with a pixel hybrid detector made of a 300 um thick silicon sensor coupled to a Timepix4 ASIC chip. The differences between the reconstructed spectra and reference distributions of an ideal detector or a 3x3 offline clustering algorithm were evaluated in terms of mean absolute percentage errors. It is demonstrated that the response matrix can restore the spectral information with a performance close to standard clustering algorithms and is less affected by noise artifacts than analog charge summing techniques.</description>

      <title>CPT-Interp: Continuous sPatial and Temporal Motion Modeling for 4D Medical Image Interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motion information from 4D medical imaging offers critical insights into dynamic changes in patient anatomy for clinical assessments and radiotherapy planning and, thereby, enhances the capabilities of 3D image analysis. However, inherent physical and technical constraints of imaging hardware often necessitate a compromise between temporal resolution and image quality. Frame interpolation emerges as a pivotal solution to this challenge. Previous methods often suffer from discretion when they estimate the intermediate motion and execute the forward warping. In this study, we draw inspiration from fluid mechanics to propose a novel approach for continuously modeling patient anatomic motion using implicit neural representation. It ensures both spatial and temporal continuity, effectively bridging Eulerian and Lagrangian specifications together to naturally facilitate continuous frame interpolation. Our experiments across multiple datasets underscore the method's superior accuracy and speed. Furthermore, as a case-specific optimization (training-free) approach, it circumvents the need for extensive datasets and addresses model generalization issues.</description>

      <title>Two-stage deep learning framework for the restoration of incomplete-ring PET images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00816v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is an important molecular imaging tool widely used in medicine. Traditional PET systems rely on complete detector rings for full angular coverage and reliable data collection. However, incomplete-ring PET scanners have emerged due to hardware failures, cost constraints, or specific clinical needs. Standard reconstruction algorithms often suffer from performance degradation with these systems because of reduced data completeness and geometric inconsistencies. We present a two-stage deep-learning framework that, without incorporating any time-of-flight (TOF) information, restores high-quality images from data with about 50% missing coincidences - double the loss levels previously addressed by CNN-based methods. The pipeline operates in two stages: a projection-domain Attention U-Net first predicts the missing sections of the sinogram by leveraging spatial context from neighbouring slices, after which the completed data are reconstructed with OSEM algorithm and passed to a U-Net-diffusion module that removes residual artefacts while reinstating high-frequency detail. Using 206 brain volumes from a public dataset, the result shows that our model successfully preserves most anatomical structures and tracer distribution features with PSNR of 30.92 dB and SSIM of 0.9708. We also achieve higher inference speed, thus providing an effective solution for incomplete-ring PET imaging.</description>
