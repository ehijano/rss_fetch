      <title>Precision Enhancement in Sustained Visual Attention Training Platforms: Offline EEG Signal Analysis for Classifier Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, a novel open-source brain-computer interface (BCI) platform was developed to decode scalp electroencephalography (EEG) signals associated with sustained attention. The EEG signal collection was conducted using a wireless headset during a sustained visual attention task, where participants were instructed to discriminate between composite images superimposed with scenes and faces, responding only to the relevant subcategory while ignoring the irrelevant ones. Seven volunteers participated in this experiment. The data collected were subjected to analyses through event-related potential (ERP), Hilbert Transform, and Wavelet Transform to extract temporal and spectral features. For each participant, utilizing its extracted features, personalized Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) models with tuned hyperparameters were developed. The models aimed to decode the participant's attentional state towards the face and scene stimuli. The SVM models achieved a higher average accuracy of 80\% and an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.86, while the RF models showed an average accuracy of 78\% and AUC of 0.8. This work suggests potential applications for the evaluation of visual attention and the development of closed-loop brainwave regulation systems in the future.</description>

      <title>Deep Representation Learning-Based Dynamic Trajectory Phenotyping for Acute Respiratory Failure in Medical Intensive Care Units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sepsis-induced acute respiratory failure (ARF) is a serious complication with a poor prognosis. This paper presents a deep representation learningbased phenotyping method to identify distinct groups of clinical trajectories of septic patients with ARF. For this retrospective study, we created a dataset from electronic medical records (EMR) consisting of data from sepsis patients admitted to medical intensive care units who required at least 24 hours of invasive mechanical ventilation at a quarternary care academic hospital in southeast USA for the years 2016-2021. A total of N=3349 patient encounters were included in this study. Clustering Representation Learning on Incomplete Time Series Data (CRLI) algorithm was applied to a parsimonious set of EMR variables in this data set. To validate the optimal number of clusters, the K-means algorithm was used in conjunction with dynamic time warping. Our model yielded four distinct patient phenotypes that were characterized as liver dysfunction/heterogeneous, hypercapnia, hypoxemia, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome by a critical care expert. A Kaplan-Meier analysis to compare the 28-day mortality trends exhibited significant differences (p &lt; 0.005) between the four phenotypes. The study demonstrates the utility of our deep representation learning-based approach in unraveling phenotypes that reflect the heterogeneity in sepsis-induced ARF in terms of different mortality outcomes and severity. These phenotypes might reveal important clinical insights into an effective prognosis and tailored treatment strategies.</description>

      <title>TiRE-GAN: Task-Incentivized Generative Learning Models for Radiomap Estimation with Radio Propagation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enriching geometric information on radio frequency (RF) signal power distribution in wireless communication systems, the radiomap has become an essential tool for resource allocation and network management. Usually, a dense radiomap is reconstructed from sparse observations collected by deployed sensors or mobile devices, which makes the radiomap estimation an urgent challenge. To leverage both physical principles of radio propagation models and data statistics from sparse observations, this work introduces a novel task-incentivized generative learning model, namely TiRE-GAN, for radiomap estimation. Specifically, we first introduce a radio depth map as input to capture the overall pattern of radio propagation and shadowing effects, following which a task-driven incentive network is proposed to provide feedback for radiomap compensation depending on downstream tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate the power of the radio depth map to capture radio propagation information, together with the efficiency of the proposed TiRE-GAN for radiomap estimation.</description>

      <title>EM-based Algorithm for Unsupervised Clustering of Measurements from a Radar Sensor Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with the problem of clustering data returned by a radar sensor network that monitors a region where multiple moving targets are present. The network is formed by nodes with limited functionalities that transmit the estimates of target positions (after a detection) to a fusion center without any association between measurements and targets. To solve the problem at hand, we resort to model-based learning algorithms and instead of applying the plain maximum likelihood approach, due to the related computational requirements, we exploit the latent variable model coupled with the expectation-maximization algorithm. The devised estimation procedure returns posterior probabilities that are used to cluster the huge amount of data collected by the fusion center. Remarkably, we also consider challenging scenarios with an unknown number of targets and estimate it by means of the model order selection rules. The clustering performance of the proposed strategy is compared to that of conventional data-driven methods over synthetic data. The numerical examples point out that the herein proposed solutions can provide reliable clustering performance overcoming the considered competitors.</description>

      <title>Zak-OTFS: Pulse Shaping and the Tradeoff between Time/Bandwidth Expansion and Predictability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Zak-OTFS input/output (I/O) relation is predictable and non-fading when the delay and Doppler periods are greater than the effective channel delay and Doppler spreads, a condition which we refer to as the crystallization condition. When the crystallization condition is satisfied, we describe how to integrate sensing and communication within a single Zak-OTFS subframe by transmitting a pilot in the center of the subframe and surrounding the pilot with a pilot region and guard band to mitigate interference between data symbols and pilot. At the receiver we first read off the effective channel taps within the pilot region, and then use the estimated channel taps to recover the data from the symbols received outside the pilot region. We introduce a framework for filter design in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain where the symplectic Fourier transform connects aliasing in the DD domain (predictability of the I/O relation) with time/bandwidth expansion. The choice of pulse shaping filter determines the fraction of pilot energy that lies outside the pilot region and the degradation in BER performance that results from the interference to data symbols. We demonstrate that Gaussian filters in the DD domain provide significant improvements in BER performance over the sinc and root raised cosine filters considered in previous work. We also demonstrate that, by limiting DD domain aliasing, Gaussian filters extend the region where the crystallization condition is satisfied. The Gaussian filters considered in this paper are a particular case of factorizable pulse shaping filters in the DD domain, and this family of filters may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Activity Detection for Massive Random Access using Covariance-based Matching Pursuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Internet of Things paradigm heavily relies on a network of a massive number of machine-type devices (MTDs) that monitor changes in various phenomena. Consequently, MTDs are randomly activated at different times whenever a change occurs. This essentially results in relatively few MTDs being active simultaneously compared to the entire network, resembling targeted sampling in compressed sensing. Therefore, signal recovery in machine-type communications is addressed through joint user activity detection and channel estimation algorithms built using compressed sensing theory. However, most of these algorithms follow a two-stage procedure in which a channel is first estimated and later mapped to find active users. This approach is inefficient because the estimated channel information is subsequently discarded. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel covariance-learning matching pursuit algorithm that bypasses explicit channel estimation. Instead, it focuses on estimating the indices of the active users greedily. Simulation results presented in terms of probability of miss detection, exact recovery rate, and computational complexity validate the proposed technique's superior performance and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Antenna Failure Resilience: Deep Learning-Enabled Robust DOA Estimation with Single Snapshot Sparse Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Deep Learning (DL) for Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation have highlighted its superiority over traditional methods, offering faster inference, enhanced super-resolution, and robust performance in low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) environments. Despite these advancements, existing research predominantly focuses on multi-snapshot scenarios, a limitation in the context of automotive radar systems which demand high angular resolution and often rely on limited snapshots, sometimes as scarce as a single snapshot. Furthermore, the increasing interest in sparse arrays for automotive radar, owing to their cost-effectiveness and reduced antenna element coupling, presents additional challenges including susceptibility to random sensor failures. This paper introduces a pioneering DL framework featuring a sparse signal augmentation layer, meticulously crafted to bolster single snapshot DOA estimation across diverse sparse array setups and amidst antenna failures. To our best knowledge, this is the first work to tackle this issue. Our approach improves the adaptability of deep learning techniques to overcome the unique difficulties posed by sparse arrays with single snapshot. We conduct thorough evaluations of our network's performance using simulated and real-world data, showcasing the efficacy and real-world viability of our proposed solution.

      <title>An Enhanced Dynamic Ray Tracing Architecture for Channel Prediction Based on Multipath Bidirectional Geometry and Field Extrapolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the development of sixth generation (6G) networks toward digitalization and intelligentization of communications, rapid and precise channel prediction is crucial for the network potential release. Interestingly, a dynamic ray tracing (DRT) approach for channel prediction has recently been proposed, which utilizes the results of traditional RT to extrapolate the multipath geometry evolution. However, both the priori environmental data and the regularity in multipath evolution can be further utilized. In this work, an enhanced-dynamic ray tracing (E-DRT) algorithm architecture based on multipath bidirectional extrapolation has been proposed. In terms of accuracy, all available environment information is utilized to predict the birth and death processes of multipath components (MPCs) through bidirectional geometry extrapolation. In terms of efficiency, bidirectional electric field extrapolation is employed based on the evolution regularity of the MPCs' electric field. The results in a Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) scenario show that E-DRT improves the accuracy of the channel prediction from 68.3% to 94.8% while reducing the runtime by 7.2% compared to DRT.</description>

      <title>Target Localization with Macro and Micro Base Stations Cooperative Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Addressing the communication and sensing demands of sixth-generation (6G) mobile communication system, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has garnered traction in academia and industry. With the sensing limitation of single base station (BS), multi-BS cooperative sensing is regarded as a promising solution. The coexistence and overlapped coverage of macro BS (MBS) and micro BS (MiBS) are common in the development of 6G, making the cooperative sensing between MBS and MiBS feasible. Since MBS and MiBS work in low and high frequency bands, respectively, the challenges of MBS and MiBS cooperative sensing lie in the fusion method of the sensing information in high and low-frequency bands. To this end, this paper introduces a symbol-level fusion method and a grid-based three-dimensional discrete Fourier transform (3D-GDFT) algorithm to achieve precise localization of multiple targets with limited resources. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MBS and MiBS cooperative sensing scheme outperforms traditional single BS (MBS/MiBS) sensing scheme, showcasing superior sensing performance</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Underwater Acoustic Channel Amid Jamming by Random Jammers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Underwater communication networks are increasingly popularized by various important maritime applications. However, this also leads to an increased threat landscape. This letter presents the first study that considers jamming attacks by random jammers present in the surroundings of legitimate transceivers in underwater acoustic communication systems. We investigate the impact of jamming attacks on various performance parameters of the legitimate underwater acoustic communication link. In particular, we investigate the legitimate link using stochastic geometry for important performance parameters, namely coverage probability, average rate, and energy efficiency of the link between two legitimate nodes, i.e., underwater and surface nodes. We then derive and present tractable expressions for these performance parameters. Finally, we performed a Monte Carlo simulation to validate our analysis. We plot the performance metrics against the transmit power, and jamming power for different intensities of the jammers in shallow, mid, and deep water scenarios. Results reveal that on average, jamming in deep water has a relatively high impact on the performance of legitimate link than in shallow water.</description>

      <title>Sparse Matrix Coding for URLLC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse Vector Coding (SVC) has long been considered an encoding method that meets the URLLC QOS requirements. This encoding method has been widely studied and applied due to its low encoding and decoding complexity, no pilot transmission, resistance to inter-carrier interference, and low power consumption. However, due to the use of position indexing, the encoding essentially reduces the signal-to-noise ratio requirements by increasing the communication bandwidth, which also leads to low encoding efficiency and strong rigidity in decoding. Based on the sparse representation characteristics of SVC, we propose a joint sparse representation encoding, namely Sparse Matrix Coding (SMC). This encoding method utilizes multi-user information joint encoding, and the sparsity and sparse locations between users are shared.</description>

      <title>Joint Discrete Precoding and RIS Optimization for RIS-Assisted MU-MIMO Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers a multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) system where the downlink communication between a base station (BS) and multiple user equipments (UEs) is aided by a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). We study the sum-rate maximization problem with the objective of finding the optimal precoding vectors and RIS configuration. Due to fronthaul limitation, each entry of the precoding vectors must be picked from a finite set of quantization labels. Furthermore, two scenarios for the RIS are investigated, one with continuous infinite-resolution reflection coefficients and another with discrete finite-resolution reflection coefficients. A novel framework is developed which, in contrast to the common literature that only offers sub-optimal solutions for optimization of discrete variables, is able to find the optimal solution to problems involving discrete constraints. Based on the classical weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE), we transform the original problem into an equivalent weighted sum mean square error (MSE) minimization problem and solve it iteratively. We compute the optimal precoding vectors via an efficient algorithm inspired by sphere decoding (SD). For optimizing the discrete RIS configuration, two solutions based on the SD algorithm are developed: An optimal SD-based algorithm and a low-complexity heuristic method that can efficiently obtain RIS configuration without much loss in optimality. The effectiveness of the presented algorithms is corroborated via numerical simulations where it is shown that the proposed designs are remarkably superior to the commonly used benchmarks.</description>

      <title>A Model-Free Kullback-Leibler Divergence Filter for Anomaly Detection in Noisy Data Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) filter to extract anomalies within data series generated by a broad class of proximity sensors, along with the anomaly locations and their relative sizes. The technique applies to devices commonly used in engineering practice, such as those mounted on mobile robots for non-destructive inspection of hazardous or other environments that may not be directly accessible to humans. The raw data generated by this class of sensors can be challenging to analyze due to the prevalence of noise over the signal content. The proposed filter is built to detect the difference of information content between data series collected by the sensor and baseline data series. It is applicable in a model-based or model-free context. The performance of the KLD filter is validated in an industrial-norm setup and benchmarked against a peer industrially-adopted algorithm.</description>

      <title>Active Sensing for Multiuser Beam Tracking with Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a beam tracking problem in which an access point (AP), in collaboration with a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), dynamically adjusts its downlink beamformers and the reflection pattern at the RIS in order to maintain reliable communications with multiple mobile user equipments (UEs). Specifically, the mobile UEs send uplink pilots to the AP periodically during the channel sensing intervals, the AP then adaptively configures the beamformers and the RIS reflection coefficients for subsequent data transmission based on the received pilots. This is an active sensing problem, because channel sensing involves configuring the RIS coefficients during the pilot stage and the optimal sensing strategy should exploit the trajectory of channel state information (CSI) from previously received pilots. Analytical solution to such an active sensing problem is very challenging. In this paper, we propose a deep learning framework utilizing a recurrent neural network (RNN) to automatically summarize the time-varying CSI obtained from the periodically received pilots into state vectors. These state vectors are then mapped to the AP beamformers and RIS reflection coefficients for subsequent downlink data transmissions, as well as the RIS reflection coefficients for the next round of uplink channel sensing. The mappings from the state vectors to the downlink beamformers and the RIS reflection coefficients for both channel sensing and downlink data transmission are performed using graph neural networks (GNNs) to account for the interference among the UEs. Simulations demonstrate significant and interpretable performance improvement of the proposed approach over the existing data-driven methods with nonadaptive channel sensing schemes.</description>

      <title>Computational Efficient Width-Wise Early Exits in Modulation Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) techniques are increasingly pervasive across various domains, including wireless communication, where they extract insights from raw radio signals. However, the computational demands of DL pose significant challenges, particularly in distributed wireless networks like Cell-free networks, where deploying DL models on edge devices becomes hard due to heightened computational loads. These computational loads escalate with larger input sizes, often correlating with improved model performance. To mitigate this challenge, Early Exiting (EE) techniques have been introduced in DL, primarily targeting the depth of the model. This approach enables models to exit during inference based on specified criteria, leveraging entropy measures at intermediate exits. Doing so makes less complex samples exit early, reducing computational load and inference time. In our contribution, we propose a novel width-wise exiting strategy for Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based architectures. By selectively adjusting the input size, we aim to regulate computational demands effectively. Our approach aims to decrease the average computational load during inference while maintaining performance levels comparable to conventional models. We specifically investigate Modulation Classification, a well-established application of DL in wireless communication. Our experimental results show substantial reductions in computational load, with an average decrease of 28%, and particularly notable reductions of 65% in high-SNR scenarios. Through this work, we present a practical solution for reducing computational demands in deep learning applications, particularly within the domain of wireless communication.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of Industry 4.0, smart factories have emerged as a paradigm shift, redefining manufacturing with the integration of advanced digital technologies. Central to this transformation is the deployment of 5G networks, offering unprecedented levels of connectivity, speed, reliability, and ultra-low latency. Among the revolutionary features of 5G is network slicing, a technology that offers enhanced capabilities through the customization of network resources by allowing multiple logical networks (or slices) to run on top of a shared physical infrastructure. This capability is particularly crucial in the densely packed and highly dynamic environment of smart factories, where diverse applications - from robotic automation to real-time analytics - demand varying network requirements. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of the integration of slicing in smart factory networks, emphasizing its critical role in enhancing operational efficiency and supporting the diverse requirements of future manufacturing processes. We elaborate on the recent advances, and technical scenarios, including indoor factory propagation conditions, traffic characteristics, system requirements, slice-aware radio resource management, network elements, enabling technologies and current standardisation efforts. Additionally, we identify open research challenges as well as key technical issues stifling deployments. Finally, we speculate on the future trajectory of slicing-enabled smart factories, emphasizing the need for continuous adaptation to emerging technologies.</description>

      <title>Distributed Adaptive Spatial Filtering with Inexact Local Solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Distributed Adaptive Signal Fusion (DASF) framework is a meta-algorithm for computing data-driven spatial filters in a distributed sensing platform with limited bandwidth and computational resources, such as a wireless sensor network. The convergence and optimality of the DASF algorithm has been extensively studied under the assumption that an exact, but possibly impractical solver for the local optimization problem at each updating node is available. In this work, we provide convergence and optimality results for the DASF framework when used with an inexact, finite-time solver such as (proximal) gradient descent or Newton's method. We provide sufficient conditions that the solver should satisfy in order to guarantee convergence of the resulting algorithm, and a lower bound for the convergence rate. We also provide numerical simulations to validate these theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Channel Estimation in Quantized Systems with a Generative Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel estimation in quantized systems is challenging, particularly in low-resolution systems. In this work, we propose to leverage a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) as generative prior, capturing the channel distribution of the propagation environment, to enhance a classical estimation technique based on the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for one-bit quantization. Thereby, a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the most responsible mixture component is inferred for a quantized received signal, which is subsequently utilized in the EM algorithm as side information. Numerical results demonstrate the significant performance improvement of our proposed approach over both a simplistic Gaussian prior and current state-of-the-art channel estimators. Furthermore, the proposed estimation framework exhibits adaptability to higher resolution systems and alternative generative priors.</description>

      <title>Improving the Ranging Performance of Random ISAC Signals Through Pulse Shaping Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel pulse shaping design for single-carrier integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) transmission. Due to the communication information embedded in the ISAC signal, the resulting auto-correlation function (ACF) is determined by both the information-conveying random symbol sequence and the signaling pulse, where the former leads to random fluctuations in the sidelobes of the ACF, impairing the range estimation performance. To overcome this challenge, we first analyze the statistical characteristics of the random ACF under the symbol-wise pulse shaping (SWPS) regime. As a step further, we formulate an optimization problem to design ISAC pulse shaping filters, which minimizes the average integrated sidelobe level ratio (ISLR) while meeting the Nyquist criterion, subject to power and bandwidth constraints. We then show that the problem can be recast as a convex quadratic program by expressing it in the frequency domain, which can be readily solved through standard tools. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed pulse shaping design achieves substantial ranging sidelobe reduction compared to the celebrated root-raised cosine (RRC) pulse shaping, given that the communication throughput is unchanged.</description>

      <title>Energy-Based Optimization of Physical-Layer Challenge-Response Authentication with Drones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drones are expected to be used for many tasks in the future and require secure communication protocols. In this work, we propose a novel physical layer authentication (PLA)-based challenge-response (CR) protocol in which a drone Bob authenticates the sender (either on the ground or air) by exploiting his prior knowledge of the wireless channel statistic (fading, path loss, and shadowing). In particular, Bob will move to a set of positions in the space, and by estimating the attenuations of the received signals he will authenticate the sender. We take into account the energy consumption in the design and provide three solutions: a purely greedy solution (PG), an optimal Bellman iterative solution (BI), and a heuristic solution based on the evaluation of the standard deviation of the attenuations in the space. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Distributed Estimation in Blockchain-aided Internet of Things in the Presence of Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed estimation in a blockchain-aided Internet of Things (BIoT) is considered, where the integrated blockchain secures data exchanges across the BIoT and the storage of data at BIoT agents. This paper focuses on developing a performance guarantee for the distributed estimation in a BIoT in the presence of malicious attacks which jointly exploits vulnerabilities present in both IoT devices and the employed blockchain within the BIoT. To achieve this, we adopt the Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB) as the performance metric, and maximize the CRB for estimating the parameter of interest over the attack domain. However, the maximization problem is inherently non-convex, making it infeasible to obtain the globally optimal solution in general. To address this issue, we develop a relaxation method capable of transforming the original non-convex optimization problem into a convex optimization problem. Moreover, we derive the analytical expression for the optimal solution to the relaxed optimization problem. The optimal value of the relaxed optimization problem can be used to provide a valid estimation performance guarantee for the BIoT in the presence of attacks.</description>

      <title>Fault Detection and Monitoring using an Information-Driven Strategy: Method, Theory, and Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to detect when a system undergoes an incipient fault is of paramount importance in preventing a critical failure. In this work, we propose an information-driven fault detection method based on a novel concept drift detector. The method is tailored to identifying drifts in input-output relationships of additive noise models (i.e., model drifts) and is based on a distribution-free mutual information (MI) estimator. Our scheme does not require prior faulty examples and can be applied distribution-free over a large class of system models. Our core contributions are twofold. First, we demonstrate the connection between fault detection, model drift detection, and testing independence between two random variables. Second, we prove several theoretical properties of the proposed MI-based fault detection scheme: (i) strong consistency, (ii) exponentially fast detection of the non-faulty case, and (iii) control of both significance levels and power of the test. To conclude, we validate our theory with synthetic data and the benchmark dataset N-CMAPSS of aircraft turbofan engines. These empirical results support the usefulness of our methodology in many practical and realistic settings, and the theoretical results show performance guarantees that other methods cannot offer.</description>

      <title>CNN-Based Equalization for Communications: Achieving Gigabit Throughput with a Flexible FPGA Hardware Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To satisfy the growing throughput demand of data-intensive applications, the performance of optical communication systems increased dramatically in recent years. With higher throughput, more advanced equalizers are crucial, to compensate for impairments caused by inter-symbol interference (ISI). The latest research shows that artificial neural network (ANN)-based equalizers are promising candidates to replace traditional algorithms for high-throughput communications. On the other hand, not only throughput but also flexibility is a main objective of beyond-5G and 6G communication systems. A platform that is able to satisfy the strict throughput and flexibility requirements of modern communication systems are field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). Thus, in this work, we present a high-performance FPGA implementation of an ANN-based equalizer, which meets the throughput requirements of modern optical communication systems. Further, our architecture is highly flexible since it includes a variable degree of parallelism (DOP) and therefore can also be applied to low-cost or low-power applications which is demonstrated for a magnetic recording channel. The implementation is based on a cross-layer design approach featuring optimizations from the algorithm down to the hardware architecture, including a detailed quantization analysis. Moreover, we present a framework to reduce the latency of the ANN-based equalizer under given throughput constraints. As a result, the bit error ratio (BER) of our equalizer for the optical fiber channel is around four times lower than that of a conventional one, while the corresponding FPGA implementation achieves a throughput of more than 40 GBd, outperforming a high-performance graphics processing unit (GPU) by three orders of magnitude for a similar batch size.</description>

      <title>Neuromorphic Correlates of Artificial Consciousness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of neural correlates of consciousness (NCC), which suggests that specific neural activities are linked to conscious experiences, has gained widespread acceptance. This acceptance is based on a wealth of evidence from experimental studies, brain imaging techniques such as fMRI and EEG, and theoretical frameworks like integrated information theory (IIT) within neuroscience and the philosophy of mind. This paper explores the potential for artificial consciousness by merging neuromorphic design and architecture with brain simulations. It proposes the Neuromorphic Correlates of Artificial Consciousness (NCAC) as a theoretical framework. While the debate on artificial consciousness remains contentious due to our incomplete grasp of consciousness, this work may raise eyebrows and invite criticism. Nevertheless, this optimistic and forward-thinking approach is fueled by insights from the Human Brain Project, advancements in brain imaging like EEG and fMRI, and recent strides in AI and computing, including quantum and neuromorphic designs. Additionally, this paper outlines how machine learning can play a role in crafting artificial consciousness, aiming to realise machine consciousness and awareness in the future.</description>

      <title>Interleave Frequency Division Multiplexing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we study interleave frequency division multiplexing (IFDM) for multicarrier modulation in static multipath and mobile time-varying channels, which outperforms orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS), and affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) by considering practical advanced detectors. The fundamental principle underlying existing modulation techniques is to establish sparse equivalent channel matrices in order to facilitate the design of low-complexity detection algorithms for signal recovery, making a trade-off between performance and implementation complexity. In contrast, the proposed IFDM establishes an equivalent fully dense and right-unitarily invariant channel matrix with the goal of achieving channel capacity, ensuring that the signals undergo sufficient statistical channel fading. Meanwhile, a low-complexity and replica maximum a posteriori (MAP)-optimal cross-domain memory approximate message passing (CD-MAMP) detector is proposed for IFDM by exploiting the sparsity of the time-domain channel and the unitary invariance in interleave-frequency-domain channel. Numerical results show that IFDM with extremely low-complexity CD-MAMP outperforms OFDM, OTFS, and AFDM with state-of-the-art orthogonal approximate message passing detectors, particularly at low velocities.</description>

      <title>AFDM Channel Estimation in Multi-Scale Multi-Lag Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing (AFDM) is a brand new chirp-based multi-carrier (MC) waveform for high mobility communications, with promising advantages over Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) and other MC waveforms. Existing AFDM research focuses on wireless communication at high carrier frequency (CF), which typically considers only Doppler frequency shift (DFS) as a result of mobility, while ignoring the accompanied Doppler time scaling (DTS) on waveform. However, for underwater acoustic (UWA) communication at much lower CF and propagating at speed of sound, the DTS effect could not be ignored and poses significant challenges for channel estimation. This paper analyzes the channel frequency response (CFR) of AFDM under multi-scale multi-lag (MSML) channels, where each propagating path could have different delay and DFS/DTS. Based on the newly derived input-output formula and its characteristics, two new channel estimation methods are proposed, i.e., AFDM with iterative multi-index (AFDM-IMI) estimation under low to moderate DTS, and AFDM with orthogonal matching pursuit (AFDM-OMP) estimation under high DTS. Numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed methods against the original AFDM channel estimation method. Moreover, the resulted AFDM system outperforms OFDM as well as Orthogonal Chirp Division Multiplexing (OCDM) in terms of channel estimation accuracy and bit error rate (BER), which is consistent with our theoretical analysis based on CFR overlap probability (COP), mutual incoherent property (MIP) and channel diversity gain under MSML channels.</description>

      <title>Spider RIS: Mobilizing Intelligent Surfaces for Enhanced Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce Spider RIS technology, which offers an innovative solution to the challenges encountered in movable antennas (MAs) and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled communication systems. By combining the dynamic adaptation capability of MAs and the flexible location advantages of UAVs, this technology offers a dynamic and movable RIS, which can flexibly optimize physical locations within the two-dimensional movement platform. Spider RIS aims to enhance the communication efficiency and reliability of wireless networks, particularly in obstructive environments, by elevating the signal quality and achievable rate. The motivation of Spider RIS is based on the ability to fully exploit the spatial variability of wireless channels and maximize channel capacity even with a limited number of reflecting elements by overcoming the limitations of traditional fixed RIS and energy-intensive UAV systems. Considering the geometry-based millimeter wave channel model, we present the design of a three-stage angular-based hybrid beamforming system empowered by Spider RIS: First, analog beamformers are designed using angular information, followed by the generation of digital precoder/combiner based on the effective channel observed from baseband stage. Subsequently, the joint dynamic positioning with phase shift design of the Spider RIS is optimized using particle swarm optimization, maximizing the achievable rate of the systems.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Massive MIMO: Precoding Design and Channel Estimation in the Electromagnetic Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable massive multiple-input multiple-output (RmMIMO) technology offers increased flexibility for future communication systems by exploiting previously untapped degrees of freedom in the electromagnetic (EM) domain. The representation of the traditional spatial domain channel state information (sCSI) limits the insights into the potential of EM domain channel properties, constraining the base station's (BS) utmost capability for precoding design. This paper leverages the EM domain channel state information (eCSI) for radiation pattern design at the BS. We develop an orthogonal decomposition method based on spherical harmonic functions to decompose the radiation pattern into a linear combination of orthogonal bases. By formulating the radiation pattern design as an optimization problem for the projection coefficients over these bases, we develop a manifold optimization-based method for iterative radiation pattern and digital precoder design. To address the eCSI estimation problem, we capitalize on the inherent structure of the channel. Specifically, we propose a subspace-based scheme to reduce the pilot overhead for wideband sCSI estimation. Given the estimated full-band sCSI, we further employ parameterized methods for angle of arrival estimation. Subsequently, the complete eCSI can be reconstructed after estimating the equivalent channel gain via the least squares method. Simulation results demonstrate that, in comparison to traditional mMIMO systems with fixed antenna radiation patterns, the proposed RmMIMO architecture offers significant throughput gains for multi-user transmission at a low channel estimation overhead.</description>

      <title>Optimal Signals and Detectors Based on Correlation and Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In continuation of an earlier study, we explore a Neymann-Pearson hypothesis testing scenario where, under the null hypothesis ($\cal{H}_0$), the received signal is a white noise process $N_t$, which is not Gaussian in general, and under the alternative hypothesis ($\cal{H}_1$), the received signal comprises a deterministic transmitted signal $s_t$ corrupted by additive white noise, the sum of $N_t$ and another noise process originating from the transmitter, denoted as $Z_t$, which is not necessarily Gaussian either. Our approach focuses on detectors that are based on the correlation and energy of the received signal, which are motivated by implementation simplicity. We optimize the detector parameters to achieve the best trade-off between missed-detection and false-alarm error exponents. First, we optimize the detectors for a given signal, resulting in a non-linear relation between the signal and correlator weights to be optimized. Subsequently, we optimize the transmitted signal and the detector parameters jointly, revealing that the optimal signal is a balanced ternary signal and the correlator has at most three different coefficients, thus facilitating a computationally feasible solution.</description>

      <title>Over-the-Air Majority Vote Computation with Modulation on Conjugate-Reciprocal Zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a new approach to compute the majority vote (MV) function based on modulation on conjugate-reciprocal zeros (MOCZ) and introduce three different methods. The proposed methods rely on the fact that when a linear combination of polynomials is evaluated at one of the roots of a polynomial in the combination, that polynomial does contribute to the evaluation. To utilize this property, each transmitter maps the votes to the zeros of a Huffman polynomial, and the corresponding polynomial coefficients are transmitted. The receiver evaluates the polynomial constructed by the elements of the superposed sequence at conjugate-reciprocal zero pairs and detects the MV with a direct zero-testing (DiZeT) decoder. With differential and index-based encoders, we eliminate the need for power-delay information at the receiver while improving the computation error rate (CER) performance. The proposed methods do not use instantaneous channel state information at the transmitters and receiver. Thus, they provide robustness against phase and time synchronization errors. We theoretically analyze the CERs of the proposed methods. Finally, we demonstrate their efficacy in a distributed median computation scenario in a fading channel.</description>

      <title>DAFT-Spread Affine Frequency Division Multiple Access for Downlink Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) and orthogonal AFDM access (O-AFDMA) are promising techniques based on chirp signals, which are able to suppress the performance deterioration caused by Doppler shifts in high-mobility scenarios. However, the high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) in AFDM or O-AFDMA is still a crucial problem, which severely limits their practical applications. In this paper, we propose a discrete affine Fourier transform (DAFT)-spread AFDMA scheme based on the properties of the AFDM systems, named DAFT-s-AFDMA to significantly reduce the PAPR by resorting to the DAFT. We formulate the transmitted time-domain signals of the proposed DAFT-s-AFDMA schemes with localized and interleaved chirp subcarrier allocation strategies. Accordingly, we derive the guidelines for setting the DAFT parameters, revealing the insights of PAPR reduction. Finally, simulation results of PAPR comparison in terms of the complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) show that the proposed DAFT-s-AFDMA schemes with localized and interleaved strategies can both attain better PAPR performances than the conventional O-AFDMA scheme.</description>

      <title>Infrared Polarization Imaging-based Non-destructive Thermography Inspection</title>

Abstract: Infrared pulse thermography non-destructive testing (NDT) method is developed based on the difference in the infrared radiation intensity emitted by defective and non-defective areas of an object. However, when the radiation intensity of the defective target is similar to that of the non-defective area of the object, the detection results are poor. To address this issue, this study investigated the polarization characteristics of the infrared radiation of different materials. Simulation results showed that the degree of infrared polarization of the object surface changed regularly with changes in thermal environment radiation. An infrared polarization imaging-based NDT method was proposed and demonstrated using specimens with four different simulated defective areas, which were designed and fabricated using four different materials. The experimental results were consistent with the simulation results, thereby proving the effectiveness of the proposed method. Compared with the infrared-radiation-intensity-based NDT method, the proposed method improved the image detail presentation and detection accuracy.</description>

      <title>Active RIS-Aided Massive MIMO With Imperfect CSI and Phase Noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has attracted significant attention as a recently proposed RIS architecture. Owing to its capability to amplify the incident signals, active RIS can mitigate the multiplicative fading effect inherent in the passive RIS-aided system. In this paper, we consider an active RIS-aided uplink multi-user massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system in the presence of phase noise at the active RIS. Specifically, we employ a two-timescale scheme, where the beamforming at the base station (BS) is adjusted based on the instantaneous aggregated channel state information (CSI) and the statistical CSI serves as the basis for designing the phase shifts at the active RIS, so that the feedback overhead and computational complexity can be significantly reduced. The aggregated channel composed of the cascaded and direct channels is estimated by utilizing the linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) technique. Based on the estimated channel, we derive the analytical closed-form expression of a lower bound of the achievable rate. The power scaling laws in the active RIS-aided system are investigated based on the theoretical expressions. When the transmit power of each user is scaled down by the number of BS antennas M or reflecting elements N, we find that the thermal noise will cause the lower bound of the achievable rate to approach zero, as the number of M or N increases to infinity. Moreover, an optimization approach based on genetic algorithms (GA) is introduced to tackle the phase shift optimization problem. Numerical results reveal that the active RIS can greatly enhance the performance of the considered system under various settings.</description>

      <title>Denoising of Geodetic Time Series Using Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks: Application to Slow Slip Event Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geospatial data has been transformative for the monitoring of the Earth, yet, as in the case of (geo)physical monitoring, the measurements can have variable spatial and temporal sampling and may be associated with a significant level of perturbations degrading the signal quality. Denoising geospatial data is, therefore, essential, yet often challenging because the observations may comprise noise coming from different origins, including both environmental signals and instrumental artifacts, which are spatially and temporally correlated, thus hard to disentangle. This study addresses the denoising of multivariate time series acquired by irregularly distributed networks of sensors, requiring specific methods to handle the spatiotemporal correlation of the noise and the signal of interest. Specifically, our method focuses on the denoising of geodetic position time series, used to monitor ground displacement worldwide with centimeter- to-millimeter precision. Among the signals affecting GNSS data, slow slip events (SSEs) are of interest to seismologists. These are transients of deformation that are weakly emerging compared to other signals. Here, we design SSEdenoiser, a multi-station spatiotemporal graph-based attentive denoiser that learns latent characteristics of GNSS noise to reveal SSE-related displacement with sub-millimeter precision. It is based on the key combination of graph recurrent networks and spatiotemporal Transformers. The proposed method is applied to the Cascadia subduction zone, where SSEs occur along with bursts of tectonic tremors, a seismic rumbling identified from independent seismic recordings. The extracted events match the spatiotemporal evolution of tremors. This good space-time correlation of the denoised GNSS signals with the tremors validates the proposed denoising procedure.</description>

      <title>Fully Reversing the Shoebox Image Source Method: From Impulse Responses to Room Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an algorithm that fully reverses the shoebox image source method (ISM), a popular and widely used room impulse response (RIR) simulator for cuboid rooms introduced by Allen and Berkley in 1979. More precisely, given a discrete multichannel RIR generated by the shoebox ISM for a microphone array of known geometry, the algorithm reliably recovers the 18 input parameters. These are the 3D source position, the 3 dimensions of the room, the 6-degrees-of-freedom room translation and orientation, and an absorption coefficient for each of the 6 room boundaries. The approach builds on a recently proposed gridless image source localization technique combined with new procedures for room axes recovery and first-order-reflection identification. Extensive simulated experiments reveal that near-exact recovery of all parameters is achieved for a 32-element, 8.4-cm-wide spherical microphone array and a sampling rate of 16~kHz using fully randomized input parameters within rooms of size 2X2X2 to 10X10X5 meters. Estimation errors decay towards zero when increasing the array size and sampling rate. The method is also shown to strongly outperform a known baseline, and its ability to extrapolate RIRs at new positions is demonstrated. Crucially, the approach is strictly limited to low-passed discrete RIRs simulated using the vanilla shoebox ISM. Nonetheless, it represents to our knowledge the first algorithmic demonstration that this difficult inverse problem is in-principle fully solvable over a wide range of configurations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2006.11360v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radars operating at 79GHz are compact, light and cost effective devices with low peak-to-average power ratio that have applications in different areas such as automotive industry and Unmanned Arial Vehicle (UAV) based radar imaging. In order to keep the structure small and simple, these radars come with small number of transmitters and receivers. The number of elements can be virtually increased using techniques such as Time Division Multiplexing (TDM), Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) or Code Division Multiplexing (CDM) and as a result higher angular resolution can be achieved. Both TDM and FDM based virtual FMCW MIMO radar imaging process have been reported in literature. However, to the best of our knowledge CDM based virtual FMCW MIMO radar has not received any attention. In this paper we will be using an 79GHz FMCW MIMO radar and apply the idea of the CDM method to increase the number of elements virtually which in turn enhances the angular resolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.00841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An innovative millimeter-wave (mm-wave) microstrip edge-fed antenna (EFA) for 77 GHz automotive radars is proposed. The radiator contour is modeled with a sinusoidal spline-shaped (SS) profile characterized by a reduced number of geometrical descriptors, but still able to guarantee a high flexibility in the modeling for fulfilling challenging user-defined requirements. The SS-EFA descriptors are effectively and efficiently optimized with a customized implementation of the System-by-Design (SbD) paradigm. The synthesized EFA layout, integrated within a linear arrangement of identical replicas to account for the integration into the real radar system, exhibits suitable impedance matching, isolation, polarization purity, and stability of the beam shaping/pointing within the target band [76:78][GHz]. The experimental assessment, carried out with a Compact Antenna Test Range (CATR) system on a printed circuit board (PCB)-manufactured prototype, assess the reliability of the outcomes from the full-wave (FW) simulations as well as the suitability of the synthesized SS-EFA for automotive radars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Next-generation cellular technologies, commonly referred to as the 6G, are envisioned to support a higher system capacity, better performance, and network sensing capabilities. The THz band is one potential enabler to this end due to the large unused frequency bands and the high spatial resolution enabled by the short signal wavelength and large bandwidth. Different from earlier surveys, this paper presents a comprehensive treatment and technology survey on THz communications and sensing in terms of advantages, applications, propagation characterization, channel modeling, measurement campaigns, antennas, transceiver devices, beamforming, networking, the integration of communications and sensing, and experimental testbeds. Starting from the motivation and use cases, we survey the development and historical perspective of THz communications and sensing with the anticipated 6G requirements. We explore the radio propagation, channel modeling, and measurement for the THz band. The transceiver requirements, architectures, technological challenges, and state-of-the-art approaches to compensate for the high propagation losses, including appropriate antenna design and beamforming solutions. We overview several related technologies that either are required by or are beneficial for THz systems and networks. The synergistic design of sensing and communications is explored in depth. Practical trials, demonstrations, and experiments are also summarized. The paper gives a holistic view of the current state of the art and highlights the open research challenges towards 6G and beyond.</description>

Abstract: Optically-transparent opportunistic electromagnetic skins (OTO-EMSs) are proposed to enable outdoor-to-indoor (O2I) millimiter-wave (mmW) wireless communications with existing windows/glass-panels. More in detail, static passive EMSs consisting of optically-transparent conducting patterned layers attached to standard glass-panels are designed. Towards this end, both the phase coverage and the optical transparency of a meshed copper-based meta-atom printed on a non-dedicated insulated glass substrate are optimized. Successively, the feasibility of OTO-EMSs able to support mmW high-efficiency O2I transmissions along non-Snell refraction directions is numerically demonstrated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07169v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological Signal Processing (TSP) utilizes simplicial complexes to model structures with higher order than vertices and edges. In this paper, we study the transferability of TSP via a generalized higher-order version of graphon, known as complexon. We recall the notion of a complexon as the limit of a simplicial complex sequence [1]. Inspired by the graphon shift operator and message-passing neural network, we construct a marginal complexon and complexon shift operator (CSO) according to components of all possible dimensions from the complexon. We investigate the CSO's eigenvalues and eigenvectors and relate them to a new family of weighted adjacency matrices. We prove that when a simplicial complex signal sequence converges to a complexon signal, the eigenvalues, eigenspaces, and Fourier transform of the corresponding CSOs converge to that of the limit complexon signal. This conclusion is further verified by two numerical experiments. These results hint at learning transferability on large simplicial complexes or simplicial complex sequences, which generalize the graphon signal processing framework.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot ECG Classification with Multimodal Learning and Test-time Clinical Knowledge Enhancement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electrocardiograms (ECGs) are non-invasive diagnostic tools crucial for detecting cardiac arrhythmic diseases in clinical practice. While ECG Self-supervised Learning (eSSL) methods show promise in representation learning from unannotated ECG data, they often overlook the clinical knowledge that can be found in reports. This oversight and the requirement for annotated samples for downstream tasks limit eSSL's versatility. In this work, we address these issues with the Multimodal ECG Representation Learning (MERL}) framework. Through multimodal learning on ECG records and associated reports, MERL is capable of performing zero-shot ECG classification with text prompts, eliminating the need for training data in downstream tasks. At test time, we propose the Clinical Knowledge Enhanced Prompt Engineering (CKEPE) approach, which uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to exploit external expert-verified clinical knowledge databases, generating more descriptive prompts and reducing hallucinations in LLM-generated content to boost zero-shot classification. Based on MERL, we perform the first benchmark across six public ECG datasets, showing the superior performance of MERL compared against eSSL methods. Notably, MERL achieves an average AUC score of 75.2% in zero-shot classification (without training data), 3.2% higher than linear probed eSSL methods with 10\% annotated training data, averaged across all six datasets.</description>

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a well-studied field with research dating back to the 1980s. Over time, HAR technologies have evolved significantly from manual feature extraction, rule-based algorithms, and simple machine learning models to powerful deep learning models, from one sensor type to a diverse array of sensing modalities. The scope has also expanded from recognising a limited set of activities to encompassing a larger variety of both simple and complex activities. However, there still exist many challenges that hinder advancement in complex activity recognition using modern deep learning methods. In this paper, we comprehensively systematise factors leading to inaccuracy in complex HAR, such as data variety and model capacity. Among many sensor types, we give more attention to wearable and camera due to their prevalence. Through this Systematisation of Knowledge (SoK) paper, readers can gain a solid understanding of the development history and existing challenges of HAR, different categorisations of activities, obstacles in deep learning-based complex HAR that impact accuracy, and potential research directions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In vibration-based condition monitoring, optimal filter design improves fault detection by enhancing weak fault signatures within vibration signals. This process involves optimising a derived objective function from a defined objective. The objectives are often based on proxy health indicators to determine the filter's parameters. However, these indicators can be compromised by irrelevant extraneous signal components and fluctuating operational conditions, affecting the filter's efficacy. Fault detection primarily uses the fault component's prominence in the squared envelope spectrum, quantified by a squared envelope spectrum-based signal-to-noise ratio. New optimal filter objective functions are derived from the proposed generalised envelope spectrum-based signal-to-noise objective for machines operating under variable speed conditions. Instead of optimising proxy health indicators, the optimal filter coefficients of the formulation directly maximise the squared envelope spectrum-based signal-to-noise ratio over targeted frequency bands using standard gradient-based optimisers. Four derived objective functions from the proposed objective effectively outperform five prominent methods in tests on three experimental datasets.</description>

Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has been widely studied in recent years, it has emerged as a new technology which can reflect the incident signal by intelligently configuring the reflection elements, thus changing the signal propagation environment, enhancing the signals users desire and suppressing the interference between users. In this paper, we study an IRS aided multi-users wireless communication where the base station (BS) sends a variety of signals, each user receives desired signals. In order to guarantee the fairness of wireless communications, we need to maximize the minimum rates of users, subject to the power constraint of BS and the phase constraint of IRS. Prior works on IRS mainly consider optimizing BS beamforming and IRS passive beamforming, this paper also aims to optimize the IRS location. The considered problem is shown to be non-convex, we decompose the problem into two subproblems, transforming the two subproblems into a lower bound problem and using alternating optimization (AO) and successive convex approximation (SCA) to solve them, respectively. Finally, the two subproblems are optimized alternately to make the objective function value converge in an acceptable range. Simulation results verify the convergence results of our proposed algorithm, and the performance improvement compared with the benchmark scheme in wireless communication system.</description>

      <title>Generalized Forgetting Recursive Least Squares: Stability and Robustness Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04259v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents generalized forgetting recursive least squares (GF-RLS), a generalization of recursive least squares (RLS) that encompasses many extensions of RLS as special cases. First, sufficient conditions are presented for the 1) Lyapunov stability, 2) uniform Lyapunov stability, 3) global asymptotic stability, and 4) global uniform exponential stability of parameter estimation error in GF-RLS when estimating fixed parameters without noise. Second, robustness guarantees are derived for the estimation of time-varying parameters in the presence of measurement noise and regressor noise. These robustness guarantees are presented in terms of global uniform ultimate boundedness of the parameter estimation error. A specialization of this result gives a bound to the asymptotic bias of least squares estimators in the errors-in-variables problem. Lastly, a survey is presented to show how GF-RLS can be used to analyze various extensions of RLS from the literature.</description>

      <title>Resource Allocation in STAR-RIS-Aided SWIPT with RSMA via Meta-Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07644v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) is a cutting-edge concept for the sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. In this paper, we propose a novel system that incorporates STAR-RIS with simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) using rate splitting multiple access (RSMA). The proposed system facilitates communication from a multi-antenna base station (BS) to single-antenna users in a downlink transmission. The BS concurrently sends energy and information signals to multiple energy harvesting receivers (EHRs) and information data receivers (IDRs) with the support of a deployed STAR-RIS. Furthermore, an optimization is introduced to strike a balance between users' sum rate and the total harvested energy. To achieve this, an optimization problem is formulated to optimize the energy/information beamforming vectors at the BS, the phase shifts at the STAR-RIS, and the common message rate. Subsequently, we employ a meta deep deterministic policy gradient (Meta-DDPG) approach to solve the complex problem. Simulation results validate that the proposed algorithm significantly enhances both data rate and harvested energy in comparison to conventional DDPG.</description>

      <title>On the convergence of Block Majorization-Minimization algorithms on the Grassmann Manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Majorization-Minimization (MM) framework is widely used to derive efficient algorithms for specific problems that require the optimization of a cost function (which can be convex or not). It is based on a sequential optimization of a surrogate function over closed convex sets. A natural extension of this framework incorporates ideas of Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) algorithms into the MM framework, also known as block MM. The rationale behind the block extension is to partition the optimization variables into several independent blocks, to obtain a surrogate for each block, and to optimize the surrogate of each block cyclically. The advantage of the block MM is that the construction and successive optimization of the surrogate functions is potentially easier than with the non-block alternative. The purpose of this letter is to exploit the geometrical properties of the Grassmann manifold (a non-convex set) for the purpose of extending classical convergence proofs of the block MM when at least one of the blocks is constrained in this manifold.</description>
