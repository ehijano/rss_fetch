      <title>Observation and Interpretation of Field Emission Saturation Induced by an Ultra-fast Intense Terahertz Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Field emission under ultra-fast intense terahertz fields provides a promising approach for generating electron bunches with ultrashort pulse duration and high charge densities. It is generally believed that the field emission current described by traditional field emission theory increases dramatically with the applied electric field. However, we conducted extensive field emission experiments using quasi-single-cycle strong-field terahertz radiation at various energy levels and different temperatures and observed an intriguing phenomenon where the emitted charge reached saturation. A novel model is proposed to interpret this phenomenon, which considers the contribution of surface valence electrons and the dynamic replenishment of free electrons from the bulk to the surface. The experimentally observed convex relationship between the emitted charge and terahertz energy is consistent with the model prediction, unlike the concave relationship derived from the traditional field emission formula. In addition, another observed counter-intuitive phenomenon, the inverse correlation between the cathode temperature and saturated emission charge, is also well interpreted by the model. This work offers comprehensive insights into field emission dynamics under ultra-fast intense fields, paving the way for generating electron bunches with unprecedented temporal resolution.</description>

      <title>Study of the transfer and matching line for a PWFA-driven FEL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of compact accelerator facilities providing high-brightness beams is one of the most challenging tasks in the field of next-generation compact and cost affordable particle accelerators. Recent results obtained at SPARC\_LAB show evidence of the FEL laser by a compact (3 cm) particle driven plasma-based accelerator. This work is carried out in the framework of the SPARC\_LAB activities concerning the R$\&amp;$D on plasma wakefield accelerators for the realization of new compact plasma based facilities, i.e EuPRAXIA@SPARC\_LAB. The work here presented is a theoretical study demonstrating a possible scheme concerning the implementation of an innovative array of discharge capillaries, operating as active-plasma lenses, and one collimator to build an unconventional transport line for bunches outgoing from plasma accelerating module. Taking advantage of the symmetric and linear focusing provided by an active-plasma lens, the witness is captured and transported along the array without affecting its quality at the exit of the plasma module. At the same time the driver, being over-focused in the same array, can be removed by means of a collimator.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Light Beam Shape Characterization using Interferometric Closure Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel technique using closure amplitudes, inspired by radio interferometry, to determine with high angular resolution the two-dimensional profile of a light beam using an interferogram from a non-redundantly masked aperture. Previous techniques have required multiple interferograms or accurate estimates of the non-uniform illuminations across the aperture. In contrast, our method using closure amplitudes avoids the need to estimate the aperture illuminations while determining the two-dimensional beam shape from a single interferogram. The invariance of closure amplitudes to even time-varying aperture illuminations makes it suitable to longer averaging intervals, with potential to reducing data rates and computational overheads. By using data from the ALBA synchrotron light source to validate the method and its results against existing methods, this paper represents the first real-world application of closure amplitudes to directly determine the light beam's profile using optical interferometry in the high angular resolution regime.</description>
