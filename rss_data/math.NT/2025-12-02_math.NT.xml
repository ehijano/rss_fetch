      <title>Breuil's Lattice Conjecture for GL2(K)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove Breuil's lattice conjecture for higher Hodge-Tate weights in the case of $\mathrm{GL}_2(K)$ where $K$ is an unramified extension of $\mathbb{Q}_p$. More precisely, under some genericity conditions, we show that the lattice inside a locally algebraic type induced by the completed cohomology of a $U(2)$-arithmetic manifold depends only on the Galois representation at places above $p$ for arbitrary Hodge-Tate weights, which are small relative to $p$. We further prove that the patched modules of all lattices inside the locally algebraic types with irreducible cosocle are cyclic.
  One key input of the paper is a structure theorem for mod $p$ representations of $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathcal{O}_K)$, which are residually multiplicity free and of finite length. Another input is an explicit computation of universal framed Galois deformation rings, which parameterize potentially crystalline lifts with fixed tame inertial types and higher Hodge-Tate weights.</description>

      <title>The $\rho$-Schwartz space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a reductive group over a local field $F$ and let $\rho:{}^LG \to \mathrm{GL}_{V_{\rho}}(\mathbb{C})$ be a representation of its $L$-group satisfying suitable assumptions. Braverman, Kazhdan and Ng\^o conjectured that one has a Schwartz space $\mathcal{S}_{\rho}(G(F))$ of functions on $G(F)$ that admits a Fourier transform and satisfies certain desiderata. We prove a large portion of this conjecture. More precisely, we construct these Schwartz spaces over non-Archimedean local fields and construct an approximation to them over Archimedean fields. Our methods are spectral in nature.</description>

      <title>Lattice points in thickened parabolas and rational points near hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among the nondegenerate C^4 hypersurfaces M in R^n, we characterize the rational quadrics as the hypersurfaces that are the least well approximated by rational points. Given M other than a rational quadric, we prove a heuristically sharp lower bound for the number of rational points very near M, improving the sensitivity of prior results of Beresnevich and Huang.
  Our methods are dynamical, and rely on an application of Ratner's theorems to 1-parameter unipotent subgroups U of SL_n(R) such that u - Id has rank at most 2 for every u in U. As part of our work, we study the algebraic subgroups of SL_n(Q) whose collection of real points can contain such a subgroup.</description>

      <title>Euclidean Algorithms for Ideal Classes in Biquadratic fields: A Genus-Theoretic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Euclidean ideal classes in real biquadratic fields and obtain unconditional existence results via genus theory. Lenstra showed (assuming the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis) that a number field with unit rank at least one admits a Euclidean ideal precisely when its class group is cyclic; subsequent work has aimed to remove the GRH hypothesis in special families. Focusing on real biquadratic fields $K=\mathbb{Q}\left(\sqrt{d_1},\sqrt{d_2}\right)$ with $2\nmid d_1d_2$, we prove that if the class group $\mathrm{Cl}_K$ is cyclic and the Hilbert class field $H(K)$ is abelian over $\mathbb{Q}$, then $K$ contains a Euclidean ideal class (unconditionally). We also analyse the distribution of genus numbers in a natural family of biquadratic fields and, using these statistics, show that the set of biquadratic fields admitting a Euclidean ideal has density zero.</description>

      <title>On the Disk of Convergence of Algebraic Power Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is mainly concerned with the disk of convergence of a power series s(x) representing an algebraic function of x and specifically with the relation between this disk and the branch points of the function. We shall focus especially on the p-adic case, answering some questions of basic nature, seemingly absent from the existing literature. Our methods are simple and essentially self-contained. To illustrate the issues, recall that in the complex case it follows from standard arguments that the open disk of convergence cannot contain all the branch points of x unless the series represents a rational function. In the p-adic case, we show that the analogous assertion is not true in complete generality; but we also confirm it in a number of cases, for instance under the assumption that p is not smaller than the degree of s(x) over the field of rational functions of x. In particular this gives an upper bound for the radius of convergence which has intrinsic nature. We shall also touch several related questions.</description>

      <title>On the maximality of the $\lambda$-invariants of Mazur--Tate elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $E$ be an elliptic curve with good ordinary reduction at an odd prime $p$. Assuming that Greenberg's $\mu=0$ conjecture holds, we show that the $\lambda$-invariants of the Mazur--Tate elements attached to $E$ either stabilise to the $\lambda$-invariant of the $p$-adic $L$-function or they attain the largest possible value at all finite levels. We characterise the latter phenomenon:\ it occurs if and only if $\ord_p\left(\frac{L(E',1)}{\Omega_{E'}}\right)$ is negative for some $E'$ that is isogenous to $E$. Furthermore, we relate this condition to congruences with boundary symbols coming from Eisenstein series. We also study the extension of these results to Hecke eigenforms of weight two.</description>

      <title>The diophantine equation $(2^{k}-1)(b^{k}-1)=y^{q}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the exponential Diophantine equation \( (2^k-1)(b^k-1)=y^q \) with $k\ge 2$, odd integer $b$ and an odd prime exponent $q$ and obtain effective upper bounds for $q$ in terms of $b$. In particular, we show that $q\le \log_2(b+1)$ holds apart from a finite, explicitly determined set of exceptional pairs $(b,q)$ when $3\le b&lt;10^6$. As an application, we prove that the related equation \( (2^k-1)(b^k-1)=x^n, \) has no positive integer solution $(k,x,n)$ for several specific odd values of $b$, including $b\in\{5,7,11,13,21,23,27,29\}$.</description>

      <title>The Linear Slicing Method for Equal Sums of Like Powers: Modular and Geometric Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Diophantine equation $a^k + b^k = c^k + d^k$ with integer variables and exponent $k&gt;1$, under the linear constraint $(c+d) - (a+b) = h$. We analyze the geometry and arithmetic of these ``linear slices.'' On the central slice $h=0$, we prove strictly convex uniqueness: distinct unordered pairs with the same sum yield distinct power sums. For shifted slices $h\neq 0$, we establish a Modular Divisibility Obstruction (MDO): any solution requires $h$ to be divisible by a specific squarefree modulus $M_k = \prod_{p-1 \mid k-1} p$. This condition creates a strong divisibility filter; for example, if $k=13$, the obstruction eliminates $99.96\%$ of all possible shifts. We combine this arithmetic constraint with a geometric exclusion zone principle and a global overlap bound, showing that the slice size must satisfy $\min\{S, S+h\} \gg |h|$. Finally, we prove an asymptotic dominance bound $k \le \max\{S, S+h\} \log 2$, implying that for any fixed slice, solutions cannot exist for sufficiently large $k$.</description>

      <title>The possible adelic indices for elliptic curves admitting a rational cyclic isogeny</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the 1970s, Serre proved that the adelic index of a non-CM elliptic curve over a number field is finite. More recently, Zywina conjectured the complete set of adelic indices for such curves over $\mathbb{Q}$. In this article, we prove that Zywina's conjecture is true for the family of non-CM elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$ that admit a nontrivial rational cyclic isogeny. This strengthens a result of Lemos that resolved Serre's uniformity question for the same family of curves. Our proof proceeds by analyzing a collection of modular curves associated with each prime isogeny degree, using recent advances on $\ell$-adic images, isogeny-torsion graphs, and computations of models and rational points.</description>

      <title>$p$-adic monodromy and mod $p$ unlikely intersections, II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study ordinary abelian schemes in characteristic $p$ and their moduli spaces from the perspective of char $p$ Mumford--Tate, log Ax--Lindemann, and geometric Andr\'e--Oort conjectures (abbreviated as $\MTT_p$, $\mathrm{logAL}_p$ and geoAO$_p$). In this paper, we achieve multiple goals: (\textbf{A}) establish the implication $\mathrm{MT}_p\Leftrightarrow \mathrm{logAL}_p \Rightarrow \mathrm{geoAO_p}$, and show that they all follow from the Tate conjecture for abelian varieties. The equivalence $\mathrm{MT}_p\Leftrightarrow \mathrm{logAL}_p$ is exploited from both sides, which enables us to \noindent(\textbf{B}) develop a representation theory approach to $\mathrm{logAL}_p$ and $\mathrm{geoAO_p}$ by first establishing many cases of MT$_p$ via classical techniques, and (\textbf{C}) develop an algebraization approach to $\MTT_p$ that transcends the limitation of classical methods. In particular, we introduce ``crystalline Hodge loci'', a rigid analytic geometric object that encodes the essential information needed for proving $\mathrm{logAL}_p$, while being very approachable via (integral and relative) $p$-adic Hodge theory. This enables us to prove $\mathrm{logAL}_p$ for compact Tate-linear curves with unramified $p$-adic monodromy. As an application, we establish $\MTT_p$ for many abelian fourfolds of $p$-adic Mumford type.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Bounds for Birch's Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a number field and $f_1,\ldots,f_s\in K[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ forms of odd degrees. In 1957, Birch proved that if $n$ is sufficiently large then the forms always have a nontrivial zero in $K^n$. Apart from some small degrees, the number of variables required was so large that it has been described as "not even astronomical". We prove that, for any fixed degree, $n$ may be taken polynomial in $s$. We deduce this from a stronger result -- the Zariski closure of the set of rational zeros has codimension bounded by a polynomial in $s$. When $K$ is totally imaginary, our results hold for forms of any (possibly even) degrees.</description>

      <title>The intrinsic subgroup of an elliptic curve and Mazur's torsion theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define and study a biadditive symmetric (not necessarily perfect) pairing on the torsion part $\mathrm{Pic}(X)_{\mathrm{tors}}$ of the Picard group of a smooth projective curve $X$ over a field $k$ with values in $k^\times \otimes \mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}$. We call its kernel the intrinsic subgroup of $X$. It turns out that some information on the reduction type of $X$ can be read off from the intrinsic subgroup. Mazur's torsion theorem says that there are exactly 15 isomorphism classes of abelian groups that appear as the rational torsion points of an elliptic curve $X$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ (identified with $\mathrm{Pic}(X)_{\mathrm{tors}}$). We refine this result by determining which subgroups of those 15 groups appear as the intrinsic subgroups.</description>

      <title>Duality for higher local fields after Kato and Suzuki</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A field $K$ is $d$-local if there exist fields $K=k_d,...,k_0$ with $k_{i+1}$ complete discrete valuation with residue field $k_i$, and $k_0$ finite of characteristic $p$. By work of Deninger and Wingberg, the Galois cohomology of such fields with finite coefficients satisfies a duality generalizing Tate duality when either $d=0$, $\mathrm{char} k_1=0$ or the coefficients have no $p$-torsion. Reviewing and synthesizing results of Suzuki and Kato, we obtain $p$-torsion duality statements under the weaker assumption that either $d\leq 1$ or $\mathrm{char} k_2=0$, as well as for varieties over $K$, where duality is stated in terms of locally compact Hausdorff topologies on the \'etale cohomology groups. More generally we obtain results for any perfect $k_0$, endowing the totally unramified cohomology groups of $K$ with the structure of ind-pro-quasi-algebraic $k_0$-groups.</description>

      <title>Counting roots of unity on the graphs of Laurent series over non-Archimedean local fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We completely classify Laurent series converging on the unit circle over a non-Archimedean local field (of any characteristic) that map infinitely many roots of unity to roots of unity. For a given Laurent series $f$ over a field of positive characteristic with residue field $\mathbb{F}_q$, we prove effective bounds for the number of possible roots of unity in terms of the number of zeroes of the auxilliary function $f(x^q) -f(x)^q$. In characteristic $0$ our bound is still effective but also depends on the ramification degree of the base field over $\mathbb{Q}_p$ as well as the size of the coefficients of $f$. This has applications to the Manin-Mumford conjecture in $\mathbb{G}_m^2$. In characteristic $0$, this work builds upon a pigeon-hole based method by Schmidt.</description>

      <title>Growth rates of sequences governed by the squarefree properties of its translates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We answer several questions of Erd\H{o}s regarding sequences of natural numbers $A$ whose translates $n+A$ intersect with the squarefree numbers in various specified ways. For instance, we show that if every translate only contains finitely many squarefree numbers, then $A$ has zero density, although the decay rate of this density can be arbitrarily slow. On the other hand, there exist sequences $A$ with optimal density $6/\pi^2$ for which infinitely many $n$ exist such that $n+a$ is squarefree for all $a \in A$ with $a &lt; n$. In fact, infinitely many such $n$ exist for every exponentially increasing sequence, as long as the sequence avoids at least one residue class modulo $p^2$ for all primes $p$, a property we call admissible. If one instead requires infinitely many $n$ to exist such that $n+a$ is squarefree for all $a \in A$, then $A$ can have density arbitrarily close to, but not equal to, $6/\pi^2$. Finally, we prove bounds on the growth rate of sequences $A$ for which $a+a'$ is squarefree for all $a,a' \in A$, as well as bounds on the largest admissible subset of $\{1, 2, \ldots, N\}$.</description>

      <title>Tree asymptotic densities in number theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic distribution of integers sharing the same rooted-tree structure that encodes their complete prime factorization tower. For each tree we derive an explicit density formula depending only on a pair $(m,k)$, the density signature of the tree, up to a suitable multiplicative scalar factor and introduce the corresponding tree zeta function, which generalizes the prime zeta function. Classical results such as the prime number theorem and later work by Landau appear as special cases.</description>

      <title>Rigorous methods for computational number theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first algorithm for computing class groups and unit groups of arbitrary number fields that provably runs in probabilistic subexponential time, assuming the Extended Riemann Hypothesis (ERH). Previous subexponential algorithms were either restricted to imaginary quadratic fields, or relied on several heuristic assumptions that have long resisted rigorous analysis.
  The heart of our method is a new general strategy to provably solve a recurring computational problem in number theory (assuming ERH): given an ideal class $[\mathfrak{a}]$ of a number field $K$, sample an ideal $\mathfrak b \in [\mathfrak{a}]$ belonging to a particular family of ideals (e.g., the family of smooth ideals, or near-prime ideals). More precisely, let $\mathcal{S}$ be an arbitrary family of ideals, and $\mathcal{S}_B$ the family of $B$-smooth ideals. We describe an efficient algorithm that samples ideals $\mathfrak b \in [\mathfrak{a}]$ such that $\mathfrak b \in \mathcal{S} \cdot\mathcal{S}_B$ with probability proportional to the density of $\mathcal{S}$ within the set of all ideals.
  The case where $\mathcal{S}$ is the set of prime ideals yields the family $\mathcal{S}\cdot\mathcal{S}_B$ of near-prime ideals, of particular interest in that it constitutes a dense family of efficiently factorable ideals. The case of smooth ideals $\mathcal{S} = \mathcal{S}_B$ regularly comes up in index-calculus algorithms (notably to compute class groups and unit groups), where it has long constituted a theoretical obstacle overcome only by heuristic arguments.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic closed forms count the Mersenne primes, the Fermat primes and the twin-prime pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct closed forms that generate with repetitions all Mersenne primes, respectively all Fermat primes, all twin-prime pairs and all Sophie Germain primes. Also, we construct closed forms that count all Mersenne primes between $0$ and $2^{n+2}-1$, respectively all Fermat primes between $0$ and $6n+5$ and all twin-prime pairs between $0$ and $n$. Every closed form is an arithmetic term, i. e. a fixed finite composition of the following arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division with remainder and the exponentiation $2^n$. While for generating these sets with repetitions, only Wilson's Theorem is applied, for the counting forms we use more specific tests, i.e. Lucas-Lehmer, respectively Pepin, and we apply to some extent Jones' work (see Acta Arithmetica XXXV, pg. 210 - 221, 1979). To count twin primes we apply Clement's Theorem, which is closely related to Wilson's. A closed form to count the Sophie Germain primes can be constructed similarly.</description>

      <title>Quantitative correlations and some problems on prime factors of consecutive integers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider several old problems involving the number of prime divisors function $\omega(n)$, as well as the related functions $\Omega(n)$ and $\tau(n)$. Firstly, we show that there are infinitely many positive integers $n$ such that $\omega(n+k) \leq \Omega(n+k) \ll k$ for all positive integers $k$, establishing a conjecture of Erd\H{o}s and Straus. Secondly, we show that the series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \omega(n)/2^n$ is irrational, settling a conjecture of Erd\H{o}s. Thirdly, we prove an asymptotic formula conjectured by Erd\H{o}s, Pomerance and S\'ark\"ozy for the number of $n\leq x$ satisfying $\omega(n)=\omega(n+1)$, for almost all $x$, with similar results for $\Omega$ and $\tau$. Common to the resolution of all these problems is the use of the probabilistic method. For the first problem, this is combined with computations involving a high-dimensional sieve of Maynard-type. For the second and third problems, we instead make use of a general quantitative estimate for two-point correlations of multiplicative functions with a small power of logarithm saving that may be of independent interest. This correlation estimate is derived by using recent work of Pilatte.</description>

      <title>A discrete approach to Dirichlet L-functions via spectral models: special values and zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Dirichlet $L$-functions via discrete analogs $L_n$ arising from the spectral theory of cyclic graphs as $n\rightarrow \infty$. Using a refined Euler-Maclaurin asymptotic expansion due to Sidi, together with an independent polynomiality property of these finite spectral sums at integers, we obtain exact special-value formulas, even starting at $n=1$. This yields new expressions for certain trigonometric sums of interest in physics, and recovers, by a different method, the striking formulas of Xie, Zhao, and Zhao. It also gives infinite families of recursion relations among special values of the Riemann zeta function and of Dirichlet $L$-functions.
  Concerning zeros, we prove that, for odd primitive characters, a natural asymptotic functional equation for the discrete functions $L_n$ is equivalent to the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis for the corresponding Dirichlet $L$-function. We also provide some remarks about the non-existence of possible real zeros.</description>

      <title>Numerical cohomology for arithmetic surfaces and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01811v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce numerical cohomology for arithmetic surfaces, which leads to an absolute version of arithmetic Riemann-Roch formula. As an application, we derive an upper bound for the self-intersection number of relative dualizing sheaf in terms of successive minima with respect to $L^2$-norm. The result has the geometric analogue that the slopes of the Harder-Narasimhan filtration of relative dualizing sheaf provide an upper bound for self-intersection number. Suppose that the arithmetic surface admits a section and has generic fiber of genus at least two, we obtain a refined upper bound for the self-intersection number, which is governed by the topological and arithmetic information of the section.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe Jacobi forms of vector-valued weights in terms of classical ones, extending previous results by Ibukiyama and Kyomura to the case of arbitrary cogenus. As in their result, our isomorphisms are given by holomorphic covariant differential operators. In contrast to previous work, however, we avoid explicit calculations, which we replace by general differential geometric arguments. In the process, we obtain a structure theorem on nearly holomorphic functions on the Jacobi upper half space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that, unlike del Pezzo surfaces, higher dimensional Fano manifolds do not satisfy in general boundedness properties for their ${\rm CH}_0$ group of $0$-cycles. For example, for quartic threefolds having a point of odd degree, there is no ``Coray type" uperbound on the minimal odd degrees of points. Also, the ${\rm CH}_0$-group of Fano hypersurfaces can be ``unbounded'' (a notion which is related to infinite dimensionality in the sense of Mumford), meaning that there is no integer $N$ such that $0$-cycles of degree at least $N$ are effective.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be an algebraic variety over $\mathbb{C}$ and $G$ be an algebraic group acting on $X$ whose action is closed. J. Poineau defined a compactification $X^\urcorner$ of $X(\mathbb{C})$ by using hybrid Berkovich spaces. We will focus on the extension of the action of $G$ on this compactification by characterising the set $\mathcal{U} \subset X^\urcorner$ where the action is well defined. We will also show that the quotient of $\mathcal{U}$ by the action of $G$ is homeomorphic to $(X/G)^\urcorner$, the compactification of $(X/G)(\mathbb{C})$. We then apply these results to $X = \mathrm{Rat}_d$, the space of rational maps and $G = \mathrm{SL}_2$. It gives the results of C. Favre-C. Gong in a more general setting. Furthermore, we get a compactification of $\mathrm{M}_d = \mathrm{Rat}_d/\mathrm{SL}_2$ where the boundary is made of orbits of non-archimedean rational maps. The results still holds if $\mathbb{C}$ is replaced by $k$ a non-trivially valued field and complex analytic spaces by Berkovich spaces over $k$.</description>

      <title>A Uniform Rewriting Algorithm for Twisted Tensor Representations of Finite General Linear Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00263v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $q=p^f$ be a prime power and let $H$ be a classical group of type $A$, so $H \cong \mathrm{SL}_d(q)$ or $\mathrm{GL}_d(q)$, acting on its natural module $V$ of dimension $d$ over $\mathbb{F}_q$. Let $W$ be an absolutely irreducible $\mathbb{F}_qH$--module such that, over an algebraic closure, $W$ is isomorphic (up to Frobenius twists) to a tensor product $\bigotimes_{t=1}^r L(\lambda^{(t)})$, where each $L(\lambda^{(t)})$ is an irreducible polynomial representation of $\mathrm{GL}_d$ of degree $k_t$, and the total degree $K=\sum_t k_t$ satisfies $K&lt;q-1$. We prove a base-$q$ injectivity lemma which shows that, for a Singer cycle $s \in H$, the eigenvalues of $s$ on $W \otimes_{\mathbb{F}_q} \mathbb{F}_{q^d}$ are parametrised by digit vectors of length $d$ with entries bounded by $K$. In particular, distinct weights of $W$ correspond to distinct eigenvalues. If in addition $W$ is multiplicity-free for the diagonal torus of $\mathrm{GL}_d$, then every eigenspace of $s$ is one-dimensional, so $s$ has a simple spectrum on $W$. Using this spectral property we design a Las Vegas rewriting algorithm which, given $G \leq \mathrm{GL}(W)$ isomorphic to $H$ and acting irreducibly on $W$, constructs a projective representation of $G$ of degree $d$ equivalent to the natural representation of $H$. The expected running time is polynomial in $d$, $\log q$ and $K$, and in the cost of field operations and discrete logarithm computations in $\mathbb{F}_{q^d}$. This extends earlier rewriting algorithms of Magaard--O'Brien--Seress and of G\"ul--Ankaral{\i}o\u{g}lu to a broader class of twisted tensor products of polynomial modules.</description>

Abstract: We extend Raimi's classical partition theorem to the continuous setting of the circle and $n$-dimensional torus. Building on recent work of Hegyv\'ari, Pach, and Pham in finite groups, we prove that there exist measurable partitions of the $n$-dimensional torus $\mathbb{T}^n$ with the property that for any finite measurable cover, some translated part of the cover has positive measure intersection with every partition element. Our proof adapts combinatorial arguments from the finite setting using measure-theoretic techniques and slicing arguments in product spaces.</description>

      <title>The Theory of Normality for Dynamically Generated Cantor Series Expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of normality for base $g$ expansions of real numbers in $[0,1)$ is rich and well developed. Similar theories have been developed for many other numeration systems, such as the regular continued fraction expansion, $\beta$-expansions, and L\"uroth series expansions.
  Let $Q=(q_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be a sequence of integers greater than or equal to 2. The $Q$-Cantor series expansion of $x \in [0,1)$ is the unique sum of the form $x=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{x_n}{q_1q_2\cdots q_n}$, where $x_n \neq q_n-1$ infinitely often. For the Cantor series expansions, most of the literature thus far considers $Q$ where the theory of normality differs drastically from that of the base $g$ expansions. We introduce the class of dynamically generated Cantor series expansions, which is a large class of Cantor series expansions for which much of the classical theory of base $g$ expansions can be developed in parallel. This class includes many examples such as the Thue-Morse sequence on $\{2,3\}$ and translated Champernowne numbers.
  A special case of our main results is that if $Q$ is a bounded basic sequence that is dynamically generated by an ergodic system having zero entropy, then normality base $Q$ coincides with distribution normality base $Q$, and $Q$ possesses a Hot Spot Theorem.</description>

      <title>The big de Rham-Witt forms over fields and motives of non-reduced schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using algebraic cycles as a medium, we prove that the groups of the big (Hesselholt-Madsen) de Rham-Witt forms over arbitrary fields are isomorphic to the relative improved (Gabber-Kerz) Milnor $K$-groups of Artin local algebras of embedding dimension $1$. This answers an old problem on the relative Milnor $K$-groups studied since 1970s, especially in ${\rm char} (k) = p&gt;0$.
  Applications include an interpretation of the big de Rham-Witt forms precisely as the vanishing cycles of the Elmanto-Morrow motivic cohomology of non-reduced schemes, as well as a construction of an extended logarithmic derivative map $d\log$ on the Milnor $K$-theory of some Artin rings to the de Rham-Witt forms.</description>

      <title>Statistical Properties of the Rooted-Tree Encoding of $\mathbb{N}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prime-encode the natural numbers via recursive factorisation, iterated to the exponents, generating a corpus of planar rooted trees equivalently represented as Dyck words. This forms a deterministic text endowed with internal rules. Statistical analysis of the corpus reveals that the dictionary and the entropy grow sublinearly, compression shows non-monotonic trend, and the rank-frequency curves assume a stable parabolic form deviating from Zipf's law. Correlation analysis using mean-squared displacement reveals a transition from normal diffusion to superdiffusion in the associated walk. These findings characterise the tree-encoded sequence as a statistically structured text with long-range correlations grounded in its generative arithmetic law, providing an empirical basis for subsequent theoretical and learnability</description>

      <title>Testing Transformer Learnability on the Arithmetic Sequence of Rooted Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study whether a Large Language Model can learn the deterministic sequence of trees generated by the iterated prime factorization of the natural numbers. Each integer is mapped into a rooted planar tree and the resulting sequence $ \mathbb{N}\mathcal{T}$ defines an arithmetic text with measurable statistical structure. A transformer network (the GPT-2 architecture) is trained from scratch on the first $10^{11}$ elements to subsequently test its predictive ability under next-word and masked-word prediction tasks. Our results show that the model partially learns the internal grammar of $\mathbb{N}\mathcal{T}$, capturing non-trivial regularities and correlations. This suggests that learnability may extend beyond empirical data to the very structure of arithmetic.</description>

Abstract: In the present paper, we study linear equations on tensor powers of the Carlitz module using the theory of Anderson dual $t$-motives and a detailed analysis of a specific Frobenius difference equation. As an application, we derive some explicit sufficient conditions for the linear independence for Carlitz polylogarithms at algebraic points in both $\infty$-adic and $v$-adic settings.</description>

Abstract: We formulate characteristic $p$ analogues of the Mumford--Tate and the Andr\'e--Oort conjectures for ordinary mod $p$ Shimura varieties of Hodge type, and set up general frameworks for studying them. We prove the two conjectures for (subvarieties of) arbitrary products of GSpin Shimura varieties, by reducing them, via a notion of linearity for mod $p$ Shimura varieties, to a third conjecture of Ax--Schanuel type. Along the way, we solve Chai's Tate-linear conjecture for products of GSpin Shimura varieties, and reveal an intimate relation among the four conjectures mentioned above. Our proof uses Crew's parabolicity conjecture which is recently proven by D'Addezio.</description>

Abstract: Let $\lambda$ be the Liouville function, defined as $\lambda(n) := (-1)^{\Omega(n)}$ where $\Omega(n)$ is the number of prime factors of $n$ with multiplicity. In 2021, Helfgott and Radziwi{\l}{\l} proved that $$\sum_{n\leq x} \frac{1}{n} \lambda(n) \lambda(n+1) \ll \frac{\log x}{(\log \log x)^{1/2}},$$improving earlier results by Tao and Ter\"av\"ainen. We prove that $$\sum_{n\leq x} \frac{1}{n} \lambda(n) \lambda(n+1) \ll (\log x)^{1-c}$$for some absolute constant $c&gt;0$. This appears to be best possible with current methods.</description>

Abstract: Let $F$ be a CM field. In this paper, we prove the local-global compatibility for cohomological cuspidal automorphic representations of $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{A}_F)$ at $p \neq l$ by using certain potential automorphy theorems in some cases including higher dimensional cases. Moreover, we also prove the Ramanujan conjecture for cohomological cuspidal automorphic representations of $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{A}_F )$.</description>

Abstract: Let $\nu$ be a place of a global function field $K$ over a finite field, with associated affine function ring $R_\nu$ and completion $K_\nu$, and let $1 \leq \mathfrak{m}&lt;\textbf{d}$. The aim of this paper is to prove an effective triple joint equidistribution result for primitive partial $R_\nu$-lattices $\Lambda$ of rank $\mathfrak{m}$ in $K_\nu^{\;\textbf{d}}$ as their covolume tends to infinity: of their $K_\nu$-linear span $V_\Lambda$ in the rank-$\mathfrak{m}$ Grassmannian space of $K_\nu^{\;\textbf{d}}$; of their shape in the modular quotient by $\operatorname{PGL}_\mathfrak{m}(R_\nu)$ of the Bruhat-Tits buildings of $\operatorname{PGL}_\mathfrak{m}(K_\nu)$; and of the shape of $\Lambda^\perp$ in the similar quotient for $\operatorname{PGL}_{\textbf{d}-\mathfrak{m}}(K_\nu)$, where $\Lambda^\perp$ is the orthogonal partial $R_\nu$-lattice of rank $\textbf{d}-\mathfrak{m}$ in the dual space of $K_\nu^{\;\textbf{d}}$. The main tools are a new refined $\text{LU}$ decomposition by blocks of elements of $\operatorname{SL}_\textbf{d}(K_\nu)$, techniques of Gorodnik and Nevo for counting integral points in well-rounded families of subsets of algebraic groups, and computations of volumes of various homogeneous spaces associated with partial $R_\nu$-lattices.</description>

Abstract: Let $F$ be a real quadratic field in which a fixed prime $p$ is inert, and $E_0$ be an imaginary quadratic field in which $p$ splits; put $E=E_0 F$. Let ${{\rm Sh}}_{1,n-1}$ be the special fiber over $\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$ of the Shimura variety for $G(U(1,n-1)\times U(n-1,1))$ with hyperspecial level structure at $p$ for some integer $n\geq 2$. Let ${{\rm Sh}}_{1,n-1}(K_{\mathfrak{p}}^{1})$ be the special fiber over $\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$ of a Shimura variety for $G(U(1,n-1)\times U(n-1,1))$ with parahoric level structure at $p$ for some integer $n\geq 2$. We exhibit elements in the higher Chow group of the supersingular locus of ${{\rm Sh}}_{1,n-1}$ and study the stratification of ${{\rm Sh}}_{1,n-1}.$ Moreover, we study the geometry of ${{\rm Sh}}_{1,n-1}(K_{\mathfrak{p}}^{1})$ and prove a form of Ihara lemma. With Ihara lemma, we prove the the arithmetic level raising map is surjective for $n=2,3.$</description>

Abstract: We prove two fast formulas for the Hurwitz values $\zeta(2,a)$ and $\zeta(3,a)$ respectively with the help of the WZ method. In them $(a)_n$ denotes the rising factorial or Pochhammer's symbol defined by $(a)_0=1$ and $(a)_n=a(a+1)\cdots(a+n-1)$ for positive integers $n$. The Huwitz $\zeta$ function is defined by $\zeta(s,a)=\zeta(0,s,a)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} (k+a)^{-s}$. In addition, we can use these fast evaluations to compute also in a rapid way Dirichlet values of the kinds $L_{\chi}(2)$ and $L_{\chi}(3)$.</description>

Abstract: We study small gaps between Goldbach primes $\mathbb{P} \cap (N-\mathbb{P})$ using the Bombieri-Davenport method and the Maynard-Tao method, and compare the two.
  We show that for almost all even integers $N$, the smallest gap in $\mathbb{P} \cap (N-\mathbb{P})$ is at most $0.765\ldots$ times the average gap, using the Bombieri-Davenport method. This improves a recent result of Tsuda. We also demonstrate that a straightforward application of the Maynard-Tao method is insufficient to improve this bound. However, it allows us to establish the existence of bounded gaps between Goldbach primes with bounded error for almost all even integers $N$.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Fourier coefficients of Siegel modular forms of higher degrees and levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12148v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the following statement about any Siegel modular form $F$ of degree $n$ and arbitrary odd level $N$ on the group $\Gamma_1^{(n)}(N)$. Let $A(F,T)$ denote the Fourier coefficients of $F$ and write $T=(T(i,j))$.
  Suppose that $F$ has a non-zero Fourier coefficient $A(F,T_0)$ such that $(T_0(n,n),N)=1$. Then there exist infinitely many odd and square-free (and thus fundamental) integers $m$ such that $m=\mathrm{discriminant}(T)$ and $A(F,T)\neq 0$. In the case of odd degrees, we prove a stronger result by replacing odd and square-free with odd and prime. We also prove quantitative results towards this.
  As a consequence, we can show in particular that the statement of the main result in arXiv:2408.03442 about the algebraicity of certain critical values of the spinor $L$-functions of holomorphic newforms (in the ambit of Deligne's conjectures) on congruence subgroups of $\mathrm{GSp}(3)$ is unconditional.</description>

      <title>Modularity from $q$-series</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20316v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1975, G. E. Andrews challenged the mathematics community to address L. Ehrenpreis' problem, which was to directly prove the modularity of the Rogers-Ramanujan $q$-series' summatory forms. This question is important because many different $q$-series appearing in combinatorics, representation theory, and physics often seem to be mysteriously modular, yet there is no general test to confirm this directly from the exotic $q$-series expressions. In this note, we answer the challenge. We use $q$-series algebra, first-order $q$-differential systems, and analytic continuation with monodromy to give a criterion that decides when such series are modular. Specifically, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for a vector of holomorphic $q$-series on $|q|&lt;1$ to form a vector-valued modular function without modular input, providing a clear path to modularity for strange $q$-series.</description>

      <title>The decomposition of primes in nonabelian extensions of Heisenberg type and an analogue of Euler's criterion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For primes $p$ and $\ell$ such that $\ell$ divides $p-1$, Hirano and Morishita constructed a nonabelian Galois extension of the function field $\mathbb{F}_p(t)$ whose degree is $\ell^3$ and Galois group is of Heisenberg type. Here we analyze how primes of degree one decompose in such extensions. It amounts to investigating the decomposition of the principal ideal $(t-a)$ for $a \in \mathbb{F}_p-\{0,1\}$ and our main result determines when it decomposes completely in terms of an explicit polynomial in $a$. It is reminiscent of Euler's criterion. The proof relies on both the group structure of the mod-$\ell$ Heisenberg group and the arithmetic of field extensions.</description>

Abstract: A classical result of Fekete gives necessary conditions on a compact set in the complex plane so that it contains infinitely many sets of conjugate algebraic integers. For such sets, we demonstrate the existence of a sequence of algebraic integers such that most of their conjugates eventually lie near the set, while maintaining a bound on heights. Finally, we examine properties satisfied by the limiting distribution of a sequence of algebraic numbers.</description>

      <title>Paley-like quasi-random graphs arising from polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Paley graphs and Paley sum graphs are classical examples of quasi-random graphs. In this paper, we provide new constructions of families of quasi-random graphs that behave like Paley graphs but are neither Cayley graphs nor Cayley sum graphs. These graphs give a unified perspective of studying various graphs arising from polynomials over finite fields, such as Paley graphs, Paley sum graphs, and graphs arising from Diophantine tuples and their generalizations. We also obtain lower bounds on the clique and independence numbers of the graphs in these families.</description>

      <title>Completing the picture for the Skolem Problem on order-4 linear recurrence sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01221v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For almost a century, the decidability of the Skolem Problem - that is, the problem of finding whether a given linear recurrence sequence (LRS) has a zero term - has remained open. A breakthrough in the 1980s established that the Skolem Problem is indeed decidable for algebraic LRS of order at most 3, and real algebraic LRS of order at most 4. However, for general algebraic LRS of order 4 the question of decidability has remained open. Our main contribution in this paper is to prove decidability for this last case, i.e. we show that the Skolem Problem is decidable for all algebraic LRS of order at most 4.</description>
