      <title>Exploring the Properties of Light Diatomic Molecules in Strong Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we develop and implement a specialized coupled-cluster (CC) approach tailored for accurately describing atoms and molecules in strong magnetic fields. Using the open-source Ghent Quantum Chemistry Package (\texttt{GQCP}) in conjunction with the Python-based Simulations of Chemistry Framework (\texttt{PySCF}), we calculate potential energy curves, permanent and transient dipole moments, as well as vibrational spectra for the diatomic molecules H$_2$, HeH$^+$ and LiH under various magnetic field strengths adopting a fully non-perturbative treatment. The main computational difficulties stem from the inclusion of the magnetic field in the Hamiltonian, in particular, from the presence of the angular momentum operator, which leads to a complication of the wave function and introduces a gauge-origin dependence. Addressing these challenges requires advanced modifications to existing routines, which we achieve by implementing gauge-comprising atomic orbitals (GIAOs) by using \texttt{GQCP}, and the capabilities offered by \texttt{PySCF}. This approach enhances the accuracy and reliability of the CC theory, opening pathways for more comprehensive investigations in molecular quantum chemistry at strong magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Refining spectroscopic calculations for trivalent lanthanide ions: a revised parametric Hamiltonian and open-source solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The historical calculation of spectroscopic properties for trivalent lanthanide ions is a complex multistep process that has been prone to inaccuracies. In this work, we revise the parametric semi-empirical Hamiltonian and address long-standing discrepancies in the literature. We also resurface the distinctions between orthogonal and non-orthogonal operators and use orthogonal operators to provide an alternative parametric description. Based on experimental data available in the literature, a new set of parameter values for the ions in LaF$_3$ and LiYF$_4$ is presented. Additionally, we provide calculations of spontaneous emission rates and oscillator strengths for magnetic dipole transitions in the LaF$_3$ crystal host. To ensure the replicability of our findings, we make available the open-source code $\mathbf{\texttt{qlanth}}$, accompanied by a comprehensive set of electronic files to serve as an updated reference for future calculations.</description>

      <title>Properties of the weakly-bound (1,1)-states and rotationally excited (2,0)-states in the muonic molecular $d d \mu, d t \mu$ and $t t \mu$ ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Total energies and other bound state properties of the weakly-bound (1,1)-states and rotationally excited (2,0)-states in the three-body muonic molecular $d d \mu, d t \mu$ and $t t \mu$ ions are determined to high numerical accuracy and investigated. Our current numerical accuracy achieved for the total and binding energies of the weakly-bound (1,1)-states in the both $d d \mu$ and $d t \mu$ ions significantly exceeds similar accuracy obtained in earlier computations of these weakly-bound states in these two ions. The bound state properties of the weakly-bound (1,1)-states and (2,0)-states in the $d d \mu, d t \mu$ and $t t \mu$ muonic ions have never been determined to high accuracy in earlier studies. We also briefly discuss the current status of muon-catalyzed nuclear fusion and develop the new universal variational expansion which can be used for extremely accurate bound state calculations of arbitrary three-body systems, including the truly adiabatic ${}^{\infty}$H$^{+}_{2}$ ion and close systems.</description>

      <title>Zeptosecond to attosecond dynamics in atoms and possibility of generating a zeptosecond light source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In nuclear collisions, nuclear bremsstrahlung can cause nuclear Coulomb excitation via photon exchange in the projectile as well as the target nuclei. Such a process originating in nuclear timescales (zeptoseconds) can also influence the atomic phenomenon, which can be observed if it is delayed at least by a few attoseconds as atomic timescales $\ge$ an attosecond. We have found that this may happen due to a mechanism called the Eisenbud-Wigner-Smith (EWS)time delay process. We have estimated EWS time delays in atomic collisions utilizing the non-relativistic version of random phase approximation with exchange as well as Hartree-Fock methods. We present three representative collision systems through which one can experimentally observe the phenomena in attosecond timescales even though they originate from nuclear bremsstrahlung radiation occurring in zeptoseconds. Thus the present work represents an investigation of parallels between two neighboring areas of physics: atomic and nuclear physics. Furthermore the present work suggests the possibilities for atomic physics research near the Coulomb barrier energies, where the nuclear bremsstrahlung can be used as a zeptosecond x-ray source.</description>

      <title>Generalized spheroidal wave equation for real and complex valued parameters. An algorithm based on the analytic derivatives for the eigenvalues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a new approach for computations of eigenvalues of the generalized spheroidal wave equations. The novelty of the present method is in the use of the analytical derivatives of the eigenvalues to minimize losses in accuracy. The derivatives are constructed {in the form of three-term recurrent relations} within the method of continued fractions associated with the corresponding spheroidal wave equation. Very accurate results for the eigenvalues are obtained for a wide range of the parameters of the problem. As an illustrative example, the electronic energies and the separation constants are computed for various electronic states and geometries of selected ($\rm{H}_2^{+}$, $\rm{HeH}^{2+}$, and $\rm{BH}^{5+}$) quasimolecular systems. We also presented the solutions of the eigenvalues for complex parameters of the generalized spheroidal wave equations. The agreement between the obtained results and the results of other authors is discussed.</description>

      <title>EIT in V+ inverted $\Xi$ system using Rydberg state in thermal Rb atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rydberg excitation using blue and IR transition is an advantageous path for quantum computation in alkali elements. Aiming to stabilize the IR laser for quantum computation, we study electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) spectrum using Rydberg state in V+inverted $\Xi$ system (${5S_{1/2}}$ $\rightarrow$ ${5P_{3/2}}$ and ${5S_{1/2}}$ $\rightarrow$ ${6P_{1/2}}$ $\rightarrow$ ${r=69D_{3/2}}$) in Rb vapour cell at room temperature. The probe laser absorption at 780 nm is monitored in the presence of the two control lasers at 421 nm and 1003 nm. In comparison to the previously studied inverted $\Xi$ system, this system has a good signal-to-noise ratio even at room temperature with similar linewidth (around $10$~MHz). We also observe Autler-Towns splitting of the EIT due to the high power of probe and blue control lasers. For completeness and comparison, we also study the EIT in an inverted $\Xi$ system using $5S_{1/2}\rightarrow6P_{1/2}\rightarrow 69D_{3/2}$ transitions.</description>

      <title>Coincidence measurement of two-photon double ionization of argon through an autoionizing resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present coincidence measurements of two-photon double-ionization (TPDI) of argon driven by femtosecond pulses centered at 26.5 eV photon energy, which are obtained from a high-harmonic generation source. The measured photoelectron spectra are interpreted with regard to three TPDI mechanisms. Theoretical predictions are obtained by an approximate model for direct TPDI and atomic structure calculations, which are implemented into a Monte Carlo simulation. The prevailing mechanism includes the excitation and prompt photoionization of an autoionizing resonance in neutral argon. We provide evidence for pronounced electron-electron interaction in this ultrafast ionization process. The present work paves the way for scrutinizing and controlling non-linear photoionization in the extreme ultraviolet using table-top sources.</description>

      <title>Strong coupling of dipole trapped atomic ensembles to a ring cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cavity quantum electrodynamics systems using atoms in resonant optical cavities are central elements of many applications such as quantum networks and quantum-enhanced sensing. We present a novel experimental setup that achieves strong spatial mode-matching between a resonant mode of a triangular ring resonator and an ensemble of ultracold atoms trapped in an optical dipole trap. We realise a large-volume, 0.5\,mK deep cavity-assisted optical dipole trap from a laser beam of modest power locked to a resonant mode of the cavity through the intracavity power build-up effect, allowing efficient loading of the trap from a magneto-optical trap. We observe dipole trapping of atoms through the vacuum Rabi splitting of the transmission spectrum of a weak probe beam near resonant with the cavity, which demonstrates collective strong coupling of the ensemble of atoms to the cavity after the magneto-optical trap is turned off. The work paves the way for a highly suitable platform for cavity-assisted quantum sensing of magnetic and electric fields.</description>

      <title>Interaction of a Poincar\'e beam with optically polarized atoms in the presence of constant magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have highlighted the frequent applications of structured light modes in optically pumped atomic magnetometers. In this work, we theoretically explore how a Poincar\'e beam probes an optically polarized atomic medium. Specifically, we consider atoms polarized by a plane wave with linear polarization, immersed in a constant external magnetic field. We analyze how the polarization of the pump and probe light fields, along with the external magnetic field, impact the absorption profile. To this end, we employ a density matrix approach based on the Liouville-von Neumann equation. Our results reveal that the absorption profile exhibits an asymmetric pattern that depends on the magnetic field strength and the mutual orientation of the pump and probe light propagation directions relative to the quantization axis. For illustration, we assume the incoming radiation drives an electric dipole transition, $5s \, ^2S_{1/2}$ ($F=1$) $\rightarrow$ $5p \, ^2P_{3/2}$ ($F=0$), in rubidium atoms subjected to a magnetic field. These findings may aid in designing future experiments on optically pumped atomic magnetometers utilizing structured light modes.</description>

      <title>The semi-classical Floquet-Markov master equation for Monte Carlo spin integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In designing an experiment to measure a neutron electric dipole moment (nEDM), it is often necessary to determine the behavior of an ensemble of spins under time-dependent and randomly fluctuating magnetic fields. This is particularly relevant for the proposed nEDM@SNS experiment, which features ultra-cold neutrons (UCNs) and helium-3 atoms occupying the same measurement cell, as well as a sinusoidal dressing field. In this work, we investigate a new technique to calculate the frequency shifts arising from magnetic field inhomogeneities and motional magnetic fields, particularly in the case where the spins in question are subjected to a time-periodic magnetic field. The method is based on Floquet theory, a general framework for analyzing periodic linear differential equations, and Redfield theory, which governs the time evolution of the density matrix in the presence of weak couplings to an environment. We benchmark the results against the analytical results derived for the static magnetic field case, as well as against the results of a conventional Runge-Kutta integrator, and find agreement with both. We further study the performance of the method, and find order-of-magnitude improvements in runtime over the conventional integrator.</description>

      <title>Non-orbital particle trapping in binary black holes through dynamic stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an interdisciplinary comparison between binary black hole systems and Radio Frequency (RF) Paul Traps, modeling the gravitational binary system as a rotating saddle near its center. This analogy connects these seemingly unrelated systems through the concept of dynamic stability. The rotating saddle potential is analytically tractable, allowing us to prove the existence of bounded charged particle trajectories under certain conditions. By focusing on stellar-mass black holes with a weak electric charge-a feature consistent with specific astrophysical conditions that leaves the spacetime metric largely unaffected but can influence nearby particle interactions-we can neglect complicating factors such as magnetic fields from large accretion disks of heavier black holes or stellar winds. Our simulation results demonstrate that charged particles can exhibit stable, non-orbital trajectories near the center of a binary system with charged stellar-mass black holes, providing unique three-dimensional trapping primarily through gravity. This system is distinctive in the literature for its non-orbital trapping mechanism. While theoretically intriguing, this trapping relies on specific conditions, including nearly identical black hole masses. These types of non-orbital trapping mechanisms could potentially allow for longer-lived plasma configurations, enhancing our ability to detect electromagnetic signatures from these systems. The significance of this work lies in the novel comparison between a laboratory-scale quantum system and a larger astrophysical one, opening new avenues for exploring parallels between microscopic and cosmic phenomena across fourteen orders of magnitude in distance.</description>

      <title>Quantum-enabled Rydberg atomic polarimetry of radio-frequency fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rydberg atoms efficiently link photons between the radio-frequency (RF) and optical domains. They furnish a medium in which the presence of an RF field imprints on the transmission of a probe laser beam by altering the coherent coupling between atomic quantum states. The immutable atomic energy structure underpins quantum-metrological RF field measurements and has driven intensive efforts to realize inherently self-calibrated sensing devices. Here we investigate spectroscopic signatures owing to the angular momentum quantization of the atomic states utilized in an electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT) sensing scheme for linearly-polarized RF fields. Specific combinations of atomic terms are shown to give rise to universal, distinctive fingerprints in the detected optical fields upon rotating the RF field polarization. Using a dressed state picture, we identify two types of angular momentum ladders that display strikingly disparate spectroscopic signatures, including the absence or presence of a central spectral EIT peak. We verify our predicted complementary response in rubidium vapour cell experiments and through density matrix calculations. Our study adds important insights into the prospects of Rydberg atomic polarimetry for quantum metrological electric field characterization.</description>

Abstract: We present relativistic many-body calculations of total electron binding energy of neutral atoms up to element $Z=120$. Binding energy for ions may be found by subtracting known ionization potentials. Accuracy of the results for $17&lt;Z \le105$ significantly exceeds that in NIST tables (there are no data for $Z&gt;105$ there). We fit numerical results for binding energies by analytical function of $Z$. We also calculate numerical values and determine dependence on $Z$ of the correlation corrections, Dirac and Breit relativistic corrections and quantum electrodynamics (QED) corrections.</description>

      <title>Dual axis atomic magnetometer and gyroscope enabled by nuclear spin perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05319v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Alkali-noble-gas comagnetometers have become an essential tool for tests of fundamental physics and offer a compact platform for precision gyroscopy. They are, however, limited by technical noise at low frequencies, commonly due to their limited suppression of magnetic noise. Here we investigate a new method for co-magnetometry between a single noble gas and alkali species. While similar to well-known devices using self-compensation, our scheme introduces magnetic pulses that controllably perturb the noble gas and pulsed optical pumping to polarise the alkali atoms. These applied pulses allow our scheme to measure, rather than just suppress, the effect of magnetic noise thereby offering reduced cross-talk. We show numerically that our scheme retrieves four signals (rotations and magnetic fields on two transverse axes) with similar sensitivity to a single axis device. We also present a proof-of-principle experiment based on a 87Rb-129Xe cell. Our data shows a low magnetic-rotation cross-talk of $0.2 \pm 0.1\mu$Hz$/$pT, which is already on par with the most sensitive devices relying on self-compensation.</description>

Abstract: Terrestrial long-baseline atom interferometer experiments are emerging as powerful tools for probing new fundamental physics, including searches for dark matter and gravitational waves. In the frequency range relevant to these signals, gravity gradient noise (GGN) poses a significant challenge. While previous studies for vertical instruments have focused on GGN induced by seismic waves, atmospheric fluctuations in pressure and temperature also lead to variations in local gravity. In this work, we advance the understanding of atmospheric GGN in vertical atom interferometers, formulating a robust characterization of its impact. We evaluate the effectiveness of underground placement of atom interferometers as a passive noise mitigation strategy. Additionally, we empirically derive global high- and low-noise models for atmospheric pressure GGN and estimate an analogous range for atmospheric temperature GGN. To highlight the variability of temperature-induced noise, we compare data from three prospective experimental sites. Our findings establish atmospheric GGN as comparable to seismic noise in its impact and underscore the importance of including these effects in site selection and active noise monitoring for future experiments.</description>

      <title>Quantum Logic Spectroscopy of an Electron and Positron for Precise Tests of the Standard Model</title>

Abstract: We propose a scheme for quantum logic spectroscopy of an electron or positron in a Penning trap. An electron or positron in a spectroscopy trap is coupled to a remote logic electron or positron via a wire to achieve motional entanglement. By separating the two traps, one can significantly improve magnetic field homogeneity, microwave characteristics, and detection sensitivity. The proposed scheme will improve the measurement precision of the electron's and positron's magnetic moments and charge-to-mass ratios, enabling precise tests of the Standard Model of particle physics.</description>
