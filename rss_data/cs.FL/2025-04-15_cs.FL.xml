      <title>Time for Timed Monitorability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monitoring is an important part of the verification toolbox, in particular in situations where exhaustive verification using, e.g., model-checking, is infeasible. The goal of online monitoring is to determine the satisfaction or violation of a specification during runtime, i.e., based on finite execution prefixes. However, not every specification is amenable to monitoring, e.g., properties for which no finite execution can witness satisfaction or violation. Monitorability is the question whether a given specification is amenable to monitoring, and has been extensively studied in discrete time.
  Here, we study, for the first time, the monitorability problem for real-time specifications. For specifications given by deterministic Timed Muller Automata, we prove decidability while we show that the problem is undecidable for specifications given by nondeterministic Timed B\"uchi automata. Furthermore, we refine monitorability to also determine bounds on the number of events as well as the time that must pass before monitoring the property may yield an informative verdict. We prove that for deterministic Timed Muller automata, such bounds can be effectively computed. In contrast we show that for nondeterministic Timed B\"uchi automata such bounds are not computable.</description>

      <title>Resolving Nondeterminism by Chance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: History-deterministic automata are those in which nondeterministic choices can be correctly resolved stepwise: there is a strategy to select a continuation of a run given the next input letter so that if the overall input word admits some accepting run, then the constructed run is also accepting.
  Motivated by checking qualitative properties in probabilistic verification, we consider the setting where the resolver strategy can randomize and only needs to succeed with lower-bounded probability. We study the expressiveness of such stochastically-resolvable automata as well as consider the decision questions of whether a given automaton has this property. In particular, we show that it is undecidable to check if a given NFA is $\lambda$-stochastically resolvable. This problem is decidable for finitely-ambiguous automata. We also present complexity upper and lower bounds for several well-studied classes of automata for which this problem remains decidable.</description>

      <title>Structure and computability of preimages in the Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conway's Game of Life is a two-dimensional cellular automaton. As a dynamical system, it is well-known to be computationally universal, i.e.\ capable of simulating an arbitrary Turing machine. We show that in a sense taking a single backwards step of the Game of Life is a computationally universal process, by constructing patterns whose preimage computation encodes an arbitrary circuit-satisfaction problem, or, equivalently, any tiling problem. As a corollary, we obtain for example that the set of orphans is coNP-complete, exhibit a $6210 \times 37800$-periodic configuration whose preimage is nonempty but contains no periodic configurations, and prove that the existence of a preimage for a periodic point is undecidable. Our constructions were obtained by a combination of computer searches and manual design.</description>

      <title>Efficient Runtime Verification of Real-Time Systems under Parametric Communication Delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18282v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Timed B\"uchi automata provide a very expressive formalism for expressing requirements of real-time systems. Online monitoring and active testing of embedded real-time systems can then be achieved by symbolic execution of such automata on the trace observed from the system. This direct construction however only is faithful if observation of the trace is immediate in the sense that the monitor (or test harness, respectively) can assign exact time stamps to the actions it observes, which is rarely true in practice due to the substantial and fluctuating parametric delays introduced by the circuitry connecting the observed system to its monitoring or testing device.
  We present purely zone-based online monitoring and testing algorithms, which handle such parametric delays exactly without recurrence to costly verification procedures for parametric timed automata. We have implemented our algorithms on top of the real-time model checking tool UPPAAL, and report on encouraging initial results.</description>

      <title>STLCCP: Efficient Convex Optimization-based Framework for Signal Temporal Logic Specifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09441v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Signal temporal logic (STL) is a powerful formalism for specifying various temporal properties in dynamical systems. However, existing methods, such as mixed-integer programming and nonlinear programming, often struggle to efficiently solve control problems with complex, long-horizon STL specifications. This study introduces \textit{STLCCP}, a novel convex optimization-based framework that leverages key structural properties of STL: monotonicity of the robustness function, its hierarchical tree structure, and correspondence between convexity/concavity in optimizations and conjunctiveness/disjunctiveness in specifications. The framework begins with a structure-aware decomposition of STL formulas, transforming the problem into an equivalent difference of convex (DC) programs. This is then solved sequentially as a convex quadratic program using an improved version of the convex-concave procedure (CCP). To further enhance efficiency, we develop a smooth approximation of the robustness function using a function termed the \textit{mellowmin} function, specifically tailored to the proposed framework. Numerical experiments on motion planning benchmarks demonstrate that \textit{STLCCP} can efficiently handle complex scenarios over long horizons, outperforming existing methods.</description>

      <title>Fractals from Regular Behaviours</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03894v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We forge connections between the theory of fractal sets obtained as attractors of iterated function systems and process calculi. To this end, we reinterpret Milner's expressions for processes as contraction operators on a complete metric space. When the space is, for example, the plane, the denotations of fixed point terms correspond to familiar fractal sets. We give a sound and complete axiomatization of fractal equivalence, the congruence on terms consisting of pairs that construct identical self-similar sets in all interpretations. We further make connections to labelled Markov chains and to invariant measures. In all of this work, we use important results from process calculi. For example, we use Rabinovich's completeness theorem for trace equivalence in our own completeness theorem. In addition to our results, we also raise many questions related to both fractals and process calculi.</description>

      <title>Membership problems in nilpotent groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15504v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study both the Submonoid Membership problem and the Rational Subset Membership problem in finitely generated nilpotent groups. We give two reductions with important applications. First, Submonoid Membership in any nilpotent group can be reduced to Rational Subset Membership in smaller groups. As a corollary, we prove the existence of a group with decidable Submonoid Membership and undecidable Rational Subset Membership, confirming a conjecture of Lohrey and Steinberg. Second, the Rational Subset Membership problem in $H_3(\mathbb Z)$ can be reduced to the Knapsack problem in the same group, and is therefore decidable. Combining both results, we deduce that the filiform $3$-step nilpotent group has decidable Submonoid Membership.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Safety Verification using Barrier Certificates and Matrix Zonotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01007v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ensuring safety in cyber-physical systems (CPSs) is a critical challenge, especially when system models are difficult to obtain or cannot be fully trusted due to uncertainty, modeling errors, or environmental disturbances. Traditional model-based approaches rely on precise system dynamics, which may not be available in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose a data-driven safety verification framework that leverages matrix zonotopes and barrier certificates to verify system safety directly from noisy data. Instead of trusting a single unreliable model, we construct a set of models that capture all possible system dynamics that align with the observed data, ensuring that the true system model is always contained within this set. This model set is compactly represented using matrix zonotopes, enabling efficient computation and propagation of uncertainty. By integrating this representation into a barrier certificate framework, we establish rigorous safety guarantees without requiring an explicit system model. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in verifying safety for dynamical systems with unknown models, showcasing its potential for real-world CPS applications.</description>

      <title>Prophecies all the Way: Game-based Model-Checking for HyperQPTL beyond $\forall^*\exists^*$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08575v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model-checking HyperLTL, a temporal logic expressing properties of sets of traces with applications to information-flow based security and privacy, has a decidable, but TOWER-complete, model-checking problem. In the classical algorithm, the complexity manifests itself with a need for the complementation of automata over infinite words. To overcome this aforementioned need, a game-based alternative for the $\forall^*\exists^*$-fragment was recently presented.
  Here, we employ imperfect information-games to extend the game-based approach to full HyperQPTL, i.e., we allow arbitrary quantifier prefixes and quantification over propositions, which allows us to express every $\omega$-regular hyperproperty. As a byproduct of our game-based algorithm, we obtain finite-state implementations of Skolem functions via transducers with lookahead that explain satisfaction or violation of HyperQPTL properties.</description>
