      <title>A probabilistic match classification model for sports tournaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing match classification models in the tournament design literature have two major limitations: a contestant is considered indifferent only if uncertain future results do never affect its prize, and competitive matches are not distinguished with respect to the incentives of the contestants. We propose a probabilistic framework to address both issues. For each match, our approach relies on simulating all other matches played simultaneously or later to compute the qualifying probabilities under the three main outcomes (win, draw, loss), which allows the classification of each match into six different categories. The suggested model is applied to the previous group stage and the new incomplete round-robin league, introduced in the 2024/25 season of UEFA club competitions. An incomplete round-robin tournament is found to contain fewer stakeless matches where both contestants are indifferent, and substantially more matches where both contestants should play offensively. However, the robustly higher proportion of potentially collusive matches can threaten with serious scandals.</description>

      <title>Reproducing the first and second moment of empirical degree distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10373v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of probabilistic models for the analysis of complex networks represents a flourishing research field. Among the former, Exponential Random Graphs (ERGs) have gained increasing attention over the years. So far, only linear ERGs have been extensively employed to gain insight into the structural organisation of real-world complex networks. None, however, is capable of accounting for the variance of the empirical degree distribution. To this aim, non-linear ERGs must be considered. After showing that the usual mean-field approximation forces the degree-corrected version of the two-star model to degenerate, we define a fitness-induced variant of it. Such a `softened' model is capable of reproducing the sample variance, while retaining the explanatory power of its linear counterpart, within a purely canonical framework.</description>

      <title>Scaling intra-urban climate fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19998v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Urban-induced changes in local microclimate, such as urban heat islands and air pollution, are known to vary with city size, leading to distinctive relations between average climate variables and city-scale quantities (e.g., total population). However, these approaches suffer from biases related to the choice of city boundaries and they neglect intra-urban variations of urban characteristics. Here, we use high-resolution data of urban temperatures, air quality, population, and street networks from 142 cities worldwide and show that their marginal and joint probability distributions collapse onto a set of general scaling functions. Using a logarithmic relation between urban spatial features and climate variables, we find that average street network properties are sufficient to characterize the entire variability of the temperature and air pollution fields observed within and across cities. These findings provide a unified statistical framework for characterizing intra-urban climate variability, with important implications for climate modeling and urban planning.</description>

      <title>Extending the Biswas--Chatterjee--Sen model with nonconformists and inflexibles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Originally, the Biswas--Chatterjee--Sen model exhibits an order/disorder phase transition for a sufficiently large number of negative interactions among actors. In this paper, the model is extended by the nonconformists and inflexibles. Nonconformists are actors who do not follow the original model rules, but in different ways do something opposite. We introduce inflexibles as actors who does not change their opinions. Both discrete and continuous opinions are considered. With direct Monte Carlo simulations and mean-field calculations, we check the influence of fractions of nonconformists and inflexibles on mean opinion in the system. With the mean-field calculations we identify ranges of fractions of nonconformists where ordered phase of the system is available. The results of the mean-field calculations perfectly match the results of the Monte Carlo simulations. We consider inflexibles adhered: (i) to extreme opinions; (ii) to specific opinions and (iii) chosen independently of their initial opinion. For inflexibles adhered to specific and extreme opinions they play a role of effective bias suppressing disorder phase in the system. The qualitative results of introducing nonconformists (inflexibles) in various ways (discrete/continuous opinions and annealed/quenched disorder) are roughly the same. However, for the model extended by inflexibles, we can observe a systematic shift of the mean order parameter to its higher values for quenched disorder compared with annealed disorder.</description>

      <title>A practical scenario generation method for electricity prices on day-ahead and intraday spot markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing interest in demand-side management (DSM) as part of the energy cost optimization calls for effective methods to determine representative electricity prices for energy optimization and scheduling investigations. We propose a practical method to construct price profiles of day-ahead (DA) and intraday (ID) electricity spot markets. We construct single-day and single-week price profiles based on historical market time series to provide ready-to-use price data sets. Our method accounts for dominant mechanisms in price variation to preserve critical statistical features (e.g., mean and standard deviation) and transient patterns in the constructed profiles. Unlike common scenario generation approaches, the method is deterministic, with few degrees of freedom and minimal application effort. Our method ensures consistency between ID and DA price profiles when both are considered and introduces profile scaling to enable multiple scenario generation. Finally, we compare the constructed profiles to clustering techniques in a DSM case study, noting similar cost results.</description>

      <title>Optimal control of a kinetic model describing social interactions on a graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce the optimal control of a kinetic model describing agents who migrate on a graph and interact within its nodes exchanging a physical quantity. As a prototype model, we consider the spread of an infectious disease on a graph, so that the exchanged quantity is the viral-load. The control, exerted on both the mobility and on the interactions separately, aims at minimising the average macroscopic viral-load.
  We prove that minimising the average viral-load weighted by the mass in each node is the most effective and convenient strategy. We consider two different interactions: in the first one the infection (gain) and the healing (loss) processes happen within the same interaction, while in the second case the infection and healing result from two different processes. With the appropriate controls, we prove that in the first case it is possible to stop the increase of the disease, but paying a very high cost in terms of control, while in the second case it is possible to eradicate the disease. We test numerically the role of each intervention and the interplay between the mobility and the interaction control strategies in each model.</description>
