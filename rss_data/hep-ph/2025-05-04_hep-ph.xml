      <title>Study of electron-positron annihilation into four pions within chiral effective field theory in the low energy region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we employ chiral effective field theory to study the process of electron-positron annihilation into four pions in the low energy region within $E_{c.m.}\leq 0.6$ GeV. The prediction of the cross-section is obtained through $SU(3)$ chiral perturbation theory up to the next-to-leading order, which is smaller than the experimental data in the energy region [0.6-0.65] GeV, though the data has only a few points and poor statistics. Then, the resonance chiral theory is applied to include the resonance contribution, with the lightest scalars and vectors written in the effective Lagrangians. A series of relevant decay widths and the masses of the vectors are studied to fix the unknown couplings. The resonance contribution should be one order larger than that of the chiral perturbation theory but still one to two orders smaller than the data.The significant discrepancy urged the new experimental measurements to give more guidance.We also compute the hadronic vacuum polarization contribution from the four pion channels to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, $(g-2)_\mu$. In the energy range from threshold up to 0.6 GeV within RChT,the contributions are $a_\mu=(0.6678\pm0.0933)\times10^{-16}$ and $a_\mu=(0.4575\pm0.0517)\times10^{-16}$ for the processes of $e^+e^-\to\pi^+\pi^+\pi^-\pi^-$, $\pi^0\pi^0\pi^+\pi^-$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Detecting gravitational signatures of dark matter with atom gradiometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the purely gravitational signatures of dark matter from the ultralight to the ultraheavy mass range in proposed long-baseline atom gradiometers. Due to their exceptional acceleration sensitivity, proposed space-based experiments, such as MAGIS-space, AEDGE and AEDGE+, could detect a dark matter subcomponent which constitutes $\mathcal{O}(10\%)$ of the local dark matter energy density and is populated by compact clumps of mass between $10^6$ kg and $10^{10}$ kg ($10^{-25}~M_\odot\lesssim M \lesssim 10^{-21}~M_\odot$), in an otherwise unexplored region of dark matter model space. Furthermore, because the gravitational observable depends on the relative gravitational time delay measured by spatially separated atomic clouds, we find that atom gradiometers are parametrically more sensitive than laser interferometers, such as LIGO and LISA, to fast-oscillating spacetime perturbations sourced by energy density and pressure fluctuations of ultralight dark matter. In optimistic scenarios, space-based experiments are projected to probe a DM overdensity of $\mathcal{O}(10)$ times the local dark matter energy density for masses $m\lesssim 10^{-17}$ eV. We therefore conclude that proposed atom gradiometers may be poised to detect dark matter through purely gravitational interactions.</description>

      <title>Holographic Heavy Quark Energy Loss in the Hybrid Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To date, holographic calculations in strongly coupled plasma have provided separate descriptions for the rates of energy loss either for ultrarelativistic massless quarks and gluons or for infinitely massive quarks, with the latter calculation valid for $\sqrt{\gamma} &lt; M/(\sqrt{\lambda}T)$, where $\gamma$ is the Lorentz boost factor for a heavy quark with velocity $v$ and mass $M$ moving through plasma with 't Hooft coupling $\lambda$ and temperature $T$. These two calculations should apply sequentially in the description of the energy loss of a heavy quark that starts out ultrarelativistic, loses energy, slows down, becomes non-relativistic at later times, and ultimately comes to rest and diffuses in the strongly coupled plasma. We provide an ansatz for uniquely incorporating both regimes to give an approximate but unified description of how a heavy quark that is initially ultrarelativistic loses energy all the way until it comes to rest. We implement this ansatz in the Hybrid Strong/Weak Coupling Model. With this new, consistent, treatment of heavy quark energy loss at strong coupling, we confront our predictions for the suppression and azimuthal anisotropies of D- and B-mesons, as well as B-tagged jets, with available experimental data.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Maximization and Mirror Symmetry in Two-Higgs-Doublet Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider 2-to-2 scatterings of Higgs bosons in a CP-conserving two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM) and study the implication of maximizing the entanglement in the flavor space, where the two doublets $\Phi_a$, $a=1,2$, can be viewed as a qubit: $\Phi_1=|0\rangle$ and $\Phi_2=|1\rangle$. More specifically, we compute the scattering amplitudes for $\Phi_a \Phi_b \to \Phi_c \Phi_d$ and require the outgoing flavor entanglement to be maximal for a full product basis such as the computational basis, which consists of $\{|00\rangle,|01\rangle,|10\rangle,|11\rangle\}$. In the unbroken phase and turning off the gauge interactions, entanglement maximization results in the appearance of an $U(2)\times U(2)$ global symmetry among the quartic couplings, which in general is broken softly by the mass terms. Interestingly, once the Higgs bosons acquire vacuum expectation values, maximal entanglement enforces an exact $U(2) \times U(2)$ symmetry, which is spontaneously broken to $U(1)\times U(1)$. As a byproduct, this gives rise to Higgs alignment as well as to the existence of 6 massless Nambu-Goldstone bosons. The $U(2)\times U(2)$ symmetry can be gauged to lift the massless Goldstones, while maintaining maximal entanglement demands the presence of a discrete $\mathrm{Z}_2$ symmetry interchanging the two gauge sectors. The model is custodially invariant in the scalar sector, and the inclusion of fermions requires a mirror dark sector, related to the standard one by the $\mathrm{Z}_2$ symmetry.</description>

      <title>Hubble-induced phase transitions in the Standard Model and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the dynamics of spectator scalar fields non-minimally coupled to gravity in the post-inflationary Universe, with particular emphasis on scenarios where the end of inflation is followed by a period of kination. In this context, the evolution of the Ricci scalar can lead to the spontaneous breaking of discrete or continuous symmetries through tachyonic instabilities. These Hubble-induced phase transitions may cause the amplification of field fluctuations, the formation of transient topological defects, and an efficient energy transfer into relativistic degrees of freedom. We analyze this general mechanism and its cosmological consequences, including (re)heating and gravitational wave production. As a concrete realization, we discuss the postinflationary evolution of the Standard Model Higgs, examining the interplay between curvature effects, vacuum stability, and non-perturbative dynamics. This framework provides a minimal and predictive connection between high-energy physics and the early Universe, with potential observational signatures.</description>

      <title>Photoproduction and detection of $\rho'\rightarrow\pi^+\pi^-\pi^+\pi^-$ decays in ultra-peripheral collisions and at an electron-ion collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vector meson photoproduction is an important probe of nuclear structure. Light vector mesons are most sensitive to low$-x$ structure, as long as they are not too light for perturbative QCD calculations. The $\rho'$ is of interest as an intermediate mass state (between the $\rho$ and $J/\psi$) that is easier to detect than the $\phi$.
  Using HERA data on proton targets, we make projections for lead/gold targets in UPCs at the Large Hadron Collider and RHIC, and for $ep$ and $eA$ collisions at a future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). These projections for ion targets depend on the largely-unknown $\rho'\rightarrow\pi^+\pi^-\pi^+\pi^-$ branching ratio, and use existing data to constrain that branching ratio. Current data points to a relatively low branching ratio, less than 50\%. The HERA $ep$ and ALICE UPC $e$Pb data exhibit very similar $4\pi$ mass spectra, indicating that, if the system is composed of two resonances, the products of their photon couplings with their four-pion branching ratios are similar.
  The predicted rates are high for both UPCs and the EIC. The $\rho'\rightarrow\pi^+\pi^-\pi^+\pi^-$ decay can be observed at the EIC with high efficiency. In $ep$ collisions at the highest energy, the forward B0 detector is needed to observe this channel down to the lowest achievable Bjorken$-x$ values.</description>

      <title>Calculations of Di-Hadron Production via Two-Photon Processes in Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-photon processes in relativistic heavy-ion collisions have emerged as a critical probe of quantum electrodynamics in ultra-intense electromagnetic fields, with recent focus extending beyond dileptons to hadronic final states. At present, quantitative studies of di-hadron production via two-photon interactions remain scarce. In this work, we employ the Equivalent Photon Approximation to obtain differential cross-section predictions for pi+pi-, K+K-, and p pbar pairs produced in ultra-peripheral Au+Au collisions at sqrt(s_NN) = 200 GeV within the STAR acceptance. The calculations deliver the unified baseline for light-meson and baryon pairs in this environment, supplying benchmarks for upcoming STAR measurements and guiding future systematic investigations of hadronic two-photon processes at RHIC and LHC facilities.</description>

      <title>Influence of the residual magnetic field on the azimuthal distribution of final-state particles in photon-nuclear processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In relativistic heavy-ion collisions, charged particles are accelerated to nearly the speed of light, and their external electromagnetic fields can be effectively approximated as quasi-real photons. These photons interact with another nucleus via photon-nuclear interactions, producing vector mesons. These vector mesons possess extremely low transverse momentum (pT ~ 0.1 GeV/c), distinguishing them from particles produced via hadronic interactions. STAR and ALICE have observed J/psi, rho0 and other vector mesons with very low pT, which are well described by photoproduction models. This unique characteristic of having extremely low transverse momentum allows them to serve as a novel experimental probe. Recent STAR results show that the equivalent photons in photoproduction processes are fully linearly polarized, affecting the azimuthal distribution of final-state particles like rho0 -&gt; pi+ pi-. Since the polarization links to the initial collision geometry, the rho0 azimuthal modulation can probe nuclear structure. However, the post-collision magnetic field may deflect these particles, distorting the azimuthal distribution and complicating structure measurements. We simulated the distribution of residual magnetic fields over time under different collision conditions using UrQMD for Au+Au collisions at sqrt(sNN)=200 GeV and calculated their effects on the azimuthal modulation (&lt;cos 2phi&gt;) of photoproduced rho0. Our results show that in peripheral collisions, the field significantly alters the for photoproduced rho0 with pT ~ 0.1 GeV/c. This provides key insights for future nuclear structure studies via photoproduction in peripheral collisions.</description>

      <title>Probing Kaons as Light-Strange Tetraquarks through Spectral and Decay Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the discovery of several kaon-like states observed at BESIII and LHCb, this study explores S-wave and P-wave tetraquark states with quark contents $ss\bar{s}\bar{q}$ and $sq\bar{q}\bar{q}$ using potential-based phenomenology. The tetraquarks are modeled as diquark-antidiquark systems in antitriplet-triplet and sextet-antisextet color configurations. The mass spectra are calculated using the Cornell potential, while decay properties are analyzed through Fierz rearrangement. A comparison with experimentally observed states is provided to enhance our understanding of light-light tetraquark systems with non-homogeneous quark compositions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the leading twist valence quark transverse momentum parton distribution functions (TMDs) and generalized parton distributions (GPDs) of the charged kaons in an isospin symmetric nuclear matter at zero temperature by employing the light-cone quark model. The medium modifications of the unpolarized TMDs and GPDs have been carried out by taking inputs from the chiral SU($3$) quark mean field model. The electromagnetic form factors (EMFFs) and charge radii have been calculated from the unpolarized GPDs for both the vacuum and in-medium cases. We have also calculated the variation of average transverse and longitudinal momenta for the active quark at high baryonic density. These results are found to be in good agreement with the available experimental data as well as with other model predictions.</description>

      <title>EFT analysis of New Physics at COHERENT with Dirac neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the sensitivity of COHERENT-like experiments to non-standard contributions within the so-called $\nu$WEFT framework. The latter is the most general low-energy effective field theory that includes not only the light SM fields but also additional right-handed Dirac neutrinos. Our analysis includes for the first time flavor-general New Physics effects in neutrino production (pion and muon decays) and neutrino detection (through Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering). Despite the generality, the results can be written in compact form and are easy to implement in existing or future analyses using effective nuclear charges. We use current COHERENT data to set constraints on the corresponding effective operators, and we estimate the sensitivity of future measurements.</description>

      <title>Semileptonic Decays of $D \to \rho l^+ \nu$ and $D_{(s)} \to K^\ast l^+ \nu$ from Light-Cone Sum Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the semileptonic decays of charmed mesons to light vector mesons within the framework of light-cone sum rules. Our calculation is performed at leading order in QCD coupling, incorporating contributions up to twist-five accuracy from both two-particle and three-particle light-cone distribution amplitudes. Transition form factors are predicted twist by twist to assess the convergence property of the operator product expansion. It is verified that the twist-four and twist-five contributions are indeed negligible for all the decays under consideration. Twist-three dominance is observed for some of the form factors, subject to heavy quark effective field theory interpretation. Branching ratios for the decays $D^+ \to \rho^0 \ell^+\nu_\ell$ , $D_s^+ \to K^{\ast0} \ell^+\nu_\ell$, $D^0 \to K^{\ast-} \ell^+\nu_\ell$ and $D^+ \to \bar{K}^{\ast0} \ell^+\nu_\ell$ are obtained, and a $10\%$--$20\%$ discrepancy from experimental measurements is found. Our finding indicates that the resonant-width and non-resonant QCD backgrounds effects should be potentially significant, implying the necessity to further implement their contributions in future precision studies of the semileptonic charm decays.</description>

      <title>Identifying regions for asymptotic expansions of amplitudes: fundamentals and recent advances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review paper discusses the identification of regions, a crucial first step in applying the "method-of-regions" technique. A systematic approach based on Newton polytope geometry has proven successful and efficient for many cases. However, obtaining the correct list of regions becomes increasingly subtle with higher loop numbers or specific Feynman graph topologies. This paper explores the scenarios where such subtleties arise, outlines general strategies to address them, and reviews the current understanding of region structures in various asymptotic expansions of Feynman integrals.</description>

      <title>Non-Standard Neutrino Interactions at Neutrino Experiments and Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of new physics on the interactions of neutrinos with other particles can be parametrized by a set of effective four-fermion operators called non-standard neutrino interactions (NSIs). This NSI framework is useful for studying the complementarity between different types of neutrino experiments. In this work, we further compare the reach of neutrino experiments with high-energy collider experiments. Since high-energy colliders often probe the mass scale associated with the four-fermion operators, the effective field theory approach becomes invalid and explicit models must be utilized. We study a variety of representative simplified models including new U(1) gauge bosons, scalar leptoquarks, and heavy neutral leptons. For each of these, we examine the model parameter space constrained by NSI bounds from current and future neutrino experiments, and by data from the Large Hadron Collider and planned electron-positron and muon colliders. We find that in the models we study, with the possible exceptions of muon-philic leptoquarks and heavy neutral leptons mixing with electron or muon neutrinos, collider searches are more constraining than neutrino measurements. Additionally, we briefly comment on other model building possibilities for obtaining models where neutrino experiments are most constraining.</description>

      <title>Dirac Scoto Inverse-Seesaw from $A_4$ Flavor Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Dirac scotogenic-like one loop radiative model where the stability of dark matter is intricately linked to the breaking of $A_4$ flavor symmetry. This breaking induces a $Z_2$ dark symmetry, stabilizing the dark matter candidate. The breaking of $A_4 \to Z_2$ leads to cutting the loop and facilitating a "scoto inverse-seesaw" mass mechanism responsible for neutrino mass generation. This elucidates the explicit explanation of two mass-squared differences, $\Delta m^2_{\rm{atm}}$ and $\Delta m^2_{\rm{sol}}$ observed in neutrino oscillations. Our model accounts for normal and inverted ordering of neutrino masses, revealing sharp correlations between $\sum m_i$ and $\langle m_{\beta} \rangle$. It also shows strong compatibility with current data in the $\delta_{CP}$-$\theta_{23}$ plane. Moreover, stringent constraints on scalar masses narrow down the viable dark matter mass regions, accommodating $SU(2)_L$ singlet and doublet scalar dark matter as well as fermionic dark matter. Additionally, our model presents a viable avenue for addressing lepton flavor violating decays while remaining consistent with current experimental constraints.</description>

      <title>Neutrino mass generation in asymptotically safe gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There exist several distinct phenomenological models to generate neutrino masses. We explore, which of these models can consistently be embedded in a quantum theory of gravity and matter. We proceed by invoking a minimal number of degrees of freedom beyond the Standard Model. Thus, we first investigate whether the Weinberg operator, a dimension-five-operator that generates neutrino masses without requiring degrees of freedom beyond the Standard Model, can arise in asymptotically safe quantum gravity. We find a negative answer with far-reaching consequences: new degrees of freedom beyond gravity and the Standard Model are necessary to give neutrinos a mass in the asymptotic-safety paradigm. Second, we explore whether the type-I Seesaw mechanism is viable and discover an upper bound on the Seesaw scale. The bound depends on the mass of the visible neutrino. We find a numerical value of $10^{14}\, \rm GeV$ for this bound when neglecting neutrino mixing for a visible mass of $10^{-10}\, \rm GeV$. Conversely, for the most ``natural" value of the Seesaw scale in a quantum-gravity setting, which is the Planck scale, we predict an upper bound for the neutrino mass of the visible neutrino of approximately $10^{-15}\, \rm GeV$. Third, we explore whether neutrinos could also be Pseudo-Dirac-neutrinos in asymptotic safety and find that this possibility can be accommodated.</description>

      <title>JFlow: Model-Independent Spherical Jeans Analysis using Equivariant Continuous Normalizing Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The kinematics of stars in dwarf spheroidal galaxies have been studied to understand the structure of dark matter halos. However, the kinematic information of these stars is often limited to celestial positions and line-of-sight velocities, making full phase space analysis challenging. Conventional methods rely on projected analytic phase space density models with several parameters and infer dark matter halo structures by solving the spherical Jeans equation. In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised machine learning method for solving the spherical Jeans equation in a model-independent way as a first step toward model-independent analysis of dwarf spheroidal galaxies. Using equivariant continuous normalizing flows, we demonstrate that spherically symmetric stellar phase space densities and velocity dispersions can be estimated without model assumptions. As a proof of concept, we apply our method to Gaia challenge datasets for spherical models and measure dark matter mass densities given velocity anisotropy profiles. Our method can identify halo structures accurately, even with a small number of tracer stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel type of soliton dubbed soft oscillons. In contrast with conventional oscillons the soft counterparts come in a continuum of unboundedly large sizes. They are peculiar also in that the oscillation frequency is set by their size and in their high harmonic content, that leads to a peculiar core structure and pulsating emission of radiation. Soft oscillons appear in a broad class of scalar field theories with plateau potentials and owe their existence to a simple confinement mechanism: a large field perturbation automatically acts as a cavity that traps massless modes. We study the classical evaporation rate, lifetime and stability under anisotropic deformations. Soft oscillons are longer lived in gapless models, where lifetimes can reach 100 times the initial radius or more.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Physics Beyond Collider (PBC) Study Group was initially mandated by the CERN Management to prepare the previous European Particle Physics Strategy Update for CERN projects other than the high-energy frontier colliders. The main findings were summarized in an PBC Summary Report submitted to the Strategy Update. Following the Update process, the PBC Study Group was confirmed on a permanent basis with an updated mandate taking into account the strategy recommendations. The Study Group is now in charge of supporting the proponents of new ideas to address the technical issues and physics motivation of the projects ahead of their review by the CERN Scientific Committees and decision by the Management. The present document updates the previous PBC summary report to inform the new ongoing European Particle Physics Strategy Update process, taking into account the evolution of the CERN and worldwide landscapes and the new projects under consideration within the Study Group.</description>

      <title>Reheating ACTs on Starobinsky and Higgs inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the recent sixth data release (DR6) of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) collaboration, the value of $n_{\rm s}=0.9743 \pm 0.0034$ for the scalar spectral index is reported, which excludes the Starobinsky and Higgs inflationary models at $2\sigma$ level. In this paper, we perform a Bayesian inference of the parameters of the Starobinsky or Higgs inflationary model with non-instantaneous reheating using the Markov chain Monte Carlo method. For the analysis, we use observational data on the cosmic microwave background collected by the Planck and ACT collaborations and on baryonic acoustic oscillations from the DESI collaboration. The reheating stage is modelled by a single parameter $R_{\rm reh}$. Using the modified Boltzmann code CLASS and the cobaya software with the GetDist package, we perform a direct inference of the model parameter space and obtain their posterior distributions. Using the Kullback--Leibler divergence, we estimate the information gain from the data, yielding $2.52$ bits for the reheating parameter. Inclusion of the ACT DR6 data provides $75\%$ more information about the reheating stage compared to analysis without ACT data. We draw constraints on the reheating temperature and the average equation of state. While the former can vary within $10$ orders of magnitude, values in the $95\,\%$ credible interval indicate a sufficiently low reheating temperature; for the latter there is a clear preference for values greater than $0.5$, which means that the conventional equations of state for dust $\omega=0$ and relativistic matter $\omega=1/3$ are excluded with more than $2\sigma$ level of significance. However, there still is a big part of parameter space where Starobinsky and Higgs inflationary models exhibit a high degree of consistency with the latest observational data, particularly from ACT DR6. Therefore, it is premature to reject these models.</description>

      <title>Perturbative LVS and Inflation: A Review of Volume Modulus and Fibre Scenarios</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In type IIB superstring compactifications, incorporating log-loop corrections and higher-derivative ${(\alpha^\prime)}^3$-corrections can stabilize the overall volume of the compact internal space at exponentially large values. This mechanism forms the basis of the perturbative Large Volume Scenario (LVS). In this report, we briefly review two inflationary models realized within the perturbative LVS framework. The first one is the volume modulus inflation (also known as inflection point inflation) and the second one is popularly known as fibre inflation. Using an explict Calabi-Yau orientifold, some concrete global embeddings of both models are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Redshift-space bispectrum in presence of massive neutrinos: A multipole expansion approach for Euclid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive neutrinos imprint distinctive signatures on the evolution of cosmic structures, notably suppressing small-scale clustering. We investigate the impact of massive neutrinos on the galaxy bispectrum in redshift-space, adopting a spherical harmonic multipole decomposition $B_L^m(k_1, \mu, t)$, that captures the full angular dependence. We develop an analytical and numerical framework incorporating neutrino-corrected perturbation theory kernels and redshift-space distortions. Our results demonstrate that the linear triangle configurations are particularly sensitive to massive neutrinos, with deviations reaching up to $\sim 2\%$ for a total mass $\sum m_\nu = 0.12\,\mathrm{eV}$. To assess detection prospects in galaxy surveys like \textit{Euclid}, we compute the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for individual multipoles, including the effects of Finger-of-God damping and shot noise. The neutrino-induced signatures in $B_0^0$ and $B_2^0$ are found to be detectable with SNR $\gtrsim 5$ across a range of configurations, even after accounting for small-scale suppression. Higher-order multipoles such as $B_2^1$ and $B_2^2$ are moderately sensitive, with SNR $\gtrsim$ ($2-3$) in squeezed limits, while hexadecapole moments are more suppressed but still exhibit measurable signals at high $k_1$. Additionally, the SNR generally increases with wave number $k_1$, particularly for squeezed and stretched triangles, suggesting that access to smaller scales significantly enhances detection prospects.Our study highlights the potential of the redshift-space bispectrum multipoles as sensitive probes of massive neutrinos, complementing traditional power spectrum analyses, and underscores the importance of angular information and higher-order statistics for galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Memory of Primordial Black Hole Mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gravitational wave signal of binary compact objects has two main contributions at frequencies below the characteristic merger frequency: the gravitational wave signal associated with the early inspiral stage of the binary and the non-linear gravitational wave memory. We compare the sensitivity of upcoming gravitational wave detectors to these two contributions, with a particular interest in events with a merger phase at frequencies higher than the detector's peak sensitivity. We demonstrate that for light primordial black holes, current and upcoming detectors are more sensitive to the inspiral signal. Our analysis incorporates the evolution history of primordial black hole binaries, key to accurately estimating the relevant event rates. We also discuss the waveform templates of the memory signal at ground- and space-based interferometers, and the implications for a matched filtering search. This allows us to compare the sensitivity of high-frequency gravitational wave detectors, sensitive to the merger phase, with the sensitivity of existing interferometers.</description>

      <title>Coupled-channel scattering of $DD, DD^*$ and $D^* D^*$ in isospin-$1$ from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first coupled-channel determination of two-body $D$ and $D^*$ scattering amplitudes in isospin-$1$ from lattice quantum chromodynamics is presented. Using three lattice volumes at $m_\pi \approx 391~\mathrm{MeV}$, finite-volume energies relevant for the channels of interest are determined. Through the L\"uscher formalism, these energies are used to constrain amplitudes of coupled $J^P=0^+$ $DD - DD^*$, $J^P=1^+$ $DD^*- D^*D^*$ and $J^P=2^+$ $DD - DD^* - D^* D^*$ scattering. All channels feature weakly repulsive interactions in $S$ wave, except for a weak $D^* D^*$ attraction in $J^P=0^+$. No amplitude singularities corresponding to physical states are found. Some of these amplitudes will be a necessary component of future lattice QCD analyses of $DD\pi$ and $DD^*$ scattering taking into account three-body and left-hand cut effects.</description>

      <title>Evolution of the transverse-momentum dependent gluon distribution at small $x$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the colour dipole picture for photon-nucleus interactions at small $x$ together with the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) effective theory, we demonstrate that the next-to-leading (NLO) order corrections to the cross-section for the inclusive production of a pair of hard jets encode not only the JIMWLK evolution with decreasing $x$, but also the DGLAP evolution of the gluon distribution function and the CSS evolution of the gluon transverse momentum dependent (TMD) distribution. The emergent CSS equation takes the form of a rate equation describing the evolution of the dijet distribution in the transverse momentum imbalance $K_\perp$ when increasing the dijet relative momentum $P_\perp$. All three types of evolution become important when both $P_\perp$ and $K_\perp$ are much larger than the nuclear saturation momentum $Q_s(x)$ and we propose a framework which encompasses all of them. The solution to the JIMWLK equation provides the source term for the DGLAP evolution with increasing $K_\perp$, which in turn generates the initial condition for the CSS evolution with increasing $P_\perp$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the properties of self-conjugate dark matter (DM) particles that predominantly interact with Standard Model electroweak gauge bosons, using an effective field theory approach. The study emphasizes effective contact interactions, invariant under the Standard Model gauge group, between vector DM and SM-neutral electroweak gauge bosons. Focusing on interaction terms up to dimension-8, we establish constraints on the model parameters based on the observed DM relic density and indirect detection signals. We also examine the prospects for dark matter-nucleon scattering in direct detection experiments. In addition, we analyze the sensitivity of low-energy LEP data to the pair production of light DM particles (with masses up to 80 GeV). Finally, we assess the potential of the proposed International Linear Collider (ILC) to probe these effective operators through the detection of DM particles produced in association with mono-photons.</description>

      <title>Hierarchies from deterministic non-locality in theory space Anderson localisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nearest-neighbour or local mass terms in theory space among quantum fields, with their generic disordered values, are known to lead to the localisation of mass eigenstates, analogous to Anderson localisation in a one-dimensional lattice. This mechanism can be used to create an exponential hierarchy in the coupling between two fields by placing them at opposite ends of the lattice chain. Extending this mechanism, we show that when copies of such fields are appropriately attached to the lattice chain, it leads to the emergence of multiple massless modes. These vanishing masses are a direct consequence of the locality of interactions in theory space. The latter may break down in an ordered and deterministic manner through quantum effects if additional interactions exist among the chain fields. Such non-locality can induce small masses for the otherwise massless modes without necessarily delocalising the mass eigenstates. We provide examples of interactions that preserve or even enhance localisation. Applications to flavour hierarchies, neutrino mass, and the $\mu$-problem in supersymmetric theories are discussed.</description>

      <title>No gauge cancellation at high energy in the five-vector $R_\xi$ gauge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel $R_\xi$ gauge in the five-vector (5V) framework within the Abelian Higgs model. In the Cartesian basis of the complex Higgs field, the 5V $R_\xi$ gauge ensures non-divergent tree-level amplitudes for each Feynman diagram in the high-energy limit. This framework pinpoints the origin of high-energy divergences in tree-level amplitudes for each diagram, providing a criterion for quantifying the degree of divergences from other gauges. The 5V description necessitates treating the Goldstone field as the fifth gauge-field component, offering deeper insight into the dynamics of massive gauge bosons, particularly its longitudinal mode. The impact of this framework is demonstrated by rigorously comparing tree-level amplitudes from the 5V $R_\xi$ gauge with those from the conventional 4V $R_\xi$ gauge and the Feynman diagram gauge, the latter of which exhibits no gauge cancellation, similar to the 5V $R_\xi$ gauge.</description>

      <title>Oscillating scalar potential and its implications for cosmic neutrino background searches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel mechanism in which an external oscillatory wave modulates the mass-squared term of a scalar potential, periodically switching its sign. As a result of this "potential oscillation," the vacuum transitions between symmetry-broken and symmetry-restored phases. This repeated toggling leads to a time-varying vacuum state with rich phenomenological consequences, driven by the scalar field's couplings to other sectors. As a concrete illustration, we demonstrate how these oscillations can open a new avenue for probing the cosmic neutrino background.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the sea: universality of the transverse momentum dependent quark distributions at small $x$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the Colour Glass Condensate effective theory, we demonstrate that back-to-back dijet correlations in dilute-dense collisions involving a small-$x$ quark from the nuclear target can be factorised in terms of universal transverse momentum dependent distributions (TMDs) for the sea quarks. Two building blocks are needed to construct all these TMDs at the operator level: the sea quark TMD operator which appears in semi-inclusive Deep-Inelastic Scattering (SIDIS) or in the Drell-Yan process and the elastic $S$-matrix for a quark-antiquark dipole. Compared to SIDIS, the saturation effects are stronger for dijet production in forward proton-nucleus collisions, due to additional scattering in the initial and final state, effectively resulting in a larger value for the nuclear saturation momentum.</description>

      <title>Phase Boundary of Nuclear Matter in Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nuclear matter with a strong magnetic field is prevalent inside neutron stars and heavy-ion collisions. In a sufficiently large magnetic field the ground state is either a chiral soliton lattice (CSL), an array of solitons of the neutral pion field, or a domain-wall Skyrmion phase in which Skyrmions emerge inside the chiral solitons. In the region of large chemical potential and a magnetic field lower than its critical value for CSL, a Skyrmion crystal is expected to take up the ground state based on the chiral perturbation theory at the next leading order. We determine the phase boundary between such a Skyrmion crystal and the QCD vacuum. There was a conjecture that a magnetic field deforms the Skyrmion into a pancake shape whose boundary is a superconducting ring of charged pions. In contrast, through the exact Skyrmion solution, we find that the pancake conjecture holds approximately in a strong magnetic field, but fails for a weak one. We also validate that a Skyrmion would shrink to null without the Skyrme term, although Derrick's scaling law is modified by a background magnetic field, and the stability at the leading order is not ruled out in theory.</description>

      <title>A Universal Equilibration Condition for Heavy Quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kinetic equilibration at late times is physically required for heavy particles in a finite temperature medium. In Fokker-Planck dynamics, it is ensured by the Einstein relation between the drag and longitudinal momentum diffusion coefficients. However, in certain gauge field theories, this relation is violated at any nonzero heavy quark velocity. Recent work in strongly coupled $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM gauge theory shows that the Kolmogorov equation for the heavy quark phase space distribution (that reduces to Fokker-Planck form upon truncating the momentum transfer probability distribution to second moments) does equilibrate even though the Fokker-Planck equation does not. Here, we generalize some of these (to date theory-specific) insights to any quantum field theory at any coupling strength. Starting from quantum field theory first principles, we derive a universal equilibration condition for the kernel of the Kolmogorov equation and, consequently, for the momentum transfer probability distribution. Remarkably, this condition reveals that the asymmetry between energy loss and energy gain in the momentum transfer probability distribution takes a simple, theory-independent, form.</description>

      <title>Constraining inflationary magnetogenesis and reheating via GWs in light of PTA data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By leveraging the limits on primordial magnetic fields (PMFs), their contributions to secondary gravitational waves (GWs), and the recent observations by the pulsar timing arrays (PTAs), we arrive at constraints on the epoch of reheating. We find that the combined spectral energy density of primary and secondary (generated by the PMFs) GWs can be described as a broken power law with different indices. We show that PMFs with blue spectra and appropriate reheating scenarios can successfully explain the PTA observations without invoking any new physics.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics in the Carrollian regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18763v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Carroll hydrodynamics arises in the $c\to 0$ limit of relativistic hydrodynamics. Instances of its relevance include the Bjorken and Gubser flow models of heavy-ion collisions, where the ultrarelativistic nature of the flow makes the physics effectively Carrollian. In this paper, we explore the structure of hydrodynamics in what can be termed as the Carrollian regime, where instead of keeping only the leading terms in the $c\to 0$ limit of relativistic hydrodynamics, we perform a small-$c$ expansion and retain the subleading terms as well. We do so both for perfect fluids as well as viscous fluids incorporating first order derivative corrections. As apposite applications of the formalism, we utilize the subleading terms to compute modifications to the Bjorken and Gubser flow equations which bring in, in particular, dependence on rapidity.</description>

      <title>First Measurement of the Muon Neutrino Interaction Cross Section and Flux as a Function of Energy at the LHC with FASER</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This letter presents the measurement of the energy-dependent neutrino-nucleon cross section in tungsten and the differential flux of muon neutrinos and anti-neutrinos. The analysis is performed using proton-proton collision data at a center-of-mass energy of $13.6 \, {\rm TeV}$ and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $(65.6 \pm 1.4) \, \mathrm{fb^{-1}}$. Using the active electronic components of the FASER detector, $338.1 \pm 21.0$ charged current muon neutrino interaction events are identified, with backgrounds from other processes subtracted. We unfold the neutrino events into a fiducial volume corresponding to the sensitive regions of the FASER detector and interpret the results in two ways: We use the expected neutrino flux to measure the cross section, and we use the predicted cross section to measure the neutrino flux. Both results are presented in six bins of neutrino energy, achieving the first differential measurement in the TeV range. The observed distributions align with Standard Model predictions. Using this differential data, we extract the contributions of neutrinos from pion and kaon decays.</description>

      <title>Deviations from the von Laue condition: Implications for the on-shell Lagrangian of particles and fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: According to the von Laue condition, the volume integral of the proper pressure inside isolated particles with a fixed structure and finite mass vanishes in the Minkowski limit of general relativity. In this work, we consider a simple illustrative example: nonstandard static global monopoles with finite energy, for which the von Laue condition is satisfied when the proper pressure is integrated over the whole space. We demonstrate, however, that the absolute value of this integral, when calculated up to a finite distance from the center of the global monopole, generally deviates from zero by no more than the energy located outside the specified volume (under the assumption of the dominant energy condition). Furthermore, we find that the maximum deviation from unity of the ratio between the volume averages of the on-shell Lagrangian and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor cannot exceed three times the outer energy fraction. Extending these results to real particles, we demonstrate that these constraints generally hold for finite-mass systems with fixed structure, including stable atomic nuclei, provided the dominant energy condition is satisfied. Specifically, we show that, except in extremely dense environments with energy densities comparable to that of the particles themselves, the volume average of the aforementioned ratio must be extremely close to unity. Finally, we discuss the broader implications of our findings for the form of the on-shell Lagrangian of real fluids, which is often a crucial element for accurately modeling the dynamics of the gravity and matter, especially in scenarios involving nonminimal couplings to other matter fields or gravity. We find that, in general, the ideal gas on-shell Lagrangian provides an accurate approximation of the true on-shell Lagrangian, even for nonideal gases with significant interparticle interactions.</description>

      <title>The Trinity of black hole correspondences: Shadows-quasinormal modes-graybody factors and cautionary remarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01909v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Correspondences between apparently distant concepts are ubiquitous in theoretical physics. In the context of Black Holes (BHs), Quasi-Normal Modes (QNMs) were shown to be linked to both shadows, in the so-called eikonal limit, and Gray-Body Factors (GBFs), using the WKB approximation. We test the accuracy of the QNM-GBF correspondence in the context of the Hawking radiation for static and rotating black hole configurations, with particular attention to the superradiant regime. Our analysis reveals the correspondence failure to accurately reproduce the Hawking spectrum due to divergences. Furthermore, we bridge the gap between BH shadows and GBFs by drawing a correspondence between such quantities in the case of generic static and spherically symmetric spacetime configurations. The shadow-GBF correspondence is tested for some case studies, including regular BHs, and its limitations and applicability are discussed. This study opens new perspectives by introducing a new correspondence and remarking on the caution needed when considering these connections.</description>
