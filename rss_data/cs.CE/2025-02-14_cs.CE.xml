      <title>FAST: A Future Aircraft Sizing Tool for Advanced Aircraft and Propulsion System Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Without radical technological advancements, the global aviation industry will continue to be a major carbon emitter. To reduce aviation's carbon emissions, innovative aircraft technology, including electrified aircraft propulsion, is under development. However, current aircraft sizing tools require detailed design information that may not be available early in the development process, particularly for novel technologies. This can yield suboptimal designs and inhibits innovation. A computational tool is needed to easily and rapidly size an aircraft configuration while allowing the designer to explore the design space, examine tradeoffs, and evaluate alternative designs. The Future Aircraft Sizing Tool (FAST), developed in Matlab, addresses this challenge by rapidly sizing aircraft with any propulsion architecture, including conventional, electric, and hybrid electric systems, even with limited initial data. FAST enables engineers to explore various aircraft configurations, evaluate design alternatives, assess performance across a flight envelope, and visualize concepts during the sizing process. By supporting early stage design, FAST addresses a gap in currently available computational tools for developing sustainable aviation technologies to help reduce the industry's carbon footprint.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Discovery of Population Balance Equations for the Particulate Sciences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the behavior of particles in a dispersed phase system via population balances holds fundamental importance in studies of particulate sciences across various fields. Particle behavior, however, is sophisticated as a single particle can undergo internal property changes (e.g., size, cell age, and energy content) through various mechanisms. When confronted with an unknown distributed particulate system, discovering the underlying population balance equation (PBE) entails firstly learning the underlying particulate phenomena followed by the associated phenomenological laws that govern the kinetics and mechanisms of particle transformations in their local conditions. Conventional inverse problem approaches reveal the shape of phenomenological functions for predetermined forms of PBE (e.g., pure breakage/aggregation PBE, etc.). However, these methods can be limited in their ability to uncover the mechanisms which govern uncharacterized particulate systems from data. Leveraging the increasing abundance of data, we devise a data-driven framework based on sparse regression to learn PBEs as linear combinations of an extensive pool of candidate terms. Thus, this approach enables effective and accurate functional identification of PBEs without assuming the structure a priori, hence mitigating any potential loss of details, while minimizing model overfitting and providing a more interpretable representation of particulate systems. We showcase the proficiency of our approach across a wide spectrum of particulate systems, ranging from simple canonical pure breakage and pure aggregation systems to complex systems with multiple particulate processes. Our approach holds the potential to generalize the discovery of PBEs along with their phenomenological laws from data, thus facilitating wider adoption of population balances.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous solution of incompressible Navier-Stokes flows on multiple surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A mechanical model and finite element method for the simultaneous solution of Stokes and incompressible Navier-Stokes flows on multiple curved surfaces over a bulk domain are proposed. The two-dimensional surfaces are defined implicitly by all level sets of a scalar function, bounded by the three-dimensional bulk domain. This bulk domain is discretized with hexahedral finite elements which do not necessarily conform with the level sets but with the boundary. The resulting numerical method is a hybrid between conforming and non-conforming finite element methods. Taylor-Hood elements or equal-order element pairs for velocity and pressure, together with stabilization techniques, are applied to fulfil the inf-sup conditions resulting from the mixed-type formulation of the governing equations. Numerical studies confirm good agreement with independently obtained solutions on selected, individual surfaces. Furthermore, higher-order convergence rates are obtained for sufficiently smooth solutions.</description>

      <title>LOB-Bench: Benchmarking Generative AI for Finance - an Application to Limit Order Book Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While financial data presents one of the most challenging and interesting sequence modelling tasks due to high noise, heavy tails, and strategic interactions, progress in this area has been hindered by the lack of consensus on quantitative evaluation paradigms. To address this, we present LOB-Bench, a benchmark, implemented in python, designed to evaluate the quality and realism of generative message-by-order data for limit order books (LOB) in the LOBSTER format. Our framework measures distributional differences in conditional and unconditional statistics between generated and real LOB data, supporting flexible multivariate statistical evaluation. The benchmark also includes features commonly used LOB statistics such as spread, order book volumes, order imbalance, and message inter-arrival times, along with scores from a trained discriminator network. Lastly, LOB-Bench contains "market impact metrics", i.e. the cross-correlations and price response functions for specific events in the data. We benchmark generative autoregressive state-space models, a (C)GAN, as well as a parametric LOB model and find that the autoregressive GenAI approach beats traditional model classes.</description>

      <title>Machine learning for modelling unstructured grid data in computational physics: a review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unstructured grid data are essential for modelling complex geometries and dynamics in computational physics. Yet, their inherent irregularity presents significant challenges for conventional machine learning (ML) techniques. This paper provides a comprehensive review of advanced ML methodologies designed to handle unstructured grid data in high-dimensional dynamical systems. Key approaches discussed include graph neural networks, transformer models with spatial attention mechanisms, interpolation-integrated ML methods, and meshless techniques such as physics-informed neural networks. These methodologies have proven effective across diverse fields, including fluid dynamics and environmental simulations. This review is intended as a guidebook for computational scientists seeking to apply ML approaches to unstructured grid data in their domains, as well as for ML researchers looking to address challenges in computational physics. It places special focus on how ML methods can overcome the inherent limitations of traditional numerical techniques and, conversely, how insights from computational physics can inform ML development. To support benchmarking, this review also provides a summary of open-access datasets of unstructured grid data in computational physics. Finally, emerging directions such as generative models with unstructured data, reinforcement learning for mesh generation, and hybrid physics-data-driven paradigms are discussed to inspire future advancements in this evolving field.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Models for Molecules: A Survey of Methods and Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative tasks about molecules, including but not limited to molecule generation, are crucial for drug discovery and material design, and have consistently attracted significant attention. In recent years, diffusion models have emerged as an impressive class of deep generative models, sparking extensive research and leading to numerous studies on their application to molecular generative tasks. Despite the proliferation of related work, there remains a notable lack of up-to-date and systematic surveys in this area. Particularly, due to the diversity of diffusion model formulations, molecular data modalities, and generative task types, the research landscape is challenging to navigate, hindering understanding and limiting the area's growth. To address this, this paper conducts a comprehensive survey of diffusion model-based molecular generative methods. We systematically review the research from the perspectives of methodological formulations, data modalities, and task types, offering a novel taxonomy. This survey aims to facilitate understanding and further flourishing development in this area. The relevant papers are summarized at: https://github.com/AzureLeon1/awesome-molecular-diffusion-models.</description>
