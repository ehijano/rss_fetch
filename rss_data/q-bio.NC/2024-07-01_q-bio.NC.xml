      <title>How scanning probe microscopy can be supported by Artificial Intelligence and quantum computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We focus on the potential possibilities for supporting Scanning Probe Microscopy measurements, emphasizing the application of Artificial Intelligence, especially Machine Learning as well as quantum computing. It turned out that Artificial Intelligence can be helpful in the experimental processes automation in routine operations, the algorithmic search for good sample regions, and shed light on the structure property relationships. Thus, it contributes to increasing the efficiency and accuracy of optical nanoscopy scanning probes. Moreover, the combination of Artificial Intelligence based algorithms and quantum computing may have a huge potential to increase the practical application of Scanning Probe Microscopy. The limitations were also discussed. Finally, we outline a research path for the improvement of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Object Space is Embodied</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The perceived similarity between objects has often been attributed to their physical and conceptual features, such as appearance and animacy, and the theoretical framework of object space is accordingly conceived. Here, we extend this framework by proposing that object space may also be defined by embodied features, specifically action possibilities that objects afford to an agent (i.e., affordance) and their spatial relation with the agent (i.e., situatedness). To test this proposal, we quantified the embodied features with a set of action atoms. We found that embodied features explained the subjective similarity among familiar objects along with the objects' visual features. This observation was further replicated with novel objects. Our study demonstrates that embodied features, which place objects within an ecological context, are essential in constructing object space in the human visual system, emphasizing the importance of incorporating embodiment as a fundamental dimension in our understanding of the visual world.</description>

      <title>A Differentiable Approach to Multi-scale Brain Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19708v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a multi-scale differentiable brain modeling workflow utilizing BrainPy, a unique differentiable brain simulator that combines accurate brain simulation with powerful gradient-based optimization. We leverage this capability of BrainPy across different brain scales. At the single-neuron level, we implement differentiable neuron models and employ gradient methods to optimize their fit to electrophysiological data. On the network level, we incorporate connectomic data to construct biologically constrained network models. Finally, to replicate animal behavior, we train these models on cognitive tasks using gradient-based learning rules. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance and speed in fitting generalized leaky integrate-and-fire and Hodgkin-Huxley single neuron models. Additionally, training a biologically-informed network of excitatory and inhibitory spiking neurons on working memory tasks successfully replicates observed neural activity and synaptic weight distributions. Overall, our differentiable multi-scale simulation approach offers a promising tool to bridge neuroscience data across electrophysiological, anatomical, and behavioral scales.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Timescales of Language Processing with EEG and Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the temporal dynamics of language processing by examining the alignment between word representations from a pre-trained transformer-based language model, and EEG data. Using a Temporal Response Function (TRF) model, we investigate how neural activity corresponds to model representations across different layers, revealing insights into the interaction between artificial language models and brain responses during language comprehension. Our analysis reveals patterns in TRFs from distinct layers, highlighting varying contributions to lexical and compositional processing. Additionally, we used linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to isolate part-of-speech (POS) representations, offering insights into their influence on neural responses and the underlying mechanisms of syntactic processing. These findings underscore EEG's utility for probing language processing dynamics with high temporal resolution. By bridging artificial language models and neural activity, this study advances our understanding of their interaction at fine timescales.</description>

      <title>Impact of Initialization on Intra-subject Pediatric Brain MR Image Registration: A Comparative Analysis between SyN ANTs and Deep Learning-Based Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study evaluates the performance of conventional SyN ANTs and learning-based registration methods in the context of pediatric neuroimaging, specifically focusing on intrasubject deformable registration. The comparison involves three approaches: without (NR), with rigid (RR), and with rigid and affine (RAR) initializations. In addition to initialization, performances are evaluated in terms of accuracy, speed, and the impact of age intervals and sex per pair. Data consists of the publicly available MRI scans from the Calgary Preschool dataset, which includes 63 children aged 2-7 years, allowing for 431 registration pairs. We implemented the unsupervised DL framework with a U-Net architecture using DeepReg and it was 5-fold cross-validated. Evaluation includes Dice scores for tissue segmentation from 18 smaller regions obtained by SynthSeg, analysis of log Jacobian determinants, and registration pro-rated training and inference times. Learning-based approaches, with or without linear initializations, exhibit slight superiority over SyN ANTs in terms of Dice scores. Indeed, DL-based implementations with RR and RAR initializations significantly outperform SyN ANTs. Both SyN ANTs and DL-based registration involve parameter optimization, but the choice between these methods depends on the scale of registration: network-based for broader coverage or SyN ANTs for specific structures. Both methods face challenges with larger age intervals due to greater growth changes. The main takeaway is that while DL-based methods show promise with faster and more accurate registrations, SyN ANTs remains robust and generalizable without the need for extensive training, highlighting the importance of method selection based on specific registration needs in the pediatric context.

      <title>Resource-rational reinforcement learning and sensorimotor causal states, and resource-rational maximiners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new computational-level objective function for theoretical biology and theoretical neuroscience that combines: reinforcement learning, the study of learning with feedback via rewards; rate-distortion theory, a branch of information theory that deals with compressing signals to retain relevant information; and computational mechanics, the study of minimal sufficient statistics of prediction also known as causal states. We highlight why this proposal is likely only an approximation, but is likely to be an interesting one, and propose a new algorithm for evaluating it to obtain the newly-coined ``reward-rate manifold''. The performance of real and artificial agents in partially observable environments can be newly benchmarked using these reward-rate manifolds. Finally, we describe experiments that can probe whether or not biological organisms are resource-rational reinforcement learners, using as an example maximin strategies, as bacteria have been shown to be approximate maximiners -- doing their best in the worst-case environment, regardless of what is actually happening.</description>

      <title>Bifurcation enhances temporal information encoding in the olfactory periphery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Living systems continually respond to signals from the surrounding environment. Survival requires that their responses adapt quickly and robustly to the changes in the environment. One particularly challenging example is olfactory navigation in turbulent plumes, where animals experience highly intermittent odor signals while odor concentration varies over many length- and timescales. Here, we show theoretically that Drosophila olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) can exploit proximity to a bifurcation point of their firing dynamics to reliably extract information about the timing and intensity of fluctuations in the odor signal, which have been shown to be critical for odor-guided navigation. Close to the bifurcation, the system is intrinsically invariant to signal variance, and information about the timing, duration, and intensity of odor fluctuations is transferred efficiently. Importantly, we find that proximity to the bifurcation is maintained by mean adaptation alone and therefore does not require any additional feedback mechanism or fine-tuning. Using a biophysical model with calcium-based feedback, we demonstrate that this mechanism can explain the measured adaptation characteristics of Drosophila ORNs.</description>
