      <title>Hyperfocal subalgebras of hyperfocal abelian Frobenius blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a class of blocks which is called hyperfocal abelian Frobenius blocks.This class of blocks is an analogous version of the block with abelian defect group and Frobenius inertial quotient at hyperfocal level and includes the blocks with Klein four hyperfocal subgroups and cyclic hyperfocal subgroups. We show that there is a stable equivalence of Morita type between the hyperfocal subalgebras of the hyperfocal abelian Frobenius blocks and a group algebra of a Frobenius group associated with the hyperfocal subgroup of the block. As applications, we can partially describe some structures of the blocks with Klein four hyperfocal subgroups and cyclic hyperfocal subgroups,such as the structures of their hyperfocal subalgebras in terms of derived categories and the structures of their characters. As a consequence, we show that Broue's abelian defect group conjecture holds for blocks with Klein four hyperfocal subgroups.</description>

      <title>A generalization of a result of Heged\"us</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A famous result of P. Heged\"us describes the structure of finite rational $\{2,5\}$-groups. In this paper, we show how Heged\"us' proof can be used to obtain a similar result for the more general situation of a finite rational $2$-group acting faithfully and with the eigenvector property on a f.d $\mathbb{F}_p$-vector space with $p\geq 5$.</description>

      <title>(Non-)Linearizable RGD systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An RGD system $\mathcal{D}$ is called \emph{linear w.r.t. a root basis $\mathcal{B}$} if the commutation relations between the root groups of $\mathcal{D}$ are `linear' in a certain sense. Moreover, $\mathcal{D}$ is called \emph{linearizable}, if there exists a root basis $\mathcal{B}$ such that $\mathcal{D}$ is linear w.r.t. $\mathcal{B}$. For many examples of RGD systems it is easy to see that they are linear w.r.t. a concrete root basis. To the best of our knowledge, it was unclear whether RGD systems exist which are not linearizable.
  In this article we show that there exist uncountably many RGD systems which are not linearizable. In particular, we provide the first explicit example of such an RGD system. This expands the quote from R\'{e}my that axiom (RGD$1$)$_{\mathrm{lin}}$ is not only a strengthening of axiom (RGD$1$), but is in fact stronger than it. We show that non-linearizability appears in examples of universal type, and also in examples of $2$-spherical type. For the examples of universal type we construct an uncountable family of non-linearizable RGD systems, and for the examples of $2$-spherical type we show that the RGD systems of type $(4, 4, 4)$ recently constructed by the author provide uncountably many non-linearizable RGD systems.</description>

      <title>Non-Wiener groups with a Gelfand pair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a non-amenable locally compact group and $K$ a compact subgroup of $G$ such that $(G,K)$ is a Gelfand pair. We show that if $G$ admits a suitable boundary representation which is topologically irreducible and not unitarizable, then $G$ is not a Wiener group in the sense that its Fourier transform does not satisfy the analogue of Wiener's Tauberian theorem. As an application, we show that if $G$ is a closed non-compact boundary transitive group of automorphisms of a connected locally finite graph with infinitely many ends, or a split reductive algebraic group over a non-archimedean local field, then $G$ is not Wiener.</description>

      <title>On K{\r u}rka's dichotomy for cellular automata on groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is about topological dynamics of cellular automata on finitely generated groups. We tackle the problem of determining for which group sensitivity to initial conditions is equivalent to the absence of equicontinuity points (so-called K{\r u}rka's dichotomy). We show that the dichotomy holds on any virtually-Z group but not on free groups with 2 or more generators. We also show that if it holds on some group, it must hold on any of its subgroups.</description>

      <title>Diamonds: Homology and the Central Series of Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish an analog of a theorem of Stallings which asserts the homomorphisms between the universal nilpotent quotients induced by a homomorphism $G \to H$ of groups are isomorphisms provided a pair of homological conditions are satisfied. Our analogy does not have a homomorphism between $G$ and $H$ but instead $G,H \leq G_0$ that satisfies a similar homological condition. We derive a few applications of this result. First, we show that there exist pairs of non-isomorphic number fields whose absolute Galois groups have isomorphic universal nilpotent quotients. We show that there exists pairs of non-isometric hyperbolic $n$-manifolds whose fundamental groups are residually nilpotent and have isomorphic universal nilpotent quotients. These are the first examples of residually nilpotent Kleinian groups with arbitrarily large nilpotent genus. Complex hyperbolic 2-manifold examples are given as well. Considering Riemann surfaces and complex hyperbolic 2-manifolds as projective curves and surfaces defined over a number field, we show the (outer) action of the absolute Galois group of the field of definition on the universal nilpotent quotients of the geometric fundamental groups are equivalent. This is in contrast to fact that the (outer) Galois action on the geometric fundamental group of a projective hyperbolic curve determines the curve by work of Mochizuki. In particular, the nilpotent representation theory of the geometric fundamental group is not anabelian.</description>

      <title>Bijective solutions to the Pentagon Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A complete classification of all finite bijective set-theoretic solutions $(S,s)$ to the Pentagon Equation is obtained. First, it is shown that every such solution determines a semigroup structure on the set $S$ that is the direct product $E\times G$ of a semigroup of left zeros $E$ and a group $G$. Next, we prove that this leads to a decomposition of the set $S$ as a Cartesian product $X\times A\times G$, for some sets $X,A$ and to the discovery of a hidden group structure on $A$. Then an unexpected structure of a matched product of groups $A,G$ is found such that the solution $(S,s)$ can be explicitly described as a lift of a solution determined on the set $A\times G$ by this matched product of groups. Conversely, every matched product of groups leads to a family of solutions arising in this way. Moreover, a simple criterion for the isomorphism of two solutions is obtained. These results significantly extend those of Colazzo, Jespers, and Kubat, in their treatment of the involutive case. Furthermore, connections to solutions to the Yang--Baxter Equation and to the theory of skew braces are uncovered. The latter motivate a further investigation of the relationship between solutions to the Yang--Baxter Equation and the Pentagon Equation at the set-theoretical level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study groups whose co-word problems are ET0L languages, which we call coET0L groups, using an automaton based model due to van Leeuwen, and recently studied by Bishop and Elder. In particular we prove a number of closure results for the class of groups with co-word problems in a subclass of `special' ET0L languages; that class of groups contains all groups that we know at the time of writing to be co-ET0L, including all groups that were proved by Holt and R\"over to be stack groups, and hence co-indexed. It includes virtually free groups, bounded automata groups, and the Higman-Thompson groups, together with groups constructed from those using finitely generated subgroups, finite extension, free and direct products, and by taking the restricted standard wreath product of a co-\E group by a finitely generated virtually free top group.</description>

      <title>Translation length formula for two-generated groups acting on trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18108v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate translation length functions for two-generated groups acting by isometries on $\Lambda$-trees, where $\Lambda$ is a totally ordered abelian group. In this context, we provide an explicit formula for the translation length of any element of the group, under certain assumptions on the translation lengths of its generators and their products. Our approach is purely combinatorial and uses only the defining axioms of pseudo-lengths. As shown by Parry, pseudo-lengths coincide with the translation length functions for actions on $\Lambda$-trees. Furthermore, we prove that, under certain conditions on four elements $\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta \in \Lambda$, there exists a unique pseudo-length on the free group $F(a,b)$ assigning these values to $a$, $b$, $ab$, $ab^{-1}$, respectively.
  Applications include results on properly discontinuous actions and discrete free groups of isometries. We also develop an algorithmic approach to studying translation length functions arising from free actions on $\mathbb{R}$-trees. Based on this, we state a conjecture that would lead to a description of $\mathrm{Aut}{(F_2)}$-orbits in the Culler-Vogtmann outer space.</description>

      <title>Elusive groups from non-split extensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A finite transitive permutation group is elusive if it contains no derangements of prime order. These groups are closely related to a longstanding open problem in algebraic graph theory known as the Polycirculant Conjecture, which asserts that no elusive group is $2$-closed. Existing constructions of elusive groups mostly arise from split extensions. In this paper, we initiate the construction of elusive groups via non-split extensions. As a demonstration, we construct elusive groups of new degrees, namely $p^{3k-4}(p+1)/2$ for each Mersenne prime $p\geq7$ and integer $k\geq2$. We also construct the first examples of elusive groups with odd degree, namely $3^{k+1}\cdot5^2$, and twice odd degree, namely $2\cdot3^{k + 1}\cdot5^2$ for each $k\geq1$. We conclude by proposing further problems to advance this new direction of research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Dehn twists in the outer automorphism group of a finitely generated non-abelian free group. Our main result states that, under certain compatibility conditions, sufficiently large powers of finitely many Dehn twists generate a right-angled Artin group. The proof proceeds by analyzing the geometry of spheres, tori, and simple closed curves in a doubled handlebody. Along the way, we establish the bigon--bihedron criterion and an equivalent condition for commuting Dehn twists. Furthermore, we construct a compact topological space on which every Dehn twist acts parabolically.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the Quillen posets $\mathcal{A}_p(H)$ of $p$-extensions $H$ of simple unitary groups have non-zero homology in the largest possible dimension, with just a few exceptions. This establishes a conjecture raised by Aschbacher-Smith in 1992. In particular, by their work and a more recent article by Piterman-Smith, Quillen's conjecture on the p-subgroup posets holds for odd primes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11883v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is known that, if removing some $n$ edges from a graph $\Gamma$ destroys all subgraphs isomorphic to a given finite graph $K$, then all subgraphs isomorphic to $K$ can be destroyed by removing at most $|E(K)|\cdot n$ edges, which form a set invariant with respect to all automorphisms of $\Gamma$. We construct the first examples of (connected) graphs $K$ for which this estimate is not sharp. Our arguments are based on a ``weighted analogue'' of an earlier known estimate for the cost of symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a complete classification of groups that can be realized as isometry groups of a translation surface $M$ with non-finitely generated fundamental group and no planar ends. Furthermore, we demonstrate that if $S$ has no non-displaceable subsurfaces and its space of ends is self-similar, then every countable subgroup of $\operatorname{GL}^+(2,\mathbb{R})$ can be realized as the Veech group of a translation surface $M$ homeomorphic to $S$. The latter result generalizes and improves upon the previous findings of Przytycki-Valdez-Weitze-Schmith\"{u}sen and Maluendas-Valdez. To prove these results, we adapt ideas from the work of Aougab-Patel-Vlamis, which focused on hyperbolic surfaces, to translation surfaces.</description>

Abstract: Let $(R,M,k)$ be a complete local ring (not necessarily Noetherian). Then we reprove by a new method that the natural surjective ring map $R\rightarrow k$ admits a splitting if and only if $\Char(R)=\Char(k)$. In our proof there is no need for the existence of the coefficient field for equi-characteristic complete local rings, whose existence is the hardest part of the known proof. However, the main result of this article is that in the unequal characteristic case $\Char(R)\neq\Char(k)$, we prove that the natural surjective map between the groups of units $R^{\ast}\rightarrow k^{\ast}$ admits a splitting. As an application of the above theorem, we show that for any complete local ring $(R,M,k)$ the following short exact sequence of Abelian groups: $$\xymatrix{1\ar[r]&amp;1+M\ar[r]&amp; R^{\ast}\ar[r]&amp;k^{\ast} \ar[r]&amp;1}$$ is always split. Next, we show with an example that the above exact sequence does not split for many incomplete local rings.</description>
