      <title>Interplay between local and global order controls bifurcations in nonreciprocal systems without a conservation law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We elucidate the generic bifurcation behavior of local and global order in short-range interacting nonreciprocal lattice systems without conservation laws. We show that a critical magnitude of nearest-neighbor correlations within the respective lattices controls the emergence of coherent oscillations of global order as a result of frustration. Local order is maintained during these oscillations, implying non-trivial spatio-temporal correlations. Ghost states emerge in the strong-interaction regime. The residence time in either of these states eventually diverges, giving rise to ordered non-equilibrium steady states via a saddle-node-infinite-period bifurcation. Our work provides a comprehensive microscopic understanding of collective phenomena in nonreciprocal matter without conservation laws, which may be relevant e.g. for understanding enzyme clustering.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics of a Superconducting Szilard Engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We implement a Szilard engine that uses a 2-bit logical unit consisting of coupled quantum flux parametrons -- Josephson-junction superconducting circuits originally designed for quantum computing. Detailed simulations show that it is highly thermodynamically efficient while functioning as a Maxwell demon. The physically-calibrated design is targeted to direct experimental exploration. However, variations in Josephson junction fabrication introduce asymmetries that result in energy inefficiency and low operational fidelity. We provide a design solution that mitigates these practical challenges. The resulting platform is ideally suited to probe the thermodynamic foundations of information processing devices far from equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Scale locality of information flow in turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulent fluctuations exhibit universal scaling laws that are independent of large-scale statistics. It is often explained that such universality is caused by the loss of information about large-scale statistics during the cascade process. In our previous study [T. Tanogami and R. Araki, Phys. Rev. Research 6, 013090 (2024)], we applied information thermodynamics to turbulence and proved that information of large-scale turbulent fluctuations is propagated to small scales. As a first step toward understanding how universality emerges at small scales under the influence of the information flow from large scales, here we investigate the scale locality of the information flow for the Sabra shell model. First, we analytically show that the information flow can be decomposed into scale-local and scale-nonlocal parts. Then, we prove that the scale-nonlocal part can be ignored compared to the scale-local part. This result implies that the information transfer from large to small scales occurs mainly through scale-local interactions, which is consistent with the scale locality of the energy cascade.</description>

      <title>Ordered States in Fcc Kagome Antiferromagnets with Magnetic Dipolar Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ordered states for a classical Heisenberg model on fcc lattice structure with ABC stacked kagome planes of magnetic ions are investigated by numerically solving the Landau-Lifshitz (LL) equation. Both the nearest-neighbor exchange interaction and the magnetic dipolar interactions are included in the model. The model with only the nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic exchange interaction is known to show the layered 120 degree spin structure. On the other hand, the model with only the magnetic dipolar interactions is known to exhibit a continuous degeneracy expressed by six sublattice spin vectors, which is reduced by an order-by-disorder process with thermal fluctuations. In the present study, other ordered states appear for various values of relative strength of the two kinds of the interactions. A vortex spin structure on hexagonal lattice points in the kagomeplanes is a novel one. Another ordered state may be glassy state in which apparent translational symmetry cannot be seen. Layered 120 degree spin structures but not uniform in the direction perpendicular to the kagome planes with various period in the direction appear depending on the relative strength of the two kinds of the interactions.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical Quantum Trajectories in the Monitored Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monitored quantum system have sparked great interest in recent years due to the possibility of observing measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPTs) in the full-counting statistics of the quantum trajectories associated with different measurement outcomes. Here, we investigate the dynamics of the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, composed of $N$ all-to-all interacting spins $1/2$, under a weak external monitoring. We derive a set of semiclassical stochastic equations describing the evolution of the expectation values of global spin observables, which become exact in the thermodynamic limit. Our results shows that the limit $N\to\infty$ does not commute with the long-time limit: while for any finite $N$ the esamble average over the noise is expected to converge towards a trivial steady state, in the thermodynamic limit a MIPT appears. The transition is not affected by post-selection issues, as it is already visible at the level of ensemble averages, thus paving the way for experimental observations. We derive a quantitative theoretical picture explaining the nature of the transition within our semiclassical picture, finding an excellent agreement with the numerics.</description>

      <title>Multiscalar Critical Models with Localised Cubic Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interface localised interactions are studied for multiscalar universality classes accessible with the perturbative $\varepsilon$ expansion in $4-\varepsilon$ dimensions. The associated beta functions at one loop and partially at two loops are derived, and a wide variety of interface conformal field theories (CFTs) is found, even in cases where the bulk universality class is as simple as the Wilson--Fisher description of the $O(N)$ model. For up to three scalar fields in the bulk, interface fixed points are classified for all bulk universality classes encountered in this case. Numerical results are obtained for interface CFTs that exist for larger numbers of multiscalar fields. Our analytic and numerical results indicate the existence of a vast space of interface CFTs, much larger than the space of defect CFTs found for line and surface defect deformations of multiscalar models in $4-\varepsilon$ dimensions.</description>

      <title>Dynamically emergent correlations in bosons via quantum resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the nonequilibrium stationary state (NESS) induced by quantum resetting of a system of $N$ noninteracting bosons in a harmonic trap. Our protocol consists of preparing initially the system in the ground state of a harmonic oscillator centered at $+a$, followed by a rapid quench where the center is shifted to $-a$ and the system is allowed to evolve unitarily up to a random Poissonian time $\tau$ distributed via $r\, e^{-r\, \tau}$. Then the trap center is reset to $+a$ again and the system is assumed to cool instantaneously to the initial ground state. The system is again allowed to evolve unitarily in the trap centered at $-a$ up to a random time, and the procedure is repeated. Under repeated resetting, the system reaches a NESS where the positions of bosons get $\rm{\textit{strongly correlated}}$ due to simultaneous resetting induced by the trap. We fully characterize the steady state by analytically computing several physical observables such as the average density, extreme value statistics, order and gap statistics, and also the distribution of the number of particles in a region $[-L,L]$, known as the full counting statistics (FCS). In particular, we show that in the large $N$ limit, the scaling function describing the FCS exhibits a striking feature: it is supported over a nontrivial finite interval, and moreover is discontinuous at an interior point of the support. Our results are supported by numerical simulations. This is a rare example of a strongly correlated quantum many-body NESS where various observables can be exactly computed.</description>

      <title>Hidden high-risky states identification from routine urban traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the core risk management tasks is to identify hidden high-risky states that may lead to system breakdown, which can provide valuable early warning knowledge. However, due to high dimensionality and nonlinear interaction embedded in large-scale complex systems like urban traffic, it remains challenging to identify hidden high-risky states from huge system state space where over 99% of possible system states are not yet visited in empirical data. Based on maximum entropy model, we infer the underlying interaction network from complicated dynamical processes of urban traffic, and construct system energy landscape. In this way, we can locate hidden high-risky states that have never been observed from real data. These states can serve as risk signals with high probability of entering hazardous minima in energy landscape, which lead to huge recovery cost. Our finding might provide insights for complex system risk management.</description>

      <title>An analog of topological entanglement entropy for mixed states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the convex-roof extension of quantum conditional mutual information ("co(QCMI)") as a diagnostic of long-range entanglement in a mixed state. We focus primarily on topological states subjected to local decoherence, and employ the Levin-Wen scheme to define co(QCMI), so that for a pure state, co(QCMI) equals topological entanglement entropy (TEE). By construction, co(QCMI) is zero if and only if a mixed state can be decomposed as a convex sum of pure states with zero TEE. We show that co(QCMI) is non-increasing with increasing decoherence when Kraus operators are proportional to the product of onsite unitaries. This implies that unlike a pure state transition between a topologically trivial and a non-trivial phase, the long-range entanglement at a decoherence-induced topological phase transition as quantified by co(QCMI) is less than or equal to that in the proximate topological phase. For the 2d toric code decohered by onsite bit/phase-flip noise, we show that co(QCMI) is non-zero below the error-recovery threshold and zero above it. Relatedly, the decohered state cannot be written as a convex sum of short-range entangled pure states below the threshold. We conjecture and provide evidence that in this example, co(QCMI) equals TEE of a recently introduced pure state. In particular, we develop a tensor-assisted Monte Carlo (TMC) computation method to efficiently evaluate the R\'enyi TEE for the aforementioned pure state and provide non-trivial consistency checks for our conjecture. We use TMC to also calculate the universal scaling dimension of the anyon-condensation order parameter at this transition.</description>

      <title>Hedgehog topological defects in 3D amorphous solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The underlying structural disorder renders the concept of topological defects in amorphous solids difficult to apply and hinders a first-principle identification of the microscopic carriers of plasticity and of the regions more prone to structural rearrangements ("soft spots"). Recently, it has been proposed that well-defined topological defects can still be identified in glasses, and correlated to local and global plasticity, by looking at the eigenvector field or the particle displacement field. Nevertheless, all the existing proposals and analyses are only valid in two spatial dimensions. In this work, we propose the idea of using hedgehog topological defects to characterize the plasticity of 3D glasses and to geometrically predict the location of their soft spots. We corroborate our proposal by simulating a Kremer-Grest 3D polymer glass, and by using both the normal mode eigenvector field and the displacement field around large plastic events. Our results confirm that a topological characterization of plasticity in glasses is feasible, and provide a concrete realization of this program in 3D amorphous systems.</description>

      <title>Thermal and Quantum Phase Transitions of the $\phi^4$ Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The critical behaviour of the classical (thermal) phase transition (CPT) of the Ising model is identical to the quantum phase transition (QPT) of the $\phi^4$ Quantum Field Theory (QFT). Our goal in this work is to map out the QPT-CPT diagram of the $\phi^4$ QFT, and study its relation to the well-known QPT-CPT phase diagram of the Ising model. To do this, we propose a modification of the usual finite-temperature Renormalization Group (RG) approach by relating the temperature parameter to the running RG scale, $T \equiv k_T = \tau k$ where $k_T$ is the running cutoff for thermal, and $k$ is for the quantum fluctuations. In this case, the temperature is related to the dimensionless quantity $\tau$. We apply this new thermal RG approach for the $\phi^4$ model in lower dimensions and construct its QPT-CPT phase diagram. We formulate requirements for the QPT-CPT phase diagram of the $\phi^4$ theory based on known properties of the QPT-CPT phase diagram of the Ising model. Finally, we use these requirements to check the viability of the thermal RG method proposed in this work.</description>

      <title>Hyperspectral electromechanical imaging at the nanoscale: Dynamical backaction, dissipation and quantum fluctuations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a new scanning nanomechanical noise microscopy platform enabling to both heat and acquire the fluctuations of mechanical nanostructures with nanometric resolution. We use this platform to image the thermally activated nanomechanical dynamics of a model system consisting of a $40\,\mathrm{nm}$ diameter single-defect nanowire, while scanning a localized heat source across its surface. We develop a thermal backaction model, which we use to demonstrate a close connection between the structure of the nanowire, its thermal response, its dissipation and its fluctuations. We notably show that the defect behaves as a single fluctuation hub, whose e-beam excitation yields a far off-equilibrium vibrational state, largely dominated by the quantum fluctuations of the heating source. Our platform is of interest for future quantitative investigation of fundamental nanoscale dynamical phenomena, and appears as a new playground for investigating quantum thermodynamics in the strongly dissipative regime and at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Origin of Robust $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Topological Phases in Stacked Hermitian Systems: Non-Hermitian Level Repulsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum spin Hall insulators, which possess a non-trivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological phase, have attracted great attention for two decades. It is generally believed that when an even number of layers of the quantum spin Hall insulators are stacked, the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological phase becomes unstable due to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ nature. While several researchers report counterexamples of the instability, there is no systematic understanding. In this work, we show that the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological phase is robust against the stacking if it has an additional chiral symmetry, in terms of the level repulsion in the corresponding non-Hermitian system. We demonstrate this by mapping a one-dimensional class DIII superconductor with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology to the corresponding non-Hermitian system in AII$^\dagger$ with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ point-gap topology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Periodically driven closed quantum systems are expected to eventually heat up to infinite temperature reaching a steady state described by a circular orthogonal ensemble (COE). However, such finite driven systems may exhibit sufficiently long prethermal regimes; their properties in these regimes are qualitatively different from that in their infinite temperature steady states. These, often experimentally relevant, prethermal regimes host a wide range of phenomena; they may exhibit dynamical localization and freezing, host Floquet scars, display signatures of Hilbert space fragmentation, and exhibit time crystalline phases. Such phenomena are often accompanied by emergent approximate dynamical symmetries which have no analogue in equilibrium systems. In this review, we provide a pedagogical introduction to the origin and nature of these symmetries and discuss their role in shaping the prethermal phases of a class of periodically driven closed quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is an elementary set of lectures on generalized global symmetries originally given at the Jena TPI School on QFT and Holography, designed to be accessible to the reader with a basic knowledge of quantum field theory. Topics covered include an introduction to higher-form symmetries with selected applications: Abelian and non-Abelian gauge theories in the continuum and on the lattice, statistical mechanical systems, the Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly from the point of view of non-invertible symmetry, and magnetohydrodynamics. Mathematical formalism is kept to a minimum and an emphasis is placed on understanding the global symmetry structure present in well-known models.</description>

      <title>Exceptional points and non-Hermitian skin effects under nonlinearity of eigenvalues</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Band structures of metamaterials described by a nonlinear eigenvalue problem are beyond the existing topological band theory. In this paper, we analyze non-Hermitian topology under the nonlinearity of eigenvalues. Specifically, we elucidate that such nonlinear systems may exhibit exceptional points and non-Hermitian skin effects which are unique non-Hermitian topological phenomena. The robustness of these non-Hermitian phenomena is clarified by introducing the topological invariants under nonlinearity which reproduce the existing ones in linear systems. Furthermore, our analysis elucidates that exceptional points may emerge even for systems without an internal degree of freedom where the equation is single component. These nonlinearity-induced exceptional points are observed in mechanical metamaterials, e.g., the Kapitza pendulum.</description>

      <title>Non-linear inhibitory responses enhance performance in collective decision-making</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The precise modulation of activity through inhibitory signals ensures that both insect colonies and neural circuits operate efficiently and adaptively, highlighting the fundamental importance of inhibition in biological systems. Modulatory signals are produced in various contexts and are known for subtly shifting the probability of receiver behaviors based on response thresholds. Here we propose a non-linear function to introduce inhibitory responsiveness in collective decision-making inspired by honeybee house-hunting. We show that, compared with usual linear functions, non-linear responses enhance final consensus and reduce deliberation time. This improvement comes at the cost of reduced accuracy in identifying the best option. Nonetheless, for value-based tasks, the benefits of faster consensus and enhanced decision-making might outweigh this drawback.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At high temperature, the overlap of two particles chosen independently according to the Gibbs measure of the branching Brownian motion converges to zero as time goes to infinity. We investigate the precise decay rate of the probability to obtain an overlap greater than $a$, for some $a&gt;0$, in the whole subcritical phase of inverse temperatures $\beta \in [0,\beta_c)$. Moreover, we study this probability both conditionally on the branching Brownian motion and non-conditionally. Two sub-phases of inverse temperatures appear, but surprisingly the threshold is not the same in both cases.</description>

      <title>Nature of barriers determine first passage times in heterogeneous media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.13814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intuition suggests that passage times across a region increases with the number of barriers along the path. Can this fail depending on the nature of the barrier? To probe this fundamental question, we exactly solve for the first passage time in general d-dimensions for diffusive transport through a spatially patterned array of obstacles - either entropic or energetic, depending on the nature of the obstacles. For energetic barriers, we show that first passage times vary non-monotonically with the number of barriers, while for entropic barriers it increases monotonically. This non-monotonicity for energetic barriers further reflects in the behaviour of effective diffusivity as well. We then design a simple experiment where a robotic bug navigates a heterogeneous environment through a spatially patterned array of obstacles to validate our predictions. Finally, using numerical simulations, we show that this non-monotonic behaviour for energetic barriers is general and extends to even super-diffusive transport.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.06390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the long-range order in two dimensions where an order parameter is advected by laminar flows such as rotational, shear, and elongational flows. Under these flows, we analyze an ordered state of the $O(N)$ scalar model in the large-$N$ limit. We show that the stability of the ordered state depends on the flow pattern; shear and elongational flows stabilize the long-range order but rotational flow does not. We discuss the physical mechanism underlying our results by connecting static correlations of fluctuations and their dynamics based on the interaction representation used in quantum mechanics. We find that advective transport induces superdiffusion under shear and elongational flows, thereby stabilizing the long-range order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.14949v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In literature on stochastic thermodynamics it is stated that for a system connected to multiple thermal reservoirs, the transition rates between two energy levels equals the sum of transition rates corresponding to each thermal bath the system is connected to. We show that this assumption leads to an impossibility of the system attaining a steady state by considering a system connected to two thermal baths. Additionally by splitting up the system into subsystems with one subsystem connected to one thermal bath and another subsystem connected to a second bath, and the rest exchanging energy with these two, we show that the collective evolution of the system as a whole is non-Markovian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.08597v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the main objectives of science is the recognition of a general pattern in a particular phenomenon in some particular regime. In this work, this is achieved with the analytical expression for the optimal protocol that minimizes the thermodynamic work and its variance for finite-time, isothermal, and weak processes. The method that solves the Euler-Lagrange integral equation is quite general and depends only on the time-reversal symmetry of the optimal protocol, which is proven generically for the regime considered. The solution is composed of a straight line with jumps at the boundaries and impulse-like terms. Already known results are deduced, and many new examples are solved corroborating this pattern. Slowly-varying and sudden cases are deduced in their appropriate asymptotic limits. Comparison with numerical procedures is limited by the nonavailability of the present methods of the literature to produce solutions in the space of distributions.</description>

      <title>Accurate Estimation of Diffusion Coefficients and their Uncertainties from Computer Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18244v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-diffusion coefficients, $D^*$, are routinely estimated from molecular dynamics simulations by fitting a linear model to the observed mean-squared displacements (MSDs) of mobile species. MSDs derived from simulation suffer from statistical noise, which introduces uncertainty in the resulting estimate of $D^*$. An optimal scheme for estimating $D^*$ will minimise this uncertainty, i.e., will have high statistical efficiency, and will give an accurate estimate of the uncertainty itself. We present a scheme for estimating $D^*$ from a single simulation trajectory with high statistical efficiency and accurately estimating the uncertainty in the predicted value. The statistical distribution of MSDs observable from a given simulation is modelled as a multivariate normal distribution using an analytical covariance matrix for an equivalent system of freely diffusing particles, which we parameterise from the available simulation data. We then perform Bayesian regression to sample the distribution of linear models that are compatible with this model multivariate normal distribution, to obtain a statistically efficient estimate of $D^*$ and an accurate estimate of the associated statistical uncertainty.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02519v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the computational efficiency of the finite temperature simulation with the minimally entangled typical thermal states (METTS). To argue that METTS can be efficiently represented as matrix product states, we present an analytic upper bound for the average entanglement Renyi entropy of METTS for Renyi index $0&lt;q\leq 1$. In particular, for 1D gapless systems described by CFTs, the upper bound scales as $\mathcal{O}(c N^0 \log \beta)$ where $c$ is the central charge and $N$ is the system size. Furthermore, we numerically find that the average Renyi entropy exhibits a universal behavior characterized by the central charge and is roughly given by half of the analytic upper bound. Based on these results, we show that METTS provide a significant speedup compared to employing the purification method to analyze thermal equilibrium states at low temperatures in 1D gapless systems.</description>

      <title>BAD-NEUS: Rapidly converging trajectory stratification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An issue for molecular dynamics simulations is that events of interest often involve timescales that are much longer than the simulation time step, which is set by the fastest timescales of the model. Because of this timescale separation, direct simulation of many events is prohibitively computationally costly. This issue can be overcome by aggregating information from many relatively short simulations that sample segments of trajectories involving events of interest. This is the strategy of Markov state models (MSMs) and related approaches, but such methods suffer from approximation error because the variables defining the states generally do not capture the dynamics fully. By contrast, once converged, the weighted ensemble (WE) method aggregates information from trajectory segments so as to yield unbiased estimates of both thermodynamic and kinetic statistics. Unfortunately, errors decay no faster than unbiased simulation in WE. Here we introduce a theoretical framework for describing WE that shows that introduction of an approximate stationary distribution on top of the stratification, as in nonequilibrium umbrella sampling (NEUS), accelerates convergence. Building on ideas from MSMs and related methods, we generalize the NEUS approach in such a way that the approximation error can be reduced systematically. We show that the improved algorithm can decrease simulation times required to achieve a desired precision by orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Emerging cost-time Pareto front for diffusion with stochastic return</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Resetting, in which a system is regularly returned to a given state after a fixed or random duration, has become a useful strategy to optimize the search performance of a system. While earlier theoretical frameworks focused on instantaneous resetting, wherein the system is directly teleported to a given state, there is a growing interest in physical resetting mechanisms that involve a finite return time. However employing such a mechanism involves cost and the effect of this cost on the search time remains largely unexplored. Yet answering this is important in order to design cost-efficient resetting strategies. Motivated from this, we present a thermodynamic analysis of a diffusing particle whose position is intermittently reset to a specific site by employing a stochastic return protocol with external confining trap. We show for a family of potentials $U_R(x) \sim |x|^{m}$ with $m&gt;0$, it is possible to find optimal potential shape that minimises the expected first-passage time for a given value of the thermodynamic cost, i.e. mean work. By varying this value, we then obtain the Pareto optimal front, and demonstrate a trade-off relation between the first-passage time and the work done.</description>

      <title>Thermal Pure States for Systems with Antiunitary Symmetries and Their Tensor Network Representations</title>

Abstract: Thermal pure state algorithms, which employ pure quantum states representing thermal equilibrium states instead of statistical ensembles, are useful both for numerical simulations and for theoretical analysis of thermal states. However, their inherently large entanglement makes it difficult to represent efficiently and limits their use in analyzing large systems. Here, we propose a new algorithm for constructing thermal pure states for systems with certain antiunitary symmetries, such as time-reversal or complex conjugation symmetry. Our method utilizes thermal pure states that, while exhibiting volume-law entanglement, can be mapped to tensor network states through simple transformations. Furthermore, our approach does not rely on random sampling and thus avoids statistical uncertainty. Moreover, we can compute not only thermal expectation values of local observables but also thermodynamic functions. We demonstrate the validity and utility of our method by applying it to the one-dimensional XY model and the two-dimensional Ising model on a triangular lattice. Our results suggest a new class of variational wave functions for volume-law states that are not limited to thermal equilibrium states.</description>

Abstract: Disentangled black hole microstates are atypical states in holographic CFTs whose gravity duals do not have smooth horizons. If there exist sufficiently many disentangled microstates to account for the entire black hole entropy, then any black hole microstate can be written as a superposition of states without smooth horizons. We show that there exist sufficiently many disentangled microstates to account for almost the entire black hole entropy of a large AdS black hole at the semiclassical limit $G_N\rightarrow 0$. In addition, we also argue that in generic quantum many-body systems with short-ranged interactions, there exist sufficiently many area law states in the microcanonical subspace to account for almost the entire thermodynamic entropy in the standard thermodynamic limit. Area law states are atypical since a typical state should contain volume law entanglement. Furthermore, we also present an explicit way to construct such a set of area law states, and argue that the same construction may also be used to construct disentangled states.</description>

Abstract: The numerical conformal bootstrap has become in the last 15 years an indispensable tool for studying strongly coupled CFTs in various dimensions. Here we review the main developments in the field in the last 5 years, since the appearance of the previous comprehensive review \cite{Poland:2018epd}. We describe developments in the software ({\tt SDPB 2.0}, {\tt scalar\_blocks}, {\tt blocks\_3d}, {\tt autoboot}, {\tt hyperion}, {\tt simpleboot}), and on the algorithmic side (Delauney triangulation, cutting surface, tiptop, navigator function, skydive). We also describe the main physics applications which were obtained using the new technology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a bond-percolation model intended to describe the consumption, and eventual exhaustion, of resources in transport networks. Edges forming minimum-length paths connecting demanded origin-destination nodes are removed if below a certain budget. As pairs of nodes are demanded and edges are removed, the macroscopic connected component of the graph disappears, i.e., the graph undergoes a percolation transition. Here, we study such a shortest-path-percolation transition in homogeneous random graphs where pairs of demanded origin-destination nodes are randomly generated, and fully characterize it by means of finite-size scaling analysis. If budget is finite, the transition is identical to the one of ordinary percolation, where a single giant cluster shrinks as edges are removed from the graph; for infinite budget, the transition becomes more abrupt than the one of ordinary percolation, being characterized by the sudden fragmentation of the giant connected component into a multitude of clusters of similar size.</description>

Abstract: In their recent works [Comm. Math. Phys. 399:1 (2023)] and [arXiv:2109.01094], Michelen and Perkins proved that the pressure of a system of particles with repulsive pair interactions is analytic for activities up to $e\Delta_{\phi}(\beta)^{-1}$, where $\Delta_{\phi}(\beta)\in(0,C_{\phi}(\beta)]$ is a constant they called the potential-weighted connective constant. This paper extends their method to locally stable, tempered, and hard-core pair potentials. Our main result is that the pressure of such a system is analytic for activities up to $e^{2-2W(eA_{\phi}(\beta)/\Delta_{\phi}(\beta))}\Delta_{\phi}(\beta)^{-1}e^{-(\beta C+1)}$, where $C\ge0$ is the local stability constant, $W(\cdot)$ the Lambert $W$-function, $A_{\phi}(\beta)$ the contribution from the attraction in the pair potential to the temperedness constant, and $\Delta_{\phi}(\beta)\in[A_{\phi}(\beta),C_{\phi}(\beta)]$ a counterpart of the constant defined by Michelen and Perkins. The main ingredients in the proof include a recursive identity for the one-point density tailored to locally stable hard-core potentials and a corresponding notion of modulations of an activity function. In the high-temperature regime, our result surpasses the classical Penrose-Ruelle bound of $C_{\phi}(\beta)^{-1}e^{-(\beta C+1)}$ by at least a factor of $e^{2}$.</description>

Abstract: Topologically-ordered phases are stable to local perturbations, and topological quantum error-correcting codes enjoy thresholds to local errors. We connect the two notions of stability by constructing classical statistical mechanics models for decoding general CSS codes and classical linear codes. Our construction encodes correction success probabilities under uncorrelated bit-flip and phase-flip errors, and simultaneously describes a generalized Z2 lattice gauge theory with quenched disorder. We observe that the clean limit of the latter is precisely the discretized imaginary time path integral of the corresponding quantum code Hamiltonian when the errors are turned into a perturbative X or Z magnetic field. Motivated by error correction considerations, we define general order parameters for all such generalized Z2 lattice gauge theories, and show that they are generally lower bounded by success probabilities of error correction. For CSS codes satisfying the LDPC condition and with a sufficiently large code distance, we prove the existence of a low temperature ordered phase of the corresponding lattice gauge theories, particularly for those lacking Euclidean spatial locality and/or when there is a nonzero code rate. We further argue that these results provide evidence to stable phases in the corresponding perturbed quantum Hamiltonians, obtained in the limit of continuous imaginary time. To do so, we distinguish space- and time-like defects in the lattice gauge theory. A high free-energy cost of space-like defects corresponds to a successful "memory experiment" and suppresses the energy splitting among the ground states, while a high free-energy cost of time-like defects corresponds to a successful "stability experiment" and points to a nonzero gap to local excitations.</description>

Abstract: The current models of ideal Fermi gas and ideal Bose gas are often considered as compatible with quantum theory. In this work, however, it is shown that improvements should be introduced into these models to take into account the quantum nature of phase space related to the uncertainty principle. The construction of the improved models is based on the use of the concepts of phase space representation of quantum mechanics and quantum phase space that were introduced and developed recently. Hamiltonian operator of a gas particle and its eigenstates are firstly determined and the use of quantum statistical mechanics leads to the deduction of the thermodynamics properties of the ideal gas itself. The explicit expressions of thermodynamic quantities such as the grand canonical potential, the thermodynamic particles number, the internal energy and the pressure as well as the state equations, corresponding to the improved models, are established for both bosons and fermions. The corrections introduced by these expressions are expected to be particularly significant at low temperature and for confined volume. They permit in particular to highlight the existence of quantum shape and size effects. It is also shown that the thermodynamics functions and variables are directly related to the momenta quantum statistical variances. Well-known relations corresponding to classic al ideal gas model can be retrieved from the improved models as asymptotic limits at high temperature and for large volume.</description>
