      <title>Hybrid Boundary Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Solving Navier-Stokes Equations with Complex Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINN) have achieved notable success in solving partial differential equations (PDE), yet solving the Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) with complex boundary conditions remains a challenging task. In this paper, we introduce a novel Hybrid Boundary PINN (HB-PINN) method that combines a pretrained network for efficient initialization with a boundary-constrained mechanism. The HB-PINN method features a primary network focused on inner domain points and a distance metric network that enhances predictions at the boundaries, ensuring accurate solutions for both boundary and interior regions. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted on the NSE under complex boundary conditions, including the 2D cylinder wake flow and the 2D blocked cavity flow with a segmented inlet. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on these benchmark scenarios, demonstrating significantly improved accuracy over existing PINN-based approaches.</description>

      <title>Coupling all-electron full-potential density functional theory with grid-based continuum embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in continuum embedding models have enabled the incorporation of solvent and electrolyte effects into density functional theory (DFT) simulations of material surfaces, significantly benefiting electrochemistry, catalysis, and other applications. To extend the simulation of diverse systems and properties, the implementation of continuum embedding models into the Environ library adopts a modular programming paradigm, offering a flexible interface for communication with various DFT programs. The speed and scalability of the current implementation rely on a smooth definition of the key physical properties of the atomistic system, in particular of its electronic density. This has hindered the coupling of Environ with all-electron simulation packages, as the sharp electron density peaks near atomic nuclei are difficult to represent on regular grids. In this work, we introduce a novel smoothing scheme that transforms atom-centered electron densities into a regular grid representation while preserving the accuracy of electrostatic calculations. This approach enables a minimal and generic interface, facilitating seamless interoperability between Environ and all-electron DFT programs. We demonstrate this development through the coupling of Environ with the FHI-aims package and present benchmark simulations that validate the proposed method.</description>

      <title>From Atoms to Dynamics: Learning the Committor Without Collective Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This Brief Communication introduces a graph-neural-network architecture built on geometric vector perceptrons to predict the committor function directly from atomic coordinates, bypassing the need for hand-crafted collective variables (CVs). The method offers atom-level interpretability, pinpointing the key atomic players in complex transitions without relying on prior assumptions. Applied across diverse molecular systems, the method accurately infers the committor function and highlights the importance of each heavy atom in the transition mechanism. It also yields precise estimates of the rate constants for the underlying processes. The proposed approach opens new avenues for understanding and modeling complex dynamics, by enabling CV-free learning and automated identification of physically meaningful reaction coordinates of complex molecular processes.</description>

      <title>Shot-Efficient ADAPT-VQE via Reused Pauli Measurements and Variance-Based Shot Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Adaptive Variational Quantum Eigensolver (ADAPT-VQE) is a promising approach for quantum algorithms in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, offering advantages over traditional VQE methods by reducing circuit depth and mitigating challenges in classical optimization. However, a major challenge in ADAPT-VQE is the high quantum measurement (shot) overhead required for circuit parameter optimization and operator selection. In this work, we propose two integrated strategies to reduce the shot requirements in ADAPT-VQE. First, we reuse Pauli measurement outcomes obtained during VQE parameter optimization in the subsequent operator selection step of the next ADAPT-VQE iteration, which involves operator gradient measurements. Second, we apply variance-based shot allocation to both Hamiltonian and operator gradient measurements. Our numerical results demonstrate that each method, individually and in combination, significantly reduces the number of shots needed to achieve chemical accuracy while maintaining result fidelity across the studied molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Single attosecond XUV pulse source via light-wave controlled relativistic laser-plasma interaction: Thomson Back Scattering Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reflecting light off a mirror moving near light speed, as first envisioned by Einstein, offers a powerful method for generating bright, ultrashort pulses in the extreme ultraviolet range. Recent breakthroughs show that dense relativistic electron mirrors can be created by striking a nanometre-scale foil with a high-intensity, sharp-front laser pulse, forming a single relativistic electron sheet (RES). This RES coherently reflects and upshifts a counter-propagating laser beam from the infrared to the extreme ultraviolet with efficiency exceeding incoherent scattering by over several orders of magnitude. Here we demonstrate that optimizing the drive laser waveform can reliably produce a single RES, leading to generation of isolated \emph{attosecond} pulses enhancing both intensity and temporal compression of the back reflected light in a controlled manner. Simulations reveal that tuning parameters like timing delay enables control over the amplitude, duration, and bandwidth of the resulting attosecond Thomson backscattering (TBS) pulse. Together, these advances meet key experimental challenges and pave the way for compact, tunable sources of isolated attosecond pulses for probing ultrafast phenomena.</description>

      <title>Surrogate Modeling of Landau Damping with Deep Operator Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kinetic simulations excel at capturing microscale plasma physics phenomena with high accuracy, but their computational demands make them impractical for modeling large-scale space and astrophysical systems. In this context, we build a surrogate model, using Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets), based upon the Vlasov-Poisson simulation data to model the dynamical evolution of plasmas, focusing on the Landau damping process - a fundamental kinetic phenomenon in space and astrophysical plasmas. The trained DeepONets are able to capture the evolution of electric field energy in both linear and nonlinear regimes under various conditions. Extensive validation highlights DeepONets' robust performance in reproducing complex plasma behaviors with high accuracy, paving the way for large-scale modeling of space and astrophysical plasmas.</description>

      <title>Thermophysical and Mechanical Properties Prediction of Rear-earth High-entropy Pyrochlore Based on Deep-learning Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-entropy pyrochlore oxides possess ultra-low thermal conductivity and excellent high-temperature phase stability, making them promising candidate for next-generation thermal barrier coating (TBC) materials. However, reliable predictive models for such complex and disordered systems remain challenging. Ab initio methods, although accurate in describing anharmonic phonon-phonon interactions, struggle to capture the strong inherent phonon-disorder scattering in high-entropy systems. Moreover, the limited simulation cell size, hundreds of atoms, cannot fully represent the configurational complexity of high-entropy phases. On the other hand, classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations lack accurate and transferable interatomic potentials, particularly in multi-component systems like high-entropy ceramics. In this work, we employed Deep Potential Molecular Dynamics (DPMD) to predict the thermophysical and mechanical properties of rare-earth high-entropy pyrochlore oxide system. The deep-potential (DP) model is trained on a limited dataset from ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) calculations, enabling large-scale molecular dynamics simulations with on-the-fly potential evaluations. This model not only achieves high accuracy in reproducing ab initio results but also demonstrates strong generalizability, making it applicable to medium-entropy ceramics containing the same constituent elements. Our study successfully develops a deep potential model for rare-earth pyrochlore systems and demonstrates that the deep-learning-based potential method offers a powerful computational approach for designing high-entropy TBC materials.</description>

      <title>Mechanically and electrically switchable triferroic altermagnet in a pentagonal FeO2 monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional multiferroics promise low-power, multifunctional devices, yet the intrinsic coexistence and mutual control of three coupled ferroic orders in a single layer remains elusive. Here, we identify pentagonal monolayer FeO$_2$ as an intrinsic triferroic altermagnet where ferroelectric (FE), ferroelastic (FA), and altermagnetic (AM) orders coexist and are tightly coupled, accompanied by a competing antiferroelectric (AFE) phase using first-principles calculations. The sole presence of glide mirror $M_x$ symmetry in a FeO$_2$ sublayer, with the breaking of four-fold rotation $C_{4z}$ symmetry, induces in-plane vector ferroelectricity and twin-related ferroelastic strains. Both FE and AFE phases break combined parity - time symmetry and display sizable altermagnetic spin splitting with N\'eel temperatures over 200~K. Electric-field-induced rotation of the FE polarization reverses the sign of the spin splitting, while in-plane uniaxial strain triggers ferroelastic switching that simultaneously rotates the FE polarization vector by $90^\circ$ and reverses the AM state. These electric-field- and strain-mediated pathways interlink six distinct polarization states that can be selected purely by electric fields and/or mechanical strain. This work extends intrinsic triferroicity to pentagonal monolayers and outlines a symmetry-based route toward mechanically and electrically configurable altermagnetic spintronics.</description>

      <title>Quantum walks reveal topological flat bands, robust edge states and topological phase transitions in cyclic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological phases, edge states, and flat bands in synthetic quantum systems are a key resource for topological quantum computing and noise-resilient information processing. We introduce a scheme based on step-dependent quantum walks on cyclic graphs, termed cyclic quantum walks (CQWs), to simulate exotic topological phenomena using discrete Fourier transforms and an effective Hamiltonian. Our approach enables the generation of both gapped and gapless topological phases, including Dirac cone-like energy dispersions, topologically nontrivial flat bands, and protected edge states, all without resorting to split-step or split-coin protocols. Odd and even-site cyclic graphs exhibit markedly different spectral characteristics, with rotationally symmetric flat bands emerging exclusively $4n$-site graphs ($n\in \mathbf{N}$). We analytically establish the conditions for the emergence of topological, gapped flat bands and show that gap closings in rotation space imply the formation of Dirac cones in momentum space. Further, we engineer protected edge states at the interface between distinct topological phases in both odd and even cycle graphs. We numerically demonstrate that the edge states are robust against moderate static and dynamic gate disorder and remain stable against phase-preserving perturbations. This scheme serves as a resource-efficient and versatile platform for engineering topological phases, transitions, edge states, and flat bands in quantum systems, opening new avenues for fault-tolerant quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Beyond symmetry protection: Robust feedback-enforced edge states in non-Hermitian stacked quantum spin Hall systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional wisdom holds that strongly coupling two QSH layers yields a trivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ phase and no protected topological edge states. We demonstrate that, in a regime with intermediate inter-layer coupling (neither in the strong or weak coupling regimes) and competitive non-Hermitian directed amplification, bulk modes are suppressed while arbitrary bulk excitations inevitably accumulate into robust helical edge transport modes - without relying on any symmetry protection. Our feedback-enforced mechanism persists over broad parameter ranges and remains robust even on fractal or irregular boundaries. These findings challenge the traditional view of stacked QSH insulators as inevitably trivial, and open up new avenues for designing helical topological devices that exploit feedback-enforced non-Hermitian engineering, instead of symmetry-enforced robustness.</description>

      <title>The $n$-body problem -- an alternative scheme for determining solutions for planetary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a general alternative scheme of the procedure and necessary conditions for solving the $n$-body problem. The presented solution is not a solution of the classical problem, where the initial conditions of positions and initial velocities/momenta of the bodies are known. Starting from the standard initial condition the procedure treats contributions to momentum from particular pair-wise interactions as independent variables from which the total momentum and velocity of a given mass is then reproduced. Initial values of those contributions are arbitrary as long as the resulting velocities match the initial condition. The obtained solutions take into account the gravitational interactions between each pair of bodies, as a result of which they are characterized by higher stability than the solutions of the classical problem. The presented procedure was used to calculate the positions and mutual velocities of three bodies: the Sun, the Earth and the Moon. It has also been tested for our entire planetary system (8 planets) with the Sun and the Moon. For these types of systems, the method allows obtaining solutions that are stable. The procedure was also tested on the example of the Pythagorean system of bodies.</description>

      <title>Instability of explicit time integration for strongly quenched dynamics with neural quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural quantum states have recently demonstrated significant potential for simulating quantum dynamics beyond the capabilities of existing variational ans\"atze. However, studying strongly driven quantum dynamics with neural networks has proven challenging so far. Here, we focus on assessing several sources of numerical instabilities that can appear in the simulation of quantum dynamics based on the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) with the computationally efficient explicit time integration scheme. Using the restricted Boltzmann machine architecture, we compare solutions obtained by TDVP with analytical solutions and implicit methods as a function of the quench strength. Interestingly, we uncover a quenching strength that leads to a numerical breakdown in the absence of Monte Carlo noise, despite the fact that physical observables don't exhibit irregularities. This breakdown phenomenon appears consistently across several different TDVP formulations, even those that eliminate small eigenvalues of the Fisher matrix or use geometric properties to recast the equation of motion. We conclude that alternative methods need to be developed to leverage the computational efficiency of explicit time integration of the TDVP equations for simulating strongly nonequilibrium quantum dynamics with neural-network quantum states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a neural network (NN)-based solver for an integro-differential equation that models shrinkage-induced fragmentation. The proposed method directly maps input parameters to the corresponding probability density function without numerically solving the governing equation, thereby significantly reducing computational costs. Specifically, it enables efficient evaluation of the density function in Monte Carlo simulations while maintaining accuracy comparable to or even exceeding that of conventional finite difference schemes. Validatation on synthetic data demonstrates both the method's computational efficiency and predictive reliability. This study establishes a foundation for the data-driven inverse analysis of fragmentation and suggests the potential for extending the framework beyond pre-specified model structures.</description>

      <title>Influence Maximization in Temporal Networks with Persistent and Reactive Behaviors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Influence maximization in temporal social networks presents unique challenges due to the dynamic interactions that evolve over time. Traditional diffusion models often fall short in capturing the real-world complexities of active-inactive transitions among nodes, obscuring the true behavior of influence spread. In dynamic networks, nodes do not simply transition to an active state once; rather, they can oscillate between active and inactive states, with the potential for reactivation and reinforcement over time. This reactivation allows previously influenced nodes to regain influence potency, enhancing their ability to spread influence to others and amplifying the overall diffusion process. Ignoring these transitions can thus conceal the cumulative impact of influence, making it essential to account for them in any effective diffusion model. To address these challenges, we introduce the Continuous Persistent Susceptible-Infected Model with Reinforcement and Re-activation (cpSI-R), which explicitly incorporates active-inactive transitions, capturing the progressive reinforcement that makes nodes more potent spreaders upon reactivation. This model naturally leads to a submodular and monotone objective function, which supports efficient optimization for seed selection in influence maximization tasks. Alongside cpSI-R, we propose an efficient temporal snapshot sampling method, simplifying the analysis of evolving networks. We then adapt the prior algorithms of seed selection to our model and sampling strategy, resulting in reduced computational costs and enhanced seed selection efficiency. Experimental evaluations on diverse datasets demonstrate substantial improvements in performance over baseline methods, underscoring the effectiveness of cpSI-R for real-world temporal networks</description>

Abstract: Dislocation-density-based crystal plasticity (CP) models are introduced to account for the microstructural changes throughout the deformation process, enabling more quantitative predictions of the deformation process compared to slip-system resistance-based plasticity models. In this work, we present a stability analysis of slip-rate-driven processes for some established dislocation density-based models, including the Kocks and Mecking (KM) model and its variants. Our analysis can be generalized to any type of dislocation density model, providing a broader framework for understanding the stability of such systems. We point out the existence of saturation dislocation densities and the essential role of initial dislocation density in distinguishing between hardening and softening responses. Since the initial microstructure, modeled through the dislocation density, could be related to the size or the sample preparation process, implicit size-dependent effects can also be inferred. To further explore these phenomena, we conduct numerical simulations of pillar compression using an Eulerian crystal plasticity framework. Our results show that dislocation-density-based CP models effectively capture microstructural evolution in small-scale materials, offering critical insights for the design of miniaturized mechanical devices and advanced materials in nanotechnology.</description>

      <title>High-$T_{\rm c}$ Ag$_x$BC and Cu$_x$BC superconductors accessible via topochemical reactions</title>

Abstract: Hole-doping of covalent materials has long served as a blueprint for designing conventional high-$T_{\rm c}$ superconductors, but thermodynamic constraints severely limit the space of realizable compounds. Our ab initio results indicate that metastable Ag$_x$BC and Cu$_x$BC phases can be accessed via standard topochemical ion exchange reactions starting from Li$_x$BC precursors. Unlike all known stoichiometric layered metal borocarbides, the predicted AgBC and CuBC derivatives, comprising honeycomb layers bridged by dumbbells, are metallic rather than semiconducting. Anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg analysis reveals that the intrinsically hole-doped AgBC possesses a unique combination of electronic and vibrational features to exhibit two-gap superconductivity above 50 K.</description>
