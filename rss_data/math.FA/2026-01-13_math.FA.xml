      <title>Some minimum topological spaces, and vector lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the existence of compact Hausdorff spaces $X$ that are minimum with respect to $cX=K$ for some fixed covering operator $c$ and compact Hausdorff space $K$ with $cK=K$. Then, using the Yosida representation theorem, we show how that situation relates to the existence of Archimedean vector lattices $A$ with distinguished strong unit that are minimum with respect to $hA=H$ for some fixed hull operator $h$ and vector lattice $H$ with $hH=H$. Among others, we obtain answers for $c=g$ (the Gleason covering operator), $c=qF$ (the quasi-$F$ covering operator), $h = u$ (the uniform completion operator), and $h=e$ (the essential completion operator).</description>

      <title>Amenability constants for unconditional sums of Banach algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Johnson amenability for unconditional direct sums of Banach algebras. Given a family $(A_i)_{i\in I}$ of Banach algebras and a Banach sequence lattice $E$ on~$I$, the $E$-sum $\bigl(\bigoplus_{i\in I} A_i\bigr)_{\!E}$ carries a natural Banach algebra structure via coordinatewise multiplication. Under the hypothesis that $C_E := \sup\{\|\chi_F\|_E : F \subseteq I \text{ finite}\} &lt; \infty$, we prove that this $E$-sum is amenable if and only if the amenability constants of the summands are uniformly bounded, and we establish the two-sided estimate \[ \sup_{i\in I}\operatorname{AM}(A_i) \;\le\; \operatorname{AM}\Bigl(\bigl(\textstyle\bigoplus_{i\in I} A_i\bigr)_{\!E}\Bigr) \;\le\; C_E^2 \sup_{i\in I}\operatorname{AM}(A_i). \] We show that the factor $C_E^2$ is sharp by exhibiting finite-dimensional examples where equality holds. We further prove that finiteness of $C_E$ is necessary whenever infinitely many summands are non-zero and the sum admits a bounded approximate identity.
  Finally, we investigate weak amenability of $E$-sums. We prove that weak amenability passes to summands, that $E$-sums of commutative weakly amenable algebras are weakly amenable, and contrasting sharply with the Johnson amenability picture that for $1 &lt; p &lt; \infty$, the $\ell_p$-sum of infinitely many copies of a non-commutative weakly amenable algebra fails to be weakly amenable. In the $c_0$-type regime ($C_E &lt; \infty$), we establish a two-sided estimate for weak amenability constants analogous to that for Johnson amenability.</description>

      <title>Posinormality and the Root Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper extends three results regarding the nth root problem by embedding classes of Hilbert-space operators into the class of posinormal operators. For instance, it is shown that (i) for coposinormal operators, if T is paranormal and T^n is quasinormal, then T is normal, and (ii) for posinormal operators, if T is k-quasiparanormal and T^n is normal, then T is normal. Moreover, (iii) it is also shown that the latter result is not conditioned to the separability of the underlying Hilbert space, even if T is not posinormal, where, in such a case, T is the direct sum of a normal operator with a nilpotent one.</description>

      <title>Weak majorization inequalities for the cubic and quartic coefficients of $e^{(A+B)t}$ versus $e^{At}e^{Bt}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A,B\in\mathbb{H}_n$ and set $H=A+B$. For each integer $k\ge 1$ define
  $$
  Q_k:=\sum_{p=0}^k \binom{k}{p} A^pB^{k-p},
  R_k:=\Re\,Q_k=\frac{Q_k+Q_k^*}{2}.
  $$
  Then $H^k=\left.\frac{d^k}{dt^k}e^{Ht}\right|_{t=0}$ and $Q_k=\left.\frac{d^k}{dt^k}(e^{At}e^{Bt})\right|_{t=0}$. We prove that, for $k=3,4,$
  $$
  \lambda(H^k)\prec_w \sigma(Q_k).
  $$ Equivalently, the eigenvalues of the cubic and quartic Taylor coefficients of $e^{(A+B)t}$ are weakly majorized by the singular values of the corresponding coefficients of the Golden--Thompson product $e^{At}e^{Bt}$. Our argument combines Ky Fan variational principles with explicit commutator identitiesfor $R_k-H^k$ at orders $k=3,4$, reducing the problem to the positivity of certain double-commutator trace forms tested against Ky Fan maximizing projections. We also record a general sufficient condition for higher orders based on commutator decompositions.</description>

      <title>Phase-field approximation of sharp-interface energies accounting for lattice symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a phase-field approximation of sharp-interface energies defined on partitions, designed for modeling grain boundaries in polycrystals. The independent variable takes values in the orthogonal group $\mathrm{O}(d)$ modulo a lattice point group $\mathcal{G}$, reflecting the crystallographic symmetries of the underlying lattice. In the sharp-interface limit, the surface energy exhibits a Read-Shockley-type behavior for small misorientation angles, scaling as $\theta|\log\theta|$. The regularized functionals are applicable to grain growth simulation and the reconstruction of grain boundaries from imaging data.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of the translation semigroup on directed metric trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of the left translation semigroup $\{T_t\}_{t \geq 0}$ on weighted $L^p$ spaces over a directed metric tree $L(G)$ is investigated. Necessary and sufficient conditions on the weight family $\rho$ for the strong continuity of the semigroup are provided. Furthermore, hypercyclicity and weak mixing properties are characterized in terms of the asymptotic decay of $\rho$ along the tree structure. These results generalize classical $L^p$ translation semigroup dynamics to a graph setting.</description>

      <title>A new family of hyperbolic slits in the Gabor frame set of B-spline generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We exhibit a new infinite family of hyperbolic curves in the complement of the frame set of Gabor systems with B-spline generators. The proof technique is a combination of an approach by Gr\"ochenig [Partitions of unity and new obstructions for Gabor frames, arXiv:1507.08432, 2015] and a partly partition of unity argument by Nielsen and the author [Counterexamples to the B-spline conjecture for Gabor frames, J. Fourier Anal. Appl., 22(6):1440-1451, 2016]. We relate the new hyperbolic obstructions to the "right bow tie" of the so-called Janssen tie [Zak transforms with few zeros and the tie, In Advances in Gabor analysis, Birkh\"auser, 2003].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate growth properties of cocycles with values in uniformly bounded representations on super-reflexive Banach spaces; this includes $L^p$-spaces for $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$ as well as Hilbert spaces. We then study the generalized Hilbert compression of cocycles arising in this setting for the Property (T) groups $\mathrm{Sp}(n,1)$, $n\ge 2$, and establish the existence of uniformly Lipschitz affine actions with optimal growth.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the notion of an exponential dichotomy with respect to a family of norms for an evolutionary family in a Banach space, and we characterize it by the admissibility of the pair $(L^p,L^q)$ for $p,q \in [1,\infty]$ with $p\ge q$. We then use this characterization to establish the robustness of an exponentially dichotomic evolutionary family with respect to a family of norms.</description>

      <title>Global Well-Posedness of the Vacuum Free Boundary Problem for the Degenerate Compressible Navier-Stokes Equations With Large Data of Spherical Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of global-in-time dynamics of vacuum is crucial for understanding viscous flows. However, the corresponding large-data problems for multidimensional spherically symmetric flows have remained open, due to the coordinate singularity at the origin and the strong degeneracy on the moving boundary. In this paper, we analyze the vacuum free boundary problem for the barotropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations with degenerate density-dependent viscosity coefficients (as in the shallow water equations) in two and three spatial dimensions. We prove that, for a general class of spherically symmetric initial density: $\rho_0^{\beta}\in H^3$ with $\beta\in (\frac{1}{3},\gamma-1]$ ($\gamma$: adiabatic exponent) vanishing on the moving boundary in the form of a distance function, no vacuum forms inside the fluid in finite time, and we establish the global well-posedness of classical solutions with large initial data. Particularly, when $\beta=\gamma-1$, the initial density contains a physical vacuum, but fails to satisfy the condition required for the Bresch-Desjardins (BD) entropy estimate when $\gamma\ge 2$. Our analysis is mainly based on a region-segmentation method: near the origin, we develop an interior BD entropy estimate, thereby obtaining flow-map-weighted estimates for the density; while, near the boundary, we construct $\rho_0$-weighted estimates for the effective velocity, which differ fundamentally from the classical BD entropy estimates and yield novel flow-map-weighted estimates for both the fluid and the effective velocities. These estimates enable us to obtain the uniform upper bound for the density and show that no cavitation occurs inside the fluid. The methodology developed here should also be useful for solving other related nonlinear equations involving similar difficulties.</description>

      <title>Homogenization of L\'evy-type operators: operator estimates with correctors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of the paper is to study in $L_2(\R^d)$ a self-adjoint operator ${\mathbb A}_\eps$, $\eps &gt;0$, of the form $$ ({\mathbb A}_\eps u) (\x) = \int_{\R^d} \mu(\x/\eps, \y/\eps) \frac{\left( u(\x) - u(\y) \right)}{|\x - \y|^{d+\alpha}}\,d\y $$ with $1&lt; \alpha &lt; 2$;
  here the function
  $\mu(\x,\y)$ is $\Z^d$-periodic in the both variables, satisfies the symmetry relation $\mu(\x,\y) = \mu(\y,\x)$ and
  the estimates $0&lt; \mu_- \leqslant \mu(\x,\y) \leqslant \mu_+&lt; \infty$. The rigorous definition of the operator ${\mathbb A}_\eps$ is given in terms of the corresponding quadratic form. In the previous work of the authors it was shown that the resolvent $({\mathbb A}_\eps + I)^{-1}$ converges, as $\eps\to0$, in the operator norm in $L_2(\mathbb R^d)$ to the resolvent of the effective operator $A^0$, and the estimate $\|({\mathbb A}_\eps + I)^{-1} - (\A^0 + I)^{-1} \| = O(\eps^{2-\alpha})$ holds. In the present work we achieve a more accurate approximation of the resolvent of ${\mathbb A}_\eps$ which takes into account the correctors. Namely, for $N\in\mathbb N$ such that $2-1/N &lt; \alpha \le 2-1/(N+1)$, we obtain $$ \bigl\|({\mathbb A}_\eps + I)^{-1} - (\A^0 + I)^{-1} - \sum_{m=1}^N \eps^{m(2-\alpha)} \mathbb{K}_m \bigr\| = O(\eps). $$</description>

      <title>Neuronal Spike Trains as Functional-Analytic Distributions: Representation, Analysis, and Significance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The action potential constitutes the digital component of the signaling dynamics of neurons. But the biophysical nature of the full time course of the action potential associated with changes in membrane potential is fundamentally and mathematically distinct from its representation as a discrete set of events that encode when action potentials triggered in a collection spike trains. In this paper, we rigorously explore from first principles the transition and modeling from the standard biophysical picture of a single action potential to its representation as a spike in a spike train. In particular, we adopt a functional-analytic framework, using Schwartz distribution theory to represent spike trains as generalized Dirac delta functions acting on smooth test functions. We then show how and why this representation transcends a purely descriptive formalism to support deep downstream analysis and modeling of spike train neural dynamics in a mathematically consistent way.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study a generalized concept of boundedness of a subset of a normed vector space with respect to a cone, which is defined as lower boundedness of the images of the underlying set through all the positive functionals of the cone. We show that this is a weaker notion when compared to other similar ones and we explore several links with the existing literature. We subsequently demonstrate that this concept furnishes the properties required to obtain various generalizations of important results and techniques, including conic cancellation rules and the R{\aa}dstr\"om embedding procedure.</description>

      <title>Heat kernel-based p-energy norms on metric measure spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.10414v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate heat kernel-based and other $p$-energy norms (1&lt;p&lt;\infty) on bounded and unbounded metric measure spaces, in particular, on nested fractals and their blowups. With the weak-monotonicity properties for these norms, we generalise the celebrated Bourgain-Brezis-Mironescu (BBM) type characterization for p\neq2. When there admits a heat kernel satisfying the two-sided estimates, we establish the equivalence of various $p$-energy norms and weak-monotonicity properties, and show that these weak-monotonicity properties hold when p=2 (in the case of Dirichlet form). Our paper's key results concern the equivalence and verification of various weak-monotonicity properties on fractals. Consequently, many classical results on p-energy norms hold on nested fractals and their blowups, including the BBM type characterization and Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality.</description>

Abstract: We consider infinite $\Z_\Z$-index complexes $\mathcal C$ of spaces with elements depending on a number of parameters, complete with respect to a linear associative regular inseparable multilinear product. The existence of nets of vanishing ideals of orders of and powers of differentials is assumed for subspaces of $\mathcal C$-spaces. In the polynomial case of orders and powers of the differentials, we derive the hierarchies of differential identities and closed multiple products. We prove that a set of maximal orders and powers for differentials, differential conditions, together with coherence conditions on indices of a complex $\mathcal C$ elements generate families of multi-graded differential algebras.</description>

      <title>Positive operator-valued noncommutative polynomials are squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06487v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish operator-valued versions of the earlier foundational factorization results for noncommutative polynomials due to Helton (Ann.~Math., 2002) and one of the authors (Linear Alg.~Appl., 2001). Specifically, we show that every positive operator-valued noncommutative polynomial $p$ admits a single-square factorization $p=r^{*}r$. An analogous statement holds for operator-valued noncommutative trigonometric polynomials.
  Our approach follows the now standard sum-of-squares (sos) paradigm but requires new results and constructions tailored to operator coefficients. Assuming a positive $p$ is not sos, Hahn--Banach separation yields a linear functional that is positive on the sos cone and negative on $p$; a Gelfand--Naimark--Segal (GNS) construction then produces a representing tuple $Y$ leading to contradiction since $p$ was assumed positive on $Y$.
  The main technical input is a canonical tuple $A$ of self-adjoint operators and, in the unitary case, a canonical tuple $U$ of unitaries, both constructed from the left-regular representation on Fock space. We prove that, up to a universal constant, the norms $\|p(A)\|$ and $\|p(U)\|$ bound the operator norm of any positive semidefinite Gram matrix $G$ representing the sos polynomial $p$. This uniform control is the key input in showing that the cone of (sums of) squares is closed in the product ultraweak topology on the coefficients. A separate approximation argument then produces a separating functional that is continuous for the weak operator topology (WOT). This two-step passage between the ultraweak and WOT topologies constitutes our separation argument and yields the required WOT closedness of the sos cone. With this in hand, the GNS construction associates to such a separating linear functional a finite-rank positive semidefinite noncommutative Hankel matrix and, on its range, produces the desired tuple $Y$.</description>

      <title>On Hahn-Banach smoothness of $L_1$-preduals and related $w^*-w$ point of continuity of unit balls of dual spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we intend to study possible $(U)$-embeddings of a Banach space $X$ into $X^{**}$. The canonical embedding of $X$ in $X^{**}$ which possesses $(U)$-embedding is of particular interest and such spaces are known as Hahn-Banach smooth spaces. Separable $L_1$-preduals are characterized which are Hahn-Banach smooth. It is derived that, when $S$ is a compact convex set where each point in $ext(S)$ is a limit point of $ext(S)$ then no subspace of $A(S)$ retains property-$(wU)$ in $A(S)^{**}$. Moreover, if $X$ is an $L_1$-predual where $I:(B_{X^*},w^*)\rightarrow (B_{X^*},w)$ is continuous on $ext (B_{X^*})$ then $X$ is Hahn-Banach smooth, is observed. This means that not all finitely supported elements in $B_{\ell_1}$ can be points of continuity of $I:(B_{\ell_1},w^*(c))\rightarrow (B_{\ell_1},w)$, which is incorrectly stated in \cite{DMR}. Throughout this article this fact is established in a few ways. It is shown that if $L_1(\mu)$ possesses a predual that is weakly Hahn-Banach smooth, then $\mu$ must have a specific characteristic.</description>

      <title>Kubota-type formulas and supports of mixed measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kubota's integral formula expresses the intrinsic volumes of a convex body as averages over its projections onto linear subspaces. In this work, we introduce a new class of Kubota-type formulas for mixed area measures adapted to rotations around a fixed axis, which encode a crucial disintegration property. Our construction is motivated by applications to valuations on convex functions. In the latter framework, we obtain corresponding statements for (conjugate) mixed Monge-Amp\`ere measures. As a by-product, we characterize supports of mixed area and mixed Monge-Amp\`ere measures, thereby confirming a special case of a conjecture by Schneider.</description>

      <title>Learning Operators with Stochastic Gradient Descent in General Hilbert Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04691v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates leveraging stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to learn operators between general Hilbert spaces. We propose weak and strong regularity conditions for the target operator to depict its intrinsic structure and complexity. Under these conditions, we establish upper bounds for convergence rates of the SGD algorithm and conduct a minimax lower bound analysis, further illustrating that our convergence analysis and regularity conditions quantitatively characterize the tractability of solving operator learning problems using the SGD algorithm. It is crucial to highlight that our convergence analysis is still valid for nonlinear operator learning. We show that the SGD estimator will converge to the best linear approximation of the nonlinear target operator. Moreover, applying our analysis to operator learning problems based on vector-valued and real-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces yields new convergence results, thereby refining the conclusions of existing literature.</description>

      <title>Hypoellipticity and Higher Order Gaussian Bounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14456v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $(\mathfrak{M},\rho,\mu)$ be a metric measure space satisfying a doubling condition, $p_0\in (1,\infty)$, and $T(t):L^{p_0}(\mathfrak{M},\mu)\rightarrow L^{p_0}(\mathfrak{M},\mu)$, $t\geq 0$, a strongly continuous semi-group. We provide sufficient conditions under which $T(t)$ is given by integration against an integral kernel satisfying higher-order Gaussian bounds of the form \[
  \left| K_t(x,y) \right| \leq C \exp\left( -c \left( \frac{\rho(x,y)^{2\kappa}}{t} \right)^{\frac{1}{2\kappa-1}} \right) \mu\left( B_\rho\left(x,\rho(x,y)+t^{1/2\kappa}\right) \right)^{-1}, \] where $B_\rho$ denotes the metric ball. We also provide conditions for similar bounds on ``derivatives'' of $K_t(x,y)$ and our results are localizable. If $A$ is the generator of $T(t)$ the main hypothesis is that $\partial_t -A$ and $\partial_t-A^{*}$ satisfy a hypoelliptic estimate at every scale, uniformly in the scale. We present applications to subelliptic PDEs.</description>

      <title>Learning Operators by Regularized Stochastic Gradient Descent with Operator-valued Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18184v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of statistical inverse problems involving the estimation of a regression operator from a Polish space to a separable Hilbert space, where the target lies in a vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert space induced by an operator-valued kernel. To address the associated ill-posedness, we analyze regularized stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithms in both online and finite-horizon settings. The former uses polynomially decaying step sizes and regularization parameters, while the latter adopts fixed values. Under suitable structural and distributional assumptions, we establish dimension-independent bounds for prediction and estimation errors. The resulting convergence rates are near-optimal in expectation, and we also derive high-probability estimates that imply almost sure convergence. Our analysis introduces a general technique for obtaining high-probability guarantees in infinite-dimensional settings. Possible extensions to broader kernel classes and encoder-decoder structures are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>A Kernel-based Stochastic Approximation Framework for Nonlinear Operator Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11070v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a stochastic approximation framework for learning nonlinear operators between infinite-dimensional spaces utilizing general Mercer operator-valued kernels. Our framework encompasses two key classes: (i) compact kernels, which admit discrete spectral decompositions, and (ii) diagonal kernels of the form $K(x,x')=k(x,x')T$, where $k$ is a scalar-valued kernel and $T$ is a positive operator on the output space. This broad setting induces expressive vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs) that generalize the classical $K=kI$ paradigm, thereby enabling rich structural modeling with rigorous theoretical guarantees. To address target operators lying outside the RKHS, we introduce vector-valued interpolation spaces to precisely quantify misspecification error. Within this framework, we establish dimension-free polynomial convergence rates, demonstrating that nonlinear operator learning can overcome the curse of dimensionality. The use of general operator-valued kernels further allows us to derive rates for intrinsically nonlinear operator learning, going beyond the linear-type behavior inherent in diagonal constructions of $K=kI$. Importantly, this framework accommodates a wide range of operator learning tasks, ranging from integral operators such as Fredholm operators to architectures based on encoder-decoder representations. Moreover, we validate its effectiveness through numerical experiments on the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of metric measure spaces, we introduce an axiomatic formulation of mixed local and nonlocal $p$-energy forms. Within this framework, we use the Poincar\'{e} inequality, the cutoff Sobolev inequality, and mild assumptions on the jump measure to establish the weak and strong elliptic Harnack inequalities for such mixed forms. Our approach is based on the De Giorgi--Nash--Moser method and extends the corresponding results for Dirichlet forms without the killing part, as well as for mixed energy forms on Euclidean spaces.</description>

      <title>Fisher-Hartwig asymptotics for non-Hermitian random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the two-dimensional analogue of the asymptotics for Toeplitz determinants with Fisher-Hartwig singularities, for general real symbols. This formula has applications to random normal matrices with complex spectra: (i) the characteristic polynomial converges to a Gaussian multiplicative chaos random measure on the limiting droplet, in the subcritical phase; (ii) the electric potential converges pointwise to a logarithmically correlated field; (iii) the measure of its level sets (i.e. thick points) is identified; (iv) the associated free energy undergoes a freezing transition.
  This establishes emergence of the Liouville quantum gravity measure from free fermions in 2d, and universality with respect to the external potential.</description>

      <title>Completeness and reflexivity type properties of $B_1(X)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00733v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a Tychonoff space $X$, $B_1(X)$ denotes the space of all Baire-one functions on $X$ endowed with the pointwise topology. We prove that the following assertions are equivalent: (1) $B_1(X)$ is a (semi-)Montel space, (2) $B_1(X)$ is a (semi-)reflexive space, (3) $B_1(X)$ is a (quasi-)complete space, (4) $B_1(X)=\mathbb{R}^X$, (5) $X$ is a $Q_f$-space. It is proved that $B_1(X)$ is sequentially complete iff $B_1(X)$ is locally complete iff $X$ is a $CZ$-space. In the case when $K$ is a compact space, we show that $B_1(K)$ is locally complete iff $K$ is scattered. We thoroughly study the case when $X$ is a separable metrizable space. Numerous distinguished examples are given.</description>
