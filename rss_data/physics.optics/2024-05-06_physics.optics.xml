      <title>Effect of multiple bands on high-harmonic generation in zinc oxide subjected to intense mid-infrared femtosecond laser pulse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate photo-ionization and high harmonic generation in the bulk of zinc oxide subjected to intense femto-second laser pulses with mid-infrared wavelength (3 $\mu$m). When the electric field strength inside vacuum is below $0.6$ V/\AA, an intra-band mechanism associated to non-adiabatic response of multiple valence and conduction bands is found to be responsible for high-harmonic generation in the bulk solid. Good semi-quantitative agreement with the experimental data is found: clean and well defined odd-order harmonic peaks extending beyond the band edge of ZnO are exhibited for laser linearly polarized perpendicular to the optical axis of the crystal.</description>

      <title>Highly efficient compact acousto-optic modulator based on a hybrid-lattice hollow core fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the acousto-optic modulation of a hybrid-lattice hollow core fiber (HL-HCF) for the first time. For many years, optical fibers with reduced diameters have been the main solution to increase the interaction of acoustic and optical waves. However, the high drive voltages and large modulator components still employed drastically affect the efficiency and miniaturization of these devices. Here, we experimentally show that combining Kagom\'e and tubular lattices in HL-HCFs allows for enhancing the amplification of the acoustic waves and the modulation of the guided optical modes thus providing high modulation efficiency even when using a fiber with a 240 um diameter. To the best of our knowledge, the measured HL-HCF's modulation efficiency (1.3 dB/V) is the highest compared to devices employing reduced diameter fibers. Additionally, we demonstrate a compact acousto-optic modulator with driver dimensions smaller than the HL-HCF diameter. Overall, our results show a promising alternative to solve the compromise of speed, efficiency, and compactness for integration with microscale all-fiber photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Polaritonic Fourier crystal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polaritonic crystals - periodic structures where the hybrid light-matter waves called polaritons can form Bloch states - promise a deeply subdiffractional nanolight manipulation and enhanced light-matter interaction. In particular, polaritons in van der Waals materials boast extreme field confinement and long lifetimes allowing for the exploitation of wave phenomena at the nanoscale. However, in conventionally patterned nanostructures, polaritons are prone to severe scattering loss at the sharp material edges, making it challenging to create functional polaritonic crystals. Here, we introduce a new concept of a polaritonic Fourier crystal based on a harmonic modulation of the polariton momentum in a pristine polaritonic waveguide with minimal scattering. We employ hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and near-field imaging to reveal a neat and well-defined band structure of phonon-polaritons in the Fourier crystal, stemming from the dominant excitation of the first-order Bloch mode. Furthermore, we show that the fundamental Bloch mode possesses a polaritonic bandgap even in the relatively lossy naturally abundant hBN. Thus, our work provides a new paradigm for polaritonic crystals essential for enhanced light-matter interaction, dispersion engineering, and nanolight guiding.</description>

      <title>Change of polarization degree of light beams on propagation in curved space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Even in free space, which is commonly considered of as a flat space-time in most settings, the degree of polarization of a partially spatially coherent light beam changes as it travels. Similarly, the polarization degree would change when a partially spatially coherent light beam propagates in a curved space-time. The difference of the polarization degree between the curved space and flat space can reveal the essential structure of the curved space. In this work, we consider a simplest case of curved space known as Schwarzschild spacetime. We can simulate the Schwarzschild space-time as an optical material with an effective refractive index. The difference of the polarization degree of a light beam propagating in curved space and flat space can be achieved up to $ 5\% $, which is detectable in practical measurement. In addition, we have found that the partially spatially coherent light source is necessary for obtaining significant changes in polarization degree. Our results provide an alternative method to estimate the Schwarzschild radius of a massive object with the optical polarization degree measurement.</description>

      <title>Optical skyrmions from metafibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical skyrmions are an emerging class of structured light with sophisticated particle-like topologies with great potential for revolutionizing modern informatics. However, the current generation of optical skyrmions involves complex or bulky systems, hindering their development of practical applications. Here, exploiting the emergent "lab-on-fiber" technology, we demonstrate the design of a metafiber-integrated photonic skyrmion generator. We not only successfully generated high-quality optical skyrmions from metafibers, but also experimentally verified their remarkable properties, such as regulability and topological stability with deep-subwavelength features beyond the diffraction limits. Our flexible and fiber-integrated optical skyrmions platform paves the avenue for future applications of topologically-enhanced remote super-resolution microscopy and super-robust information transfer.</description>

      <title>All-fiber microendoscopic polarization sensing at single-photon level aided by deep-learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The polarization of light conveys crucial information about the spatial ordering and optical properties of a specimen. However, precise polarization measurement in challenging conditions, including constrained spaces, low light levels, and high-speed scenarios, remains a severe challenge. Addressing this problem, we introduce a real-time polarization measurement method accurate down to a single-photon level that provides complete information about the polarization state. Free of moving components, the polarization sensor utilizes a few-mode fiber followed by a fiber array and a detector array. The calibration of the sensor relies on a neural network yielding unprecedented accuracy across all polarization states, including partially polarized light. We validate the approach by visualizing the polarization structure of a biological specimen. Our method offers an efficient and reliable solution for real-time polarization sensing and microendoscopy under low-light conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Backflow, or retropropagation, is a counterintuitive phenomenon whereby for a forward-propagating wave the energy locally propagates backward. In this study, energy backflow has been examined in connection with (a) (2+1)-dimensional unidirectional scalar and vector-valued monochromatic waves; (b) a (2+1)D scalar spatiotemporal wavepacket constructed by using an appropriate temporal frequency spectrum; (c) a scalar closed-form analytical unidirectional version of the Focus Wave Mode -- a localized pulse propagating luminally and without spread. Furthermore, an extended class of (2+1)D and (3+1)D finite-energy unidirectional spatiotemporally localized wave packets has been derived.</description>

      <title>Foundry's perspective on laser and SOA module integration with silicon photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silicon photonic integrated circuit (PIC) builds on the demand for a low cost approach from established silicon-based manufacturing infrastructure traditionally built for electronics. Besides its natural abundance, silicon has desirable properties such as optically low loss (at certain critical wavelengths), and small form factor to enable high density scaled-up optical on-chip circuitry. However, given its indirect bandgap, the platform is typically integrated with other direct bandgap (e.g., III-V semiconductor) platforms for on-chip light source. An effective solution to integrating light source onto silicon photonics platform is integral to a practical scaled-up and full-fledged integrated photonics implementation. Here, we discuss the integration solutions, and present our foundry's perspective toward realizing it.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advanced multijunction solar cell (MJSC) has emerged as a frontrunner with higher efficiency in photovoltaic literature. It started its journey with a modest 20% efficient tandem solar cell, and today, it has reached an impressive 47.1% photoconversion efficiency (PCE) with six junction combinations. Since the early 1990s, these solar cells have been utilised for space applications. Recently, there has been a trend of using this genre for terrestrial applications as well. However, the complexity and high cost of the fabrication procedure have been the significant challenges over the last three decades. The photovoltaic (PV) community has witnessed a variety of fabrication approaches to address these hurdles. This paper reviews the progression of computational and experimental research approaches of III-V MJSCs and their fabrication processes. In addition, it addresses the barriers hindering the progress of these cells and their prospects. This review gathers insights from a handful number of articles on III-V MJSCs to provide a comprehensive guide for the new entrants, experts and practitioners about the research methodologies, growth techniques, current status, challenges, and opportunities in a timely and conscious manner.</description>

      <title>Configurable Learned Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the pursuit of advancing holographic display technology, we face a unique yet persistent roadblock: the inflexibility of learned holography in adapting to various hardware configurations.
  This is due to the variances in the complex optical components and system settings in existing holographic displays.
  Although the emerging learned approaches have enabled rapid and high-quality hologram generation, any alteration in display hardware still requires a retraining of the model.
  Our work introduces a configurable learned model that interactively computes 3D holograms from RGB-only 2D images for a variety of holographic displays.
  The model can be conditioned to predefined hardware parameters of existing holographic displays such as working wavelengths, pixel pitch, propagation distance, and peak brightness without having to retrain.
  In addition, our model accommodates various hologram types, including conventional single-color and emerging multi-color holograms that simultaneously use multiple color primaries in holographic displays.
  Notably, we enabled our hologram computations to rely on identifying the correlation between depth estimation and 3D hologram synthesis tasks within the learning domain for the first time in the literature.
  We employ knowledge distillation via a student-teacher learning strategy to streamline our model for interactive performance.
  Achieving up to a 2x speed improvement compared to state-of-the-art models while consistently generating high-quality 3D holograms with different hardware configurations.</description>

      <title>Computational Electromagnetics Meets Spin Qubits: Controlling Noise Effects in Quantum Sensing and Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solid-state spin qubits have emerged as promising quantum information platforms but are susceptible to magnetic noise. Despite extensive efforts in controlling noise in spin qubit quantum applications, one important but less controlled noise source is near-field electromagnetic fluctuations. Low-frequency (MHz and GHz) electromagnetic fluctuations are significantly enhanced near nanostructured lossy material components essential in quantum applications, including metallic/superconducting gates necessary for controlling spin qubits in quantum computing devices and materials/nanostructures to be probed in quantum sensing. Although controlling this low-frequency electromagnetic fluctuation noise is crucial for improving the performance of quantum sensing and computing, current efforts are hindered by computational challenges. In this paper, we leverage advanced computational electromagnetics techniques, especially fast and accurate volume integral equation based solvers, to overcome the computational obstacle. We introduce a theoretical and computational framework to control low-frequency magnetic fluctuation noise for enhancing spin qubit quantum sensing and computing performance. Our framework extends the application of computational electromagnetics to spin qubit quantum devices. We further apply our theoretical framework to control noise effects in realistic quantum computing devices and quantum sensing applications. Our work paves the way for device engineering to control magnetic fluctuations and improve the performance of spin qubit quantum sensing and computing.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Configurational Spectral Splitting between Trion and Charged Exciton in a Monolayer Semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many-body electron-hole complexes in a semiconductor are important both from a fundamental physics point of view and for practical device applications. A three-body system of electrons (e) and holes (h) (2e1h, or 1e2h) in a two-band semiconductor is commonly believed to be associated with two spectral peaks for the exciton and trion (or charged exciton), respectively. But both the validity of this understanding and the physical meaning of a trion or charged exciton have not been thoroughly examined. From the physics point of view, there are two different configurations, (e)(eh) or (eeh), which could be considered charged exciton and trion, respectively. Here (...) represents an irreducible cluster with respect to Coulomb interactions. In this paper, we consider these issues related to the 2e1h three-body problem theoretically and experimentally using monolayer MoTe2 as an example. Our theoretical tools involve the three-body Bethe-Salpeter Equation (BSE) and the cluster expansion technique, especially their correspondence. Experimentally, we measure the photoluminescence spectrum on a gate-controlled monolayer MoTe2. We found two spectral peaks that are 21 and 4 meV, respectively, below the exciton peak, in contrast to the single "trion" peak from the conventional understanding. We show that, while the three-body BSE in a two-band model can reproduce all spectral features, the cluster-expansion technique shows that the two peaks correspond to the charged exciton (e)(eh) and trion (eeh), respectively. In other words, there is a spectral splitting due to the two different many-body configurations. Furthermore, we find that the trion only exists in the intervalley case, while the charged exciton exists both for the intervalley and intravalley cases.</description>

      <title>Probing fragile topology with a screw dislocation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fragile topology, akin to twisted bilayer graphene and the exotic phases therein, is a notable topological class with intriguing properties. However, due to its unique nature and the lack of bulk-edge correspondence, the experimental signature of fragile topology has been under debated since its birth. Here, we demonstrate experimentally that fragile topological phases with filling anomaly can be probed via screw dislocations, despite that they do not support gapless edge states. Using a designer hexagonal phononic crystal with a fragile topological band gap, we find that 1D gapless bound modes can emerge at a screw dislocation due to the bulk fragile topology. We then establish a connection between our system and the twisted boundary condition via the gauge invariance principle and illustrate that such an emergent phenomenon is an intrinsic property of fragile topological phases with filling anomaly. We observe experimentally the 1D topological bound states using the pump-probe measurements of their dispersion and wavefunctions, which unveils a novel bulk-defect correspondence of fragile topology and a powerful tool for probing fragile topological phases and materials.</description>

      <title>Coherent XUV super continuum emission from atomic bound states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent supercontinuum radiation in the extreme-ultraviolet (XUV) range is indispensable for synthesizing attosecond light pulses and for exploring transient atomic structures. Here, we report the striking observations of coherent XUV supercontinuum (XSC) extended from below to far above the ionization threshold, which exhibits completely different temporal and spatial properties comparing to the conventional rescattering induced high harmonic generation (HHG). We demonstrate that the strong-field created coherence among bound orbitals strongly distort the atomic transition energies during the pulse, leading to coherent emission spanning tens of electron-volts, in contrast to the line emission via free-induction decay occurring after the pulse. The supposed non-radiating bound dark states contribute as well by emitting dressed energy through dark-to-bright emission mechanism. All the processes modulated at sub-cycle time scale jointly form this new-type coherent XSC. This work achieves the strong-field attosecond control of the exotic atomic radiation dynamics and provides the means of simultaneous generation of separated attosecond sources, i.e., XSC and HHG, with potential advancing attosecond interferometry.</description>

      <title>Demixing fluorescence time traces transmitted by multimode fibers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.00695v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fiber photometry is a significantly less invasive method compared to other deep brain imaging microendoscopy approaches due to the use of thin multimode fibers (MMF diameter $&lt;$ 500 $\mu$m). Nevertheless, the transmitted signals get scrambled upon propagation within the MMF, thus limiting the technique's potential in resolving temporal readouts with cellular resolution. Here, we demonstrate how to separate the time trace signals of several fluorescent sources probed by a thin ($\approx$ 200 $\mu$m) MMF with typical implantable length in a mouse brain. We disentangled several spatio-temporal fluorescence signals by using a general unconstrained non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm directly on the raw video data. Furthermore, we show that commercial and low-cost open-source miniscopes display enough sensitivity to image the same fluorescence patterns seen in our proof of principle experiment, suggesting that a new avenue for novel minimally invasive deep brain studies with multimode fibers in freely-behaving mice could be possible.</description>

Abstract: The ability to spatially separate the electric and magnetic fields of a light beam enables the inspection of laser-matter interactions driven solely by optical magnetic fields. However, magnetic field excitations are commonly orders of magnitude weaker than those driven by the electric field. Several studies have already demonstrated the isolation of an intense, linearly polarized magnetic field using structured light. In this work, we report the generation of isolated high intensity magnetic fields with controlled polarization state in the non-paraxial regime using structured laser beams. Our theoretical findings highlight a significant enhancement in the amplitude of the longitudinal magnetic field carried by an azimuthally polarized laser under tight-focusing conditions. Furthermore, by implementing a multiple-beam configuration, we achieve precise control over the polarization state and amplitude of the spatially isolated magnetic field. We report the generation of polarization-controlled magnetic fields reaching up to tens of Tesla, even from moderately intense laser beams of $\sim 10^{12} \, \mathrm{W}/\mathrm{cm}^2$. Our study paves the way for ultraintense interactions with circularly polarized magnetic fields from a feasible experimental setup point of view, particularly interesting to probe ferromagnetic materials and chiral media.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale Dark-Field Imaging in Full-Field Transmission X-Ray Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dark-field signal uncovers details beyond conventional X-ray attenuation contrast, which is especially valuable for material sciences. In particular, dark-field techniques are able to reveal structures beyond the spatial resolution of a setup. However, its implementation is yet limited to the micrometer regime. Therefore, we propose a technique to extend full-field transmission X-ray microscopy by the dark-field signal. The proposed method is based on a well-defined illumination of a beam-shaping condenser, which allows to block the bright-field by motorized apertures in the back focal plane of the objective's lens. This method offers a simple implementation and enables rapid modality changes while maintaining short scan times, making dark-field imaging widely available at the nanometer scale.</description>

      <title>Design and Optimization of a Graphene-On-Silicon Nitride Integrated Waveguide Dual-Mode Electro-Absorption Modulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14812v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the design, simulation and optimization of a graphene-on-silicon nitride (GOSiN) integrated waveguide dual-mode electro-absorption modulator operating with a speed between 27-109 GHz and an energy consumption below 6 pJ/bit. This device individually modulates the TE$_0$ and TE$_1$ modes in a single-arm dual-mode waveguide with modulation depths up to 316 dB/cm and 273 dB/cm, respectively. It has promising applications in Multimode Division Multiplexing (MDM) systems, where single-mode modulation induces high losses and costs. We have started from the design of GOSiN TE$_0$ and TE$_1$ passive low-loss mode filters. Then, applying a gate voltage to graphene via transparent IHO electrodes, we have combined both filters and shown that the light absorption can be modulated to obtain four logical values in transmission: (0,0), (0,1), (1,0) and (1,1). Our proposed devices can potentially boost the development of efficient MDM systems for ultra-fast on-chip interconnections.</description>

      <title>Topological Corner Modes by Composite Wannier States in Glide-Symmetric Photonic Crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Second-order topological insulators can be characterized by their bulk polarization, which is believed to be intrinsically connected to the center of the Wannier function. In this study, we demonstrate the existence of second-order topological insulators that feature a pair of partially degenerate photonic bands. These arise from the nonsymmorphic glide symmetry in an all-dielectric photonic crystal. The center of the maximally localized Wannier function (MLWF) is consistently located at the origin but is not equivalent with respect to the sum of constituent polarizations. As a result, topological corner modes can be identified by the distinctly hybridized MLWFs that truncate at the sample boundary. Through full-wave numerical simulations paired with microwave experiments, the second-order topology is clearly confirmed and characterized. These topological corner states exhibit notably unique modal symmetries, which are made possible by the inversion of the Wannier bands. Our results provide an alternative approach to explore higher-order topological physics with significant potential for applications in integrated and quantum photonics.</description>
