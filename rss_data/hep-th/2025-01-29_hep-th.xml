      <title>Carroll at Phase Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asymptotic behavior of generic Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid in the vicinity of phase-separated regions is known to produce an instability where well-known relativistic Conformal Field Theory (CFT) techniques fail. In this letter, we introduce an analytic paradigm which solves this important issue. We show that there is an emergent Carrollian symmetry when phase separation is reached and techniques of Carroll CFT, as opposed to its relativistic relative, is central to the understanding of the physics. We work with the analogous spinless fermionic system in this region and capture the transition across this phase separation. Our numerical results corroborate the density-density correlations intrinsically computed using Carroll CFT.</description>

      <title>The complete trans-series for conserved charges in integrable field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the vacuum expectation values of conserved charges in two dimensional integrable theories. We study the situations when the ground-state can be described by a single integral equation with a finite support: the thermodynamic limit of the Bethe ansatz equation. We solve this integral equation by expanding around the infinite support limit and write the expectation values in terms of an explicitly calculable trans-series, which includes both perturbative and all non-perturbative corrections. These different types of corrections are interrelated via resurgence relations, which we all reveal. We provide explicit formulas for a wide class of bosonic and fermionic models including the $O(N)$ (super) symmetric nonlinear sigma and Gross-Neveu, the $SU(N)$ invariant principal chiral and chiral Gross-Neveu models along with the Lieb-Liniger and Gaudin-Yang models and the case of the disk capacitor. With numerical analyses we demonstrate that the laterally Borel resummed trans-series is convergent and reproduces the physical result.</description>

      <title>A classical model for semiclassical state-counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the type II von Neumann algebras that appear in semiclassical gravity, all states have infinite entropy, but entropy differences are uniquely defined. Akers and I have shown that the entropy difference of microcanonical states has a relative state-counting interpretation in terms of the additional (finite) number of degrees of freedom that are needed to represent the "larger-entropy" state supposing that one already has a representation of the "smaller-entropy" state, and supposing that one is restricted to act with gauge-invariant operators. This short paper explains some of the curious features of relative state-counting by analogy to the classical limit of quantum statistical mechanics. In this analogy the preferred family of renormalized traces becomes the preferred family of symplectic measures on phase space; the trace-index of infinite-dimensional subspaces becomes the ratio of phase space volumes; and the restriction that one must act with gauge-invariant operators becomes the restriction that one must act with symplectomorphisms. Because in the phase-space analogy one has exact control over the quantum deformation away from the classical theory, one can see precisely how the relevant aspects of the classical structure are inherited from the quantum theory -- though even in this simple setting, it is a nontrivial technical task to show how classical symplectomorphisms emerge from the underlying quantum theory in the $\hbar \to 0$ limit.</description>

      <title>Wilsonian renormalisation group and thermal field theory in the Schwinger-Keldysh closed-time-path formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study perturbative Wilsonian renormalisation group (RG) for the scalar $\phi^4$ theory at finite temperature to one loop order in the Schwinger-Keldysh closed-time-path (CTP) formalism. By explicitly integrating out the UV modes, we show how effective interactions coupling the two branches of the CTP contour arise. This provides a microscopic derivation of the type of effective CTP actions used in the literature. While the full effective theory has no critical points, we instead proceed to study critical properties of the RG flow in a reduced space of complex couplings that characterise certain time-ordered correlators and show the existence of two novel fixed points in $d=4$ spacetime dimensions. We relate one to the Wilson-Fished fixed point known to exist only in $4-\epsilon$ dimensions, and the other to the standard Gaussian fixed point.</description>

      <title>A new look at multi-gravity and dimensional deconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has long been understood that certain theories of ghost free massive gravity and their multi-graviton extensions can be thought of as arising from a higher dimensional theory of gravity, upon discretising the extra dimension. However, this correspondence between standard multi-gravity and extra dimensional gravity holds only when one discretises the extra dimension after gauge fixing the lapse function associated to the various lower dimensional hypersurfaces. The lapse provides crucial structure to the extra dimensional theory: in pure general relativity (GR), it ensures full diffeomorphism invariance of the theory, and enforces its Hamiltonian constraint. Thus, upon deconstruction, important information related to the extra dimension is missing in the resulting multi-gravity theory; as a result one could never hope to recover higher dimensional GR in its entirety upon taking the appropriate continuum limit. Here, we develop an improved deconstruction procedure that maintains the free lapse, and show that the resulting deconstructed theory is essentially multi-gravity equipped with additional dynamical scalar fields, whose field equations encode the Hamiltonian constraint in the extra dimensional theory. As an example, we explicitly demonstrate that - with an FLRW ansatz for the metrics in this new theory - one may recover all of the equations and constraints of 5-dimensional brane cosmology upon taking the continuum limit. We then treat the deconstructed theory as an entity in its own right, and generalise it to arbitrary dimension and interaction structures beyond those admitting a well-defined continuum limit. We dub this theory `scalar-tensor multi-gravity', and show that the new scalar equations change the structure of some simple solutions that were previously allowed in standard multi-gravity, in a manner that exactly mirrors what we expect from higher dimensional GR.</description>

      <title>Mass gap in non-perturbative quadratic $\mathcal{R}^2$ gravity via Dyson-Schwinger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply in a simple model derived from quadratic $\mathcal{R}^2$ gravity the technique of Dyson-Schwinger equations to solve for its corresponding quantum theory. Particularly, we solve the classical equations of motion to get a solution to the hierarchy of Dyson-Schwinger equations in the limit of large coupling. The model is obtained by looking for conformally flat solutions. The model admits Higgs-like solutions with a single particle having a finite mass. Assuming a Fubini-Lipatov instanton for the vacuum instead, the spectrum is given by an infinite set of excitations of finite mass. In both cases, the model develops a mass gap due to the presence of the quadratic Ricci scalar, after the breaking of the conformal symmetry.</description>

      <title>Holographic QCD phase diagram for a rotating plasma in the Hawking-Page approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the combined effect of rotation and finite chemical potential in the confinement/deconfinement transition of strongly interacting matter. The holographic description consists of a five-dimensional geometry that contains a black hole (BH) in the deconfined (plasma) phase. The geometry is equipped with some cut-off that introduces an infrared energy scale. We consider two possibilities: the so-called hard wall and soft wall AdS/QCD models. The transition between the plasma and hadronic phases is represented holographically as a Hawking-Page transition between geometries with and without a black hole. The gravitational dual of the rotating plasma at finite density is given by a Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) charged anti-de Sitter (AdS) BH with non-zero angular momentum. This analysis provides the critical temperature of deconfinement as a function of the quark chemical potential and the plasma rotational velocity. For the particular case of very low temperatures and high densities, it is found that the critical value of the chemical potential for the transition to occur at $ T \to 0 $ does not depend on the plasma vorticity, since the effects of rotation and quark density on the critical temperature are shown to be independent.</description>

      <title>Higher-order chiral scalar from boundary reduction of 3d higher-spin gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a recently proposed covariant procedure to reduce the Chern-Simons action of three-dimensional higher-spin gravity to the boundary, resulting in a Lorentz covariant action for higher-order chiral scalars. After gauge-fixing, we obtain a higher-derivative action generalizing the $s=1$ Floreanini-Jackiw and $s=2$ Alekseev-Shatashvili actions to arbitrary spin $s$. For simplicity, we treat the case of general spin at the linearized level, while the full non-linear asymptotic boundary conditions are presented in component form for the $SL(3,\mathbb R)$ case. Finally, we extend the spin-3 linearized analysis to a background with non-trivial higher-spin charge and show that it has a richer structure of zero modes.</description>

      <title>Revisiting color superconductors in bottom-up holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of constructing a color superconducting phase in bottom-up holography. We introduce a model that describes the five-dimensional dynamics of a scalar field dual to a chiral symmetry breaking condensate, which is coupled to the RR 4-form. The coupling is given by a topological WZ term, which is elegantly responsible both for scalar condensation at high density, and color Higgsing in the condensed phase. This construction realizes both properties at finite density and Higgsing fraction.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov exponents as probes for phase transitions of Kerr-AdS black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study proper time and coordinate time Lyapunov exponents of chaos for massless and massive particles, and explore their relationships with phase transitions of four-dimensional and five-dimensional Kerr-AdS black holes. The results reveal that these Lyapunov exponents can reflect the occurrence of phase transitions. Specifically, when compared to the Lyapunov exponents of massive particles in chaotic states, those of massless particles exhibit a more comprehensive ability to describe the phase transitions. Furthermore, we conduct a study on the critical exponents associated with the Lyapunov exponents in four-dimensional Kerr AdS black holes, identifying a critical exponent value of 1/2.</description>

      <title>Wormholes, branes and finite matrices in sine dilaton gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the double trumpet in sine dilaton gravity via WdW quantization. The wormhole size is discretized. The wormhole amplitude matches the spectral correlation of a finite-cut matrix integral, where matrices have large but finite dimensions. This strongly suggests an identification of the sine dilaton gravity theory with the q-deformed JT gravity matrix integral. At the very least, it captures all universal content of that matrix model. The disk decomposes into the physical (gauge invariant) solutions of the WdW equation, which are trumpets with discrete sizes. This decomposition modifies the usual no-boundary wavefunction to a normalizable one in sine dilaton gravity. We furthermore present an exact quantization of sine dilaton gravity with open and closed end of the world branes. These EOW branes correspond with FZZT branes for the two Liouville theories that make up sine dilaton gravity. The WdW equation implies redundancies in this space of branes, leaving a one parameter family of gauge invariant branes. One gauge choice corresponds with branes discussed by Okuyama in the context of chord diagrams and of DSSYK. Legendre transforming the EOW brane amplitude reproduces the trumpet, independent of the WdW quantization calculation. One could read our work as fleshing out the Hilbert space of closed universes in sine dilaton gravity.</description>

Abstract: We adapt the Worldline Formalism to obtain resummed expressions for the effective action and the heat kernel of a quantum scalar field coupled to a Yukawa background. The resummation includes all the invariants built from powers, first derivatives and second derivatives of the latter. Using such results, we compute the instability of the vacuum computing the vacuum persistence amplitude and the corresponding Schwinger pair production probability. We show that the inclusion of an additional, rapidly varying background can greatly enhance the production of pairs.</description>

      <title>Useful trick to compute correlation functions of composite operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In general, in gauge field theories, physical observables are represented by gauge-invariant composite operators, such as the electromagnetic current. As we recently demonstrated in the context of the $U\left(1\right)$ and $SU\left(2\right)$ Higgs models \cite{Dudal:2019pyg,Dudal:2020uwb,Maas:2020kda}, correlation functions of gauge-invariant operators exhibit very nice properties. Besides the well-known gauge independence, they do not present unphysical cuts, and their K\"{a}ll\'{e}n-Lehmann representations are positive, at least perturbatively. Despite all these interesting features, they are not employed as much as elementary fields, mainly due to the additional complexities involved in their computation and renormalization. In this article, we present a useful trick to compute loop corrections to correlation functions of composite operators. This trick consists of introducing an additional field with no dynamics, coupled to the composite operator of interest. By using this approach, we can employ the traditional algorithms used to compute correlation functions of elementary fields.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of test particles and scalar perturbations around Ay\'{o}n-Beato-Garc\'{i}a black hole coupled with cloud of strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the geodesic motion and scalar perturbations of the Ay\'on-Beato-Garc\'ia (ABG) black hole (BH) coupled with a cloud of strings (CS). By employing the effective potential approach, we analyze the trajectories of massless and massive test particles around this regular BH solution. The interplay between nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED) and CS significantly modifies the spacetime geometry, resulting in distinct dynamical properties for test particles. The behavior of null and timelike geodesics, including their stability and escape conditions, is thoroughly examined. In addition to the geodesic analysis, we study scalar perturbations by deriving the Klein-Gordon equation for massless scalar fields in this spacetime. The resulting Schr\"odinger-like wave equation reveals an effective potential that depends intricately on the NLED and CS parameters. Furthermore, we compute the greybody factors (GFs) to explore the energy transmission and absorption properties of theBH. Our results demonstrate that the NLED parameter $g$ and the CS parameter $\alpha$ play pivotal roles in modulating the GFs, influencing the energy spectrum of scalar radiation. These results provide significant understanding of the observational characteristics of the ABG NLED-CS BH in astrophysical contexts.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Consequences of Domain Walls Biased by Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the simplest standard model extensions leading to a domain wall network is a real scalar $S$ with a $\mathcal{Z}_2$ symmetry spontaneously broken during universe evolution. Motivated by the swampland program, we explore the possibility that quantum gravity effects are responsible for violation of the discrete symmetry, triggering the annihilation of the domain wall network. We explore the resulting cosmological implications in terms of dark radiation, dark matter, gravitational waves, primordial black holes, and wormholes connected to baby universes.</description>

      <title>Two Channel Kondo behavior in the quantum XX chain with a boundary defect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a boundary defect in the single spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ quantum $XX$ chain exhibits two-channel Kondo physics. Due to the presence of the defect, the edge spin fractionalizes into two Majorana fermions, out of which one decouples, and one is overscreened by the free fermion in bulk, leading to non-trivial boundary behavior characteristic of the two-channel Kondo model. When the ratio of boundary to bulk coupling exceeds a critical value of $\sqrt{2}$, a massive boundary-bound mode is exponentially localized near the impurity site for strong impurity coupling. This leads to unusual behavior in physical quantities, such as the $g$-function not being monotonic. We compute the $g-$function of the impurity from both thermodynamic and entanglement entropy calculations and show that it takes a non-integer value of $\sqrt{2}$ just as in the two-channel Kondo problem.</description>

      <title>The foot, the fan, and the cuprate phase diagram: Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Fermi liquid with a `large' Fermi surface (FL) can have a quantum phase transition to a spin density wave state (SDW) with reconstructed `small' Fermi pockets. Both FL and SDW phases obey the Luttinger constraints on the volume enclosed by the Fermi surfaces. The critical spin fluctuations lead to spin-singlet $d$-wave pairing, as observed in the cuprates. Studies of the influence of spatial disorder on the SDW-FL quantum phase transition predict an extended quantum-critical Griffiths-type phase at low temperatures on the large Fermi surface side. These computations agree with the `foot' seen in transport, and recent low temperature neutron scattering observations on La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$.
  However, this theory cannot explain the higher temperature pseudogap and the `fan' of strange metal of the hole-doped cuprates. Here we need to consider underlying Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions without symmetry breaking. Then the small Fermi surface phase does not obey the Luttinger constraint, and is instead a `fractionalized Fermi liquid' (FL*). A theory of FL* in single band models describes photoemission observations in the pseudogap phase. The FL*-FL quantum phase transition, and the influence of spatial disorder, is described by an analysis inspired by the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. This theory successfully describes linear-in-temperature resistivity, optical conductivity and thermopower observations.
  The crossovers connecting these lower and higher temperature descriptions are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Confined Monopoles in Chiral Bag</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chiral bag model provides a dual description of hadron physics in terms of quarks and hadrons in the sense of Cheshire Cat principle. In this work, we find that, within the chiral bag, confinement is likely caused by monopole condensation. The chiral bag surface can be interpreted as an $\eta'$ domain wall, where a Chern-Simons-Higgs theory resides, as previously conjectured. Under level-rank duality, the Chern-Simons theory corresponds to the counterterm introduced to block the so-called color charge leakage. To obtain the correct net baryon number for the total chiral bag, vector meson field interactions occur on the bag surface and extend outside the bag. We also propose that the skyrmion description of baryons should be understood as a system of monopoles enveloped by a meson cloud.</description>

      <title>Multi-Messenger and Cosmological Constraints on Dark Matter through Two-Fluid Neutron Star Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the impact of dark matter (DM) on neutron stars (NSs) using a two-fluid formalism that treats nuclear matter (NM) and DM as gravitationally coupled components. Employing NM equations of state spanning a wide range of stiffness and a self-interacting asymmetric fermionic DM framework, we explore the emergence of DM core- and halo-dominated structures and their observational implications. Constraints from gravitational waves (GW170817), NICER X-ray measurements (PSR J0030+0451), and pulsar mass limits (PSR J0740+6620) delineate a consistent parameter space for DM properties derived from these multi-messenger observations. DM halo-dominated configurations, while consistent with PSR J0740+6620's mass limits and NICER's radius measurements for PSR J0030+0451, are ruled out by the tidal deformability bounds inferred from the GW170817 event. Consequently, the combined limits inferred from the observational data of GW170817, PSR J0030+0451, and PSR J0740+6620 support the plausibility of DM core-dominated configurations. Constraints on the DM self-interaction strength from galaxy cluster dynamics further refine the DM parameter space permitted by NS observations. This work bridges multi-messenger astrophysics and cosmology, providing insights into DM interactions and their implications for NS structure, evolution, and observational signatures.</description>

      <title>Can the sound horizon-free measurement of $H_0$ constrain early new physics?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sound horizon-independent $H_0$ extracted by using galaxy clustering surveys data through, e.g., EFTofLSS or ShapeFit analyses, is considered to have the potential to constrain the early new physics responsible for solving the Hubble tension. Recent observations, e.g. DESI, have shown that the sound horizon-independent measurement of $H_0$ is consistent with $\Lambda$CDM. In this work, we clarify some potential misuses and misinterpretations in these analyses. On the one hand, imposing some prior from other cosmological probes is often used to strengthen the constraints on the results, however, these priors are usually derived using the assumption of $\Lambda$CDM, it is not suitable to apply these so-called $\Lambda$CDM priors (e.g., the $n_s$ prior from CMB), which would bias the results, to early new physics because these early new physics are usually accompanied by shifts of the $\Lambda$CDM parameters. On the other hand, the constraints on $H_0$ in the sound horizon-independent EFTofLSS analysis arise from not only the shape of the power spectrum ($k_\text{eq}$-based $H_0$), but also the overall amplitude (when combined with CMB lensing observations) and the relative amplitudes of the BAO wiggles, thus besides $k_\text{eq}$ other information may also play a role in constraining $H_0$. We also make forecasts for an Euclid-like survey, which suggest that ongoing observations will also have difficulty ruling out early new physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate how chiral oscillations of a massive Dirac field can be described within quantum field theory using a finite-time interaction picture approach, where the mass term in the Lagrangian is treated as a perturbative coupling between massless fields of definite chirality. We derive the formula for chiral oscillations at the fourth order in the perturbative expansion, obtaining a result consistent with the formula derived by means of other methods. Furthermore, we illustrate how the perturbative framework of chiral oscillations can effectively describe production processes where an electron must exhibit both left chirality and positive helicity, as in decay $\pi^- \to e^- + {\bar \nu}_e$. Finally, we argue that, in this perturbative view, chiral oscillations are also essential for detecting the decay products in such processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking in quantum field theories at non-zero temperature still holds fundamental open questions, in particular what happens to vacuum Goldstone bosons when the temperature is increased. By investigating a complex scalar field theory on the lattice we demonstrate that Goldstone bosons at non-zero temperature behave like screened massless particle-like excitations, so-called thermoparticles, which continue to exist even in the symmetry-restored phase of the theory. We provide non-perturbative evidence for the functional form of the Goldstone mode's dissipative behaviour, which is distinct from standard perturbative expectations, and determine its corresponding spectral properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extract the equation of state for hot quark matter from a holographic $2+1$ flavor QCD model, which could form the core of a stable compact star. By adding a thin hadron shell, a new type of hybrid star is constructed. With the temperature serving as a parameter, the EoS varies and we obtain stable stars with the maximum mass of around 23 to 30 solar masses, and the compactness around $0.1$. The I-Love-Q-C relations are further discussed, and compared with the neutron star cases. These compact stars are candidates for black hole mimickers, which could be observed by gravitational waves and distinguished by properties like nonzero tidal Love number and electromagnetic signals.</description>

Abstract: We construct large $N$ saddle points of the matrix model for the $\mathcal{N}=4$ Yang-Mills index dual to the BPS black holes in $AdS_5\times S^5$, in two different setups. When the two complex chemical potentials for the angular momenta are collinear, we find linear eigenvalue distributions which solve the large $N$ saddle point equation. When the chemical potentials are not collinear, we find novel solutions given by areal eigenvalue distributions after slightly reformulating the saddle point problem. We also construct a class of multi-cut saddle points, showing that they sometimes admit nontrivial filling fractions. As a byproduct, we find that the Bethe ansatz equation emerges from our saddle point equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00602v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One quantum characterization of a black hole motivated by (local) holography and thermodynamics is that it maximizes thermodynamic entropy for a given surface area. In the context of quantum gravity, this could be more fundamental than the classical characterization by a horizon. As a step, we explore this possibility by solving the 4D semi-classical Einstein equation with many matter fields. For highly-excited spherically-symmetric static configurations, we apply local typicality and estimate the entropy including self-gravity to derive its upper bound. The saturation condition uniquely determines the entropy-maximized configuration: self-gravitating quanta condensate into a radially-uniform dense configuration with no horizon, where the self-gravity and a large quantum pressure induced by the curvatures are balanced and no singularity appears. The interior metric is a self-consistent and non-perturbative solution in Planck's constant. The maximum entropy, given by the volume integral of the entropy density, agrees with the Bekenstein-Hawking formula through self-gravity, deriving the Bousso bound for thermodynamic entropy. Finally, 10 future prospects are discussed, leading to a speculative view that the configuration represents a quantum-gravitational condensate in a semi-classical manner.</description>

Abstract: We study the static patch of de Sitter space in the presence of a timelike boundary. We impose that the conformal class of the induced metric and the trace of the extrinsic curvature, $K$, are fixed at the boundary. We present the thermodynamic structure of de Sitter space subject to these boundary conditions, for static and spherically symmetric configurations to leading order in the semiclassical approximation. In three spacetime dimensions, and taking $K$ constant on a toroidal Euclidean boundary, we find that the spacetime is thermally stable for all $K$. In four spacetime dimensions, the thermal stability depends on the value of $K$. It is established that for sufficiently large $K$, the de Sitter static patch subject to conformal boundary conditions is thermally stable. This contrasts the Dirichlet problem for which the region encompassing the cosmological horizon has negative specific heat. We present an analysis of the linearised Einstein equations subject to conformal boundary conditions. In the worldline limit of the timelike boundary, the underlying modes are linked to the quasinormal modes of the static patch. In the limit where the timelike boundary approaches the cosmological event horizon, the linearised modes are interpreted in terms of the shear and sound modes of a fluid dynamical system. Additionally, we find modes with a frequency of positive imaginary part. Measured in a local inertial reference frame, and taking the stretched cosmological horizon limit, these modes grow at most polynomially.</description>

Abstract: If entanglement builds spacetime, then conversely, disentanglement ought to destroy spacetime. From the quantum null energy condition and quantum focusing conjecture, we obtain disentanglement criteria which necessitate infinite energies and strong spacetime singularities. We apply our results to the strong cosmic censorship proposal, where singularities at the Cauchy horizons in black holes are desirable. Using our disentanglement criteria and without resorting to any detailed calculations, we provide an exceedingly general and physically transparent discussion of strong cosmic censorship in semiclassical black holes. We argue that strong cosmic censorship is enforced in asymptotically flat and de Sitter black holes by disentanglement and describe how similar disentanglement might be avoided in some anti-de Sitter cases.</description>

Abstract: We review recent developments in physical implications of Weyl conformal geometry. The associated Weyl quadratic gravity action is a gauge theory of the Weyl group of dilatations and Poincar\'e symmetry. Weyl conformal geometry is defined by equivalence classes of the metric and Weyl gauge field ($\omega_\mu$), related by Weyl gauge transformations. Weyl geometry can be seen as a covariantised version of Riemannian geometry with respect to Weyl gauge symmetry (of dilatations). This Weyl gauge-covariant formulation of Weyl geometry is metric, which avoids long-held criticisms on the physical relevance of this geometry, that ignored its gauge symmetry. Weyl quadratic gravity and its geometry have interesting properties: Weyl gauge symmetry spontaneously broken to Einstein-Hilbert gravity (Riemannian geometry) respectively, with $\Lambda&gt;0$; this is the only true gauge theory of a space-time symmetry i.e. with a physical (Weyl) gauge boson ($\omega_\mu$); all fields and masses have geometric origin (with no added scalar fields); the theory is the perturbative part of a Weyl gauge invariant DBI action of conformal geometry in $d$ dimensions. The theory has a Weyl gauge invariant geometric regularisation (by $\hat R$) to $d$ dimensions and it is Weyl-anomaly free; this anomaly is recovered in the broken phase after massive $\omega_\mu$ decouples; in the limit of vanishing Weyl gauge current, one obtains conformal gravity and Riemannian geometry; SM has a natural embedding in conformal geometry with no new degrees of freedom, with a successful Starobinsky-Higgs inflation. Briefly, Weyl conformal geometry provides a (quantum) gauge theory of gravity, leading to a unified description by the gauge principle of Einstein-Hilbert gravity and SM.</description>

Abstract: We give a microscopic derivation of the semi-classical entropy of static black holes in 3d Lovelock gravities, which are certain 3d Horndeski theories that were recently discovered from higher-dimensional Lovelock gravities via various methods and admit novel black hole solutions analogous to higher-dimensional ones. Assuming the ground state is described by the soliton obtained from the black hole solution by performing a double Wick rotation, we reproduce the semi-classical entropy from Cardy formula without central charges for the asymptotic growth of the number of states. We explain in detail how the mass of the soliton, which is needed in the Cardy formula, can be computed in the mini-superspace formalism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07643v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamics of Einstein gravity with vanishing cosmological constant subjected to conformal boundary conditions. Our focus is on comparing the series of subextensive terms to predictions from thermal effective field theory, with which we find agreement for the boundary theory on a spatial sphere, hyperbolic space, and flat space. We calculate the leading Wilson coefficients and observe that the first subextensive correction to the free energy is negative. This violates a conjectured bound on this coefficient in quantum field theory, which we interpret as a signal that gravity does not fully decouple in the putative boundary dual.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Negativity and Replica Symmetry Breaking in General Holographic States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13009v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The entanglement negativity $\mathcal{E}(A:B)$ is a useful measure of quantum entanglement in bipartite mixed states. In random tensor networks (RTNs), which are related to fixed-area states, it was found in [arXiv:2101.11029] that the dominant saddles computing the even R\'enyi negativity $\mathcal{E}^{(2k)}$ generically break the $\mathbb{Z}_{2k}$ replica symmetry. This calls into question previous calculations of holographic negativity using 2D CFT techniques that assumed $\mathbb{Z}_{2k}$ replica symmetry and proposed that the negativity was related to the entanglement wedge cross section. In this paper, we resolve this issue by showing that in general holographic states, the saddles computing $\mathcal{E}^{(2k)}$ indeed break the $\mathbb{Z}_{2k}$ replica symmetry. Our argument involves an identity relating $\mathcal{E}^{(2k)}$ to the $k$-th R\'enyi entropy on subregion $AB^*$ in the doubled state $|{\rho_{AB}}\rangle_{AA^*BB^*}$, from which we see that the $\mathbb{Z}_{2k}$ replica symmetry is broken down to $\mathbb{Z}_{k}$. For $k&lt;1$, which includes the case of $\mathcal{E}(A:B)$ at $k=1/2$, we use a modified cosmic brane proposal to derive a new holographic prescription for $\mathcal{E}^{(2k)}$ and show that it is given by a new saddle with multiple cosmic branes anchored to subregions $A$ and $B$ in the original state. Using our prescription, we reproduce known results for the PSSY model and show that our saddle dominates over previously proposed CFT calculations near $k=1$. Moreover, we argue that the $\mathbb{Z}_{2k}$ symmetric configurations previously proposed are not gravitational saddles, unlike our proposal. Finally, we contrast holographic calculations with those arising from RTNs with non-maximally entangled links, demonstrating that the qualitative form of backreaction in such RTNs is different from that in gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the presence of scalar field models supporting kink solutions with logarithmic tails, which we call super long-range structures. We first consider models with a single real scalar field and associate the long-range profile to the orders of vanishing derivatives of the potential at its minima. We then present a model whose derivatives are null in all orders and obtain analytical solutions with logarithmic falloff. We also show that these solutions are stable under small fluctuations. To investigate the forces between super long-range structures, we consider three methods and compare them. Next, we study two-field models in which the additional field is used to modify the kinetic term of the other. By using a first-order formalism based on the minimization of the energy, we explore the situation in which one of the fields can be obtained independently from the other. Within this framework, we unveil how to smoothly go from long- or short- to super long-range structures.</description>

      <title>A Strategy for Proving the Strong Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis : Chaotic Systems and Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The strong eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) provides a sufficient condition for thermalization and equilibration. Although it is expected to be hold in a wide class of highly chaotic theories, there are only a few analytic examples demonstrating the strong ETH in special cases, often through methods related to integrability. In this paper, we explore sufficient conditions for the strong ETH that may apply to a broad range of chaotic theories. These conditions are expressed as inequalities involving the long-time averages of real-time thermal correlators. Specifically, as an illustration, we consider simple toy examples which satisfy these conditions under certain technical assumptions. This toy models have same properties as holographic theories at least in the perturbation in large $N$. We give a few comments for more realistic holographic models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The predictions of inflation are usually defined in terms of equal time in-in correlation functions in an accelerating cosmological background. These same observables exist for quantum field theory in other spacetimes, including flat space. In this paper, we will explore how the Wilsonian renormalization group (RG) and effective field theory (EFT) apply to these observables in both flat and de Sitter space. Specifically, we show that matching the short- and long-distance calculations requires additional terms localized at the time of the measurement that are not captured by the effective action of the EFT. These additional terms only correct the local and semi-local terms in the EFT correlators. In flat space, we give an explicit demonstration by matching in-in correlators of light scalars interacting with a heavy field with the EFT result. We then show how these additional terms arise generically via exact RG. We also compare these explicit results in flat space with the corresponding theory in de Sitter and show that the local terms typically redshift away. Our results are closely related to momentum space entanglement that arises from tracing over short-wavelength modes.</description>

      <title>Primary scalar hair in Gauss-Bonnet black holes with Thurston horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we construct novel asymptotically locally AdS$_5$ black hole solutions of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory at the Chern-Simons point, supported by a scalar field that generates primary hair. The strength of the scalar field is governed by an independent integration constant; when this constant vanishes, the spacetime reduces to a black hole geometry devoid of hair. The existence of these solutions is intrinsically tied to the horizon metric, which is modeled by three non-trivial Thurston geometries: Nil, Solv, and $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$. The quadratic part of the scalar field action corresponds to a conformally coupled scalar in five dimensions -an invariance of the matter sector that is explicitly broken by the introduction of a quartic self-interaction. These black holes are characterized by two distinct parameters: the horizon radius and the temperature. Notably, there exists a straight line in this parameter space along which the horizon geometry exhibits enhanced isometries, corresponding to solutions previously reported in JHEP 02, 014 (2014). Away from this line, for a fixed horizon radius and temperatures above or below a critical value, the metric's isometries undergo spontaneous breaking. Employing the Regge-Teitelboim approach, we compute the mass and entropy of these solutions, both of which vanish. Despite this, only one of the integration constants can be interpreted as hair, as the other modifies the local geometry at the conformal boundary. Finally, for Solv horizon geometries, we extend these hairy solutions to six dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct statistical mechanical models of crystal melting describing the flavoured Witten indices of $\mathcal{N}\ge 2$ supersymmetric quiver gauge theories. Our results can be derived from the Jeffrey-Kirwan (JK) residue formulas, and generalize the previous results for quivers corresponding to toric Calabi-Yau threefolds and fourfolds to a large class of quivers satisfying the no-overlap condition, including those corresponding to some non-toric Calabi-Yau manifolds. We construct new quiver algebras which we call the double quiver Yangians/algebras, as well as their representations in terms of the aforementioned crystals. For theories with four supercharges, we compare the double quiver algebras with the existing quiver Yangians/BPS algebras, which we show can also be constructed from the JK residues. For theories with two supercharges, the double quiver algebras provide an algebraic description of the BPS states, including the information of the fixed points and their relative coefficients in the full partition functions.</description>

      <title>EFT &amp; Species Scale: Friends or foes?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently the notion that quantum gravity effects could manifest at scales much lower than the Planck scale has seen an intense Swamplandish revival. Dozens of works have explored how the so-called species scale -- at which an effective description of gravity must break down -- relates to String Theory and the Swampland conjectures. In particular, the interplay between this scale and the abundant towers of states becoming lighter in asymptotic regions of moduli spaces has proved to be key in understanding the real scale of quantum gravity. Nevertheless concerns have been raised regarding the validity of using infinite towers of states when estimating this scale within Effective Field Theory and, more precisely, the consistency of cutting the tower part way through in a framework that relies on a clear separation of scales. In this work we take an EFT point-of-view and provide a detailed perturbative derivation of the species scale -- by computing the 1-loop graviton propagator in the presence of many fields -- thereby clarifying common sources of confusion in the literature. Not only do we clarify the setup, assumptions and regimes of validity of the result, but more importantly apply the same methods to an infinite tower of states. We show how each state in the tower contributes to the species scale and how the procedure of counting only ''light fields'' can be compatible with not cutting the tower, thereby maintaining the harmony between infinite towers and EFTs even in the context of the species scale.</description>

      <title>Two-Measure Electroweak Standard Model. Some aspects of cosmological evolution and vacuum stability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the FLRW universe, the scalar field \phi(t) obtained by cosmological averaging of the local Higgs field H(x) is considered as a classical field for which the SM quantization procedure is meaningless. When applying the Two-Measure theory (TMT) to study cosmology, the ratio \zeta of the measure densities is a scalar function, which: enters into all equations of motion. Through the constraint, $\zeta$ is defined as a function of \phi(t). During cosmological evolution, \zeta(\phi) changes from \zeta\approx 0 at the inflationary stage to \zeta=1 at the approaching vacuum stage. Each stage of the classical cosmological background is determined by the set \{\phi(t), {\rm curvature}, \zeta(\phi(t))\}. The Two-Measure SM (TMSM) is realized in the context of cosmology as a set of cosmologically modified copies of the GWS model. Each of the copies exists as a local quantum field theory defined on the classical cosmological background at the appropriate stage of its evolution. This basic idea is studied in detail for the stage of slow-roll inflation and for the stage of approaching vacuum. Due to the presence of \zeta(\phi(t)) in all equations of motion, all TMSM coupling constants turn out to be running (classical) TMT-effective parameters. During cosmological evolution, changing these parameters yields new results: the classical running TMT-effective Higgs selfcoupling increases from \lambda\sim 10^{-11} (which ensures consistency with Planck's CMB data at \xi=\frac{1}{6}) to \lambda\sim 0.1 near vacuum; the mass term in the Higgs potential changes sign from positive to negative, providing standard SSB; the classical running gauge and Yukawa coupling constants change by several orders of magnitude; the GWS theory is reproduced so that the fermion mass hierarchy is obtained quite naturally. 1-loop quantum corrections preserves the slow-roll inflation and does not violate the vacuum stability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the so-called group geometric approach to (super)gravity and (super)string theories, any compact Lie group manifold $G_{c}$ can be smoothly deformed into a group manifold $G_{c}^{\mu }$ (locally diffeomorphic to $G_{c}$ itself), which is `soft', namely, based on a non-left-invariant, intrinsic one-form Vielbein $\mu $, which violates the Maurer-Cartan equations and consequently has a non-vanishing associated curvature two-form. Within the framework based on the above deformation (`softening'), we show how to construct an infinite-dimensional (infinite-rank), generalized Kac-Moody (KM) algebra associated to $G_{c}^{\mu }$, starting from the generalized KM algebras associated to $G_{c}$. As an application, we consider KM algebras associated to deformed manifolds such as the `soft' circle, the `soft' two-sphere and the `soft' three-sphere. While the generalized KM algebra associated to the deformed circle is trivially isomorphic to its undeformed analogue, and hence not new, the `softening' of the two- and three- sphere includes squashed manifolds (and in particular, the so-called Berger three-sphere) and yields to non-trivial results.</description>

      <title>Universal trade-off structure between symmetry, irreversibility, and quantum coherence in quantum processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.11086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry, irreversibility, and quantum coherence are foundational concepts in physics. Here, we present a universal tradeoff relation between these three concepts. This particularly reveals that (1) under a global symmetry, any attempt to change the local conserved charge causes inevitable irreversibility, and (2) such irreversibility can be mitigated by quantum coherence. Our tradeoff relation follows solely from the unitarity and global symmetry of the total dynamics, allowing for general applicability. For non-equilibrium physics, it relates the coherence cost and the entropy production -- representing thermodynamic irreversibility -- in arbitrary quantum processes. It also provides fundamental limitations on the capability of a number of quantum information processing tasks -- such as gate and measurement implementation and error correction -- that involve symmetry restrictions. Furthermore, it predicts how many bits of classical information thrown into a black hole become unreadable under energy conservation. Our tradeoff relation is based on quantum uncertainty relation, showcasing intimate connections between fundamental physical principles and ultimate operational capability of quantum processes.</description>

Abstract: The idea of reduction of couplings consists in the search for relations between seemingly independent couplings of a renormalizable theory that are renormalization group invariant. In this article, we demonstrate the existence of such 1-loop relations among the top Yukawa, the Higgs quartic and the gauge colour couplings of the Type-II Two Higgs Doublet Model at a high-energy boundary. The phenomenological viability of the reduced theory suggests the value of $\tan\beta$ and the scale in which new physics may appear.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes and Wormholes from Domain Wall Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Domain walls (DWs) are topological defects originating from phase transitions in the early universe. In the presence of an energy imbalance between distinct vacua, enclosed DW cavities shrink until the entire network disappears. By studying the dynamics of thin-shell bubbles in General Relativity, we demonstrate that closed DWs with sizes exceeding the cosmic horizon tend to annihilate later than the average. This delayed annihilation allows for the formation of large overdensities, which, upon entering the Hubble horizon, eventually collapse to form Primordial Black Holes (PBHs). We rely on 3D percolation theory to calculate the number density of these late-annihilating DWs, enabling us to infer the abundance of PBHs. A key insight from our study is that DW networks with the potential to emit observable Gravitational Waves are also likely to yield detectable PBHs. Additionally, we find that wormholes connected to baby-universes can be produced and conclude on the possibility to generate a multiverse.</description>

Abstract: We propose novel inflationary primordial gravitational wave (GW) spectral shapes at interferometer-based current and future GW missions to test dark matter (DM) production via gravity-portal.We consider three right-handed neutrinos (RHNs), the lightest among them is DM candidate while the others participate in baryogenesis via leptogenesis. We find that future GW detectors BBO, DECIGO, ET, for instance, are able to probe DM mass for $5\times 10^6\, {\rm GeV}&lt;M_{\rm DM}&lt;1.6\times 10^7$ GeV with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) $&gt;10$, along with the observed amount of baryon asymmetry due to gravitational leptogenesis for heavy RHN mass $M_{\cal{N}}$ to be around $8\times 10^{12}$ GeV. Employing Fisher matrix forecast analysis, we identify the parameter space involving non-minimal coupling to gravity $\xi$, reheating temperature of the Universe $T_{\rm rh}$ and DM mass $M_{\rm DM}$ where the GW detector-sensitivities will be the maximum with the least error, along with SNR $&gt;10$. Finally, utilizing mock data for each GW detector, we perform MCMC analysis to find out the combined constraints on the various microphysics parameters. We also explore production of other cosmological relics such as QCD axion relic as DM candidate, produced via gravity-portal in early universe. We find that ET, for instance, can probe the decay constant of such DM candidates ($f_{a}$) as $10^9\,{\rm GeV}\lesssim f_{a}\lesssim 10^{14}\,{\rm GeV}$ for misalignment angle $\theta_i\in[0.1,\pi/\sqrt{3}]$ and $\xi=1$ with SNR $&gt;10$, whereas this range decreases with the increase of non-minimal coupling. Thus the upcoming GW missions will be able to test such non-thermal DM and baryogenesis scenarios involving very high energy scales, which is otherwise impossible to reach in particle physics experiments in laboratories.</description>

Abstract: Using special functions and orthogonal polynomials, we introduce an algebraic version of quantum field theory for elementary particles. Closed-loop integrals in the Feynman diagrams for computing transition amplitudes are finite. Consequently, no renormalization scheme is required in this theory.</description>

      <title>Dust collapse and horizon formation in Quadratic Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quadratic Gravity supplements the Einstein-Hilbert action by terms quadratic in the spacetime curvature. This leads to a rich phase space of static, compact gravitating objects including the Schwarzschild black hole, wormholes, and naked singularities. For the first time, we study the collapse of a spherically symmetric star with uniform dust density in this setting. We assume that the interior geometry respects the symmetries of the matter configuration, i.e., homogeneity and isotropy, thus it is insensitive to the Weyl-squared term and the interior dynamics is fully determined by $R$ and $R^2$. As our main result, we find that the collapse leads to the formation of a horizon, implying that the endpoint of a uniform dust collapse with a homogeneous and isotropic interior is not a horizonless spacetime. We also show that the curvature-squared contribution is responsible for making the collapse into a singularity faster than the standard Oppenheimer-Snyder scenario. Furthermore, the junction conditions connecting spacetime inside and outside the matter distribution are found to be significantly more constraining than their counterparts in General Relativity and we discuss key properties of any exterior solution matching to the spacetime inside the collapsing star. Finally, we comment on the potentially non-generic behavior entailed by our assumptions.</description>

      <title>Subtleties in the calculation of correlation functions for hot and dense systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06674v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss subtleties in the calculation of loop integrals in studies of hot and dense systems as they appear in both perturbative and non-perturbative approaches. To be specific, we address subtleties which appear in situations where the order of integration, differentiation, and limit processes plays a crucial role. For example, this applies to computations of the effective action and the computation of momentum-dependent correlation functions. In particular, the zero-temperature limit is delicate in systems with fermions because of the presence of discontinuities at the Fermi surface. We provide a general discussion of scenarios where the computation and evaluation of loop integrals in the context of relativistic theories requires particular attention as a change of the order of the involved mathematical operations may lead to a different result. Our general considerations are then illustrated with the aid of concrete examples, namely by the computation of masses from fully momentum-dependent correlation functions in the context of the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model and quantum electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Cosmological perturbations in a generalised axion-like dark energy model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse the cosmological evolution of a generalised axion-like field that drives the late-time acceleration of the Universe. This model can exhibit tracking behaviour, which alleviates the coincidence problem. The cosmological perturbations are carried within a multi-fluid approach where the scalar field is described by a non-adiabatic fluid, i.e., one whose speed of sound in the rest frame differs from the adiabatic one. The cosmological perturbations are solved since the radiation-dominated epoch, imposing initial adiabatic conditions for matter, radiation and the dark energy component, for modes well outside the Hubble horizon in the past. We analyse the homogeneous curvature perturbation, gravitational potential and dark energy perturbations in this model, as well as the matter power spectrum and f{\sigma}8. We discuss which parameters of the model are more favoured observationally.</description>

      <title>Split Cherenkov radiation in isotropic chiral matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chiral matter exhibits unique electromagnetic responses due to the macroscopic manifestation of the chiral anomaly as anomalous transport currents. Here, we study the modification of electromagnetic radiation in isotropic chiral matter characterized by an axion coupling that varies linearly over time $\theta(t) = b_0 t$. Using Carroll-Field-Jackiw electrodynamics, we derive the causal Green's function to investigate the stability and radiation properties of the system. Even though the plane-wave modes of isotropic chiral matter exhibit imaginary frequencies for long wavelengths, which might suggest instability in the system, we show that their contribution is confined to the near-field region. Also we find no exponentially growing fields at arbitrarily large times, so that stability is preserved. Under these conditions the radiation yields a positive energy flux, although this is not an inherent property of the general definition. In the case of a fast-moving charge, we confirm the existence of vacuum Cherenkov radiation and show that, for refractive indices $n &gt; 1$, the Cherenkov cone can split into two concentric cones with opposite circular polarizations. This split, governed by the speed of the particle $v$, $n$ and $b_0$, resembles the optical spin-Hall effect and offers potential applications for creating circularly polarized terahertz (THz) light sources. Our Green's function approach provides a general method for analyzing radiation in chiral matter, from Weyl semimetals to quark-gluon plasmas, and can be extended to systems such as oscillating dipoles and accelerated charges.</description>

      <title>Bose-Einstein condensation in a rigidly rotating relativistic boson gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of a free Bose gas under rigid rotation. The aim is to explore the impact of rotation on the thermodynamic quantities associated with BEC, including the Bose-Einstein (BE) transition temperature and condensate fraction. We begin by introducing the rotation in the Lagrangian density of free charged Klein-Gordon fields and determine the corresponding grand canonical partition function at finite temperature, chemical potential, and finite angular velocity. Assuming slow rotation, we derive analytical expressions for the pressure, energy, number, and angular momentum densities of a free Bose gas in nonrelativistic and ultrarelativistic limits in terms of the corresponding fugacities. We then focus on the phenomenon of BEC. We calculate the critical temperature of BEC transition and the condensate fraction in a slowly rotating Bose gas including only particles. Our findings indicate that the critical exponent associated with the BE transition in a rotating gas is lower compared to that in a nonrotating Bose gas. We also determine the fugacity in a rotating Bose gas in the aforementioned limits and examine how rotation affects its temperature dependence, both below and above the critical temperature. By analyzing the behavior of heat capacity at these temperatures, we demonstrate that in a nonrelativistic Bose gas, the rotation transforms the nature of the BE phase transition from a continuous to a discontinuous transition. In general, we find that a nonrelativistic Bose gas under rotation behaves similarly to a nonrotating Bose gas in ultrarelativistic limit.</description>

      <title>$\eta$ invariant of massive Wilson Dirac operator and the index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the lattice index theorem in the perspective of $K$-theory. The standard definition given by the overlap Dirac operator equals to the $\eta$ invariant of the Wilson Dirac operator with a negative mass. This equality is not coincidental but reflects a mathematically profound significance known as the suspension isomorphism of $K$-groups. Specifically, we identify the Wilson Dirac operator as an element of the $K^1$ group, which is characterized by the $\eta$-invariant. Furthermore, we prove that, at sufficiently small but finite lattice spacings, this $\eta$-invariant equals to the index of the continuum Dirac operator. Our results indicate that the Ginsparg-Wilson relation and the associated exact chiral symmetry are not essential for understanding gauge field topology in lattice gauge theory.</description>

      <title>Symmetry of screening masses of mesons in two-flavor lattice QCD at high temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12675v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate spatial two-point correlation functions of mesonic operators in two-flavor lattice QCD at high temperatures. The simulated temperatures over the range $T \in [147, 330]$ MeV, where the critical temperature is estimated around 165 MeV. To ensure a good control of the chiral symmetry we employ the M\"obius domain-wall fermion action for two degenerate flavors of quarks. With a lattice cut off $a^{-1}\sim 2.6$ GeV, the residual mass is reduced to 0.14 MeV. With the energy spectrum obtained from the screening mass at incremental values of the temperature range, we examine the $SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R$ chiral symmetry, the anomalous axial $U(1)$ as well as an enhanced symmetry which exchanges the spin degrees of freedom. We also study how the data approaches the perturbative prediction given by twice the Matsubara frequency of free quarks.</description>

      <title>On the structure of tensor products of the finite-dimensional representations of quantum affine $\mathfrak{sl}_n$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review some important facts about the structure of tensor products of finite dimensional representations of quantum affine algebras. This is done from the elementary standpoint of the representation theory of semisimple Lie algebras in the scope of a masters thesis. We set the focus on drawing the line to the finite dimensional representation theory of quantum affine $\mathfrak{sl}_n$, the theory of q-characters, and introduce the so called snake modules together with their character formula.</description>
