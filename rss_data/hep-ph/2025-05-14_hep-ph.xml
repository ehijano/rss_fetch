      <title>A Superalgebra Within: representations of lightest standard model particles form a $\mathbb{Z}_2^5$-graded algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is demonstrated how a set of particle representations, familiar from the Standard Model, collectively form a superalgebra. Those representations mirroring the behaviour of the Standard Model's gauge bosons, and three generations of fermions, are each included in this algebra, with exception only to those irreps involving the top quark. This superalgebra is isomorphic to the Euclidean Jordan algebra of $16\times 16$ hermitian matrices, $H_{16}(\mathbb{C}),$ and is generated by division algebras. The division algebraic substructure enables a natural factorization between internal and spacetime symmetries. It also allows for the definition of a $\mathbb{Z}_2^5$ grading on the algebra. Those internal symmetries respecting this substructure are found to be $\mathfrak{su}(3)_C \oplus \mathfrak{su}(2)_L \oplus \mathfrak{u}(1)_Y,$ in addition to four iterations of $\mathfrak{u}(1)$. For spatial symmetries, one finds multiple copies of $\mathfrak{so}(3)$. Given its Jordan algebraic foundation, and its apparent non-relativistic character, the model may supply a bridge between particle physics and quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Velocity Distributions for Direct Detection: Astrophysical Uncertainties are Smaller Than They Appear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sensitivity of direct detection experiments depends on the phase-space distribution of dark matter near the Sun, which can be modeled theoretically using cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of Milky Way-like galaxies. However, capturing the halo-to-halo variation in the local dark matter speeds -- a necessary step for quantifying the astrophysical uncertainties that feed into experimental results -- requires a sufficiently large sample of simulated galaxies, which has been a challenge. In this work, we quantify this variation with nearly one hundred Milky Way-like galaxies from the IllustrisTNG50 simulation, the largest sample to date at this resolution. Moreover, we introduce a novel phase-space scaling procedure that endows every system with a reference frame that accurately reproduces the local standard-of-rest speed of our Galaxy, providing a principled way of extrapolating the simulation results to real-world data. The predicted speed distributions are consistent with the Standard Halo Model, a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution peaked at the local circular speed and truncated at the escape speed. The dark matter-nucleon cross section limits placed by these speed distributions vary by ~60% about the median. This places the 1-sigma astrophysical uncertainty at or below the level of the systematic uncertainty of current ton-scale detectors, even down to the energy threshold. The predicted uncertainty remains unchanged when sub-selecting on those TNG galaxies with merger histories similar to the Milky Way. Tabulated speed distributions, as well as Maxwell-Boltzmann fits, are provided for use in computing direct detection bounds or projecting sensitivities.</description>

      <title>Constraining anomalous $W tb$ and related SMEFT couplings using low-energy and electroweak precision observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate constraints on couplings of Standard Model effective field theory (SMEFT) operators contributing to $Wtb$ effective vertex at tree level. We study the one-loop level impact of these couplings on the low-energy flavour changing charged and neutral current processes and on the electroweak precision observables. We use the available data on these relevant processes to constrain the associated SMEFT/$Wtb$ couplings. Solving the renormalisation group equations, we connect the SMEFT couplings at different scales and use the bounds at low energy to obtain the relevant bounds at the large scale $\Lambda$. Our findings indicate significantly improved constraints on the couplings compared to existing constraints on $Wtb$ couplings by ATLAS and CMS. Additionally, we predict branching ratios for various top-FCNC processes, which exceed SM expectations by several orders of magnitude but remain within the reach of future colliders. These SMEFT couplings, or anomalous couplings of the effective $Wtb$ vertex, can further constrain different UV-complete and simplified models that generate such interactions at the tree or loop level.</description>

      <title>Warm Inflation with Pseudo-scalar couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inflaton couplings during warm inflation result in the production of a thermal bath. Thermal friction and fluctuations can dominate the standard de Sitter analogues, resulting in a modified slow-roll scenario with a new source of density fluctuations. Due to issues with back-reaction, it is advantageous to consider inflaton couplings with the thermal bath that are pseudo-scalar in nature, e.g., derivative interactions or topological $F \tilde F$ couplings. We demonstrate that $\textit{ every single}$ existing model of warm inflation utilizing pseudo-scalar couplings needs to be corrected to account for the chemical potentials that the thermal bath acquires in response to the inflaton coupling. These chemical potentials are for non-conserved charges, and are non-zero only because of the applied inflaton couplings. The model-dependent chemical potentials modify the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, making the relationship between the thermal friction and thermal fluctuations model-dependent. In extreme cases, these chemical potentials can cause the friction term to vanish while thermal fluctuations remain non-zero. In the context of a simple example, we demonstrate how to calculate the chemical potentials, thermal friction, and thermal fluctuations using both the Boltzmann equations and by calculating thermal expectation values, showing explicitly that the two approaches give the same result.</description>

      <title>Interplay between Electroweak Symmetry Breaking and Dark Matter Relic Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models of Dark Matter must contend with the fact that the presence of electroweak symmetry breaking along the thermal evolution of the Universe modifies the masses, interactions and, thus, the thermally averaged cross sections. We study in detail the impact of taking (not taking) the presence of the electroweak symmetry breaking into account in the calculations of the Dark Matter relic density, providing a model-independent measure of such differences. By focusing on a particular model, we show that ignoring this effect can lead to the inclusion (exclusion) of wrong (viable) regions of parameter space.</description>

      <title>Asteroseismological constraints on--and hints of--dark matter interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If dark matter interacts with nuclei or electrons, then elastic collisions with constituents of stars will cause some of the galactic dark matter to fall below the escape velocity and become gravitationally bound. For asymmetric dark matter (which does not self-annihilate), the large accumulated population of dark matter can act as an additional source of heat transport, altering stellar structure and evolution. These effects can be probed by the use of asteroseismology. Here, we demonstrate this effect via numerical simulations. We use Monte Carlo-calibrated heat transport calculations, with a focus on the erasure of the convective core in stars that are slightly more massive than the Sun. We find limits on spin-dependent dark matter-nucleon and dark matter-electron interactions using asteroseismological data from a nearby sub-giant star. More tantalizingly, we find a $\gtrsim 4 \sigma$ preference for dark matter-electron interactions for dark matter masses $\lesssim 3.5$ GeV and cross sections $\sigma_{\chi-e} \sim 10^{-34.5}$ cm$^2$, albeit in strong tension with limits from Earth-based direct detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Up-quark Mass Generation in QCD-like theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the dynamically generated up quark mass in some QCD-like theories with $F=3$ light flavors, obtained from supersymmetric QCD perturbed via anomaly mediated supersymmetry breaking. We match the low-energy effective theory to the traditional chiral Lagrangian of QCD and determine the coefficients to next-to-leading order in chiral perturbation theory, while also varying the number of colors $N$. We find that the dynamically generated up quark mass vanishes in the large $N$ limit, and is small for $F&lt;N$, however for $F=N$ there is a sizeable $O(1)$ contribution. While our results are reliable only for small supersymmetry breaking, we observe that extrapolating the $F=N$ result to large supersymmetry breaking would lead to a dynamical up quark mass that is large enough to account for its entire physical mass.</description>

      <title>BSM reach of rare charm decays, including the rising star $\Lambda_c\to p\mu^+\mu^-$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform the first global fit of rare charm transitions using recent data on $D^0\to \mu^+\mu^-$, $D^+\to\pi^+\mu^+\mu^-$, $\Lambda_c\to p\mu^+\mu^-$ and $D^0\to\pi^+\pi^-\mu^+\mu^-$ decays, including angular observables. We work out constraints on new physics in the framework of the weak effective field theory. While angular observables in $D^0\to\pi^+\pi^-\mu^+\mu^-$ decays provide sensitivities to different QCD models, future null tests in $\Lambda_c\to p \mu^+\mu^-$ look more promising to extract limits because of less hadronic uncertainties. This marks $\Lambda_c\to p \mu^+\mu^-$ as the rising star of rare charm decays.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes and magnetic fields in conformal neutrino mass models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sufficiently strong and long-lasting first-order phase transitions can produce primordial black holes (PBHs) that contribute substantially to the dark matter abundance of the Universe, and can produce large-scale primordial magnetic fields. We study these mechanisms in a generic class of conformal U(1)' models that also explain active neutrino oscillation data via the type-I seesaw mechanism. We find that phase transitions that occur at seesaw scales between $10^4$ GeV and $10^{11}$ GeV produce gravitational wave signals at LISA/ET that can be correlated with microlensing signals of PBHs at the Roman Space Telescope, while scales near $10^{11}$ GeV can be correlated with Hawking evaporation signals at future gamma-ray telescopes. LISA can probe the entire range of PBH masses between $1\times 10^{-16}M_\odot$ and $8\times 10^{-11}M_\odot$ if PBHs fully account for the dark matter abundance. For Z' masses between 40 TeV and $10^4$ TeV, and 10 TeV right-handed neutrinos, helical magnetic fields (with magnitudes $\gtrsim 0.5$ pG and coherence lengths $\gtrsim 0.008$ Mpc above current blazar lower bounds can be produced.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic grand unification in SO(10) with one extra dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asymptotic grand unification provides an alternative approach to gradually unify gauge couplings in the UV limit, where they reach a non-trivial UV fixed point. Using an economical and realistic particle content setup, we demonstrate that asymptotic grand unification can be achieved in a 5D SO(10) model with one extra dimension. The top, bottom and tau masses are split, and the smallness of the neutrino mass is explained via inverse seesaw. One intermediate scale, the Pati-Salam symmetry breaking scale, is included below the compactification scale. Due to the absence of large-dimensional Higgs representations, gauge couplings exhibit asymptotic safety and are thus asymptotically unified, regardless of their initial values. In contrast, Yukawa couplings can achieve asymptotic freedom if the negative gauge contributions dominate over the positive Yukawa terms, requiring exact unification at the compactification scale. The widely-used 126-dimensional Higgs is not recommended in this 5D asymptotic SO(10) GUT, as it tends to drive the gauge beta function positive, compromising asymptotic safety.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the LHCb observations of $P_c$ and $P_{cs}$ states, we systematically investigate the hidden-charm double-strange pentaquark system ($nssc\bar{c}$) using the resonating group method within the quark delocalization color screening model (QDCSM). By dynamically incorporating channel coupling effects, five resonance states are identified with $J^P = 1/2^-$ and $3/2^-$. Their masses, widths, and dominant decay channels are predicted, providing critical guidance for future experimental searches.</description>

      <title>What can solve the Strong CP problem?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three possible strategies have been advocated to solve the strong CP problem. The first is the axion, a dynamical mechanism that relaxes any initial value of the CP violating angle $\bar{\theta}$ to zero. The second is the imposition of new symmetries that are believed to set $\bar{\theta}$ to zero in the UV. The third is the acceptance of the fine tuning of parameters. We argue that the latter two solutions do not solve the strong CP problem. The $\theta$ term of QCD is not a parameter - it does not exist in the Hamiltonian. Rather, it is a property of the quantum state that our universe finds itself in, arising from the fact that there are CP violating states of a CP preserving Hamiltonian. It is not eliminated by imposing parity as a symmetry since the underlying theory is already parity symmetric and that does not preclude the existence of CP violating states. Moreover, since the value of $\theta$ realized in our universe is a consequence of measurement, it is inherently random and cannot be fine tuned by choice of parameters. Rather any fine tuning would require a tuning between parameters in the theory and the random outcome of measurement. Our results considerably strengthen the case for the existence of the axion and axion dark matter. The confusion around $\theta$ arises from the fact that unlike classical mechanics, the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian are not equivalent in quantum mechanics. The Hamiltonian defines the differential time evolution, whereas the Lagrangian is a solution to this evolution. Consequently, initial conditions could in principle appear in the Lagrangian but not in the Hamiltonian. This results in aspects of the initial condition such as $\theta$ misleadingly appearing in the Lagrangian as parameters. We comment on the similarity between the $\theta$ vacua and the violations of the constraint equations of classical gauge theories in quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Radiative $\mu-\tau$ Corrections and Renormalization of Neutrino Mass Operators in Type II Seesaw Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the impact of radiative $\mu-\tau$ corrections on the renormalization of neutrino mass operators in the Type II Seesaw framework, incorporating both dimension-five and dimension-six operators. Using renormalization group equations (RGE), we analyze the evolution of flavor coupling matrices and their deviations from $\mu-\tau$ symmetric configurations due to quantum corrections. Given the stringent constraints from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) on the triplet scalar masses and couplings, we examine how these bounds influence the viability of $\mu-\tau$ symmetric seesaw models. Our analysis highlights the interplay between high-scale $\mu-\tau$ symmetry predictions and low-scale phenomenology, revealing whether radiative corrections remain within experimentally allowed limits.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic fluctuations of momentum and angular momentum of heavy quarks in the pre-equilibrium stage of pA collisions at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We simulate the real-time evolution of the $SU(3)$-glasma generated in the early stages of high-energy proton-nucleus collisions, employing classical lattice gauge theory techniques. Our setup incorporates a realistic modeling of the proton's internal structure and includes longitudinal fluctuations in the initial state, enabling the study of genuinely non-boost-invariant collision dynamics. Focusing on the momentum and angular momentum anisotropies of heavy quarks in the infinite mass limit, we find that the system retains significant anisotropy well beyond the characteristic timescale $\tau = 1/Q_s$. This persistence of anisotropy is further confirmed in the more realistic, non-boost-invariant scenario, across a range of fluctuation amplitudes. These findings pave the way for future investigations involving dynamical heavy quarks and more quantitative initializations of the glasma.</description>

      <title>Emerging axion detection in artificial magnetoelectric materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of dark matter is a fundamental problem in physics. Axions are considered a key component of dark matter, characterized by very weak Chern-Simons couplings to electromagnetism, gravity, and fermions. We propose a novel symmetry-breaking detection mechanism in magnetoelectric materials, allowing for a linear axionic coupling between magnetism and ferroelectric polarization. We focus on strain gradient Sr2IrO4, where the breaking of space-inversion symmetry results in an emergent polar phase and out-of-plane magnetic moment, exhibiting a flexomagnetoelectric effect. In this material, the linear P||M enables direct coupling between the external axion field and the intrinsic axion-like field within the material. This mechanism amplifies the weak electromagnetic signals induced by axions, paving the way for pioneering axion detection. These signals can be detected by monitoring changes in macroscopic physical quantities, such as the magnetoelectric and magnetic responses. In contrast to conventional detection techniques, this mechanism significantly enhances the sensitivity of the axion-electron and axion-photon coupling, providing a novel platform for axion detection and advancing the study of dark matter through the magnetoelectric effect.</description>

      <title>Power corrections in the determination of heavy meson LCDAs: A renormalon-based estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At leading power accuracy the QCD light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs) for a heavy meson can be matched onto the LCDAs in the framework of heavy-quark effective theory (HQET) through a factorization formula. We examine the power corrections to this factorization in the renormalon model, which can associate the power corrections originating from high-twist contributions to the divergent series in a matching kernel. Our analysis indicates that the dominant power corrections originate from the virtual part of the vertex bubble chain diagrams, which generate poles at $w=n+\frac{1}{2},\forall n\in \mathbb{N}$ and $w=1$ in the Borel plane. Employing phenomenological models for both HQET and QCD LCDA, we present a numerical estimate. The results indicate that the power corrections in the peak region are approximately $22\%$ for the D meson and $7\%$ for the $\overline{\mathrm{B}}$ meson. These findings showcase the magnitude and the potential importance of power corrections in achieving high-precision phenomenological predictions for heavy mesons.</description>

      <title>Constraints on light scalars in the Aligned-two-Higgs-doublet model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the viability of light-scalar scenarios within the $\mathcal{CP}$-conserving, flavour-aligned two-Higgs-doublet model (A2HDM), where at least one additional neutral or charged scalar is assumed to be lighter than the 125 GeV Higgs boson. The A2HDM naturally avoids flavour-changing neutral currents via Yukawa alignment, providing a more flexible framework than conventional $Z_2$-symmetric models. Employing the $\texttt{HEPfit}$ package within a Bayesian statistical approach, we perform global fits across all distinct light-scalar configurations, incorporating theoretical requirements and experimental constraints from electroweak precision observables, flavour data, Higgs measurements, and direct searches at the LEP and the LHC.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{P}$, $\mathcal{T}$-violating axion mediated interactions in RaOH molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If axion simultaneously has the scalar couplings to the nucleons and pseudo-scalar couplings to the electrons, they may mediate a $\mathcal{P}$, $\mathcal{T}$ violating interaction between the electronic shell and nuclei in the molecules. The polyatomic molecule RaOH, which is considered as a promising platform for the $\mathcal{P}$, $\mathcal{T}$ violation searches, is studied for its sensitivity to such interactions. Due to the long-range nature (on molecular scales) of the axion-mediated interaction, it is interesting whether the enhancement parameter would be sensitive to the vibration of the molecule. Our results imply that the impact of the vibrations on the axion-mediated electron-nucleon interaction in the molecule is similar to the impact on the short-range electron-nucleon scalar-pseudoscalar interaction studied earlier.</description>

      <title>Electroweak hierarchy from conformal and custodial symmetry -- "Custodial Naturalness"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I introduce the idea of "Custodial Naturalness" to explain the origin of the electroweak (EW) scale hierarchy. Custodial Naturalness is based on classical scale invariance as well as an extension of the Standard Model (SM) scalar sector custodial symmetry. In a minimal realization, this requires a single new complex scalar field charged under a new U(1) gauge symmetry, which partially overlaps with $B-L$. Classical scale invariance and the high-scale scalar sector SO(6) custodial symmetry are radiatively broken by quantum effects that generate a new intermediate scale by dimensional transmutation. The little hierarchy problem is solved because the Higgs boson arises as pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB) of the spontaneously broken SO(6) custodial symmetry. The minimal realization of Custodial Naturalness has the same number of parameters as the SM and predicts testable new physics in the form of a heavy $Z'$ as well as a light but close-to invisible dilaton.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The earliest phase of an ultrarelativistic heavy ion collision can be described as a highly populated system of gluons called glasma. We study some glasma characteristics related to the system's angular momentum. The first one is the global angular momentum perpendicular to the reaction plane, which is spanned by the beam axis and impact parameter vector. We show that only a small fraction of the enormous initial angular momentum of the colliding ultrarelativistic nuclei is transferred to the glasma. Our main focus is the glasma angular momentum directed along the beam axis. This quantity has a local character and results from the inhomogeneous velocity field generated in the glasma. We calculate the vorticity and local angular momentum which show noticeably different behaviour. The results are analyzed in detail and discussed in the context of existing experimental data. We argue that neither vorticity nor thermal vorticity but instead the local angular momentum controls the polarization of final-state hadrons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A theory and numerical findings are presented on the magnetic Casimir interaction that arises from vacuum fluctuations of the quantized field and its effects at the nuclear scale. We investigate how the zero-temperature Casimir effect at nuclear scales can generate the black-body temperatures required to induce a magnetic electron-positron plasma. The magnetic permeability of the plasma and any magnetic fields present influence the screened Casimir-Yukawa potentials between perfect conducting surfaces. We discuss implications for the magnetic Casimir-Yukawa potential, its screening length, and a magnetic permeability-dependent quantity that resembles the meson mass.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present exact non-perturbative solutions to chiral gauge theories based on the $E_6$ gauge group and several matter fermions in the fundamental $\bf{27}$-dimensional representation. They are obtained when supersymmetric versions are perturbed by small supersymmetry breaking by anomaly mediation. The universality classes obtained are very different from what can be conjectured by the tumbling hypothesis. In particular, the case with three $\bf{27}$s may have an unbroken $\text{SU}(3)$ symmetry with massless composite fermions in $\bf{10}$ of $\text{SU}(3)$. For this case, we employed numerical techniques to obtain the exact ground state.</description>

      <title>Impact of ACT DR6 and DESI DR2 for Early Dark Energy and the Hubble tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The data release six of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT DR6) and the second data release from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI DR2) recently became available. In light of these data, we update constraints on the Early Dark Energy (EDE) resolution to the Hubble tension. While ACT DR6 does not favor EDE over the core cosmological model $\Lambda$CDM, it allows for a significantly larger maximum contribution of EDE, $f_{\rm EDE}$, in the pre-recombination era than the latest analysis of {\it Planck} NPIPE despite increased precision at small angular scales. Moreover, EDE rises the value of $H_0r_s$, improving consistency between CMB and DESI DR2 data. We find a residual tension with SH0ES of $\sim 2 \sigma$ for the combination of {\it Planck} at $\ell &lt;1000$ + ACT DR6 + lensing + Pantheon-plus + DESI DR2, a significant decrease from $3.7 \sigma$ for analyses that use NPIPE and SDSS BAO data. A profile likelihood analysis reveals significant prior-volume effects in Bayesian analyses which do not include SH$0$ES, with confidence intervals of $f_{\rm EDE}=0.09\pm 0.03$ and $H_0= 71.0\pm1.1$ km/s/Mpc. When including DESI data, the EDE model with $H_0=73$ km/s/Mpc provides a better fit than the $\Lambda$CDM model with $H_0=68.4$ km/s/Mpc. The inclusion of SH$0$ES data rises the preference well above $5\sigma$, with $\Delta\chi^2=-35.4$. Our work demonstrates that after ACT DR6 and DESI DR2, EDE remains a potential resolution to the Hubble tension.</description>

Abstract: Recently, we give the robust $\sim2\,\sigma$ evidences of dynamical dark matter and beyond $2\,\sigma$ signals of the coexistence of dynamical dark matter and dynamical dark energy using current cosmological observations [1]. Here we propose the quintessence dark matter model to explain the evolution of dark matter over time on cosmic scales. Interestingly, we find that the exponential quintessence is likely the origin of such an evolution.</description>

Abstract: We study observational bounds in a class of scalar-tensor gravity theories recently proposed. Either an upper or lower bound on a conformal factor in these theories is derived from null observation in composition dependent fifth force search, microscope mission. The important case of a lower bound implies that future improved observations have chances of verifying this class of theories. Future prospect for a particular type of observation is mentioned. The considered class of scalar-tensor gravity was shown elsewhere to explain the conversion of inflationary early phase to late time quintessence type dark energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study graviton-photon conversion in the magnetic fields of a blazar jet and explore the possibility of detecting high-frequency gravitational waves through blazar observations. We calculate the conversion rate using the magnetic field configurations of leptonic, lepto-hadronic, and hadronic one-zone synchrotron self-Compton models for the blazar jet of Mrk 501. By requiring that the photon flux produced within the blazar jet does not exceed the observed flux of Mrk 501, we derive conservative constraints on the abundance of stochastic gravitational waves. We find that, for all three models considered, the resulting limits can be more stringent than previous constraints in the frequency range from $10^8$ Hz to $10^{15}$ Hz.</description>

      <title>A novel view of the flavor-singlet spectrum from multi-flavor QCD on the lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SU(3) gauge theories with increasing number of light fermions are the templates of strongly interacting sectors and studying their low-energy dynamics and spectrum is important, both for understanding the strong dynamics of QCD itself, but also for discovering viable UV completions of beyond the Standard Model physics. In order to contrast many-flavors strongly interacting theories with QCD on a quantitative footing, we use Lattice Field Theory simulations. We focus on the study of the flavor-singlet spectrum in the scalar and pseudoscalar channels: this is an interesting probe of the dynamics of the strongly interacting sector, as reminded by the QCD case with the $f_0(500)$ ($\sigma$) and $\eta^\prime$ mesons. The hierarchy of the spectrum of a strongly coupled new gauge sector of the Standard Model defines the potential reach of future colliders for new physics discoveries. In addition to a novel hierarchy with light scalars, introducing many light flavors at fixed number of colors can influence the dynamics of the lightest flavor-singlet pseudoscalar. We present a complete lattice study of both these flavor-singlet channels on high-statistics gauge ensembles generated by the LatKMI collaboration with 4, 8, and 12 copies of light mass-degenerate fermions. We also present other hadron masses on the lightest ensemble for $N_f=8$ generated by the LatKMI collaboration and discuss the chiral extrapolation of the spectrum in this particular theory. We contrast the results to $N_f=4$ simulations and previous results of $N_f=12$ simulations.</description>

      <title>Contrastive Normalizing Flows for Uncertainty-Aware Parameter Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating physical parameters from data is a crucial application of machine learning (ML) in the physical sciences. However, systematic uncertainties, such as detector miscalibration, induce data distribution distortions that can erode statistical precision. In both high-energy physics (HEP) and broader ML contexts, achieving uncertainty-aware parameter estimation under these domain shifts remains an open problem. In this work, we address this challenge of uncertainty-aware parameter estimation for a broad set of tasks critical for HEP. We introduce a novel approach based on Contrastive Normalizing Flows (CNFs), which achieves top performance on the HiggsML Uncertainty Challenge dataset. Building on the insight that a binary classifier can approximate the model parameter likelihood ratio, we address the practical limitations of expressivity and the high cost of simulating high-dimensional parameter grids by embedding data and parameters in a learned CNF mapping. This mapping yields a tunable contrastive distribution that enables robust classification under shifted data distributions. Through a combination of theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations, we demonstrate that CNFs, when coupled with a classifier and established frequentist techniques, provide principled parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification through classification that is robust to data distribution distortions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study non-factorizable N = 1 superamplitudes for massive chiral superstates. We demonstrate how little group scaling and the supersymmetric Ward identities determine the form of non-factorizable massless superamplitudes, then extrapolate to massive superamplitudes by requiring they reduce to the massless form when we send all masses to zero. This technique does not depend on whether or not the superstates are self-conjugate (so that the fermionic components are either Dirac or Majorana) or whether the superamplitude is dressed with a form-factor.</description>

      <title>Kination-like Era Driven by the Effective Inflaton/Higgs Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the minimal $U(1)_X$ extended Standard Model, we explore cosmic inflation where the $U(1)_X$ Higgs field serves as the inflaton. We demonstrate that a stiff era with an equation of state $w &gt; 1/3$ can emerge during the inflaton's oscillatory phase after inflation, driven by the Coleman-Weinberg potential of the inflaton, arising due to radiative corrections. This leads to significant modulation and enhancement of the irreducible stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background from inflation, deviating from the conventional scale-invariant spectrum. Such a distinct GW spectrum could be detectable by next-generation GW interferometer missions, such as U-DECIGO. In our framework, the GW spectrum depends on the $U(1)_X$ gauge coupling and the mass of the $U(1)_X$ gauge boson ($Z^\prime$). As a result, future GW observations and $Z^\prime$ boson resonance searches at high-energy collider experiments are complementary to one another.</description>

      <title>Higgs boson pair production in non-linear Effective Field Theory with full $m_t$-dependence at NLO QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.05162</link>
      <description>arXiv:1806.05162v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a calculation of the NLO QCD corrections to Higgs boson pair production within the framework of a non-linearly realised Effective Field Theory in the Higgs sector, described by the electroweak chiral Lagrangian. We analyse how the NLO corrections affect distributions in the Higgs boson pair invariant mass and the transverse momentum of one of the Higgs bosons. We find that these corrections lead to significant and non-homogeneous K-factors in certain regions of the parameter space. We also provide an analytical parametrisation for the total cross-section and the $m_{hh}$ distribution as a function of the anomalous Higgs couplings that includes NLO corrections. Such a parametrisation can be useful for phenomenological studies.</description>

      <title>High-energy neutrinos flavour composition as a probe of neutrino magnetic moments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02027v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutrino propagation in the Galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields is considered. We extend an approach developed in \cite{Popov:2019nkr} to describe neutrino flavour and spin oscillations using wave packets. The evolution equations for the neutrino wave packets in a uniform and non-uniform magnetic fields are derived. The analytical expressions for neutrino flavour and spin oscillations probabilities accounting for damping due to the wave packet separation are obtained for the case of a uniform magnetic field. It is shown that terms in the flavour oscillations probabilities that depend on the magnetic field strength are characterized by two coherence lengths. One of the coherence lengths coincides with the coherence length for neutrino oscillations in vacuum, while the second one is proportional to the cube of the average neutrino momentum $p_0^3$. The probabilities of flavour and spin oscillations are calculated numerically for neutrino interacting with the non-uniform Galactic magnetic field. It is shown that oscillations on certain frequencies are suppressed on the Galactic scale due to the neutrino wave packets separation. The flavour compositions of high-energy neutrino flux coming from the Galactic centre and ultra-high energy neutrinos from an extragalactic sourse are calculated accounting for neutrino interaction with the magnetic field and decoherence due to the wave packet separation. It is shown that for neutrino magnetic moments $\sim 10^{-13} \mu_B$ and larger these flavour compositions significantly differ from ones predicted by the vacuum neutrino oscillations scenario.</description>

      <title>Divergences in the effective loop interaction of the Chern-Simons bosons with leptons. The unitary gauge case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00164v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the extension of the Standard Model with Chern-Simons type interaction. There is a new vector massive boson (Chern-Simons bosons) in this extension. Using only three-particle dimension-4 interaction of the Chern-Simons bosons with vector bosons of the SM, we consider effective loop interaction of a new vector boson with leptons. We consider the renormalizability of this loop interaction and conclude that for the case of computation of loop diagrams in the unitary gauge, we can not get rid of the divergences in the effective interaction of the Chern-Simons bosons with leptons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00335v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we have investigated the radiative and semileptonic decay of doubly heavy baryons. Our focus is to determine the static and dynamic properties such as ground state masses, magnetic moment, transition magnetic moment, radiative decay and heavy-to-heavy semileptonic decay rates including their corresponding branching fractions. The ground state masses are calculated by solving the six-dimensional hyperradial Schr\"{o}dinger equation. The magnetic moments and transition magnetic moments for $J^P=\frac{1}{2}^+$ and $J^P=\frac{3}{2}^+$ baryons are also calculated. In addition, radiative M1 decay widths are computed from the transition magnetic moment. We have employed the Isgur-Wise function(IWF) to analyse the semileptonic decay widths of the doubly heavy baryons. The obtained results are compared with other theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Schwinger pair production in counterpropagating laser pulses: Identifying volume factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the nonperturbative process of vacuum pair production in a combination of two counterpropagating linearly polarized laser pulses of a finite spatial extent. By means of the locally-constant field approximation (LCFA), we calculate the total particle yield for the corresponding four-dimensional setup and compare it with the estimates obtained for simplified low-dimensional scenarios. Within the domain where the LCFA is well justified, we examine a combination of two plane-wave pulses, a standing electromagnetic wave, and a spatially uniform oscillating field and demonstrate that at each of these three levels of approximation, one can accurately predict the actual particle number by multiplying the results by properly chosen volume factors depending on the field parameters. We present closed-form expressions for these factors providing universal prescriptions for evaluating the particle yield. Our final formula connecting the spatially uniform setup with the four-dimensional scenario has a relative uncertainty of the level of $10\%$. The explicit correspondences deduced in this study not only prove the relevance of the approximate predictions, but also allow one to quickly estimate the number of pairs for various realistic scenarios without performing multidimensional LCFA integrations.</description>

      <title>Cold Dark Matter Based on an Analogy with Superconductivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel candidate for cold dark matter consisting of condensed Cooper pairs in a theory of interacting fermions with broken chiral symmetry. Establishing the thermal history from the early radiation era to the present, the fermions are shown to behave like standard radiation at high temperatures, but then experience a critical era decaying faster than radiation, akin to freeze-out, which sets the relic abundance. Through a second-order phase transition, fermion-antifermion pairs condense and the system asymptotes toward zero temperature and pressure. By the present era, the nonrelativistic, massive condensate decays slightly faster than in the standard scenario--a unique prediction that may be tested by combined measurements of the cosmic microwave background and large scale structure. We also show that in the case of massive fermions, the phase transition is frustrated, and instead leaves a residual, long-lived source of dark energy.</description>

      <title>Unlocking the Inelastic Dark Matter Window with Vector Mediators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00881v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the robust cosmological and astrophysical evidence confirming the existence of a non-baryonic matter component in the Universe, the underlying nature of Dark Matter (DM) remains a mystery. Among the several possible scenarios, light DM candidates thermally produced in the early Universe are especially interesting, since their abundance could be set via the standard freeze-out mechanism. Additionally, new light states can present a rich phenomenology and are attracting increasing attention due to recent experimental capabilities to probe dark sectors with feeble interactions. In particular, inelastic DM (iDM) candidates are an appealing option, since they can avoid cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation bounds as well as indirect and direct detection searches. Although such models have been intensively studied in the literature, the usual scenario is to consider a secluded dark photon mediator. In this work, we consider the case of iDM with general vector mediators and explore the consequences of such a choice in the relic density computation, as well as for the cosmological and experimental bounds. We examine models with couplings to baryon and lepton number and show new viable parameter regions for inelastic dark matter models. Especially, anomaly-free gauge groups with non-universal couplings to leptons open new windows of the parameter space for thermal dark matter yet unexplored by experiments. We also provide a numerical Python library to compute the relic densities for user-defined gauge charges.</description>

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are employed to solve the Dyson--Schwinger equations of quantum electrodynamics (QED) in Euclidean space, with a focus on the non-perturbative generation of the fermion's dynamical mass function in the Landau gauge. By inserting the integral equation directly into the loss function, our PINN framework enables a single neural network to learn a continuous and differentiable representation of the mass function over a spectrum of momenta. Also, we benchmark our approach against a traditional numerical algorithm showing the main differences among them. Our novel strategy, which is expected to be extended to other quantum field theories, is the first step towards forefront applications of machine learning in high-level theoretical physics.</description>

      <title>Oscillatory properties of strange quark stars described by the vector MIT bag model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigated the radial and non-radial fundamental ($f$) mode oscillations of self-bound (quark) stars obtained after employing the Vector MIT (vMIT) bag model. Within this model, we computed the equation of state for strange quark matter satisfying thermodynamic consistency. This allowed us to obtain the corresponding behavior of the speed of sound, mass-radius relation, and gravitational redshift. In particular, our choice of $G_V$ = 0.30 fm$^2$ produces masses and radii in agreement with recent astronomical data (e.g. from NICER and HESS J1731). In fact, we tested that variations of the remaining vMIT parameters slightly modify this conclusion. Then, we proceeded to compute the radial oscillation frequencies of the $f$-mode, which is tightly connected to the dynamical stability of these compact stars. We found that increments of the $G_V$ parameter have a stabilizing property around the maximal-mass stars for a given stellar family. We also calculated the gravitational-wave frequencies of the non-radial $f$-mode. Our results show that they are restricted to be in the range (1.6 - 1.8) kHz for high-mass stars and to (1.5 - 1.6) kHz for low-mass stars. Finally, we propose a universal relation between these frequencies and the square root of the average density. All these last results are important in distinguishing strange stars from ordinary neutron stars in future gravitational-wave detections coming from compact sources with activated non-radial modes.</description>

      <title>Exclusive semileptonic decays of $D$ and $D_s$ mesons into orbitally and radially excited states of strange and light mesons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semileptonic decays of $D$ and $D_s$ mesons into orbitally and radially excited strange and light mesons are studied in detail within the framework of the relativistic quark model based on the quasipotential approach and quantum chromodynamics. The hadronic matrix elements of the weak current between meson states are calculated with the consistent account of relativistic effects including contributions of the intermediate negative energy states and boosts of the meson wave functions from the rest to moving reference frame. The invariant form factors that parameterize these matrix elements are obtained as the overlap integrals of the initial and final meson wave functions. Their dependence on the square of the transferred momentum $q^2$ is explicitly determined within the whole accessible kinematic range. A convenient analytical approximation for numerical values of form factors is given. These form factors and helicity formalism are employed for the calculation of the differential and total semileptonic decay rates of charm mesons into excited strange and light mesons. Different asymmetry and polarization parameters are also evaluated. The obtained results are compared with other theoretical calculations and available experimental data. Reasonable agreement with experimentally measured semileptonic decay branching fractions and upper bounds is obtained.</description>

Abstract: In this work, real photon production scattering kernels from jet-medium interactions in the QCD medium are perturbatively calculated using the higher-twist (HT) formalism. Focus is given towards real photon production from a highly virtual (and highly energetic) quark, taking into account heavy-quark mass scales [Phys. Rev. C 94, 054902 (2016)], fermion-boson conversion processes [Nucl. Phys. A 793, 128-170 (2007)], as well as coherence effects [Phys. Rev. C 105, 024908 (2022)]. A generalized factorization procedure, such as that used in e-A deep-inelastic scattering, is employed to derive an improved single-scattering medium-induced photon emission kernels that go beyond the traditional in-medium gluon exchange approximation. Diagrams with real-photon emission from the hard quark are classified based on the final-state particles, and include two types of scattering kernels at $O(\alpha_{em}\alpha_{s})$ giving the following final states: (i) real photon and real quark, (ii) real photon and real gluon. The collisional kernels, thus derived, include full phase factors from all non-vanishing diagrams and complete second-order derivative terms in the transverse momentum gradient expansion. Moreover, the calculation includes heavy-quark mass effects, thus exploring heavy-quark energy loss. The in-medium parton distribution functions and the related jet transport coefficients have a hard transverse momentum dependence (of the emitted gluon or photon) present within the phase factor. It is observed that the jet transport coefficients resemble the transverse-momentum-dependent parton distribution functions.</description>

Abstract: We systematically explore the S-wave $D_1D_1$, $D_1D^*_2$ and $D^*_2D^*_2$ states with various isospin-spin-orbit ($ISL$) configurations in the quark model. We propose nine stable dimeson states with the $ISL$ configurations, $ISL=001$, $010$, $012$, $100$, $102$, $110$, $112$, $120$, and $122$, against dissociation into their constituent mesons. Those bound states are hydrogenlike molecular states, where the two subclusters are moderately overlapped and the QCD covalent bond is formed due to the delocalization of light quarks. The QCD covalent bond serves as the primary binding mechanism in the bound states with $I=1$. However, the exchange of $\pi$ and $\sigma$-meson plays a pivotal role in the bound states with $I=0$. The coupled-channel effect is essential in the formation of the bound states with $ISL=001$, $010$, $012$, $100$, and $102$.</description>

Abstract: We construct relativized mock meson states for heavy quarkonium, where the Dirac spinors import kinetic relativistic correction and the dynamic wave functions are the same as those solved from Schr\"odinger equation. We find that the kinetic relativistic correction imported by Dirac spinors is crucial to study the two-photon transition form factors. Using relativized mock meson states, we give credible predictions for the two-photon transition form factors and decay widths of $\eta_{c,b}(n^1S_0)$ and $\chi_{c,b}(n^3P_0)$ ($n=1,2,3$).</description>

      <title>A radiative neutrino mass model with leptoquarks under non-holomorphic modular $A_4$ symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a radiative seesaw model with two leptoquarks under non-holomorphic modular $A_4$ symmetry. The leptons and quarks belong to non-trivial representations of the modular $A_4$ and the structures of their mass matrices are restricted. Neutrino masses are generated at one-loop level via leptoquark inside loop diagram where structures of relevant Yukawa interactions are determined by the modular $A_4$ symmetry. We scan the free parameters in the model and try to fit all the observed data for both lepton and quark sectors. For allowed parameters, we show some predictions regarding neutrino observables such as sum of neutrino mass and neutrinoless double beta decay.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes and Gravitational Waves in Extensions of the Standard Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenology of a Standard Model extension incorporating an inert scalar doublet and a gauged $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry. Our analysis reveals regions of the parameter space that support strong first-order phase transitions, including cases featuring two successive transitions. Each transition can generate a stochastic gravitational wave background within the sensitivity reach of upcoming experiments. Remarkably, the high-scale transition may also produce primordial black holes with appreciable abundance.</description>

      <title>The two-loop energy-momentum tensor within the gradient-flow formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.09837</link>
      <description>arXiv:1808.09837v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gradient-flow formulation of the energy-momentum tensor of QCD is extended to NNLO perturbation theory. This means that the Wilson coefficients which multiply the flowed operators in the corresponding expression for the regular energy-momentum tensor are calculated to this order. The result has been obtained by applying modern tools of regular perturbation theory, reducing the occurring two-loop integrals, which also include flow-time integrations, to a small set of master integrals which can be calculated analytically.</description>

      <title>Is gauge symmetry vacuous or physical ? : Lessons from the Landau problem as a solvable quantum gauge theoretical system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gauge symmetry is one of the most important concepts in modern physics, but there are two conflicting views on its meaning or interpretation. The standard view is that local gauge symmetry is the basis of the pursue of fundamental particles and forces in nature. Another view is that the gauge symmetry is not a symmetry of nature but just a redundancy in description. Naturally, both statements are nothing wrong, but one might feel that there is a slight conceptual conflict between the two points of view. Due to the subtlety of the subject, however, little literature exists that discusses the root of such an anxiety. In the present paper, by making full use of the analytically solvable nature of the quantum Landau problem, we argue that the familiar gauge principle plays a critical role in unraveling a subtle mismatch between the two viewpoints above. We reveal that there exist two types of quantities in gauge theories, which should clearly be discriminated. The first are quantities, which look seemingly gauge-invariant but actually not, whereas the second are genuinely gauge-invariant quantities, which correspond to direct experimental observables.</description>

      <title>Bridging the micro-Hz gravitational wave gap via Doppler tracking with the Uranus Orbiter and Probe Mission: Massive black hole binaries, early universe signals and ultra-light dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the recent announcement by NASA's \textit{Planetary Science and Astrobiology Decadal Survey 2023-2032}, a priority flagship mission to the planet Uranus is anticipated. Here, we explore the prospects of using the mission's radio Doppler tracking equipment to detect gravitational waves (GWs) and other analogous signals related to dark matter (DM) over the duration of its interplanetary cruise. We develop a methodology to stack tracking data and account for time varying detector geometry, thereby constructing the sensitivity of the mission to GWs over the wide frequency range of $3\times 10^{-9}$ Hz to $10^{-4}$ Hz. We find that the mission has the potential to fill the gap between pulsar timing and space-based-interferometry GW observatories. If improvements in reducing \textit{Cassini} era noise by a factor of $\sim$10 are implemented, we forecast the detection of $\mathcal{\mathcal{O}}(\rm{few})$ individual massive black hole binaries using two independent population models. Additionally, we determine the mission's sensitivity to both astrophysical and primordial stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds, as well as its capacity to test, or even confirm via detection, ultralight DM models. In all these cases, the tracking of the spacecraft over its interplanetary cruise would enable coverage of unexplored regions of parameter space, where signals from new phenomena in our Universe may be lurking.</description>

      <title>$B_c^{\pm}$-$^{12}$C states and detailed study of momentum space method for $\Upsilon$- and $\eta_b$-nucleus bound states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a detailed study of the $\Upsilon$-, $\eta_b$-, and $B_c$-nucleus systems in momentum space to calculate the bound-state energies and the corresponding coordinate-space radial wave functions. The attractive strong potentials for the meson-nucleus systems are calculated from the Lorentz scalar mass modifications of these mesons in nuclear matter in the local density approximation in the nucleus. The downward shift of the meson masses may be regarded as a signature of partial restoration of chiral symmetry in a nuclear medium applied in the present study in an empirical sense, because the origin of the negative mass shift in this study is not directly related to the chiral symmetry mechanism. Furthermore, as an initial and realistic study, the $B_c^{\pm}$-$^{12}$C bound states are studied for the first time, with the effects of self-consistently calculated Coulomb potentials in $^{12}$C (when the $B_c^{\pm}$ mesons are absent).</description>

      <title>Dark matter coupled to radiation: Limits from the Milky Way satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interactions between dark matter (DM) and relativistic particles at early times suppress structure formation on small scales. In particular, the scattering process transfers heat and momentum from radiation to DM, ultimately reducing the abundance of low-mass DM halos and the dwarf galaxies they host. Herein, we derive limits on DM-photon and DM-neutrino scattering cross section using the Milky Way satellite galaxy population. We consider temperature-independent interactions parameterized by DM mass ($m_\chi$) and DM-radiation interaction cross section ($\sigma_{\chi\text{-}i}$, where $i$ represents the target species). By requiring that the linear matter power spectra be strictly less suppressed than in the case of a thermal-relic warm DM cutoff, we derive the following $95\%$ upper limits at $m_\chi=1$ MeV: $\sigma_{\chi\text{-}\gamma}&lt;1.98\times10^{-38}\text{cm}^2$ and $\sigma_{\chi\text{-}\nu}&lt;3.16\times10^{-38}\text{cm}^2$. Our bounds on $\sigma_{\chi\text{-}i}$ depend linearly on $m_\chi$ for $m_\chi \gtrsim 1~\mathrm{MeV}$ and improve upon previous limits by 1 order of magnitude. The mass dependence of our limit approaches $m_\chi^3$ at lower masses due to the effects of DM sound speed; at $m_{\chi}=100~\mathrm{keV}$, we arrive at an upper limit 3 orders of magnitude more stringent than achieved in previous explorations. Upcoming dwarf galaxy surveys will further improve the sensitivity of similar analyses, complementing laboratory and indirect detection searches for DM-radiation interactions.</description>

      <title>Non-Gaussianity Beyond the Scalar Sector: A Search for Tensor and Mixed Tensor-Scalar Bispectra with Planck Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial gravitational waves could be non-Gaussian, just like primordial scalar perturbations. Although the tensor two-point function has thus-far remained elusive, the three-point function could, in principle, be large enough to be detected in Cosmic Microwave Background temperature and polarization anisotropies. We perform a detailed analysis of tensor and mixed tensor-scalar non-Gaussianity through the Planck PR4 bispectrum, placing constraints on eleven primordial templates, spanning various phenomenological and physical regimes including modifications to gravity, additional fields in inflation, and primordial magnetic fields. All analysis is performed using modern quasi-optimal binned estimators, and yields no evidence for tensor non-Gaussianity, with a maximum detection significance of $2\sigma$. Our constraints are derived primarily from large-scales (except for tensor-scalar-scalar models), and benefit greatly from the inclusion of $B$-modes. Although we find some loss of information from binning, mask effects and residual foreground contamination, our $f_{\rm NL}$ bounds improve over those of previous analyses by $(20-700)\%$, with six of the eleven models being analyzed for the first time. Unlike for scalar non-Gaussianity, future low-noise experiments such as LiteBIRD, the Simons Observatory and CMB-S4, will yield considerable improvement in tensor non-Gaussianity constraints.</description>

      <title>The density of states method for symplectic gauge theories at finite temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the finite-temperature behaviour of the $Sp(4)$ Yang-Mills lattice theory in four dimensions, by applying the Logarithmic Linear Relaxation (LLR) algorithm. We demonstrate the presence of coexisting (metastable) phases, when the system is in the proximity of the transition. We measure observables such as the free energy, the expectation value of the plaquette operator and of the Polyakov loop, as well as the specific heat, and the Binder cumulant. We use these results to obtain a high-precision measurement of the critical coupling at the confinement-deconfinement transition, and assess its systematic uncertainty, for one value of the lattice extent in the time direction. Furthermore, we perform an extensive study of the finite-volume behaviour of the lattice system, by repeating the measurements for fixed lattice time extent, while increasing the spatial size of the lattice. We hence characterise the first-order transition on the lattice, and present the first results in the literature on this theory for the infinite volume extrapolation of lattice quantities related to latent heat and interface tension.
  Gauge theories with $Sp(4)$ group have been proposed as new dark sectors to provide a fundamental origin for the current phenomenological evidence of dark matter. A phase transition at high temperature, in such a new dark sector, occurring in the early universe, might have left a relic stochastic background of gravitational waves. Our results represent a milestone toward establishing whether such a new physics signal is detectable in future experiments, as they enter the calculation of the parameters, $\alpha$ and $\beta$, controlling the power spectrum of gravitational waves. We also outline the process needed in the continuum extrapolation of our measurements, and test its feasibility on one additional choice of temporal extent of the lattice.</description>

      <title>Wiggly dilaton: a landscape of spontaneously broken scale invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dilaton emerges as a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB) associated with the spontaneous breaking of scale invariance in a nearly conformal field theory (CFT). We show the existence of a wiggly dilaton potential that contains multiple vacuum solutions in a five-dimensional (5D) holographic formulation. The wiggly feature originates from boundary potentials of a 5D axion-like scalar field, whose naturally small bulk mass parameter corresponds to a marginally-relevant deformation of the dual CFT. Depending on the energy density of a boundary 3-brane, our model can provide a relaxion potential or generate a light dilaton. However, an extremely light dilaton requires fine-tuning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We search for an excess of electrons and positrons in the interplanetary space from the decays of heavy neutrinos produced in nuclear reactions in the Sun. Using measurements of the electron spectra in the MeV range from the Ulysses and SOHO satellites, we report the strongest direct upper bound to date on the mixing between heavy neutral leptons with MeV masses and electron neutrinos, reaching $U_e^2\simeq 10^{-6}$ at $M_N=10\,$MeV. Our sensitivity is predominantly constrained by the uncertainties in the propagation of electrons and positrons, particularly the diffusion coefficient in the inner Solar System, as well as the uncertainties in the astrophysical background. Enhancing our understanding of either of these factors could lead to a significant improvement in sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Search for Solar Boosted Dark Matter Particles at the PandaX-4T Experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel constraint on light dark matter utilizing $1.54$ tonne$\cdot$year of data acquired from the PandaX-4T dual-phase xenon time projection chamber. This constraint is derived through detecting electronic recoil signals resulting from the interaction with solar-enhanced dark matter flux. Low-mass dark matter particles, lighter than a few MeV/$c^2$, can scatter with the thermal electrons in the Sun. Consequently, with higher kinetic energy, the boosted dark matter component becomes detectable via contact scattering with xenon electrons, resulting in a few keV energy deposition that exceeds the threshold of PandaX-4T. We calculate the expected recoil energy in PandaX-4T considering the Sun's acceleration and the detection capabilities of the xenon detector. The first experimental search results using the xenon detector yield the most stringent cross-section of $3.51 \times 10^{-39}~\mathrm{cm}^2$ at $0.08~\mathrm{MeV}$/$c^2$ for a solar boosted dark matter mass ranging from $0.02$ to $10~ \mathrm{MeV}$/$c^2$, achieving a 23 fold improvement compared with earlier experimental studies.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Effects of Mass Dependence in Spontaneous Collapse Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spontaneous collapse models aim to solve the long-standing measurement problem in quantum mechanics by modifying the theory's dynamics to include objective wave function collapses. These collapses occur randomly in space, bridging the gap between quantum and classical behavior. A central feature of these models is their dependence on mass density, which directly influences how and when collapse events occur. In this work, we explore a generalized framework in which the collapse dynamics depend on arbitrary functions of the mass density, extending previous models. We analyze the theoretical consistency of these generalizations, investigate their predictions, and compare them with experimental data. Our findings show that only a limited range of mass-dependence functions are viable, with significant implications for the future development and empirical testability of collapse-based models.</description>

Abstract: The iconic, deep-MOND-limit (DML) relation between acceleration and mass, $a\sim (M\mathcal{A}_0)^{1/2}/r$, implies that, in MOND, accelerations cannot be linear in the mass distribution ($\mathcal{A}_0\equiv Ga_0$ is the DML constant, and $a_0$ the MOND acceleration). This leads to important idiosyncracies of MOND, such as a breakdown of the strong equivalence principle, and the resulting ``external-field effect''. I show that the DML axioms are, in themselves, consistent with a, possibly unique, nonrelativistic, action-based, linear formulation of the DML. This model suffers from important drawbacks, which may make it unacceptable as a basis for a full-fledged MOND theory. The model is unique among MOND theories propounded to date not only in being linear -- hence not exhibiting an external-field effect, for example -- but in constituting a modification of both Newtonian inertia and Newtonian gravity. This linear and time-local model inspires and begets several, one-parameter families of models. One family employs nonlinear, time-nonlocal kinetic terms, but still linear gravitational-field equations. Other families generalize the DMLs of AQUAL and QUMOND, modifying gravity as well as inertia. All families employ fractional time derivatives and possibly fractional Laplacians. At present, I cannot base some acceptable MOND theory on these models -- for example, I cannot offer a sensible umbrella theory that interpolates between these DML models and Newtonian dynamics. They are, however, quite useful in elucidating various matter-of-principle aspects of MOND; e.g., they help to understand which predictions follow from only the basic tenets of MOND -- so-called primary predictions -- and which are secondary, i.e., theory dependent. The models may also show the way to a wider class of MOND theories. (Abridged.)</description>
