      <title>High-performance amorphous superconducting rhenium films by e-beam evaporation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present electron beam evaporation of rhenium films on room-temperature substrates. The films are shown to be amorphous and achieve a record-high critical temperature for rhenium - exceeding 7 K at the midpoint of the transition - alongside a high critical current density of 5000 A/mm^2 and critical fields above 10 T. Terahertz spectroscopy reveals a BCS-like character of superconductivity with a zero-temperature energy gap of approximately 2 meV and subgap optical conductivity. Despite being friable, the films are stable and compatible with lift-off processes that opens the capabilities for superconducting device applications.</description>

      <title>Strain-Engineered Electronic Structure and Superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the films of the Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelate superconductors, in which the (La,Pr)$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ system exhibits a remarkable transition temperature $T_c$ exceeding 40 K, were synthesized at ambient pressure. We systematically investigate the band structures and electronic correlation effect to identify the key factors controlling superconductivity and pathways to enhance $T_c$. Based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we construct a bilayer two-orbital ($3d_{3z^2-r^2}$ and $3d_{x^2-y^2}$) tight-binding model for a series of in-plane compression mimicking the substrate effect. We find the band energy at the $M$ point drops with the compression, leading to increase of the density of states at the Fermi level, in stark contrast to the behavior of the bulk under pressure. We then apply functional renormalization group (FRG) method to study the electronic correlation effect on the superconductivity. We find the $s_\pm$-wave pairing symmetry remains robust in the films, the same as the bulk. But somewhat surprisingly, for the films, we find $T_c$ can be enhanced by reducing the in-plane lattice constant, increasing the out-of-plane lattice constant, or further electron-doping. These findings are consistent with the itinerant picture of the superconductivity induced by spin-fluctuations and provide theoretical support for further boosting $T_c$ in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Sizable superconducting gap and anisotropic chiral topological superconductivity in the Weyl semimetal PtBi$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological superconductors offer a fertile ground for realizing Majorana zero modes -- topologically protected, zero-energy quasiparticles that are resilient to local perturbations and hold great promise for fault-tolerant quantum computing. Recent studies have presented encouraging evidence for intrinsic topological superconductivity in the Weyl semimetal trigonal PtBi$_2$, hinting at a robust surface phase potentially stable beyond the McMillan limit. However, due to substantial spatial variations in the observed superconducting (SC) gap $\Delta$ the nature of the underlying order parameter $\Delta$($k$) remained under debate. Here we report the realization of sizable surface SC gaps ($\Delta &gt; 10\,\mathrm{meV}$) in PtBi$_2$, exhibiting remarkable spatial uniformity from hundreds of nanometers down to the atomic level, as revealed by scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. Building on this spatial homogeneity -- indicative of long-range phase coherence -- we uncover previously unobserved low-energy Andreev bound states (ABSs) that ubiquitously emerge within the SC gap across the surface. Theoretical simulations that closely reproduce the experimental spectra, reveal an anisotropic chiral pairing symmetry of $\Delta$($k$), and further suggest that the observed ABSs are of topological origin. The combination of a large, nontrivial pairing gap and accessible surface states establishes PtBi$_2$ as a compelling platform for investigating topological superconductivity and its associated Majorana modes.</description>

      <title>Two-photon coupling via Josephson element II: Interaction renormalizations and cross-Kerr coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the interactions mediated by symmetric superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID), their renormalizations, and applicability of the anharmonic oscillator model for a coupled phase qubit. The coupling SQUID can switch between single- or two-photon interaction in situ. We consider a coupled resonator and an rf SQUID. The latter dwells in the vicinity of its metastable well holding a number of anharmonic energy states and acts as an artificial atom known as the phase qubit. Apart from the linear and two-photon couplings, interactions of optomechanical type and a cross-Kerr coupling arise. Near the two-photon resonance, we calculate the renormalizations due to nonresonant interactions, which are more prominent with the higher Josephson energy of the coupler. We interpret the renormalizations by depicting some of the virtual processes involved. That also allows us to determine the minimal amount of metastable states in the phase qubit for the renormalization formulas to hold.</description>

      <title>Lattice-charge coupling in a trilayer nickelate with intertwined density wave order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intertwined charge and spin correlations are ubiquitous in a wide range of transition metal oxides and are often perceived as intimately related to unconventional superconductivity. Theoretically envisioned as driven by strong electronic correlations, the intertwined order is usually found to be strongly coupled to the lattice as signaled by pronounced phonon softening. Recently, both charge/spin density waves (CDW/SDW) and superconductivity have been discovered in several Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates, in particular trilayer nickelates RE4Ni3O10 (RE=Pr, La). The nature of the intertwined order and the role of lattice-charge coupling are at the heart of the debate about these materials. Using inelastic X-ray scattering, we mapped the phonon dispersions in RE4Ni3O10 and found no evidence of phonon softening near the CDW wavevector over a wide temperature range. Calculations of the electronic susceptibility revealed a peak at the observed SDW ordering vector but not at the CDW wavevector. The absence of phonon softening is in sharp contrast to that in canonical oxide materials, notably cuprates. Our experimental and theoretical findings highlight the crucial role of the spin degree of freedom and establish a foundation for understanding the interplay between superconductivity and density-wave transitions in RP nickelate superconductors and beyond.</description>

      <title>Emergent topology by Landau level mixing in quantum Hall-superconductor nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the emergence of novel topological phases in quantum Hall-superconductor hybrid systems driven by Landau level mixing and spin-orbit interactions. Focusing on a narrow superconducting stripe atop a two-dimensional electron gas, we identify regimes where the hybridization of the chiral Andreev states at each side of the stripe leads to different phases beyond the long sought $p$-wave superconducting one. These topological phases exhibit distinctive transport signatures, including quantized nonlocal conductance arising from electron cotunneling at filling factor $\nu=1$, which can coexist with quantized crossed Andreev reflection at $\nu=2$. A combination of numerical simulations and effective modelling reveals the role of spin-orbit coupling and stripe geometry in controlling these transitions. Our findings suggest new strategies for realizing and detecting topology in proximized quantum Hall devices.</description>

      <title>Ex Situ Fabrication of Superconducting Nanostructures for Low-Temperature STM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanofabrication enables flexible experimental design but is often incompatible with scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS) due to the latter's stringent surface quality requirements. Here, we present a fabrication strategy that combines ex situ nanolithography with in situ ultrahigh-vacuum (UHV) cleaving to produce atomically clean, nanopatterned superconductor/topological insulator (TI) heterostructures suitable for high-resolution STM/STS. In our initial Design I, nanoribbons were defined by etching trenches into a TI film, followed by niobium capping and sample flipping before cleaving. This enabled STM/STS to be applied in large areas, although edge quality was limited by etch debris. To overcome this, we developed Design II, which avoids etching through the film by locally thinning it, leaving nanoscale ribbons raised above a continuous TI layer, followed again by Nb capping and sample flipping before cleaving. This method yields clean, reproducible nanostructures with well-defined superconducting gaps, demonstrating a reliable fabrication pathway for high-resolution STM/STS studies of nanoscale topological devices.</description>
