      <title>Higher-dimensional topologically charged traversable defect wormhole with non-exotic matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we explore a topologically charged higher-dimensional traversable defect wormhole, with a specific emphasis on five dimensions. Particularly noteworthy is the fact that the matter-energy distribution attributed to this charged wormhole configuration adheres to the weak energy condition, thus presenting an instance of a five-dimensional wormhole supported by non-exotic matter. Furthermore, our analysis shows that scalar quantities related to space-time curvature and parameters associated with the matter-energy distribution remain finite at the wormhole throat. Moreover, they diminish as distance extends toward infinity, indicating the asymptotic flatness inherent in our model.</description>

      <title>Pilgrim and Generalized Ghost Pilgrim Dark Energy Models in Modified Symmetric Teleparallel Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate $f(Q)$ gravity ($Q$ represents the non-metricity) to explore its cosmological implications of the two non-interacting dark energy models. We use the correspondence scenario to find the pilgrim and generalized ghost pilgrim dark energy $f(Q)$ gravity models for a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe with pressureless matter and a power-law scale factor. The reconstructed models explain the observed rapid expansion of the universe using astronomical observations. We also examine the physical properties of the model, including its equation of state parameter, $(\omega_{D}-\omega^{\prime}_{D})$ and $(r-s)$-planes and the squared speed of sound. It is found that our results are consistent with the interacting pilgrim dark energy model in the same gravity.</description>

      <title>Charged solution with equal metric ansatz in Gauss-Bonnet theory coupled to scalar field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the course of this research, we employ the Gauss-Bonnet equation of motion alongside the scalar field and potential to acquire a fresh solution for a spherically symmetrical charged black hole. Specifically, we derive this black hole solution by employing a metric potential where the components are equal, that is, $g_{tt}=g_{rr}$. In our research, we achieve several accomplishments, including fixing the characteristics of the scalar field, and the Gauss-Bonnet term. We thoroughly examine the physical properties associated with such black hole and show that we have supplementary terms when compared to the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole solution. These additional terms are of the order $O(\frac{1}{r^6})$ and $O(\frac{1}{r^9})$. The presence of these supplementary terms can be attributed to the impact of the scalar function denoted as $\xi$. Such expressions play a crucial role in generating the multi-horizon black hole solution. The presence of these extra terms facilitates the derivation of a modified first law of thermodynamics and the corresponding Smarr relation.</description>

      <title>Linear stability of a time-dependent, spherically symmetric background in beyond Horndeski theory and the speed of gravity waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address a dynamical, spherically symmetric background in beyond Horndeski theory and formulate a set of linear stability conditions for high energy perturbation modes about an arbitrary solution. In this general setting we derive speeds of propagation in both radial and angular directions for gravity waves and compare them with the speed of light in the case of minimally coupled photon. In particular, we find that the class of beyond Horndeski theories, which satisfy the equality of gravity waves' speed to the speed of light, feature gravity waves propagating at superluminal speeds about a time-dependent inhomogeneous background.</description>

      <title>Physical time for the beginning universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose that physical time is based on counting the oscillations of wave functions. The discrete counting of the ticks of these clocks does not depend on the metric frame. It remains well defined for the beginning epochs of the universe. The photon clock counts the oscillations of electromagnetic plane waves in the cosmic reference frame. It can be gauged with clocks for other massless or massive particles. These equivalent clocks form a clock system which defines a common universal continuous physical time. For the photon clock this physical time coincides with conformal time. The universe is eternal towards the past for typical models of inflationary cosmology -- the photon clock ticks an infinite number of times. We compare the photon clock system to geodesic physical time, which is a frame invariant generalization of proper time.</description>

      <title>Einstein's equations constrained by homogeneous and isotropic expansion: Initial value problems and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we put forth a general scheme for defining initial value problems from Einstein's equations of General Relativity constrained by homogeneous and isotropic expansion. The cosmological models arising as solutions are naturally interpreted as spatially homogeneous and isotropic on ``large scales". In order to show the well-posedness and applicability of such a scheme, we specialize in a class of spacetimes filled with the general homogeneous perfect fluid and inhomogeneous viscoelastic matter. We prove the existence, uniqueness, and relative stability of solutions, and an additional inequality for the energy density. As a consequence of our theorems, a new mechanism of energy transfer appears involving the different components of matter. A class of exact solutions is also obtained to exemplify the general results.</description>

      <title>Stability and quasinormal modes for black holes with time-dependent scalar hair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate black hole solutions with time-dependent (scalar) hair in scalar-tensor theories. Known exact solutions exist for such theories at the background level, where the metric takes on a standard GR form (e.g. Schwarzschild-de Sitter), but these solutions are generically plagued by instabilities. Recently, a new such solution was identified in arXiv:2310.11919, in which the time-dependent scalar background profile is qualitatively different from previous known exact solutions - specifically, the canonical kinetic term for the background scalar $X$ is not constant in this solution. We investigate the stability of this new solution by analysing odd parity perturbations, identifying a bound placed by stability and the resulting surviving parameter space. We extract the quasinormal mode spectrum predicted by the theory, finding a generic positive shift of quasinormal mode frequencies and damping times compared to GR. We forecast constraints on these shifts (and the single effective parameter $\hat\beta$ controlling them) from current and future gravitational wave experiments, finding constraints at up to the ${\cal O}(10^{-2})$ and ${\cal O}(10^{-6})$ level for LVK and LISA/TianQin, respectively. All calculations performed in this paper are reproducible via a companion Mathematica notebook.</description>

      <title>Relativistic model of anisotropic star with Bose-Einstein density depiction in $f(T)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a new model for anisotropic compact stars that are confined to physical dark matter in the background of $f(T)$ teleparallel gravity. The model is based on the equation of state (EoS) of the bag model type and the Bose-Einstein dark matter density profile. The derived solutions meet the energy conditions, the causality conditions, and the required conditions on the stability factor and adiabatic index, indicating that they are physically well-behaved and represent the physical and stable matter configuration. We also determine the maximum mass, surface redshift, and compactness parameter at the surface. Interestingly, all of these numbers fall within the specified range, supporting the physical viability of our proposal. Additionally, the various masses that are derived for varying the model parameter $k$ correspond to five compact, realistic compact objects, including LMC X-4, Her X-1, 4U 1538-52, SAX J1808.4-3658, and Cen X-3. We have also illustrated the radially symmetric profiles of energy density and the moment of inertia for non-rotating stars.</description>

      <title>Symmetric black-to-white hole solutions with a cosmological constan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a system with a Hamiltonian constraint, we demonstrate that its dynamics preserves invariant with respect to the choice of the lapse function, regardless of whether the Hamiltonian incorporates quantum corrections. Applying this observation to the interior of black-to-white holes, we analyze its dynamics with different choices of the lapse function. The results explicitly show that the leading-order expansion of both metrics in Refs. [1,2] and Refs. [3,4] exhibits identical behavior near the transition surface,therefore in this sense the black-to-white hole model proposed in Refs. [1,2] may be interpreted as a coarse-grained version of the solution within the framework of loop quantum gravity. The black-to-white hole solutions with exact symmetry between the black hole and white hole regions are constructed by appropriately fixing the quantum parameters in the effective theory of loop quantum gravity. This approach circumvents the issue of amplification of mass, which could arise from a mass difference between the black hole and white hole. Finally, the black-to-white hole solutions with a cosmological constant are constructed. The numerical solutions for the interior of black-to-white hole with a cosmological constant are obtained, and their symmetric behavior is also discussed.</description>

      <title>New edge modes and corner charges for first-order symmetries of 4D gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a set of noncommuting frame-translation symmetries in 4D gravity in tetrad-connection variables, which allow expressing diffeomorphisms as composite transformations. Working on the phase space level for finite regions, we pay close attention to the corner piece of the generators, discuss various possible charge brackets, relative definitions of the charges, coupling to spinors and relations to other charges. What emerges is a picture of the symmetries and edge modes of gravity that bears local resemblance to a Poincare group $SO(1,3)\ltimes \mathbb{R}^{1,3}$, but possesses structure functions. In particular, we argue that the symmetries and charges presented here are more amenable to discretisation, and sketch a strategy for this charge algebra, geared toward quantum gravity applications.</description>

      <title>Carroll black holes in (A)dS and their higher-derivative modifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define the Carrollian black holes corresponding to the limit of Schwarzschild-(A)dS spacetime and its higher-derivative counterpart known as Schwarzschild-Bach-(A)dS spacetime, which is also a static spherically symmetric vacuum solution of quadratic gravity. By analyzing motion of massive particles in these geometries, we found that: In the case of Schwarzschild-(A)dS, a (nearly) tangential particle from infinity will wind around the extremal surface with a finite number of windings depending on the impact parameter and the cosmological constant. In Schwarzschild-Bach-(A)dS, a particle passing close enough to the extremal surface will have an infinite number of windings; hence, it will not escape to asymptotic infinity as in Schwarzschild-(A)dS. We also calculate the thermodynamical quantities for such black holes and argue that it is analogous to an incompressible thermodynamical system with divergent entropy when the temperature goes to zero (in the strict Carroll limit). We then define a divergent specific heat that can be positive, negative, or zero.</description>

      <title>Slow-roll Hilltop Inflation in $f(\phi,T)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last four decades, a number of modified gravity theories have been proposed to study cosmological phenomena as they can provide solutions for some of the shortcomings of Einstein's gravity in explaining early and late time accelerations of the observed Universe, the existence of dark matter, singularities at center of Black holes etc. The theoretical and observational challenges faced by the $\Lambda$CDM model also point towards the necessity for looking beyond General Relativity. In this direction, recently $f(\phi, T)$ gravity has been proposed in literature where the non-minimal coupling of the scalar field $\phi$ with the trace of energy-momentum tensor $T$ has been introduced in the Einstein-Hilbert action. Considering the Hilltop potential, we have studied the slow-roll inflation in the framework of $f(\phi, T)$ gravity. It is found that Hilltop inflationary models in $f(\phi, T)$ gravity are viable when seen in the light of latest Planck data.</description>

      <title>Post-Newtonian observables for aligned-spin binaries to sixth order in spin from gravitational self-force and Compton amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of compact binaries is essential for gravitational-wave detection and parameter estimation, with spin being an important effect to include in waveform models. In this paper, we derive new post-Newtonian (PN) results for the conservative aligned-spin dynamics at next-to-next-to-leading order for the spin$^3$ and spin$^4$ contributions, in addition to the next-to-leading order (NLO) spin$^5$ and spin$^6$ contributions. One approach we follow is the Tutti Frutti method, which relates PN and gravitational self-force (GSF) results through the redshift and spin-precession invariants, by making use of the simple dependence of the scattering angle on the symmetric mass ratio. However, an ambiguity arises at the NLO spin$^5$ contribution, due to transcendental functions of the Kerr spin in the redshift; this is also the order at which Compton amplitudes calculations are affected by spurious poles. Therefore, we follow an additional approach to determine the NLO spin$^5$ and spin$^6$ dynamics: using on-shell Compton amplitudes obtained from black hole perturbation theory. The Compton amplitude used in this work is composed of the unambiguous tree-level far-zone part reported in [Phys. Rev. D 109, no.8, 084071 (2024)], as well as the full, non-interfering with the far-zone, $\ell=2$ partial wave contributions from the near zone, which are responsible for capturing Kerr finite-size effects. Other results in this paper include deriving the scattering angle of a spinning test body in a Kerr background from a parametrized worldline action, and computing the redshift and spin-precession invariants for eccentric orbits without an eccentricity expansion.</description>

      <title>Resonant excitation of eccentricity in spherical extreme-mass-ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational radiation reaction, has been one of the fundamental issues in general relativity. Over a span of decades, this process has been analyzed in the adiabatic limit, in order to comprehend how it drives extreme-mass-ratio binaries, that are prime targets for space-borne detectors. It has been shown that spherical orbits around Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes remain spherical (zero eccentricity) under the influence of gravitational radiation reaction. Here, we show that spherical orbits in non-Kerr black holes, that still preserve most of the good qualities and symmetries of Kerr spacetime, can access certain resonances in such a way that an initially spherical inspiral acquires non-zero eccentricity and becomes non-spherical. Therefore, the crossing of resonances under radiation reaction interrupts and even inverts, up to some small radius close to plunge, the process of circularization of orbits. The strength of resonant excitation of eccentricity depends on the initial position and inclination of the integrable extreme-mass-ratio system, as well as the integrability-breaking parameter introduced in the background spacetime that amplifies further the excitation. We find that the harmonics of gravitational waves emitted from these inspirals undergo a frequency modulation as the orbit `metamorphoses' from spherical to non-spherical, due to the effect of resonant eccentricity excitation. The gain that low-amplitude harmonics experience in these oligochromatic EMRIs, due to resonances, may be detectable with future spaceborne detectors and serves as an indicator of non-Kerrness of the background spacetime.</description>

      <title>Geometrically deformed charged anisotropic models in $f(Q,T)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we developed the geometrically deformed compact objects in the $f(Q, T)$ gravity theory under an electric field through gravitational decoupling via. minimal geometric deformation (MGD) technique for the first time. The decoupled field equations are solved via two different mimic approaches $\theta_0^0 = \rho$ and $\theta_1^1 = p_r$ through the Karmarkar condition. We conduct physical viability tests on our models and examine how decoupling parameters affect the physical qualities of objects. The obtained models are compared with the observational constraints for neutron stars PSR J1810+174, PSR J1959+2048, and PSR J2215+5135, including GW190814. Particularly, by modifying parameters $\alpha$ and $n$, we accomplish the occurrence of a "\textit{mass gap}" component. The resulting models exhibit stable, well-behaved mass profiles, regular behaviour, and no gravitational collapse, as verified by the Buchdahl--Andr\'{e}asson's limit. Furthermore, we provide a thorough physical analysis that is based on two parameters: $n$ ($f(Q,T)$--coupling parameter) and $\alpha$ (decoupling parameter). This work extends our current understanding of compact star configurations and sheds light on the behaviour of compact objects in the $f(Q,T)$ gravity.</description>

      <title>Landauer's principle and black hole area quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article assesses Landauer's principle from information theory in the context of area quantization of the Schwarzschild black hole. Within a quantum-mechanical perspective where Hawking evaporation can be interpreted in terms of transitions between the discrete states of the area (or mass) spectrum, we justify that Landauer's principle holds consistently with the bound saturating when the number of microstates of the black hole goes as $2^n$, where $n$ is a large positive integer labeling the levels of the area/mass spectrum in the semiclassical regime. This is equivalent to the area spacing $\Delta A = \alpha n l_P^2$ (in natural units), where $\alpha = 4 \ln 2$ for which the entropy spacing between consecutive levels in Boltzmann units coincides exactly with one bit of information. We also comment on the situation for other values of $\alpha$ prevalent in the literature.</description>

      <title>A speculative model for cyclic information preservation in Kerr-Newman spacetime using closed timelike curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a speculative model exploring the behavior of quantum information for particles entering closed timelike curves (CTCs) in Kerr-Newman spacetime. We apply Gavassino's restoration principle to derive a theoretical framework for cyclic information dynamics within these extreme gravitational environments. Our model focuses specifically on particles that enter CTCs near the inner horizon of a Kerr-Newman black hole, examining how such curves might affect quantum state evolution, entanglement preservation, and information retention.</description>

      <title>On the global Gaussian bending measure and its applications in stationary spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alternative gravity theories have been put forward to address the limitations of general relativity, each exhibiting differences, particularly in their strong-field limits. Nonetheless, there remains a lack of effective means to distinguish or test these theories through local strong-field measurements. In this work, we define a global Gaussian bending measure over singular spacetime regions, establish a corresponding global theory, and demonstrate its applications in a general stationary spacetime. The global theory is based on differential geometry, rather than on specific gravity theories, allowing it to depict various physics within general relativity and beyond. For example, it is applicable to describe the gravitational bending of massless or massive messengers, such as photons, neutrinos, cosmic rays, and possibly massive gravitational waves predicted in certain theories of gravity. Besides, the global theory can be applied to any stationary spacetime regions outside a rotating black hole. As an instance of its direct applications, we investigate the highly-curved spacetime effects of the black hole in its immediate surrounding regions and design local strong-field experiments involving different shapes of singular lensing patches. New means can be therefore anticipated to be developed according to the global theory to differentiate between different gravity theories and test them in their strong-field regions.</description>

      <title>Constraining gravitational wave velocities using gravitational and electromagnetic wave observations of white dwarf binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the general theory of relativity (GR) predicts that gravitational waves (GWs) have exactly the same propagation velocity as electromagnetic (EM) waves, many theories of gravity beyond GR expect otherwise. Accurate measurement of the difference in their propagation speed, or a tight constraint on it, could be crucial to validate or put limits on theories beyond GR. The proposed future space-borne GW detectors are poised to detect a substantial number of Galactic white dwarf binaries (GWDBs), which emit the GW as semi-monochromatic signals. Concurrently, these GWDBs can also be identified as optical variable sources. Here we proposed that allocating a GWDB's optical light curve and contemporaneous GW signal can be used to trace the difference between the velocity of GW and EM waves. Simulating GW and EM wave data from 14 verification binaries (VBs), our method constrains propagation-originated phase differences, limiting the discrepancy between the speed of light ($c$) and GW ($c_{GW}$). Through the utilization of LISA's design sensitivity and the current precision in optical observation on GWDB, our study reveals that a four-year observation of the 14 recognized VBs results in a joint constraint that confines $\Delta c/c$ ($\Delta c = c_{\mathrm{GW}} - c$) to the range of $-2.1\times10^{-12}$ and $4.8\times10^{-12}$. Additionally, by incorporating this constraint on $c_{\mathrm{GW}}$, we are able to establish boundaries for the mass of the graviton, limiting it to $m_{\mathrm{g}}\le3\times10^{-23}\,e\mathrm{V}/c^{2}$, and for the parameter associated with local Lorentz violation, $\bar{s}_{00}$, constrained within the range of $-3.4\times10^{-11}\le\bar{s}_{00}\le1.5\times10^{-11}$.</description>

      <title>Linear Stability of Schwarzschild-Anti-de Sitter spacetimes I: The system of gravitational perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the main paper of a series establishing the linear stability of Schwarzschild-Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes to gravitational perturbations. Specifically, we prove that solutions to the linearisation of the Einstein equations $\textrm{Ric}(g) = \Lambda g$ with $\Lambda&lt;0$ around a Schwarzschild-AdS metric arising from regular initial data and with standard Dirichlet-type boundary conditions imposed at the conformal boundary (inherited from fixing the conformal class of the non-linear metric) remain globally uniformly bounded on the black hole exterior and in fact decay inverse logarithmically in time to a linearised Kerr-AdS metric. The proof exploits a hierarchical structure of the equations of linearised gravity in double null gauge and crucially relies on boundedness and logarithmic decay results for the Teukolsky system, which are independent results proven in Part II of the series. Contrary to the asymptotically flat case, addition of a residual pure gauge solution to the original solution is not required to prove decay of all linearised null curvature and Ricci coefficients. One may however normalise the solution at the conformal boundary to be in standard AdS-form by adding such a pure gauge solution, which is constructed dynamically from the trace of the original solution at the conformal boundary and quantitatively controlled by initial data.</description>

Abstract: We prove boundedness and inverse logarithmic decay in time of solutions to the Teukolsky equations on Schwarzschild-Anti-de Sitter backgrounds with standard boundary conditions originating from fixing the conformal class of the non-linear metric on the boundary. The proofs rely on (1) a physical space transformation theory between the Teukolsky equations and the Regge-Wheeler equations on Schwarzschild-Anti de Sitter backgrounds and (2) novel energy and Carleman estimates handling the coupling of the two Teukolsky equations through the boundary conditions thereby generalising earlier work of \cite{Hol.Smu13} for the covariant wave equation. Specifically, we also produce purely physical space Carleman estimates.</description>

      <title>How cosmological expansion affects communication between distant quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum communication protocol between harmonic oscillator detectors, interacting with a quantum field, is developed in a cosmological expanding background. The aim is to see if the quantum effects arising in an expanding universe, such as the cosmological particle production, could facilitate the communication between two distant parts or if they provide an additive noisy effect. By considering a perfect cosmic fluid, the resulting expansion turns out to increase the classical capacity of the protocol. This increasing occurs for all the cosmological expansions unless the latter is sharpened just before the receiver's detector interacts with the field. Moreover, the classical capacity turns out to be sensible to the barotropic parameter $w$ of the perfect fluid and to the coupling between the field and the scalar curvature $\xi$. As a consequence, by performing this protocol, one can achieve information about the cosmological dynamics and its coupling with a background quantum field.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effect of adding an interaction in the $G_3$ term of Horndeski theory, where the propagation of gravitational waves are not modified. We derive the background and perturbation equations of motion from the action. We also derive the no-ghost and Laplacian instability conditions for tensor modes and scalar mode propagation. Then we study the evolution of the matter perturbation in the quasi-static approximation. We find that the gravitational couplings to the baryonic and cold dark matter over density are modified in this theory. We introduce a concrete model of the free function in the theory and study the background and linear perturbation dynamics. We then use the genetic algorithm to test the model. We compare the $H(z)$ function of the model and the $H(z)$ curve predicted by the genetic algorithm, using the $H(z)$ data. For the perturbation sector we compute the $f\sigma_{8}$ observable for the model and compare it with the predicted function from the genetic algorithm from the $f\sigma_{8}$ data.</description>

      <title>Probing the Effective Quantum Gravity via Quasinormal Modes and Shadows of Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two quantum-corrected black hole models have recently been proposed within the Hamiltonian constraints approach to quantum gravity, maintaining general covariance \cite{Zhang:2024khj}. We have studied the quasinormal spectra of these black holes using three methods: the higher-order WKB approach with Pad\'e approximants, time-domain integration, and the Frobenius method. The Frobenius method, in particular, allows us to determine precise values of the frequencies, including the overtones. The two models differ in their choice of quantum parameter $\xi$, and we can distinguish them by their quasinormal spectra. In the first model, increasing the quantum parameter results in higher real oscillation frequencies and damping rates of the fundamental mode. In contrast, the second model shows a decrease in the oscillation frequency of the least-damped mode when the quantum parameter is introduced. We have shown that, while the fundamental mode changes relatively gradually with the quantum parameter, the first few overtones deviate from their Schwarzschild limits at an increasing rate. This results in a qualitatively new behavior: the real parts of the frequencies of the first and higher overtones tend to zero as the quantum parameter increases. In addition to the branch of modes that are perturbative in the quantum parameter, we observe some non-perturbative modes at moderate values of the quantum parameter.
  Additionally, we have calculated the radii of the shadows cast by these black holes and discussed possible constraints based on observations of Sgt $A^*$.</description>

      <title>Generating variable $\hbar$ and $c$ via Fujii-Wetterich model in curved spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the Fujii-Wetterich model [Phys.Rev.D 26, 2580 (1982) and Nucl.Phys.B 302, 645 (1988)] which allows the Higgs doublet to couple with a "cosmon" scalar $\chi$ of the background spacetime as $\chi^2\,\Phi^2$. Upon the SSB of the $SU(2)$ gauge, the VEV of the Higgs doublet is proportional to the field $\chi$. Fujii and Wetterich employed this linkage to make particle masses dependent on $\chi$. We shall present an $\textit alternative$ mechanism: at a given point $x^*$, the prevailing Higgs VEV will be used to $\textit construct$ a quantum of action $\hbar_*$ and a speed of light $c_*$ in association with $\chi(x^*)$. Specifically, each open set vicinity of a given point $x^*$ on the manifold is equipped with a replica of the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam action operating with its own effective values of $\hbar_*$ and $c_*$, whereas particle masses induced via Higgs SSB remain independent of $\chi(x^*)$. Our mechanism unambiguously generates the dependencies $\hbar_*\propto\chi^{-1/2}(x^*)$ and $c_*\propto\chi^{1/2}(x^*)$, causing these "fundamental constants" to vary along with the dynamical field $\chi$ across the manifold. For late-time cosmology, a varying $c$ along the trajectory of light waves from distant supernovae towards Earth renders the classic Lema\^itre redshift formula $1+z=a^{-1}$ inapplicable. Using the dependency $c_*\propto\chi^{1/2}(x^*)$, we derive the new (variable-$c$) Lema\^itre redshift relation and apply it to analyze the Pantheon Catalog of SneIa $\textit without$ invoking the dark energy hypothesis. Key consequences are: (1) Accounting for the Pantheon Catalog with a fit exceeding the quality of the $\Lambda$CDM model; (2) Explaining the late-time cosmic acceleration based on variable $c$, eliminating the need for dark energy; (3) Revitalizing Blanchard-Douspis-Rowan-Robinson-Sarkar's CMB power spectrum analysis that bypassed dark energy [A&amp;A 412, 35 (2003)].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the nonlinear stability of the cosmological region of Kerr de Sitter spacetimes. More precisely, we show that solutions to the Einstein vacuum equations with positive cosmological constant arising from data on a cylinder that is uniformly close to the Kerr de Sitter geometry (with possibly different mass and angular momentum parameters at either end) are future geodesically complete and display asymptotically de Sitter-like degrees of freedom. The proof uses an ADM formulation of the Einstein equations in parabolic gauge. Together with a well-known theorem of Hintz-Vasy [Acta Math. 220 (2018)], our result yields a global stability result for Kerr de Sitter from Cauchy data on a spacelike hypersurface bridging two black hole exteriors.</description>

      <title>Thermal chaos of quantum-corrected-AdS black hole in the extended phase space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We briefly analyzed the equation of state and critical points of the quantum-corrected Schwarzschild-like black hole and used the Melnikov method to study its thermal chaotic behavior in the extended phase space of flat, closed, and open universes. The results show that the black hole's thermodynamic behavior is similar to that of the Van der Waals system. Although the critical ratios at the critical points differ among the three universes, they are all independent of the quantum correction parameter. For chaos, time perturbations will lead to chaotic behavior when their amplitude exceeds a critical value that depends on the quantum correction parameter and the radius of the dust sphere in the FRW model. Based on this, we found that the chaotic behavior of the black hole varies across different universes depending on the quantum correction parameter, but this parameter always makes chaos more likely. Using the value of the quantum correction parameter determined by Meissner, chaos is always more difficult to occur in an open universe compared to the other two types of universes. Which universe is most prone to chaos depends on the radius of the dust sphere. Finally, chaotic behavior is always present under spatial perturbations.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Dipole Moment in Braneworld Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the gravitational effects on the relativistic Dirac theory of a system such as a Hydrogen atom in the braneworld scenario. A gravitational dipole moment like contribution, arises in the nonrelativistic Hamiltonian of the system through an exact Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation. This term violates the equivalence principle for the weak interaction that is restored in the average over the spins. Furthermore, it feels the effects of the extra dimensions, so that in a Universe with two additional spatial dimensions its energy contribution is amplified by an order of $\sim 10^{16}\ \text{eV}$ concerning to the energy of this term for ordinary space. The compactification radius for a Universe with two extra dimensions is within the experimental limits, where deviations from the inverse square law are being tested. This suggests that the energy value for the gravitational dipole term in this scenario may lead us to search for traces of extra dimensions in atomic spectroscopy, as well as experimental constraints for these dimensions.</description>

      <title>Systematic bias due to mismodelling precessing binary black hole ringdown</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate waveform modelling is crucial for parameter estimation in gravitational wave astronomy, impacting our understanding of source properties and the testing of general relativity. The precession of orbital and spin angular momenta in binary black hole (BBH) systems with misaligned spins presents a complex challenge for gravitational waveform modelling. Current precessing BBH waveform models employ a co-precessing frame, which precesses along with the binary. In this paper, we investigate a source of bias stemming from the mismodelling of ringdown frequency in the co-precessing frame. We find that this mismodelling of the co-precessing frame ringdown frequency introduces systematic biases in parameter estimation, for high mass systems in particular, and in the Inspiral-Merger-Ringdown (IMR)-consistency test of general relativity. Employing the waveform model IMRPhenomXPHM, we conduct an IMR-consistency test using a Fisher matrix analysis across parameter space, as well as full injected signal parameter estimation studies. Our results show that this mismodelling particularly affects BBH systems with high mass ratios, high spin magnitudes, and highly inclined spins. These findings suggest inconsistencies for all waveform models which do not address this issue.</description>

      <title>Magnets are Weber Bar Gravitational Wave Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When a gravitational wave (GW) passes through a DC magnetic field, it couples to the conducting wires carrying the currents which generate the magnetic field, causing them to oscillate at the GW frequency. The oscillating currents then generate an AC component through which the GW can be detected - thus forming a resonant mass detector or a Magnetic Weber Bar. We quantify this claim and demonstrate that magnets can have exceptional sensitivity to GWs over a frequency range demarcated by the mechanical and electromagnetic resonant frequencies of the system; indeed, we outline why a magnetic readout strategy can be considered an optimal Weber bar design. The concept is applicable to a broad class of magnets, but can be particularly well exploited by the powerful magnets being deployed in search of axion dark matter, for example by DMRadio and ADMX-EFR. Explicitly, we demonstrate that the MRI magnet that is being deployed for ADMX-EFR can achieve a broadband GW strain sensitivity of $\sim$$10^{-20}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ from a few kHz to about 10 MHz, with a peak sensitivity down to $\sim$$10^{-22}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ at a kHz exploiting a mechanical resonance.</description>

      <title>An Infrared On-Shell Action and its Implications for Soft Charge Fluctuations in Asymptotically Flat Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the infrared on-shell action of Einstein gravity in asymptotically flat spacetimes, obtaining an effective, gauge-invariant boundary action for memory and shockwave spacetimes. We show that the phase space is in both cases parameterized by the leading soft variables in asymptotically flat spacetimes, thereby extending the equivalence between shockwave and soft commutators to spacetimes with non-vanishing Bondi mass. We then demonstrate that our on-shell action is equal to three quantities studied separately in the literature: $(i)$ the soft supertranslation charge; $(ii)$ the shockwave effective action, or equivalently the modular Hamiltonian; and $(iii)$ the soft effective action. Finally, we compute the quantum fluctuations in the soft supertranslation charge and, assuming the supertranslation parameter may be promoted to an operator, we obtain an area law, consistent with earlier results showing that the modular Hamiltonian has such fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-Wave and Gravitational-Wave Memory Signatures of Core-Collapse Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we calculate the energy, signal-to-noise ratio, detection range, and angular anisotropy of the matter, matter memory, and neutrino memory gravitational wave (GW) signatures of 21 three-dimensional initially non-rotating core-collapse supernova (CCSN) models carried to late times. We find that inferred energy, signal-to-noise ratio, and detection range are angle-dependent quantities, and that the spread of possible energy, signal-to-noise, and detection ranges across all viewing angles generally increases with progenitor mass. When examining the low-frequency matter memory and neutrino memory components of the signal, we find that the neutrino memory is the most detectable component of a CCSN GW signal, and that DECIGO is best-equipped to detect both matter memory and neutrino memory. Moreover, we find that the polarization angle between the $h_+$ and $h_{\times}$ strains serves as a unique identifier of matter and neutrino memory. Finally, we develop a galactic density- and stellar mass-weighted formalism to calculate the rate at which we can expect to detect CCSN GW signals with Advanced LIGO. When considering only the matter component of the signal, the aLIGO detection rate is around 65$\%$ of the total galactic supernova rate, but increases to 90$\%$ when incorporating the neutrino memory component. We find that all future detectors (ET, CE, DECIGO) will be able to detect CCSN GW signals from the entire galaxy, and for the higher-mass progenitors even into the local group of galaxies.</description>

      <title>Methodological notes on the gauge invariance in the treatment of waves and oscillations in plasmas $via$ the Einstein-Vlasov-Maxwell system: Fundamental equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of gauge transformations in linearized gravitation is investigated. After a brief discussion of the fundamentals of the kinetic theory in curved spacetime, the Einstein-Vlasov-Maxwell system of equations in terms of gauge invariant quantities is established without neglecting the equations of motion associated with the dynamics of the non-radiative components of the metric tensor. The established theory is applied to a non-collisional electron-positron plasma, leading to a dispersion relation for gravitational waves in this model system. The problem of Landau damping is addressed and some attention is given to the issue of the energy exchanges between the plasma and the gravitational wave. In a future paper, a more complete set of approximate dispersion relations for waves and oscillations in plasmas will be presented, including the dynamics of non-radiative components of the metric tensor, with special attention to the problems of the Landau damping and of the energy exchanges between matter, the electromagnetic field and the gravitational field.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we compute the partition functions of $\mathcal{N}=1$ SUGRA for different boundary topologies, i.e. sphere and torus, using super-Virasoro TQFT. We use fusion and modular kernels of the super-Liouville theory to compute the necklace-channel conformal block and showcase formalism by proving that the inner product holds for superconformal blocks, defined as states in the Hilbert space. Finally, we compute the out-of-time-order correlator for the torus topology with superconformal primary insertions as matter using the tools of super-Virasoro TQFT and investigate its early-time behaviour.</description>

      <title>Discriminating among cosmological models by data-driven methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explores the Pantheon+SH0ES dataset to identify patterns that can discriminate between different cosmological models. We focus on determining whether the behaviour of dark energy is consistent with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model or suggests novel cosmological features. The central goal is to evaluate the robustness of the $\Lambda$CDM model compared with other dark energy models, and to investigate whether there are deviations that might indicate new cosmological insights. The study takes into account a data-driven approach, using both traditional statistical methods and machine learning techniques. Initially, we evaluate six different dark energy models using traditional statistical methods like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), Static and Dynamic Nested Sampling to infer the cosmological parameters. Subsequently, we adopt a machine learning approach, developing a regression model to compute the distance modulus of each supernova, expanding the feature set to 74 statistical features. Traditional statistical analysis confirms that the $\Lambda$CDM model is robust, yielding expected parameter values. Other models show deviations, with the Generalised and Modified Chaplygin Gas models performing poorly. In the machine learning analysis, feature selection techniques, particularly Boruta, significantly improve model performance. In particular, models initially considered weak (Generalised/Modified Chaplygin Gas) show significant improvement after feature selection. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of a data-driven approach to cosmological model evaluation. The $\Lambda$CDM model remains robust, while machine learning techniques, in particular feature selection, reveal potential improvements in alternative models which could be relevant for new observational campaigns like the recent DESI survey.</description>

Abstract: A magnetically levitated mass couples to gravity and can act as an effective gravitational wave detector. We show that a superconducting sphere levitated in a quadrupolar magnetic field, when excited by a gravitational wave, will produce magnetic field fluctuations that can be read out using a flux tunable microwave resonator. With a readout operating at the standard quantum limit, such a system could achieve broadband strain noise sensitivity of $h \lesssim 10^{-19}/\sqrt{\rm Hz}$ for frequencies of $10~\mathrm{kHz}~-~1~\mathrm{MHz}$, opening new corridors for astrophysical probes of new physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the linear cosmological perturbations in the context of the so-called energy-momentum squared gravity (EMSG) theory. Recent researches show that the EMSG theory can reproduce viable background cosmological evolution comparable to $\Lambda$CDM, while the matter-dominated era exhibits slight distinctions. In this paper, we mainly focus on the power-law EMSG models and derive the equations for the linear cosmological perturbations. We explore the propagation of the gravitational wave (GW) and the growth of matter density perturbation at the first order, and estimate the model parameters from the simulated GW data and the observed redshift space distortion data. Our analysis reveals that the model parameters should be small and positive in $1\sigma$ confidence interval, which indicates that the theory is in good agreement with the observational data and can be regarded as an alternative for the standard cosmological model.</description>

      <title>Chromo-natural inflation supported by enhanced friction from Horndeski gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the extension of the chromo-natural inflation model by incorporating nonminimal coupling between the axion field and gravity. Nonminimal coupling is introduced so that it enhances friction in the axion's equation of motion and thus supports slow-roll inflation. This enhanced friction effectively delays the activation of the gauge field, thereby preventing the overproduction of gravitational waves in the CMB scale. We extend previous results by describing the nonminimal coupling in a general and unifying way utilizing Horndeski gravity. This allows us to explore systematically and comprehensively possible enhanced friction models of chromo-natural inflation consistent with observations. We find a novel enhanced friction model that shows better agreement (within 1$\sigma$) with CMB measurements than the previous nonminimally coupled chromo-natural inflation model. The gravitational-wave spectrum starts to rise at some wavenumber due to retarded activation of the gauge field in the late stage of inflation. We show how one can identify the wavenumber at which this occurs based on the background evolution and present a universal analytic formula for the gravitational-wave spectrum that can be used for any enhanced friction model of chromo-natural inflation.</description>

Abstract: In this review, a pedagogical introduction to the concepts of slow-roll inflationary Universe and number of $e$-folds is provided. In particular, the differences between the basic notion of number of $e$-folds ($N_e$), total number of $e$-folds ($N_T$) and number of $e$-folds before the end of inflation ($N$), are outlined. The proper application of the number of $e$-folds before the end of inflation is discussed both as a time-like variable for the scalar field evolution and as a key parameter for computing inflationary predictions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the cosmology and astrophysics of axion-like particles (ALPs) with CP-violating Yukawa couplings to nucleons. At finite nucleon density, the ALP's dynamics is governed by an effective potential which is the sum of the bare periodic potential and a linear potential whose strength depends on the nucleon density. We identify a critical nucleon density $\rho_c$ controlling the dynamics. At densities smaller than $\rho_c$ the effective potential is a tilted sinusoidal curve and the field is displaced from its zero-density minimum. At densities larger than $\rho_c$ the minima (and maxima) are absent, and the ALP is destabilized. Astrophysically, this implies that neutron stars can source a radial ALP field, providing a complementary probe to equivalence principle tests. Cosmologically, the ALP may have been destabilized in the early Universe and could have made large field excursions. We discuss model-building applications of our results for such early universe scenarios.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Emission from Cosmic String Loops, II: Local Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using lattice field simulations of the Abelian-Higgs model, we characterize the simultaneous emission of (scalar and gauge) particles and gravitational waves (GWs) by local string loops. We use {\it network} loops created in a phase transition, and {\it artificial} loops formed by either crossing straight-boosted or curved-static infinite strings. Loops decay via both particle and GW emission, on time scales $\Delta t_{\rm dec} \propto L^p$, where $L$ is the loop length. For particle production, we find $p \simeq 2$ for artificial loops and $p \lesssim 1$ for network loops, whilst for GW emission, we find $p \simeq 1$ for all loops. We find that below a critical length, artificial loops decay primarily through particle production, whilst for larger loops GW emission dominates. However, for network loops, which represent more realistic configurations, particle emission always dominates, as supported by our data with length-to-core ratios up to $L/r_\text{c} \lesssim 3500$. Our results indicate that the GW background from a local string network should be greatly suppressed compared to estimations that ignore particle emission.</description>

      <title>Non-parametric late-time expansion history reconstruction and implications for the Hubble tension in light of DESI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We non-parametrically reconstruct the late-time expansion history in light of the latest Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements from DESI combined with various Type Ia Supernovae (SNeIa) catalogs, using interpolation through piece-wise natural cubic splines, and a reconstruction procedure based on Gaussian Processes (GPs). Applied to DESI BAO and PantheonPlus SNeIa data, both methods indicate that deviations from a reference $\Lambda$CDM model in the $z \lesssim 2$ unnormalized expansion rate $E(z)$ are constrained to be $\lesssim 10\%$, but also consistently identify two features in $E(z)$: a bump at $z \sim 0.5$, and a depression at $z \sim 0.9$, which cannot be simultaneously captured by a $w_0w_a$CDM fit. These features, which are stable against assumptions regarding spatial curvature, interpolation knots, and GP kernel, disappear if one adopts the older SDSS BAO measurements in place of DESI, and decrease in significance when replacing the PantheonPlus catalog with the Union3 and DESY5 ones. We infer $c/(r_dH_0)=29.90 \pm 0.33$ (with $r_d$ the sound horizon at baryon drag), which slightly reduces the Hubble tension and makes room for a more important role of late-time new physics in this context, albeit still remaining a sub-dominant part of the solution. If substantiated in forthcoming data releases, our results tentatively point to oscillatory/non-monotonic features in the shape of the expansion rate at $z \lesssim 2$, of potential interest for dark energy model-building.</description>

      <title>A direct method for reproducing fully relativistic spectra from standard accretion disks by modifying their inner boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General relativistic effects are strong near the black hole of an X-ray binary and significantly impact the total energy released at the innermost accretion disk's region. Our goal is to fully incorporate the black hole's spin and all the general relativistic effects on the observed spectra coming from X-ray binary systems while maintaining the simplicity of the standard disk model. That is possible by appropriately shifting only the disk's inner radius. We employ some of the most efficient pseudo-Newtonian potentials around Kerr black holes and derive two generalized disk temperature profiles, thus incorporating the spin's contribution to the thermal spectra. Then, we associate the observed radiative efficiency with the emission pattern featuring all the relativistic effects included in the kerrbb model, obtaining an expression about the modified inner radius of the disk. Moreover, we apply this method to Cygnus X-1 by fitting the observational data obtained during its high/soft and hard/low spectral states. The fully relativistic spectra are reproduced to a very good approximation with an error margin of 0.03-4%. The disk is parameterized by a modified innermost radius within the range of $(0.2-2)R_{ISCO}$, depending on the source's viewing angle and black hole spin. Relativistic effects near the black hole make an otherwise standard accretion disk with inclination $\theta &lt;60^{\circ}$ seem truncated to larger radii to a distant observer. On the other hand, an edge-on view of the disk gives the perspective of being pulled closer to the central object than the respective ISCO radius. In addition, we show that the observational data of Cygnus X-1 can be satisfactorily fitted by employing a reasonably simple lepto-hadronic jet model and a hybrid thermal/non-thermal corona along with the Kerr-adjusted standard accretion disk.</description>

      <title>Accelerated signal-to-noise ratio interpolation across the gravitational-wave signal manifold powered by artificial neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matched-filter based gravitational-wave search pipelines identify candidate events within seconds of their arrival on Earth, offering a chance to guide electromagnetic follow-up and observe multi-messenger events. Understanding the detectors' response to an astrophysical signal across the searched signal manifold is paramount to inferring the parameters of the progenitor and deciding which candidates warrant telescope time. In this paper, we use artificial neural networks to accelerate and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) computation for sufficiently local patches of the signal manifold. Our machine-learning based model generates a single waveform (or equivalently, computes a single SNR timeseries) in 6 milliseconds on a CPU and 0.4 milliseconds on a GPU. When we use the GPU to generate batches of waveforms simultaneously, we find that we can produce $10^4$ waveforms in $\lesssim 1$ ms on a GPU. This is achieved while remaining faithful, on average, to 1 part in $10^4$ (1 part in $10^5$) for binary black hole (binary neutron star) waveforms. The model we present is designed to directly utilize intermediate detection pipeline outputs, and is a step towards ultra-low-latency parameter estimation within search pipelines.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the coincidence between gravitational waves and fast radio bursts from neutron star--black hole mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are mysterious astrophysical transients whose origin and mechanism remain unclear. Compact object mergers may be a promising channel to produce some FRBs. Neutron star-black hole (NSBH) mergers could produce FRBs through mechanisms involving neutron star tidal disruption or magnetospheric disturbances. This could present an opportunity for multi-messenger gravitational-wave observations, providing new insight into the nature of FRBs and nuclear matter. However, some of the gravitational-wave signals may be marginal detections with signal-to-noise ratios &lt; 8 or have large sky location and distance uncertainties, making it less straightforward to confidently associate an FRB with the gravitational-wave signal. One must therefore take care to avoid a false positive association. We demonstrate how to do this with simulated data. We calculate the posterior odds -- a measurement of our relative belief for a common versus unrelated origin of a coincident NSBH and FRB. We find that a coincident FRB+NSBH from a common source can yield a statistically significant posterior odds in a network with at least two observatories, but only if we require a coincidence in time and and sky location, rather than time alone. However, we find that for our model, we require a network signal-to-noise ratio greater than 10 to be confident in the common-source detection, when using a threshold of ln odds &gt; 8. We suggest that a coincident NSBH+FRB detection could help distinguish between FRB engines by discriminating between disrupting and non-disrupting models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent outcomes by the DESI Collaboration have shed light on a possible slightly evolving dark energy, challenging the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. To better understand dark energy nature, high-redshift observations like gamma-ray burst data become essential for mapping the universe expansion history, provided they are calibrated with other probes. To this aim, we calibrate the $E_p-E_{iso}$ (or Amati) correlation through model-independent B\'ezier interpolations of the updated Hubble rate and the novel DESI data sets. More precisely, we provide two B\'ezier calibrations: i) handling the entire DESI sample, and ii) excluding the point at $z_{eff}=0.51$, criticized by the recent literature. In both the two options, we let the comoving sound horizon at the drag epoch, $r_d$, vary in the range $r_d \in [138, 156]$ Mpc. The Planck value is also explored for comparison. By means of the so-calibrated gamma-ray bursts, we thus constrain three dark energy frameworks, namely the standard $\Lambda$CDM, the $\omega_0$CDM and the $\omega_0\omega_1$CDM models, in both spatially flat and non-flat universes. To do so, we worked out Monte Carlo Markov chain analyses, making use of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Further, we adopt model selection criteria to check the statistically preferred cosmological model finding a preference towards the concordance paradigm only whether the spatial curvature is zero. Conversely, and quite interestingly, the flat $\omega_0$CDM and both the cases, flat/non-flat, $\omega_0\omega_1$CDM model, leave evidently open the chance that dark energy evolves at higher redshifts.</description>

      <title>AC Currents from Gravitational Waves in Plasma Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that gravitational waves can induce electromagnetic perturbations in magnetised plasmas, with production occurring via the direct coupling of gravitational waves to the background magnetic field: this is the so-called Gertsenshtein effect. In this short work, we consider the direct gravitational perturbations of charge carriers via their minimal coupling to gravity in a collisionless plasma. We find that for isotropic plasmas, no secondary plasma perturbations are generated. However, when an anisotropy is introduced in the form of a background plasma current, we find that gravitational waves can induce a secondary current. For a constant DC background current, the secondary current inherits the AC frequency of the gravitational waves. It will certainly be interesting to investigate this effect in astrophysical plasmas in future work as well as its wider phenomenological consequences.</description>

      <title>Plane wave limits of Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Utilizing the covariant formulation of Penrose's plane wave limit by Blau et al., we construct for any Riemannian metric $g$ a family of "plane wave limits" of one higher dimension. These limits are taken along geodesics of $g$, yield simpler metrics of Lorentzian signature, and are isometric invariants. They can also be seen to arise locally from a suitable expansion of $g$ in Fermi coordinates, and they directly encode much of $g$'s geometry. For example, normal Jacobi fields of $g$ are encoded as geodesics of its plane wave limits. Furthermore, $g$ will have constant sectional curvature if and only if each of its plane wave limits is locally conformally flat. In fact $g$ will be flat, or Ricci-flat, or geodesically complete, if and only if all of its plane wave limits are, respectively, the same. Many other curvature properties are preserved in the limit, including certain inequalities, such as signed Ricci curvature.</description>

      <title>The Kontsevich-Segal Criterion in the No-Boundary State Constrains Anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the Kontsevich-Segal-Witten (KSW) criterion applied to the no-boundary state constrains anisotropic deformations of de Sitter space. We consider squashed $S^3$ and $S^1 \times S^2$ boundaries and find that in both models, the KSW criterion excludes a significant range of homogeneous but anisotropic configurations. For squashed $S^3$ boundaries, the excluded range includes all surface geometries with negative scalar curvature, in line with dS/CFT reasoning. For $S^1 \times S^2$ boundaries, we find that KSW selects the low-temperature regime of configuration space where the $S^1$ is sufficiently large compared to the $S^2$. In both models, the KSW criterion renders the semiclassical wave function normalizable, up to one-loop effects.</description>

      <title>Gravitation: from Newton to Einstein</title>

      <description>arXiv:1902.07287v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This document gathers the notes of a 30-hour review course on gravitation, which I delivered in January 2018 and January 2019 at the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences of Cameroon (AIMS-Cameroon). Its main goal is to propose a big picture of gravitation, where Einstein's relativity arises as a natural increment to Newton's theory. It is designed for bachelor/master students who do not necessarily have prior knowledge about relativity. The students are nevertheless expected to be familiar with the fundamentals of Newton's mechanics and gravitation, for the first chapter to be a mere reformulation of known concepts. The second chapter then introduces special and general relativity at the same time, while the third chapter explores concrete manifestations of relativistic gravitation, notably gravitational waves and black holes. Each section corresponds, on average, to slightly more than a 2-hour black-board lecture. The numerous exercises must be considered part of the course itself; they are intended to stimulate active reading.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.04552v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate both the null energy condition (NEC) violating scenario and the $c_T$-diminishing scenario for generating enhanced power spectrum of primordial gravitational waves (GWs) during inflation, where $c_T$ is the propagating speed of primordial GWs. Both of these two scenarios can be realized stably with theories beyond Horndeski, hence can be uniformly implemented within the framework of the effective field theory. We calculate the power spectrum of primordial GWs by assuming that the inflationary Universe undergoes three phases, where the violation of NEC or the diminishment of $c_T$ occurs in the intermediate phase. A template of the spectrum is given for the NEC-violating scenario. We also discuss the underlying relation and discrepancy between these two scenarios with a disformal transformation.</description>

Abstract: We consider a formulation of the Brans-Dicke theory in Jordan's frame for Bianchi-I spacetime within the framework of loop quantum gravity. The robustness of singularity resolutions due to the quantum effects is explicitly verified in the context of two quantization schemes typically used in the literature. We present an exploration of the effects of quantum geometry on the background dynamics, which is also illustrated through some explicit numerical examples and showing the absence of the singularity.</description>

Abstract: We generalize the notion of Einstein-Rosen bridge by defining it as a space-like connection between two universes with regions of asymptotically minkowskian space-time infinities. The corresponding symmetry and asymmetry properties of the generalized Einstein-Rosen bridge are considered at the cases of Reissner-Nordstr\"om and Kerr metrics. We elucidate the versatility of intriguing symmetry and asymmetry phenomena outside and inside black holes. For description of the test particle (planet and photon) motion it is used the Kerr-Newman metric of the rotating and electrically charged black hole. In particular, it is demonstrated the symmetry and asymmetry of the one-way Einstein-Rosen bridge inside black hole toward and through the plethora of endless and infinite universes.</description>

      <title>Shadow of Kerr black hole surrounded by a cloud of strings in Rastall gravity and constraints from M87*</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the first image of a black hole captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), there has been a surge of research using observations of black hole shadows to test theories of gravity. In this paper, we carry out a study related to the shadow of Kerr black holes surrounded by a cloud of strings in Rastall gravity, which deviates from the Kerr black hole due to the presence of the string parameter $a_0$ and the parameter $\beta$. The horizons, ergospheres, and photon region of the black hole are shown. Moreover, we explore the shadow and observations of the black hole, which are closely linked to the parameters $a_0$ and $\beta$. By treating \text{M87*} as a Kerr black hole surrounded by a cloud of strings under Rastall gravity, we constrain the black hole parameters using the EHT observations. For a given $\beta$, the circularity deviation of the black hole obeys $\Delta C\lesssim0.1$ in all regions. The angular diameter $\theta_{d}=42\pm3\mu as$ provides the upper bound of parameters $a$ and $a_0$ for fixed $\beta$. The shadow axis ratio satisfies the observation data of EHT ($1&lt;D_x\lesssim4/3$) in the whole space for a given $\beta$. These results are consistent with the public information from EHT. In other words, candidates for real astrophysical black holes can be Kerr black holes surrounded by a cloud of strings in Rastall gravity.</description>

      <title>Quantum loop corrections in the modified gravity model of Starobinsky inflation with primordial black hole production</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02934v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A modified gravity model of Starobinsky inflation and primordial black hole production was proposed in good (within $1\sigma$) agreement with current measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation. The model is an extension of the singularity-free Appleby-Battye-Starobinsky model by the $R^4$-term with different values of the parameters whose fine-tuning leads to efficient production of primordial black holes on smaller scales with the asteroid-size masses between $10^{16}$ g and $10^{20}$ g. Those primordial black holes may be part (or the whole) of the current dark matter, while the proposed model can be confirmed or falsified by detection or absence of the induced gravitational waves with the frequencies about $10^{-2}$ Hz. The main purpose of this paper was to estimate the size of quantum (loop) corrections in the model. It was found their relative contribution to the power spectrum of scalar perturbations is about $10^{-3}$ or less, so that the model is not ruled out by the quantum corrections.</description>

Abstract: It has been suggested that the effects of renormalization significantly reduce the amplitude of the inflationary spectra at scales measurable in the cosmic microwave background. Via a gauge-invariant analysis, we compute the renormalized scalar and tensor power spectra and follow their evolution in an inflating universe that undergoes a transition to an FRW phase with a growing horizon. For perturbations originating from Minkowski vacuum fluctuations, we show that the standard prediction for the spectra on superhorizon scales is a late-time attractor, while they are UV finite at all times. Our result is independent of the equation of state after inflation, showing that the standard prediction is fully robust.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study black hole (BH) solutions in extended Einstein-Maxwell-scalar theories, which are classified in a subclass of the $U(1)$ gauge-invariant scalar-vector-tensor theories. The scalar field is coupled to the vector field, which has electric and magnetic charges. For the static and spherically symmetric spacetime, we investigate modifications to the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m solutions focusing on the three types of scalar-vector interactions, including derivative couplings. We solve the field equations analytically in two asymptotic regions which are the vicinity of the BH horizon and the spatial infinity, and clarify the condition for the existence of scalar hair. To understand the behaviors of solutions in intermediate scales, the field equations are integrated numerically for concrete models with different types of couplings. We find new hairy BH solutions with scalar hair in the presence of magnetic charge and kinetic coupling. The magnetic charge plays an important role in distinguishing hairy BH solutions originated from three types of different interactions at a large coupling limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spectral amplitude of the merger-ringdown gravitational wave (GW) emitted by a comparable mass-ratio black hole merger is modeled by the greybody factor of the remnant black hole. We also include the post-Newtonian correction to the greybody factor model. Our model includes only a few fitting parameters, which could evade the overfitting issue. We perform the mass-spin inference from the SXS data without tuning the data range of each SXS waveform. Also, we find that the exponential damping in the ringdown spectral amplitude can be modeled well with the exponential damping in the greybody factor at high frequencies. Our findings could be consistent with a conjecture that the light ring of the remnant black hole, which sources the ringdown, forms as early as during the merger stage. We discuss the formation of the light ring in the static binary solution as a first step towards the understanding of how the separation of merging black holes may affect the formation of the light ring.</description>

      <title>Fast marginalization algorithm for optimizing gravitational wave detection, parameter estimation and sky localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an algorithm to marginalize the likelihood for a gravitational wave signal from a quasi-circular binary merger over its extrinsic parameters, accounting for the effects of higher harmonics and spin-induced precession. The algorithm takes as input the matched-filtering time series of individual waveform harmonics against the data in all operational detectors, and the covariances of the harmonics. The outputs are the Gaussian likelihood marginalized over extrinsic parameters describing the merger time, location and orientation, along with samples from the conditional posterior of these parameters. Our algorithm exploits the waveform's known analytical dependence on extrinsic parameters to efficiently marginalize over them using a single waveform evaluation. Our current implementation achieves a 10% precision on the marginalized likelihood within $\approx 50$ ms on a single CPU core and is publicly available through the package `cogwheel`. We discuss applications of this tool for gravitational wave searches involving higher modes or precession, efficient and robust parameter estimation, and generation of sky localization maps in low latency for electromagnetic followup of gravitational-wave alerts. The inclusion of higher modes can improve the distance measurement, providing an advantage over existing low-latency localization methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze a model for Dark Energy - Dark Matter interaction, based on a decaying process of the former into the latter. The dynamical equations are constructed following a kinetic formulation, which separates the interacting fluctuations from an equilibrium distribution of both species. The emerging dynamical picture consists of coupled equations, which are specialized in the case of a Dark Energy equation of state parameter; we deal with a modified Lambda Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model, which is investigated versus a possible interpretation of the Hubble tension. Using an optimized set of the model's free parameters, it can be shown that the obtained Hubble parameter can, in principle, address the tension. We then use the most recent datasets from late Universe sources and compressed information from the Cosmic Microwave Background data to constrain the free parameters and compare the addressed scenario to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. The study outlines how our proposal is preferred by the data in all cases, based on fit quality, while also alleviating the tension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study some of the properties of the $G \to 0$ limit of the Kerr-Newman solution of Einstein-Maxwell equations. Noting Carter's observation of the near equality between the $g = 2$ gyromagnetic ratio in the Kerr-Newman solution and that of the electron, we discuss additional such coincidences relating to the Kerr-Newman multipoles and properties of the electron. In contrast to the Coulomb field, this spinning Maxwell field has a finite Lagrangian. Moreover, by evaluating the Lagrangian for the superposition of two such Kerr-Newman electromagnetic fields on a flat background, we are able to find their interaction potential. This yields a correction to the Coulomb interaction due to the spin of the field.</description>

Abstract: We provide general relativistic treatment of the single-component field described by Dirac's positive-energy wave equation of 1971. It is motivated by Bogomolny's proposal to regard that field as a possible candidate for dark matter. Our emphasis is on standard (flat) Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmology. The early universe is not considered, though there is a strong indication that the field may play a role in internally driven generation of cosmic anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Relational dynamics and Page-Wootters formalism in group field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Group field theory posits that spacetime is emergent and is hence defined without any background notion of space or time; dynamical questions are formulated in relational terms, in particular using (scalar) matter degrees of freedom as time. Unlike in canonical quantisation of gravitational systems, there is no obvious notion of coordinate transformations or constraints, and established quantisation methods cannot be directly applied. As a result, different canonical formalisms for group field theory have been discussed in the literature. We address these issues using a parametrised version of group field theory, in which all (geometry and matter) degrees of freedom evolve in a fiducial parameter. There is a constraint associated to the freedom of reparametrisation and the Dirac quantisation programme can be implemented. Using the "trinity of relational dynamics", we show that the resulting "clock-neutral" theory is entirely equivalent to a deparametrised canonical group field theory, interpreted in terms of the Page-Wootters formalism. Our results not only show that the deparametrised quantisation is fully covariant and can be seen as encoding the dynamics of joint quantum matter and geometry degrees of freedom, they also appear to be the first application of the Page-Wootters formalism directly to non-perturbative quantum gravity. We show extensions to a setting in which many independent gauge symmetries are introduced, which connects to the "multi-fingered time" idea in quantum gravity and provides a somewhat novel extension of the Page-Wootters formalism.</description>

      <title>Spectral Variance in a Stochastic Gravitational-Wave Background From a Binary Population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06270v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A population of compact object binaries emitting gravitational waves that are not individually resolvable will form a stochastic gravitational wave signal. While the expected spectrum over population realizations is well known from Phinney (2001), its higher order moments have not been fully studied before or computed in the case of arbitrary binary evolution. We calculate analytic scaling relationships as a function of gravitational-wave frequency for the statistical variance, skewness, and kurtosis of a stochastic gravitational-wave signal over population realizations due to finite source effects. If the time derivative of the binary orbital frequency can be expressed as a power-law in frequency, we find that these moment quantities also take the form of power-law relationships. We also develop a numerical population synthesis framework against which we compare our analytic results, finding excellent agreement. These new scaling relationships provide physical context to understanding spectral fluctuations in a gravitational-wave background signal and may provide additional information that can aid in explaining the origin of the nanohertz-frequency signal observed by pulsar timing array campaigns.</description>

      <title>On the stability of electrovacuum space-times in scalar-tensor gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the behavior of static, spherically symmetric solutions to the field equations of the scalar-tensor theories (STT) of gravity belonging to the Bergmann-Wagoner-Nordtvedt class, in the presence of an electric and/or magnetic charge. The study is restricted to canonical (nonphantom) versions of the theories and scalar fields without a self-interaction potential. Only radial (monopole) perturbations are considered as the most likely ones to cause an instability. The static background solutions contain naked singularities, but we formulate the boundary conditions in such a way that would preserve their meaning if a singularity is smoothed, for example, due to quantum gravity effects. Since the solutions of all STT under study are related by conformal transformations, the stability problem for all of them reduces to the same wave equation, but the boundary conditions for perturbations (and sometimes the boundaries themselves) are different in different STT, which affects the stability results. The stability or instability conclusions are obtained for different branches of the solutions in the Brans-Dicke, Barker and Schwinger STT as well as for nonminimally coupled scalar fields with an arbitrary parameter $\xi$ in the GR framework.</description>

      <title>Modified gravity in the presence of matter creation: scenario for the late Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a dynamic scenario for characterizing the late Universe evolution, aiming to mitigate the Hubble tension. Specifically, we consider a metric $f(R)$ gravity in the Jordan frame which is implemented to the dynamics of a flat isotropic Universe. This cosmological model incorporates a matter creation process, due to the time variation of the cosmological gravitational field. We model particle creation by representing the isotropic Universe (specifically, a given fiducial volume) as an open thermodynamic system. The resulting dynamical model involves four unknowns: the Hubble parameter, the non-minimally coupled scalar field, its potential, and the energy density of the matter component. We impose suitable conditions to derive a closed system for these functions of the redshift. In this model, the vacuum energy density of the present Universe is determined by the scalar field potential, in line with the modified gravity scenario. Hence, we construct a viable model, determining the form of the $f(R)$ theory a posteriori and appropriately constraining the phenomenological parameters of the matter creation process to eliminate tachyon modes. Finally, by analyzing the allowed parameter space, we demonstrate that the Planck evolution of the Hubble parameter can be reconciled with the late Universe dynamics, thus alleviating the Hubble tension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum cosmology aims at elucidating the beginning of our Universe. Back in early 80's, Vilenkin and Hartle-Hawking put forward the "tunneling from nothing" and "no boundary" proposals. Recently there has been renewed interest in this subject from the viewpoint of defining the oscillating path integral for Lorentzian quantum gravity using the Picard-Lefschetz theory. Aiming at going beyond the mini-superspace and saddle-point approximations, we perform Monte Carlo calculations using the generalized Lefschetz thimble method to overcome the sign problem. In particular, we confirm that either Vilenkin or Hartle-Hawking saddle point becomes relevant if one uses the Robin boundary condition depending on its parameter. We also clarify some fundamental issues in quantum cosmology, such as an issue related to the integration domain of the lapse function and an issue related to reading off the real geometry from the complex geometry obtained at the saddle point.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Starobinsky model of cosmological inflation in four spacetime dimensions is reviewed with the emphasis on impact of quantum gravity corrections. As a specific example of the quantum corrections, the Grisaru-Zanon quartic curvature terms in the gravitational effective action of closed superstrings are chosen. Those quartic curvature terms are compared to the Bel-Robinson tensor squared in a flat Friedman universe, and the upper bound on the effective string coupling constant is found by demanding unitarity (causality) and the absence of ghosts. It is found that the quantum corrections to the observables (tilts) of the cosmic microwave background radiation in the Starobinsky inflation may be of the same order of magnitude as the next-to-next-to-next classical contributions in the Starobinsky model with respect to the inverse powers of the e-folding number at the horizon crossing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigated the stability of the chameleon screening mechanism in the Brans-Dicke scalar-tensor model. We define a constraint on the Brans-Dicke parameter $\omega_{BD}^*$ identifying two stability groups, $\omega_{BD}&gt;\omega_{BD}^*$ and $0&lt;\omega_{BD}&lt;\omega_{BD}^*$. The first group achieves stability with both appropriate eigenvalues and a density profile consistent with dark energy dominance. The second exhibits eigenvalue stability but contradicts conditions for a stable universe. We explore the impact of variations in the scalar field potential and matter coupling by analyzing different parameter sets. Each unique set of parameters results in a distinct $\omega_{BD}^*$. Dynamic analysis reveals that stability is achieved when the scalar field dominates, highlighting the importance of the kinetic and potential terms while minimizing the influence of matter density. In high matter density regions, the scalar field's negligible presence aligns with standard gravitational behavior, whereas in low matter density regions, the scalar field grows exponentially, driving dark energy and cosmic acceleration.</description>

      <title>Shadow of a Renormalization Group Improved Rotating Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00226v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a study on quantum gravity effects on the shadow of a rotating black hole (BH) obtained in the setting of the asymptotically safe gravity. The rotating metric, which results from a static regular one recently presented in the literature, is generated by using the generalized Newman-Janis algorithm. The novelty of the static regular metric lies in the fact that it is the outcome of an effective Lagrangian which describes dust whose spherically symmetric collapse is non-singular as a consequence of the antiscreening character of gravity at small distances. The effective Lagrangian includes a multiplicative coupling, denoted as chi, with the Lagrangian of the collapsing fluid. The resulting exterior metric for large radii depends on a free parameter xi which captures the quantum gravity effects. The form of the coupling chi and its connection with the quantum parameter xi are determined by the running of the Newton coupling G(k) along a renormalization group trajectory that stops at the ultraviolet non-gaussian fixed point of the asymptotic safety theory for quantum gravity. Varying both the spin parameter a/M and the quantum parameter xi, we explore the quantum gravity effects on several astronomical observables used to describe the morphology of the shadow cast by rotating BHs. In order to obtain constraints on the parameter xi, we confront our results with the recent Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of the shadows of the supermassive BHs M87 and Sgr A. We find that the ranges of variation of all the studied shadow observables fall entirely within the ranges determined by the EHT collaboration. We then conclude that the current astronomical data do not rule out the renormalization group improved rotating BH.</description>

Abstract: The Cauchy problem for the massive Dirac equation is studied in the Reissner-Nordstr\"om geometry in horizon-penetrating Eddington-Finkelstein-type coordinates. We derive an integral representation for the Dirac propagator involving the solutions of the ordinary differential equations which arise in the separation of variables. Our integral representation describes the dynamics of Dirac particles outside and across the event horizon, up to the Cauchy horizon.</description>

Abstract: We compute the heat kernel coefficients that are needed for the regularization and renormalization of massive gravity. Starting from the Stueckelberg action for massive gravity, we determine the propagators of the different fields (massive tensor, vector and scalar) in a general linear covariant gauge depending on four free gauge parameters. We then compute the non-minimal heat kernel coefficients for all the components of the scalar, vector and tensor sector, and employ these coefficients to regularize the propagators of all the different fields of massive gravity. We also study the massless limit and discuss the appearance of the van Dam-Veltman-Zakharov discontinuity. In the course of the computation, we derive new identities relating the heat kernel coefficients of different field sectors, both massive and massless.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17053v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use galaxy-galaxy lensing data to test General Relativity and $f(T)$ gravity at galaxies scales. We consider an exact spherically symmetric solution of $f(T)$ theory which is obtained from an approximate quadratic correction, and thus it is expected to hold for every realistic deviation from General Relativity. Quantifying the deviation by a single parameter $Q$, and following the post-Newtonian approximation, we obtain the corresponding deviation in the gravitational potential, shear component, and effective excess surface density profile. We used five stellar mass samples and divided them into blue and red to test the model dependence on galaxy color, and we modeled the excess surface density (ESD) profiles using the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profiles. Based on the group catalog from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS DR7) we finally extract $Q=-2.138^{+0.952}_{-0.516}\times 10^{-5}\,$Mpc$^{-2}$ at $1\sigma$ confidence. This result indicates that $f(T)$ corrections on top of General Relativity are favored. Finally, we apply information criteria, such as the AIC and BIC ones, and although the dependence of $f(T)$ gravity on the off-center effect implies that its optimality needs to be carefully studied, our analysis shows that $f(T)$ gravity is more efficient in fitting the data comparing to General Relativity and $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, and thus it offers a challenge to the latter.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Curvature Perturbation and Primordial Black Hole Formation in Two-stage Inflation with a break</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02492v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a model of $R^2$-gravity with a non-minimally coupled scalar field that gives rise to two-stage inflation with a break, that is, with an intermediate stage where inflation momentarily halts. We find that the power spectrum of the primordial curvature perturbation is significantly enhanced at the break scale, which can account for the primordial black hole (PBH) formation, without affecting the CMB constraint on large scales. The behavior of the curvature perturbation is carefully analyzed and we find a few notable new features in the spectrum. In particular, we find that the $k^3$ growth of the spectrum of toward the end of the first stage of inflation. We argue that this is a universal feature common to all two-stage models where the field dominating the second stage is heavy during the first stage. By appropriately tuning the model parameters, we find that our model can realize the scenario of PBHs as the cold dark matter of the Universe. We also find that we can choose the parameters so that the spectrum of the induced gravitational waves from the enhanced curvature perturbation fits the NANOGrav-15yr data of pulsar timing array observation.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes and curvature perturbations from false vacuum islands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06506v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, much attention has been focused on the false vacuum islands that are flooded by an expanding ocean of true-vacuum bubbles slightly later than most of the other parts of the world. These delayed decay regions will accumulate locally larger vacuum energy density by staying in the false vacuum longer than those already transited into the true vacuum. A false vacuum island with thus acquired density contrast of a super-horizon size will evolve locally from radiation dominance to vacuum dominance, creating a local baby Universe that can be regarded effectively as a local closed Universe. If such density contrasts of super-horizon sizes can ever grow large enough to exceed the threshold of gravitational collapse, primordial black holes will form similar to those collapsing curvature perturbations on super-horizon scales induced by small-scale enhancements during inflation. If not, such density contrasts can still induce curvature perturbations potentially observable today. In this paper, we revisit and elaborate on the generations of primordial black holes and curvature perturbations from delayed-decayed false vacuum islands during asynchronous first-order phase transitions with fitting formulas convenient for future model-independent studies.</description>

      <title>Wormholes and Factorization in Exact Effective Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the general framework of effective theories obtained via exact path integration of a complete theory over some sector of its degrees of freedom. Theories constructed this way contain multi-integrals which couple fields arbitrarily far apart, and in certain settings even on path-disconnected components of the space. These are not just entanglement, but genuine non-local interactions that we dub quantum wormholes.
  Any state the path integral of such an effective theory prepares is shown to be a partial trace of a state of the complete theory over the integrated-out sector. The resulting reduced density operator is generally mixed due to bra-ket wormholes. An infinite family of ensembles of pure states of the complete theory giving the same effective state is identified. These allow one to equivalently interpret any effective state as being prepared by an ensemble of theories. When computing entropic quantities, bra-ket wormholes give rise to replica wormholes. This causes replica path integrals for the effective theory to not factorize even when the underlying manifold does, as expected from mixing. In contrast, effective theories obtained by derivative expansions have no quantum wormholes and prepare pure states. There exist operators in the algebra of effective theories which can distinguish mixed from pure states, implying a breakdown of non-exact effective theories for sufficiently complex observables.
  This framework unifies and provides new insights into much of the phenomena observed in quantum gravity, including the interplay between wormholes and unitarity, the breakdown of bulk effective theory, the factorization puzzle, state ensembles, theory ensembles, quantum error correction, and baby universes. Some interesting lessons are drawn accounting also for characteristic aspects of gravity concerning IR/UV mixing and Kaluza-Klein reductions.</description>

Abstract: The gravitational path integral is usually implemented with a covariant action by analogy with other gauge field theories, but the gravitational case is different in important ways. A key difference is that the integrand has an essential singularity, which occurs at zero lapse where the spacetime metric degenerates. The lapse integration contour required to impose the local time reparametrization constraints must run from $-\infty$ to $+\infty$, yet must not pass through zero. This raises the question: what is the correct integration contour, and why? We study that question by starting with the reduced phase space path integral, which involves no essential singularity. We observe that if the momenta are to be integrated before the lapse, to obtain a configuration space path integral, the lapse contour should pass below the origin in the complex lapse plane. This contour is also consistent with the requirement that quantum field fluctuation amplitudes have the usual short distance vacuum form, and with obtaining the Bekenstein-Hawking horizon entropy from a Lorentzian path integral. We close with a discussion of related issues, including potential obstacles to deriving a nonperturbative covariant gravitational path integral.</description>

      <title>Galaxy groups in the presence of Cosmological Constant: Increasing the Masses of Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14944v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The boundaries of galaxy groups and clusters are defined by the interplay between the Newtonian attractive force and the decoupling from the local expansion of the Universe. This work extends the definition of a zero radial acceleration surface (ZRAS) and the turnaround surface (TS) for a general distribution of the masses in an expanding background, governed by the cosmological constant. We apply these definitions to different galaxy groups in the local Universe, mapping these groups up to ten megaparsec distances. We discuss the dipole and the quadrupole rate for the Local Group of Galaxies and the implementations on the Hubble diagram correction and galaxy groups virialization. With these definitions, we present the surfaces showing the interplay between the local expansion vs the local Newtonian attraction for galaxy groups in the local Universe. Further, we estimate the masses of different galaxy groups and show that the Cosmological Constant requires these masses to be higher. For the groups with enough tracers close to the TS, the contribution of the Cosmological Constant makes the masses to be even higher. The results show the importance of including the local cosmic expansion in analyzing the Cosmic Flow of the local Universe.</description>

      <title>Discrete $Z_4$ symmetry in quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00718v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the discrete $Z_4$ symmetry ${\hat {\bf i}}$, which takes place in the scenario of quantum gravity where the gravitational tetrads emerge as the order parameter. Under this symmetry operation $\hat {\bf i}$, the emerging tetrads are multiplied by the imaginary unit, $\hat {\bf i}\,e^a_\mu = - i e^a_\mu$. The existence of such symmetry and the spontaneous breaking of this symmetry are also supported by the consideration of the symmetry breaking scheme in the topological superfluid $^3$He-B. The order parameter $^3$He-B is the analogue of the tetrad field, but it has complex values. The $\hat {\bf i}$-symmetry operation changes the phase of the complex order parameter by $\pi/2$, which corresponds to the $Z_4$ discrete symmetry in quantum gravity. We also considered the alternative scenario of the breaking of this $Z_4$ symmetry, in which the $\hat {\bf i}$-operation changes sign of the scalar curvature, $\hat {\bf i} \,{\cal R} = - {\cal R}$, and thus the Einstein-Hilbert action violates the $\hat {\bf i}$-symmetry. In the alternative scenario of symmetry breaking, the gravitational coupling $K=1/16\pi G$ plays the role of the order parameter, which changes sign under $\hat {\bf i}$-transformation.</description>

      <title>Hyperboloidal Method for Quasinormal Modes of Non-Relativistic Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01487v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recently reported compactified hyperboloidal method has found wide use in the numerical computation of quasinormal modes, with implications for fields as diverse as gravitational physics and optics. We extend this intrinsically relativistic method into the non-relativistic domain, demonstrating its use to calculate the quasinormal modes of the Schr\"odinger equation and solve related bound-state problems. We also describe how to further generalize this method, offering a perspective on the importance of non-relativistic quasinormal modes for the programme of black hole spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Non-extremal Island in de Sitter Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21617v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the challenges and resolutions in computing the entanglement entropy for the quantum field theory coupled to de Sitter (dS) gravity along a timelike boundary. The conventional island formula, originally designed to calculate the fine-grained entropy for a non-gravitational system coupled to anti-de Sitter (AdS) gravity, encounters difficulties in de Sitter gravitational spacetime, failing to provide a physically plausible extremal island. To overcome these problems, we introduce a doubly holographic model by embedding a dS$_2$ braneworld in an AdS$_3$ bulk spacetime. This approach facilitates the computation of entanglement entropy through holographic correlation functions, effectively circumventing the constraints of the island formula. We demonstrate that the correct recipe for calculating entanglement entropy with dS gravity involves the non-extremal island, whose boundary is instead defined at the edge of the dS gravitational region. Our findings indicate that, during the island phase, the entanglement wedge of the non-gravitational bath includes the entire dS gravitational space. Using the second variation formula, we further show that the existence of a locally minimal surface anchored on the gravitational brane is intrinsically linked to the extrinsic curvature of the brane.</description>
